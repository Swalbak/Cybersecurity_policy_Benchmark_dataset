It is possible to intentionally and unintentionally disturb or suspend the operation of the network of state information systems and electronic communications, as well as to encumber the functions of the political, economic and military decision-making mechanisms of the state, cause material damages, mis- information of society, and trigger technogenic failures. Insecurity in cyber space may impact the reliability of the use of ICT and thus prevent the development of a 1 Sustainable Development Strategy of Latvia until 2030. modern and innovative society. During politically, so- cially, or economically sensitive developments, major cyber attacks may be directed against Latvia. A secure and reliable information society and e-government is not possible in a state without a national competence in cy- ber security and cryptography. With the increasing trend of society’s range and use of services in cyber space, the number of cyber attacks and methods in which attacks are carried out is increasing re- spectively.2 To reduce and prevent the risks and threats in cyber space, a uniied and coordinated cyber security policy involving both the public and private sector is required. he Cyber Security Strategy of Latvia lays down strategic priorities in developing cyber security policy and an accompanying action plan will be introduced in the irst half of 2014. he Strategy has been developed in line with documents of in- ternational organisations, especially the EU and NATO as well as according to the measures speciied in the National Security Concept and the State Defence Concept. 2 Symantec Internet Security hreat Report 2013 about the increase of attacks and vulnerability in the world. 1. INTRODUCTION PDF Compressor Pro 3 he aim of the cyber security policy is a secure and reliable cyber space, which ensures a safe, reliable, and continuous supply of services essential for the state and society. In implementing the cyber security policy, the following principles are being used — development, cooperation, responsibility, and openness. Development – it is possible to protect against rapidly growing threats in cyber space only by constantly and systematically developing and improving skills in the ICT sector and its security specialisation. Cooperation – the efective protection against threats in cyber space unrestricted by geographical boundaries of countries or administrative boundaries of institutions is only possible through cooperation at both the national and international level. Responsibility – it is possible to efectively reduce risks in cyber space only if all parties involved in cyber space, including individuals, state institutions, and private busi- nesses are informed about and aware of the efects of their activity or inactivity on their own security and the secu- rity of others. Openness – the cyber security policy is to be imple- mented by facilitating the accessibility of information and communication technology while respecting the rights and fundamental freedoms of an individual, searching for a balance between freedom, privacy, and security, as well as promoting good practices, ethics, and standards in cyber space. 2. AIMS AND BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE POLICY PDF Compressor Pro 4 Modern society uses ICT more extensively by both direct- ly acquiring information and processing it and creating new and widely accessible tools for self-expression. Con- venient and diverse mutual communication tools and platforms are being used to receive services. A total of 75.8 % of the inhabitants of Latvia have used the Internet, while 70.3 % use the Internet at least once a week1. he number of electronic transactions in the biggest banks in Latvia exceeds 90 % of the total number of transactions,2 and more than 25 % of state institution services are avail- able electronically3. Extensive use of ICT has changed the daily routine of society, and a virtual environment where physical and dig- ital actions merge has been created. he idea that ICT is a matter of interest of just a small group of professionals has been gradually substituted by the understanding that the entire society is, to a greater or lesser extent, linked with ICT, and the range of services provided and supported by ICT will increase in the following years. Since ICT is widely used, all members of society — from ICT users to man- agers, decision makers and legislators — should have an understanding about the basic principles of the processes and security of cyber space. ICT solutions and services have a complicated structure, but they are widely accessible. It is easy to use cyber space to 1 Central Statistical Bureau.

Furthermore, the use of ICT tools can re- strict the rights and fundamental freedoms of an individual or violate the right to privacy and personal data protection. he situation in Latvian cyber space is characterised by a considerable number of ICT security incidents, from several incidents of high signiicance to hundreds of in- cidents of low signiicance afecting state and municipal institutions, private businesses and individuals. According to an overview by CERT.LV, 4964 high priority incidents and over 200 thousand low priority incidents have been registered in 2013.4 he trend of politically, socially or economically sensitive developments being accompanied by intentionally organised cyber attacks in is increasing. Latvia may be subject to an increased risk during its 2015 Presidency of the Council of the EU. In order to reduce the number of cases when with the help of ICT damage to society is caused, it is important to de- velop a set of comprehensive measures that would protect cyber space and its services. he strategy sets ive priority areas of action: 1. Governance and Resources of Cyber Security. 2. Rule of Law in cyber space and reduction of Cyber Crime. 3. Crisis management. 4. Awareness raising, education and research. 5. International cooperation. 4 CERT.LV Overview 2013. 3. OVERVIEW OF CYBER SECURITY IN LATVIA PDF Compressor Pro 5 4.1. GOVERNANCE AND RESOURCES OF CYBER SECURITY ICT solutions and services are developed, improved and maintained in both the public and the private sector. For the solutions and services to be reliable, safe and continu- ous, it is necessary to apply information security require- ments, standards, and good practices throughout their entire life cycle by including risk analysis based security planning, and assessing political, economic, social, legal, and personal data protection aspects. Cyber security policy implementation in Latvia involves a broad, comprehensive range of interested parties; therefore it is necessary to create an efective cyber security governance model. National Cyber Security National cyber security should be viewed in three di- mensions — infrastructure, services, and processes — where the provision of information safety is required. At the moment, cyber security governance is organised in a partially centralised model, where the leading insti- tutions (according to the respective authority) perform the function of handling the strategy, methodology and coordination of cyber security, whereas supervisors of speciic ICT solutions and services constantly ensure practical implementation and execution of the estab- lished requirements. National cyber security is based on mutual cooperation, where each state authority performs its functions, including in cyber space, and cooperates with other involved parties directly or through the Na- tional Information Technology Security Council (here- inater — Council). he Council has been established by the Law on the Security of Information Technolo- gy, which determines the development of cyber security policy at a national level. According to the Law the Council coordinates the development of cyber security policy and planning and implementation of objectives and measures. he Council is the central national au- thority for the exchange of information and cooperation between the public and private sector, and its operation is ensured by the National Cyber Security Policy Coordi- nation Section of the Ministry of Defence. National cyber security policy is developed by (Visualisation in Appendix No. 1): 1. Ministry of Defence (MOD) – coordinates develop- ment and implementation of information technology security and protection policy, as well as cooperates in the provision of international cooperation. he Na- tional Cyber Security Policy Coordination Section of the MOD organises and provides support for the im- plementation of cyber security policy. 2. Ministry of Foreign Afairs (MFA) – coordinates inter- national cooperation and Latvia’s participation in vari- ous international initiatives related to the cyber security. 3. Financial and Capital Market Commission (FCMC) – regulates and supervises activities in cyber space of members of the inancial and capital market cyber space; the Bank of Latvia (BoL) promotes secure and smooth operation of payment systems, while credit institutions are responsible for secure availability of electronic services in their sector. 4. Ministry of Economics (MoE) – develops economic policy and promotes the development of competitive- ness and innovation. 5. Ministry of the Interior (MoI), State Police (SP) and Security Police (SeP) – implement the policies for com- bating crime, public order, security protection, and the 4. KEY AREAS OF ACTION PDF Compressor Pro 6 protection of rights and legal interests of individuals, as well as coordinates the settlement of crisis situations. 6. Information Technology Security Incident Re- sponse Institution CERT.LV – monitors and analy- ses developments in cyber space, reacts to incidents and coordinates their prevention, carries out re- search, organises educational events and training, as well as supervises the implementation of obligations speciied in the Law on the Security of Information Technology. CERT.LV provides support for Latvian and foreign state and municipal institutions, entre- preneurs, and individuals. 7. Ministry of Education and Science (MoES) – pro- motes knowledge and understanding of cyber space and its secure use. 8. Ministry of Welfare (MoW) – implements the so- cial policy and the policy for the protection of chil- dren’s rights. 9. Operation of the Safer Internet Centre of Latvia Net- Safe Latvia is ensured by the Latvian Internet Associ- ation, educates society about possible risks and threats online, and promotes the use of secure internet content. 10. National Armed Forces (NAF) and Cyber Defence Unit (CDU) – provide support in crisis situations. 11. Non-governmental organisations in the IT sector – provide support, consult and cooperate with the Council in developing and implementing the cyber security policy1. 12. Ministry of Transport (MoT) – organises the imple- mentation of communication policy. 1 Existing partners of the Council: association “ISACA Latvia Chap- ter”, Latvian Open Technology Association, Latvian Information and Communication Technology Association, Latvian Internet Association, Association of Commercial Banks of Latvia, Latvian Chamber of Com- merce and Industry. 13. Constitution Protection Bureau (CPB) – oversees the critical infrastructure. 14. Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and Data State Inspec- torate (DSI) – develop, organise and coordinate the policy on rights in the ield of personal data pro- tection, freedom of information and supervision of electronic documents. 15. State Joint Stock Company “Latvian State Radio and Television Centre” (LSRTC) – the only provider of reliable certiication services, which ensures the infrastructure of electronic identity cards and elec- tronic signatures. 16. Ministry of Environmental Protection and Region- al Development (MEPRD) – organises the gover- nance of state ICT and coordinates the electrisation of public services, whereas State Regional Devel- opment Agency (SRDA) ensures the operation and development of solutions for shared use of state ICT. he Law on the Security of Information Technology and related Cabinet regulations determine basic security requirements for state and municipal institutions and providers of public electronic communications services, as well as supervisors of the critical infrastructure of ICT. In cases of incidents, a set of deinite procedures for state and municipal institutions and owners and legal managers of the critical infrastructure are established. In the private sector, the governance of information securi- ty is based on the sustainability of business and secure and reliable provision of services. In some sectors, there are laws and regulations which, for example, apply to credit institu- tions, providers of electronic services, or personal data pro- tection; but good practices and standards for the security of ICT solutions are not widely used. he market of electronic communication operators is scattered, and a part of service PDF Compressor Pro 7 providers do not fulil the requirements speciied in the leg- islation, thus causing security risks to both clients and other users of ICT infrastructure in Latvia and abroad. According to the Law on the Security of Information Technology, a national Information Technology Security Incident Response Institution CERT.LV has been created. CERT.LV maintains common monitoring of cyber space, provides support for Latvian and foreign state and mu- nicipal institutions, entrepreneurs and individuals in preventing IT security incidents as well as coordinates the prevention of security incidents. As activity in cyber space increases, CERT.LV together with institutions from the public and private sectors must develop resources which would allow the summarization of technical infor- mation about incidents in cyber space and storage of this information for analysis and evaluation. Required actions: 1. Improve coordinated development, implementation and evaluation of the national cyber security policy within the framework of the National IT Security Council through cooperation of representatives of pub- lic, non-governmental and private sectors. Strengthen the leading position of the Ministry of Defence in a coordinated development and implementation of the cyber security policy. 2. Create an information exchange medium (platform) by promoting the exchange of information among en- trepreneurs about topical cyber security threats, prob- lems, solutions, good practices, and their application. 3. Implement the assessment of risks to national cyber security. 4. Promote the standards and practices of good security management in the public and private sector by creat- ing understanding about ICT security in the business environment and organising regular training for lead- ing employers. 5. Improve the mechanism of implementation and monitoring of security requirements for electronic communication operators. 6. Improve the ability of CERT.LV to observe, analyse and prevent IT security incidents and cooperate with NATO and EU partners on information exchange. 7. Develop CERT.LV resources and competences to per- form centralised security tests. State owned ICT Cyber security at a national level is closely connected to the state ICT governance system, which is now partially regulated by the Law on State Information Systems. Its fur- ther development has been outlined in the concept of the organisational model of state ICT management. he con- cept sets many tasks for the optimisation of state ICT and the improvement of management processes of state ICT. Fulilment of necessary tasks would allow reaching a ho- mogenous, more shared and professionally and rationally maintained state ICT infrastructure, which would attract better motivated human resources with a higher degree of specialisation and higher professional competences, thus increasing the overall level of state ICT security. he op- timisation of state ICT would, inter alia, allow focusing of resources for the improvement of the technological security of state ICT solutions, for example, by creating shared solu- tions for the continuity of operations, etc. With respect to the management of state ICT, the concept provides for the development and implementation of standards and guide- lines for the continuity, reliability and security of electronic state administrative processes. Currently used state ICT solutions and especially state infor- mation systems (SIS) contain information, illegal exposure PDF Compressor Pro 8 or acquisition, distortion or deletion of which can cause signiicant damage to a speciic person, society, or state. Denying access to SIS or interrupting the operation of sup- port systems can completely or partially paralyse the work of the public administration. herefore it is important that the development, introduction and operation of state ICT solutions, including security management, is carried out in a rational, efective, transparent and mutually harmonised manner by using best practices of the sector and guidelines to minimise to the occurrence of ICT security threats due to mistakes as well as deliberate actions. he Law on State Information Systems provides for a single level of technical and organisational requirements for all registered systems irrespective of their functionality, value of the collected information, and inluence on the execu- tion of functions of the public administration, both within the institution and outside of it. he lack of diferentiation of requirements causes inadequate pressure on systems of varying signiicance and capacity, as well as the willingness to avoid system registration. Diferentiation of the require- ments and categorisation of the systems would allow the application of more precise and - appropriate legal mea- sures in case of a criminal ofence. he case study by MoEPRD suggests that one half of the holders of state information systems do not ensure mea- sures for security management, as they are not motivated or competent. he state ICT security monitoring and control system is insuicient. Required actions: 1. Continue the implementation of improved manage- ment measures speciied in the conceptual organisa- tional model of state ICT management, which provides for the development of a uniied ICT architecture and development or improvement of management process- es, standards and guidelines. 2. Develop a legal order for a uniied management of the provision of state ICT that provides for a categorisa- tion of systems based on a risk analysis and appropri- ately diferentiated requirement framework for secu- rity management. 3. Improve the understanding and knowledge of the holders of ICT solutions and infrastructure by organ- ising training programmes for the managing staf of the state administration and the staf involved in ICT security management. 4. Evaluate the eiciency of the supervision of ICT secu- rity management, the responsibility and penalties for not implementing the security management measures, as well as to establish minimum requirements for the work of security managers. 5. Organise extraordinary audits and security tests of state ICT solutions and infrastructure performed by independent organisations. 6. Develop the procedure according to which the institu- tions report to a common competent authority about the implementation of information security measures. 7. Improve the cooperation between the Latvian Associ- ation of Local and Regional Governments, Municipal- ities and Institutions in order to improve the security management of municipal ICT resources. Critical Infrastructure Critical infrastructure of information technology has been established for the performance of basic functions essen- tial for state and society to ensure the integrity, accessibi- lity and conidentiality of the critical infrastructure. Once a year the Cabinet of Ministers establishes and reviews the information technology infrastructure whose termination PDF Compressor Pro 9 can substantially threaten the existence of the state.1 he critical infrastructure of information technology has been included in the critical infrastructure of the state, and its owners and legal managers, in cooperation with security institutions and CERT.LV, consistently improve security measures. Planning and implementation of security mea- sures for critical infrastructure is regulated by the Cabinet of Ministers.2 For the purposes of exchange of knowledge and experience, as well as for the improvement of proce- dures, representatives of critical infrastructures are regular- ly involved in training organised by CERT.LV. Required actions: 1. Improve the processing of information and experi- ence exchange about incidents, protection of the crit- ical infrastructure and prevention of risks among the holders of critical infrastructures, CERT.LV and state security institutions. 2. Organise crisis training and security breach tests at a national, regional and international level and in coop- eration with the Cyber Defence Unit of the National Armed Forces (NAF). 3. Strengthen the security of state ICT resources by developing technical tools for the automatic provi- sion and control of security, as well as to improve the capacity, knowledge and mutual cooperation of the security staff. 1 Cabinet Regulation No. 496 of 1 April 2010 “Planning and Implemen- tation Procedure of Identiication and Security Measures for the Critical Infrastructure, including the Critical Infrastructure of Europe.” 2 Cabinet Regulation No. 100 of 1 February 2011 “Planning and Im- plementation Procedure of the Security Measures for the Critical Infrastructure of Information Technology” Human Resources he situation in state and municipal institutions is char- acterised by signiicant diferences in human and mate- rial resources, from institutions with well-paid and high- ly qualiied employees and modern technical resources to — in most cases —institutions with employees with inadequate qualiication and low quality information technology. his creates an unequal level of fulilment of obligations laid down by the legislation in the area of information security management in the state adminis- tration. Furthermore, the restricted availability of highly qualiied experts in the labour market does not meet the demand of the private sector and companies are using outsourcing services to carry out their functions. he number of ICT security management experts and se- curity technology experts in the Latvian labour market is small. he professional standard for ICT security manag- ers and a certiication procedure for this speciality have not been established, and study programmes in comput- ing, computer science and information technology do not purposefully train experts for this specialisation. here are minimum competency requirements established for the ICT security managers in state administration in- stitutions. IT specialists from state and municipal insti- tutions participate in “Be secure” training seminars and annual brieings in the institutions; however, the acquired amount of knowledge is restricted and its use in practical situations is not being practised and tested. Required actions: 1. Assess and raise existing professional standards related to the ICT by including the requirements for the knowl- edge about and skills for cyber security. 2. Deine, increase and assess the professional competen- cies of experts responsible for cyber security and promote PDF Compressor Pro 10 the use of expert certiications acquired abroad for the conirmation of such competencies. 3. Promote the contribution of higher education institu- tions by including cyber security specialisation in study programmes. 4. Perform a labour market analysis about the demand, supply, remuneration of cyber security experts and the employment level of experts prepared by educational institutions. 5. Improve the competencies of the teaching staf in the area of cyber security and to support the preparation of methodological materials. 4.2. RULE OF LAW IN CYBER SPACE AND REDUCTION OF CYBER CRIME Rule of Law in cyber space is based on the principle of equivalency, which provides for the observation of laws and regulations both in the physical and the virtual en- vironment. he state is obliged to ensure the basic rights and freedoms of any person laid down by the Constitu- tion and the observation of principles of universal rights irrespective of their ield of application. he provided technological opportunities have favoured the increase of criminal ofences in cyber space. To commit such of- fences, criminals use automatic data processing systems as a tool for committing crimes that direct them towards another protected or publicly inaccessible automatic data processing system or its resources. An automatic data processing system can also be used as a medium for the circulation of illegal or ofensive and defamatory (incitement to racial hatred, distribution of child por- nography, etc.) information. he reduction of cybercrime requires action in two basic directions — preventive work for the reduction of criminal ofences and efective combating of crime. he complicated structure and operation of cyber space out- line two problematic areas in the implementation of efective combating of cybercrime. Firstly, the understanding of the concept “signiicant damage” and its application is an im- portant precondition for establishing constituent elements of a criminal ofence and appropriate qualiication and punish- ment of a criminal ofence. Secondly, investigation and collec- tion of evidence in cyber space requires speciic knowledge. Implementation of preventive actions requires organised ICT and a legislative base regulating its security, as well as efective use thereof. he existing capacity in combating cybercrime should be developed by strengthening elec- tronic evidence. Investigation, as well as collection and assessment of evidence requires special knowledge and a suicient level of competence is crucial in law enforce- ment agencies, prosecutor’s oices and courts to ensure the rule of law in cyber space. Required actions: 1. Assess the laws and regulations in the ICT sector as a foundation for applying the Latvian Administrative Violations Code and Criminal Law and to improve this foundation to ensure efective protection of individu- als’ interests through and in relation to criminal law. 2. Assess the present situation and the necessary amend- ments in legislation that provide for punishment for causing damage to the security or operation of infor- mation systems directed towards automatic data pro- cessing systems. 3. Develop the terminology related to the information security and cyber security in the Latvian language and harmonise its use in the legislative enactments. PDF Compressor Pro 11 4. Assess and improve the supervision of obligations in the area of cyber security laid down by the legislative enactments and to promote support for the fulfil- ment thereof. 5. Facilitate discussions and exchange of opinions about the identiication of new ICT crimes and improvement of the legal basis for the restriction thereof in line with the international trends. 6. Combat and investigate cybercrimes by assessing and improving the existing resources, procedures, coopera- tion mechanisms, and their eiciency. 7. Assess and develop the existing capacity of acquiring and analysing evidence in the process of investigation of cybercrimes by developing the competence of SP and improving the cooperation with CERT.LV. 8. Develop methodical materials for studies about the ICT sector for the purposes of increasing the knowledge of police oicers, persons directing the proceedings and judges about the ICT sector and to implement an in- depth training programme about the issues of combat- ing cybercrime. 9. Develop a uniied mechanism for listing the criminal ofences in cyber space (statistics) in the system of police, prosecution and court. 4.3. PREPAREDNESS AND CAPACITY TO ACT IN CRISIS SITUATIONS Institutions which ensure national cyber security capabili- ties have been set up in Latvia. Plans for action in the case of increased threat have been developed and are being regu- larly updated. Cooperation with the Ministry of the Interior for solving diferent crisis situations has been established. he involvement of experts is available in collaboration with the private sector. However, the present resources and measures are not suicient and organised enough to ensure eicient and prompt action in the case of serious and exten- sive ICT security incidents or cyber attacks. he present situation in Latvia and threats in cyber space, as well as resources for the prevention of risks and man- agement of a crisis that are at the disposal of the state have been assessed in the cyber crisis exercise by the Cabinet of Ministers on 7 December 2012. Reduction of incidents and the prevention of a crisis require individual under- standing about cyber security and the responsibility of each organisation, where CERT.LV can give advice on daily work or provide support in cases of serious and unexpected incidents. Considering the limited resources of the state administra- tion and the conclusions of the cyber crisis exercise, the NAF are developing a Cyber Defence Unit to provide sup- port for CERT.LV and NAF units in preventing ICT secu- rity incidents and management of consequences in crisis situations in cyber space or in war time. he Unit would be used should CERT.LV resources be insuicient and involve- ment of the Unit would faster expedite the implementation of emergency measures or if the Unit had at its disposal special resources for performing such activities.1 he Unit is being created as a back-up team of experts consisting of volunteers from the public and private sector accord- ing to the legal basis of the service of the National Guard. To ensure the functioning and strengthening of the infra- structure of electronic communication the existing infra- structural capabilities should be developed (especially with respect to resistance to the inluence of external conditions), 1 Concept of the National Armed Forces Cyber Defence Unit of the Mi- nistry of Defence, Rīga, 2013. PDF Compressor Pro 12 as well as a new infrastructure for securing the basic func- tions of a state, especially when the daily use of electronic communication networks can be restricted. Required actions: 1. Evaluate the definition of a crisis, its procedures, leg- islation and the use thereof in the case of a possible cyber crisis. 2. Develop the capabilities of the NAF and the Cyber Defence Unit to react in a crisis situation and in man- aging the consequences of major incidents by providing and ensuring operational capability of the Unit. 3. Develop information technology and communication systems for the NAF to ensure the support of NAF management capabilities in crisis situations. 4. Organise regular theoretical and practical training at a national level with the involvement of high oicials and merchants in order to develop mutual understanding and coordinate the management of crisis situations. 5. Improve the competence and resources of state insti- tutions when preparing and ensuring the presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2015 when global cyber attacks may be directed against Latvia. 6. Develop regional and international cooperation, to ensure regular training for providing and receiving support in a crisis situation. 7. Establish an electronic communication network for emergency situations. 8. Develop a technological and organisational solution that provides state institutions with infrastructure and ensures high conidentiality and integrity of and acces- sibility to state information systems. 9. Strengthen the outer scope of the national external communication network: establish, categorise, coordi- nate, evaluate risks, and make necessary improvements to ensure a reliable and secure low of data between Latvia and other countries, but, when necessary, to use the network for changes in data lows or the restriction thereof between countries. 4.4. AWARENESS RAISING, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH An informed society is a crucial part of a secure and re- liable cyber space. Awareness is ensured by purposeful and regular explanatory work, including the policy and communication implemented by the leading oicials of a country, raising the issues in educational institutions and organising regular discussions of experts in the media. he level of awareness of a society about the threats to ICT, tools available for their prevention, personal rights in the electronic medium and their infringement, as well as about action in the case of a threat is low. According to the statistics of CERT.LV, in almost all cases when the devices of users have been infected and have become a part of bot- nets (approximately 15–20 thousand a month), the users have not deliberately caused damage and the cause of the infection is sotware that has not been updated or the lack of antivirus solutions when malicious e-mail attachments are opened. Along with raising awareness of society, it is important to increase understanding about ethical norms and moral responsibilities in the electronic environment. To improve the knowledge of ICT users, it is necessary to implement a set of complex measures, starting from primary and secondary education. It is necessary to organise reg- ular information campaigns in cooperation with non-gov- ernmental and private institutions, as well as constantly relect the information in mass media. At the moment, cyber security issues are only tested in a uniform model in general education in an informatics examination (knowl- PDF Compressor Pro 13 edge test part) at the secondary education level. Although the average level of answered questions is comparatively high (2013 — 0.79%), it is impossible to assess the actual actions of students in daily life. he type of communica- tion (channel), content and methodology is to be applied according to the chosen target audience (see Figure 1). At the moment, there are no academic study pro- grammes and scientific activity in the area of cyber security and people studying the respective subjects abroad are not motivated to return to Latvia due to low salaries, lack of opportunities for professional devel- opment. According to a study by the World Economic Forum, Latvia ranks 110th with regard to the availabil- ity of scientists and engineers.1 1 World Economic Forum “The Global Competitiveness Report 2012–2013”, p. 227. To develop new study programmes and educate experts and professionals from other sectors (e.g., experts in law) about ICT issues, a teaching staf with an appropriate competen- cy is required. Competency should be increased by creating and supporting security research groups at universities and scientiic institutes. hese would, irstly, attract Latvian spe - cialists who are currently working abroad, serve as a basis for the creation of a national cyber security (including cryp- tography) school, provide the opportunity in the future to successfully participate in scientiic EU projects and, inal- ly, to create commercial products with a high added value. Required actions: 1. Increase the competency of educational institutions and teaching staf and their contribution to educating children and youth about the issues of ICT security by integrating these issues into the educational system and Figure 1. he level of cyber space security knowledge according to the target audience.

Additionally, opportuni- ties must be ensured for children and youths to report violations on the Internet and to receive support from a psychologist. Further education of the teaching staf about the issues of cyber security must be organized. 2. Develop educational and informative materials about cyber security for use in educational institutions and interest groups that are easily accessible and diferenti- ated according to various age groups. 3. Develop academic studies and research in cyber se- curity to train experts, promote innovation, establish public-private partnerships for the support of science and research, and to attract European funds, grants and inancial instruments. 4. Create an ICT security laboratory and to organise sci- entiic conferences about topical issues concerning cyber security and cybercrime in cooperation with universities and scientiic institutes. 5. Implement educational and informative campaigns and other measures for the overall enhancement of the understanding of society about the cyber security, cy- bercrime and important threats, to expand the accessi- bility of various ICT security sotware. 6. Develop the exchange of information and opinions among public administration, associations of the sec- tor, experts, business leaders, as well as creators of public opinion — non-governmental organisations and the academic environment. 7. Participate in international informative initiatives and platforms, use the European Cyber Security Month and the e-Skills Week to raise issues about the cyber security. 8. Promote innovation in the cyber security sector and develop a uniied academic resource of high-capacity computing (supercomputer). 4.5. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION he opportunities and security threats provided by cyber space do not recognize national borders and therefore no state can efectively face new security challenges on its own. Due to the awareness of the increasing role of cyber space in every society, cyber security as an important issue has been included on the agenda of cross border cooperation and by international organisations. In bilateral and multi- lateral cooperation, a wide range of issues are usually con- sidered — from observation of human rights in the virtual environment to combating of crime, oten also involving the private sector. Under these conditions, diferent na- tional interests inevitably collide, and thus far the inter- national community has not reached signiicant progress in creating a common understanding and approach. At the same time, many non-harmonised processes still take place. It is important for Latvia to have knowledge of the work of international and regional organisations and to participate in this work while at the same time expressing support for ensuring the basic principles of a democratic society in the virtual environment. It should be not only be safe, but also free and accessible. Latvia is taking part in international processes, including the work of NATO, the EU, OSCE and UN, to promote the improvement of a secure, free and accessible cyber space. Latvia supports the irst comprehensive resolution of the United Nations Human Rights Council on human rights in the virtual space and will continue to partici- pate and strengthen such initiatives as the Freedom Online Coalition, which focuses on observing human rights and basic freedoms in cyber space, especially the freedom of speech. PDF Compressor Pro 15 Latvia has joined the Council of Europe Convention on Cyber Crime and its Additional Protocol concerning the criminalisation of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems. According to the Convention, all involved countries harmonise their legal regulations to cooperate in the investigation of crimes and to ensure that the people responsible for committing cybercrimes are held liable. Cyber security is an important part of national defence, and nationally developed defence capabilities can be strengthened by cooperating with NATO and EU mem- ber states in a crisis situation. To receive efective support when necessary and to strengthen cyber security mea- sures in the Euro-Atlantic space, the development of both collective and individual cyber protection capabilities of each member state should be facilitated in accordance with the approved NATO and EU cyber security planning documents. NATO has approved the Cyber Defence Con- cept and Action Plan and corresponding planning docu- ments, which provide for the necessity to promote the de- velopment of cyber security capabilities of both NATO as a whole and each individual member state. Required actions: 1. Strengthen cooperation with countries from the Bal- tic and Northern European countries and improve the cooperation with NATO, the EU, OSCE and UN to improve the security, accessibility and freedom of ICT. 2. Support international eforts in enhancing mutual trust and cooperation, emphasising the equal applicability of international legal norms to both the physical and the virtual environment. 3. Create a common Baltic university study programme to combine regional educational resources to preparing strong and qualiied experts. 4. Organise international cyber security events in Latvia on a regular basis, highlighting Latvia as a country that takes care of the security of ICT at a national and inter- national level. 5. Develop and test national procedures to receive prompt and efective help in case of a cyber threat according to the Memorandum of Understanding between Latvia and NATO and pursuant to the NATO Cyber Defence Concept and Action Plan. 6. Strengthen cyber protection capabilities by participat- ing in various international training courses, exercises and cyber attack simulations within NATO, the EU, and other international organizations and forums, giving local experts and the Cyber Defence Unit the opportunity to improve their knowledge about the latest solutions in information systems security.

It is possible to intentionally and  unintentionally disturb or suspend the operation of the  network of state information systems and electronic  communications, as well as to encumber the functions  of the political, economic and military decision-making  mechanisms of the state, cause material damages, mis- information of society, and trigger technogenic failures.  Insecurity in  cyber space may impact the reliability of  the use of ICT and thus prevent the development of a                   1 Sustainable Development Strategy of Latvia until 2030.  modern and innovative society. During politically, so- cially, or economically sensitive developments, major  cyber attacks may be directed against Latvia. A secure  and reliable information society and e-government is not  possible in a state without a national competence in cy- ber security and cryptography.  With the increasing trend of society’s range and use of  services in  cyber space, the number of cyber attacks and  methods in which attacks are carried out is increasing re- spectively.2   To reduce and prevent the risks and threats in  cyber space,  a uniied and coordinated cyber security policy involving  both the public and private sector is required. he Cyber  Security Strategy of Latvia lays down strategic priorities  in developing cyber security policy and an accompanying  action plan will be introduced in the irst half of 2014. he  Strategy  has been developed in line with documents of in- ternational organisations, especially the EU and NATO  as  well as according to the measures speciied in the National  Security Concept and the State Defence Concept.  2 Symantec Internet Security hreat Report 2013 about the increase of   attacks and vulnerability in the world.  1. INTRODUCTION  PDF Compressor Pro  http://www.pdfcompressor.org/buy.html   3  he aim of the cyber security policy is a secure and reliable  cyber space, which ensures a safe, reliable, and continuous  supply of services essential for the state and society.  In implementing the cyber security policy, the following  principles are being used — development, cooperation,   responsibility, and openness.  Development – it is possible to protect against rapidly  growing threats in  cyber space only by constantly and  systematically developing and improving skills in the  ICT sector and its security specialisation.  Cooperation – the efective protection against threats in  cyber space unrestricted by geographical boundaries of  countries or administrative boundaries of institutions is   only possible through cooperation at both the national  and international level.  Responsibility – it is possible to efectively reduce risks  in cyber space only if all parties involved in cyber space,  including individuals, state institutions, and private busi- nesses are informed about and aware of the efects of their  activity or inactivity on their own security and the secu- rity of others.  Openness – the cyber security policy is to be imple- mented by facilitating the accessibility of information  and communication technology while respecting the  rights and fundamental freedoms of an individual,  searching for a balance between freedom, privacy, and  security, as well as promoting good practices, ethics,  and standards in cyber space.  2. AIMS AND BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE POLICY  PDF Compressor Pro  http://www.pdfcompressor.org/buy.html   4  Modern society uses ICT more extensively by both direct- ly acquiring information and processing it and creating   new and widely accessible tools for self-expression. Con- venient and diverse mutual communication tools and  platforms are being used to receive services. A total of  75.8 % of the inhabitants of Latvia have used the Internet,  while 70.3 % use the Internet at least once a week1. he  number of electronic transactions in the biggest banks in  Latvia exceeds 90 % of the total number of transactions,2  and more than 25 % of state institution services are avail- able electronically3.  Extensive use of ICT has changed the daily routine of   society, and a virtual environment where physical and dig- ital actions merge has been created. he idea that ICT is a  matter of interest of just a small group of professionals has  been gradually substituted by the understanding that the  entire society is, to a greater or lesser extent, linked with  ICT, and the range of services provided and supported by  ICT will increase in the following years. Since ICT is widely  used, all members of  society — from ICT users to man- agers, decision makers and legislators — should have an  understanding about the basic principles of the processes  and security of cyber space.  ICT solutions and services have a complicated structure,  but they are widely accessible. It is easy to use cyber space to   1 Central Statistical Bureau.

Furthermore, the use of ICT tools can re- strict the rights and fundamental freedoms of an individual  or violate the right to privacy and personal data protection.   he situation in Latvian cyber space is characterised by  a considerable number of ICT security incidents, from  several incidents of high signiicance to hundreds of in- cidents of low signiicance afecting state and municipal  institutions, private businesses and individuals. According  to an overview by CERT.LV, 4964 high priority incidents  and over 200 thousand low priority incidents have been  registered in 2013.4 he trend of politically, socially or  economically sensitive developments being accompanied  by intentionally organised cyber attacks in  is increasing.  Latvia may be subject to an increased risk during its 2015  Presidency of the Council of the EU.  In order to reduce the number of cases when with the help  of ICT damage to  society is caused, it is important to de- velop a set of comprehensive measures that would protect  cyber space and its services. he strategy sets ive priority   areas of action:  1.

GOVERNANCE AND RESOURCES OF CYBER  SECURITY    ICT solutions and services are developed, improved and  maintained in both the public and the private sector. For  the solutions and services to be reliable, safe and continu- ous, it is necessary to apply information security require- ments, standards, and good practices throughout their  entire life cycle by including risk analysis based security  planning, and assessing political, economic, social, legal,  and personal data protection  aspects. Cyber security policy  implementation in Latvia involves a broad, comprehensive  range of interested parties; therefore it is necessary to create  an efective cyber security governance model.  National Cyber Security National cyber security should be viewed in three di- mensions — infrastructure, services, and processes —  where the provision of information safety is required.  At the moment, cyber security governance is organised  in a partially centralised model, where the leading insti- tutions (according to the respective authority) perform  the function of handling the strategy, methodology and   coordination of cyber security, whereas supervisors of  speciic ICT solutions and services constantly ensure  practical implementation and execution of the estab- lished requirements. National cyber security is based on  mutual cooperation, where each state authority performs  its functions, including in  cyber space, and cooperates  with other involved parties directly or through the Na- tional Information Technology Security Council (here- inater — Council). he Council has been established   by the Law on the Security of Information Technolo- gy, which determines the development of cyber security    policy at a national level. According to the Law the  Council coordinates the development of cyber security  policy and planning and implementation of objectives  and measures. he Council is the central national au- thority for the exchange of information and cooperation  between the public and private sector, and its operation  is ensured by the National Cyber Security Policy Coordi- nation Section of the Ministry of Defence.  National cyber security policy is developed by  (Visualisation in Appendix No. 1): 1. Ministry of Defence (MOD) – coordinates develop-  ment and implementation of information technology  security and protection policy, as well as cooperates  in the provision of international cooperation. he Na- tional Cyber Security Policy Coordination Section of  the MOD organises and provides support for the im- plementation of cyber security policy.  2.    Ministry of Foreign Afairs (MFA) – coordinates inter- national cooperation and Latvia’s participation in vari- ous international initiatives related to the cyber security.  3. Financial and Capital Market Commission (FCMC) –  regulates and supervises activities in  cyber space of  members of the inancial and capital market cyber  space; the Bank of Latvia (BoL) promotes secure and  smooth operation of payment systems, while credit  institutions are responsible for  secure availability of  electronic services in their sector.  4. Ministry of Economics (MoE) – develops economic  policy and promotes the development of competitive- ness and innovation.  5. Ministry of the Interior (MoI), State Police (SP) and  Security Police (SeP) – implement the policies for com- bating crime, public order, security protection, and the   4. KEY AREAS OF ACTION   PDF Compressor Pro  http://www.pdfcompressor.org/buy.html   6  protection of rights and legal interests of individuals, as  well as coordinates the settlement of crisis situations.  6. Information Technology Security Incident Re-  sponse Institution CERT.LV – monitors and analy- ses developments in  cyber space, reacts to incidents  and coordinates their prevention, carries out re- search, organises educational events and training, as  well as supervises the implementation of obligations  speciied in the Law on the Security of Information  Technology. CERT.LV provides support for Latvian  and foreign state and municipal institutions, entre- preneurs, and individuals.  7. Ministry of Education and Science (MoES) – pro- motes knowledge and understanding  of cyber space  and its secure use.  8. Ministry of Welfare (MoW) – implements the so- cial policy and the policy for the protection of chil- dren’s rights.  9. Operation of the Safer Internet Centre of Latvia Net-  Safe Latvia is ensured by the Latvian Internet Associ- ation, educates society about possible risks and threats  online, and promotes the use of secure internet content.  10. National Armed Forces (NAF) and Cyber Defence   Unit (CDU) – provide support in crisis situations. 11. Non-governmental organisations in the IT sector –    provide support, consult and cooperate with the  Council in developing and implementing the cyber  security policy1.  12. Ministry of Transport (MoT) – organises the imple- mentation of communication policy.  1 Existing partners of the Council: association “ISACA Latvia Chap-  ter”, Latvian Open Technology Association, Latvian Information and   Communication Technology Association, Latvian Internet Association,   Association of Commercial Banks of Latvia, Latvian Chamber of Com-  merce and Industry.  13. Constitution Protection Bureau (CPB) – oversees  the critical infrastructure.  14. Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and Data State Inspec-  torate (DSI) – develop, organise and coordinate the  policy on rights in the ield of personal data pro- tection, freedom of information and supervision of  electronic documents.  15. State Joint Stock Company “Latvian State Radio   and Television Centre” (LSRTC) – the only provider  of reliable certiication services, which ensures the  infrastructure of electronic identity cards and elec- tronic signatures.  16. Ministry of Environmental Protection and Region-  al Development (MEPRD) – organises the gover- nance of state ICT and coordinates the electrisation  of public services, whereas State Regional Devel-  opment Agency (SRDA) ensures the operation and  development of solutions for shared use of state ICT.  he Law on the Security of Information Technology and  related Cabinet regulations determine basic security  requirements for state and municipal institutions and  providers of public electronic communications services,  as well as supervisors of the critical infrastructure of ICT.  In cases of incidents, a set of deinite procedures for state  and municipal institutions and owners and legal managers  of the critical infrastructure are established.  In the private sector, the governance of information securi- ty is based on the sustainability of business and secure and  reliable provision of services. In some sectors, there are laws  and regulations which, for example, apply to credit institu- tions, providers of electronic services, or personal data pro- tection; but good practices and standards for the security of  ICT solutions are not widely used. he market of electronic  communication operators is scattered, and a part of service   PDF Compressor Pro  http://www.pdfcompressor.org/buy.html   7  providers do not fulil the requirements speciied in the leg- islation, thus causing security risks to both clients and other  users of ICT infrastructure in Latvia and abroad.  According to the Law on the Security of Information  Technology, a national Information Technology Security  Incident Response Institution CERT.LV has been created.   CERT.LV maintains common monitoring of  cyber space,  provides support for Latvian and foreign state and mu- nicipal institutions, entrepreneurs and individuals in  preventing IT security incidents as well as coordinates  the prevention of security incidents. As  activity in  cyber  space increases, CERT.LV together with institutions from  the public and private sectors must develop resources  which would allow the summarization of technical infor- mation about  incidents in  cyber space and storage of this  information for analysis and evaluation.  Required actions: 1. Improve coordinated development, implementation   and evaluation of the national cyber security policy   within the framework of the National IT Security  Council through cooperation of representatives of pub- lic, non-governmental and private sectors. Strengthen  the leading position of the Ministry of Defence in a  coordinated development and implementation of the  cyber security policy.  2. Create an information exchange medium (platform)  by promoting the exchange of information among en- trepreneurs about topical cyber security threats, prob- lems, solutions, good practices, and their application.  3. Implement the assessment of risks to national cyber  security.  4. Promote the standards and practices of good security  management in the public and private sector by creat- ing understanding about ICT security in the business   environment and organising regular training for lead- ing employers.  5. Improve the mechanism of implementation and  monitoring of security requirements for electronic  communication operators.  6. Improve the ability of CERT.LV to observe, analyse  and prevent IT security incidents and cooperate with  NATO and EU partners on information exchange.  7. Develop CERT.LV resources and competences to per- form centralised security tests.  State owned ICT Cyber security at a national level is closely connected to  the state ICT governance system, which is now partially  regulated by the Law on State Information Systems. Its fur- ther development has been outlined in the concept of the  organisational model of state ICT management. he con- cept sets many tasks for the optimisation of state ICT and  the improvement of management processes of state ICT.  Fulilment of necessary tasks would allow reaching a ho- mogenous, more shared and professionally and rationally  maintained state ICT infrastructure, which would attract  better motivated human resources with a higher degree of  specialisation and higher professional competences, thus  increasing the overall level of state ICT security. he op- timisation of state ICT would, inter alia, allow focusing of  resources for the improvement of the technological security  of state ICT solutions, for example, by creating shared solu- tions for the continuity of operations, etc. With respect to  the management of state ICT, the concept provides for the  development and implementation of standards and guide- lines for the continuity, reliability and security of electronic  state administrative processes.   Currently used state ICT solutions and especially state infor- mation systems (SIS) contain information, illegal exposure   PDF Compressor Pro  http://www.pdfcompressor.org/buy.html   8  or acquisition, distortion or deletion of which can cause  signiicant damage to a speciic person, society, or state.  Denying access to SIS or interrupting the operation of sup- port systems can completely or partially paralyse the work  of the public administration. herefore it is important that  the development, introduction and operation of state ICT  solutions, including security management, is carried out in  a rational, efective, transparent and mutually harmonised  manner by using best practices of the sector and guidelines  to minimise to the occurrence of ICT security threats due  to mistakes as well as deliberate actions.  he Law on State Information Systems provides for a single  level of technical and organisational requirements for all  registered systems irrespective of their functionality, value  of the collected information, and inluence on the execu- tion of functions of the public administration, both within  the institution and outside of it. he lack of diferentiation  of requirements causes inadequate pressure on systems of  varying signiicance and capacity, as well as the willingness  to avoid system registration. Diferentiation of the require- ments and categorisation of the systems would allow the  application of more precise and - appropriate legal mea- sures in case of a criminal ofence.   he case study by MoEPRD suggests that one half of the  holders of state information systems do not ensure mea- sures for security management, as they are not motivated  or competent. he state ICT security monitoring and  control system is insuicient.  Required actions: 1. Continue the implementation of improved manage-  ment  measures speciied in the conceptual  organisa- tional model of state ICT management, which provides  for the development of a uniied ICT architecture and   development or improvement of management process- es, standards and guidelines.  2. Develop a legal order for a uniied management of the  provision of state ICT that provides for a categorisa- tion of systems based on a risk analysis and appropri- ately diferentiated requirement framework for secu- rity management.  3. Improve the understanding and knowledge of the  holders of ICT solutions and infrastructure by organ- ising training programmes for the managing staf of  the state administration and the staf involved in ICT  security management.  4. Evaluate the eiciency of the supervision of ICT secu- rity management, the responsibility and penalties for  not implementing the security management measures,  as well as to establish minimum requirements for the  work of security managers.  5. Organise extraordinary audits and security tests of  state ICT solutions and infrastructure performed by  independent organisations.  6. Develop the procedure according to which the institu- tions report to a common competent authority about  the implementation of information security measures.  7. Improve the cooperation between the Latvian Associ- ation of Local and Regional Governments, Municipal- ities and Institutions in order to improve the security  management of municipal ICT resources.  Critical Infrastructure Critical infrastructure of information technology has been  established for the performance of basic functions essen- tial for state and society to ensure the integrity, accessibi- lity and conidentiality of the critical infrastructure. Once  a year the Cabinet of Ministers establishes and reviews the  information technology infrastructure whose termination   PDF Compressor Pro  http://www.pdfcompressor.org/buy.html   9  can substantially threaten the existence of the state.1 he  critical infrastructure of information technology has been  included in the critical infrastructure of the state, and its  owners and legal managers, in cooperation with security  institutions and CERT.LV, consistently improve security  measures. Planning and implementation of security mea- sures for critical infrastructure is regulated by the Cabinet  of Ministers.2 For the purposes of exchange of knowledge  and experience, as well as for the improvement of proce- dures, representatives of critical infrastructures are regular- ly involved in training organised by CERT.LV.  Required actions: 1. Improve the processing of information and experi-  ence exchange about incidents, protection of the crit- ical infrastructure and prevention of risks among the  holders of critical infrastructures, CERT.LV and state  security institutions.  2. Organise crisis training and security breach tests at a  national, regional and international level and in coop- eration with the Cyber Defence Unit of the National  Armed Forces (NAF).  3. Strengthen the security of state ICT resources by  developing technical tools for the automatic provi- sion and control of security, as well as to improve the  capacity, knowledge and mutual cooperation of the  security staff.  1 Cabinet Regulation No. 496 of 1 April 2010 “Planning and Implemen-  tation Procedure of Identiication and Security Measures for the Critical   Infrastructure, including the Critical Infrastructure of Europe.” 2 Cabinet Regulation No. 100 of 1 February 2011 “Planning and Im-  plementation Procedure of the Security Measures for the Critical    Infrastructure of Information Technology”  Human Resources he situation in state and municipal institutions is char- acterised by signiicant diferences in human and mate- rial resources, from institutions with well-paid and high- ly qualiied employees and modern technical resources  to — in most cases —institutions with employees with  inadequate qualiication and low quality information  technology. his creates an unequal level of fulilment  of obligations laid down by the legislation in the area of  information security management in the state adminis- tration. Furthermore, the restricted availability of highly  qualiied experts in the labour market does not meet the  demand of the private sector and companies are using  outsourcing services to carry out their functions.   he number of ICT security management experts and se- curity technology experts in the Latvian labour market is  small. he professional standard for ICT security manag- ers and a certiication procedure for this speciality have  not been established, and study programmes in comput- ing, computer science and information technology do not  purposefully train experts for this specialisation. here  are minimum competency requirements established for  the ICT security managers in state administration in- stitutions. IT specialists from state and municipal insti- tutions participate in “Be secure” training seminars and  annual brieings in the institutions; however, the acquired  amount of knowledge is restricted and its use in practical  situations is not being practised and tested.  Required actions: 1. Assess and raise existing professional standards related    to the ICT by including the requirements for the knowl- edge about and skills for cyber security.  2. Deine, increase and assess the professional competen- cies of experts responsible for cyber security and promote    PDF Compressor Pro  http://www.pdfcompressor.org/buy.html   10  the use of expert certiications acquired abroad for the  conirmation of such competencies.  3. Promote the contribution of higher education institu- tions by including cyber security specialisation in study  programmes.  4. Perform a labour market analysis about the demand,  supply, remuneration of cyber security experts and the  employment level of experts prepared by educational  institutions.   5. Improve the competencies of the teaching staf in the  area of cyber security and to support the preparation of  methodological materials.  4.2. RULE OF LAW IN CYBER SPACE AND REDUCTION  OF CYBER CRIME  Rule of Law in cyber space is based on the principle of  equivalency, which provides for the observation of laws  and regulations both in the physical and the virtual en- vironment. he state is obliged to ensure the basic rights  and freedoms of any person laid down by the Constitu- tion and the observation of principles of universal rights  irrespective of their ield of application. he provided  technological opportunities have favoured the increase  of criminal ofences in  cyber space. To commit such of- fences, criminals use automatic data processing systems  as a tool for committing crimes that direct them towards  another protected or publicly inaccessible automatic  data processing system or its resources. An automatic  data processing system can also be used as a medium  for the circulation of illegal or ofensive and defamatory   (incitement to racial hatred, distribution of child por- nography, etc.) information.   he reduction of cybercrime requires action in two basic   directions — preventive work for the reduction of criminal  ofences and efective combating of crime.   he complicated structure and operation of  cyber space out- line two problematic areas in the implementation of efective  combating of cybercrime. Firstly, the understanding of the  concept “signiicant damage” and its application is an im- portant precondition for establishing constituent elements of  a criminal ofence and appropriate qualiication and punish- ment of a criminal ofence. Secondly, investigation and collec- tion of evidence in  cyber space requires speciic knowledge.  Implementation of preventive actions requires organised  ICT and a legislative base regulating its security, as well as  efective use thereof. he existing capacity in combating  cybercrime should be developed by strengthening elec- tronic evidence. Investigation, as well as collection and  assessment of evidence requires special knowledge and  a suicient level of competence is crucial in law enforce- ment agencies, prosecutor’s oices and courts to ensure  the rule of law in cyber space.  Required actions: 1. Assess the laws and regulations in the ICT sector as   a foundation for applying the Latvian Administrative  Violations Code and Criminal Law and to improve this  foundation to ensure efective protection of individu- als’ interests through and in relation to criminal law.  2. Assess the present situation and the necessary amend- ments in legislation that provide for punishment for  causing damage to the security or operation of infor- mation systems directed towards automatic data pro- cessing systems.  3. Develop the terminology related to the information  security and cyber security in the Latvian language and  harmonise its use in the legislative enactments.  PDF Compressor Pro  http://www.pdfcompressor.org/buy.html   11  4. Assess and improve the supervision of obligations in  the area of cyber security laid down by the legislative  enactments and to promote support for the fulfil- ment thereof.  5. Facilitate discussions and exchange of opinions about  the identiication of new ICT crimes and improvement  of the legal basis for the restriction thereof in line with  the international trends.   6. Combat and investigate cybercrimes by assessing and  improving the existing resources, procedures, coopera- tion mechanisms, and their eiciency.  7. Assess and develop the existing capacity of acquiring  and analysing evidence in the process of investigation  of cybercrimes by developing the competence of SP  and improving the cooperation with CERT.LV.  8. Develop methodical materials for studies about the ICT  sector for the purposes of increasing the knowledge of  police oicers, persons directing the proceedings and  judges about the ICT sector and to implement an in- depth training programme about the issues of combat- ing cybercrime.  9. Develop a uniied mechanism for listing the criminal  ofences in  cyber space (statistics) in the system of  police, prosecution and court.  4.3. PREPAREDNESS AND CAPACITY TO ACT IN CRISIS  SITUATIONS  Institutions which ensure national cyber security capabili- ties have been set up in Latvia. Plans for action in the case  of increased threat have been developed and are being regu- larly updated. Cooperation with the Ministry of the Interior   for solving diferent crisis situations has been established.  he involvement of experts is available in collaboration  with the private sector. However, the present resources and   measures are not suicient and organised enough to ensure  eicient and prompt action in the case of serious and exten- sive ICT security incidents or cyber attacks.   he present situation in Latvia and threats in  cyber space,  as well as resources for the prevention of risks and man- agement of a crisis that are at the disposal of the state have  been assessed in the cyber crisis exercise by the Cabinet  of Ministers on 7 December 2012. Reduction of incidents  and the prevention of a crisis require individual under- standing about cyber security and the responsibility of  each organisation, where CERT.LV can give advice on  daily work or provide support in cases of serious and   unexpected incidents.  Considering the limited resources of the state administra- tion and the conclusions of the cyber crisis exercise, the  NAF are developing a Cyber Defence Unit to provide sup- port for CERT.LV and NAF units in preventing ICT secu- rity incidents and management of consequences in crisis  situations in cyber space or in war time.  he Unit would be  used should CERT.LV resources be insuicient and involve- ment of the Unit would faster expedite the implementation  of emergency measures or if the Unit had at its disposal  special resources for performing such activities.1 he Unit  is being created as a back-up team of experts consisting  of volunteers  from the public and private sector accord- ing to the legal basis of the service of the National Guard.  To ensure the functioning and strengthening of the infra- structure of electronic communication the existing infra- structural capabilities should be developed (especially with  respect to resistance to the inluence of external conditions),   1 Concept of the National Armed Forces Cyber Defence Unit of the Mi-  nistry of Defence, Rīga, 2013.  PDF Compressor Pro  http://www.pdfcompressor.org/buy.html   12  as well as a new infrastructure for securing the basic func- tions of a state, especially when the daily use of electronic  communication networks can be restricted.  Required actions: 1.  Evaluate the definition of a crisis, its procedures, leg-  islation and the use thereof in the case of a possible  cyber crisis.  2. Develop the capabilities of the NAF and the Cyber   Defence Unit to react in a crisis situation and in man- aging the consequences of major incidents by providing  and ensuring operational capability of the Unit.  3. Develop information technology and communication  systems for the NAF to ensure the support of NAF  management capabilities in crisis situations.  4. Organise regular theoretical and practical training at a  national level with the involvement of high oicials and  merchants in order to develop mutual understanding  and coordinate the management of crisis situations.  5. Improve the competence and resources of state insti- tutions when preparing and ensuring the presidency  of the Council of the European Union in 2015 when  global cyber attacks may be directed against Latvia.  6. Develop regional and international cooperation, to  ensure regular training for providing and receiving  support in a crisis situation.  7. Establish an electronic communication network for  emergency situations.  8. Develop a technological and organisational solution  that provides state institutions with infrastructure and  ensures high conidentiality and integrity of and acces- sibility to state information systems.  9. Strengthen the outer scope of the national external  communication network: establish, categorise, coordi- nate, evaluate risks, and make necessary improvements  to ensure a reliable and secure low of data between   Latvia and other countries, but, when necessary, to use  the network for changes in data lows or the restriction  thereof between countries.  4.4. AWARENESS RAISING, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH  An informed society is a crucial part of a secure and re- liable cyber space. Awareness is ensured by purposeful  and regular explanatory work, including the policy and  communication implemented by the leading oicials of a  country, raising the issues in educational institutions and  organising regular discussions of experts in the media.  he level of awareness of a society about the threats to  ICT, tools available for their prevention, personal rights in  the electronic medium and their infringement, as well as  about action in the case of a threat is low. According to the  statistics of CERT.LV, in almost all cases when the devices  of users have been infected and have become a part of bot- nets (approximately 15–20 thousand a month), the users  have not deliberately caused damage and the cause of the  infection is sotware that has not been updated or the lack  of antivirus solutions when malicious e-mail attachments  are opened. Along with raising awareness of  society, it is  important to increase  understanding about ethical norms  and moral responsibilities in the electronic environment.  To improve the knowledge of ICT users, it is necessary to  implement a set of complex measures, starting from primary  and secondary education. It is necessary to organise reg- ular information campaigns in cooperation with non-gov- ernmental and private institutions, as well as constantly  relect the information in mass media. At the moment,   cyber security issues  are only tested in a uniform model in   general education in  an informatics examination (knowl-  PDF Compressor Pro  http://www.pdfcompressor.org/buy.html   13  edge test part) at the secondary education level. Although  the average level of answered questions is comparatively  high (2013 — 0.79%), it is impossible to assess the actual  actions of students in daily life. he type of communica- tion (channel), content and methodology is to be applied  according to the chosen target audience (see Figure 1).  At the moment, there are no academic study pro- grammes and scientific activity in the area of cyber  security and people studying the respective subjects  abroad are not motivated to return to Latvia due to low  salaries, lack of opportunities for professional devel- opment. According to a study by the World Economic   Forum, Latvia ranks 110th with regard to the availabil- ity of scientists and engineers.1  1 World Economic Forum “The Global Competitiveness Report   2012–2013”, p. 227.  To develop new study programmes and educate experts and  professionals from other sectors (e.g., experts in law) about  ICT issues, a teaching staf with an appropriate competen- cy is required. Competency should be increased by creating  and supporting security research groups at universities and  scientiic institutes. hese would, irstly, attract Latvian spe -  cialists who are currently working abroad, serve as a basis  for the creation of a national cyber security (including cryp- tography) school, provide the opportunity in the future to  successfully participate in scientiic EU projects and, inal- ly, to create commercial products with a high added value.  Required actions: 1. Increase the competency of educational institutions   and teaching staf and their contribution to educating  children and youth about the issues of ICT security by  integrating these issues into the educational system and   Figure 1. he level of cyber space security knowledge  according to the target audience.

Additionally, opportuni- ties must be ensured for children and youths to report   violations on the Internet and to receive support from  a psychologist. Further education of the teaching staf  about the issues of cyber security must be organized.  2. Develop educational and informative materials about  cyber security for use in educational institutions and  interest groups that are easily accessible and diferenti- ated according to various age groups.  3. Develop academic studies and research in cyber se- curity to train experts, promote innovation, establish  public-private partnerships for the support of science  and research, and to attract European funds, grants and  inancial instruments.  4. Create an ICT security laboratory and to organise sci- entiic conferences about topical issues concerning  cyber security and cybercrime in cooperation with  universities and scientiic institutes.  5. Implement educational and informative campaigns  and other measures for the overall enhancement of the  understanding of  society about the cyber security, cy- bercrime and important threats, to expand the accessi- bility of various ICT security sotware.  6. Develop the exchange of information and opinions  among public administration, associations of the sec- tor, experts, business leaders, as well as creators of  public opinion — non-governmental organisations  and the academic environment.  7. Participate in international informative initiatives and  platforms, use the European Cyber Security Month and  the e-Skills Week to raise issues about the cyber security.   8. Promote innovation in the cyber security sector and  develop a uniied academic resource of high-capacity  computing (supercomputer).  4.5. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION  he opportunities and security threats provided by cyber  space  do not recognize national borders and therefore no  state can efectively face new security challenges on its own.   Due to the awareness of the increasing role of  cyber space  in every society, cyber security as an important issue has  been included on the agenda of cross border cooperation  and by international organisations. In bilateral and multi- lateral cooperation, a wide range of issues are usually con- sidered — from observation of human rights in the virtual  environment to combating of crime, oten also involving  the private sector. Under these conditions, diferent na- tional interests inevitably collide, and thus far the inter- national community has not reached signiicant progress  in creating a common understanding and approach. At  the same time, many non-harmonised processes still take  place. It is important for Latvia to have knowledge of the  work of international and regional organisations and to  participate in this work while at the same time expressing  support for ensuring the basic principles of a democratic  society in the virtual environment. It should be not only  be safe, but also free and accessible.  Latvia is taking part in international processes, including  the work of NATO, the EU, OSCE and UN, to promote  the improvement of a secure, free and accessible cyber  space. Latvia supports the irst comprehensive resolution  of the United Nations Human Rights Council on human  rights in the virtual space and will continue to partici- pate and strengthen such initiatives as the Freedom  Online Coalition, which focuses on observing human  rights and basic freedoms in cyber space, especially the  freedom of speech.   PDF Compressor Pro  http://www.pdfcompressor.org/buy.html   15  Latvia has joined the Council of Europe Convention on  Cyber Crime and its Additional Protocol concerning the  criminalisation of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature  committed through computer systems. According to the  Convention, all involved countries harmonise their legal  regulations to cooperate in the investigation of crimes  and to ensure that the people responsible for committing  cybercrimes are held liable.  Cyber security is an important part of national defence,  and nationally developed defence capabilities can be  strengthened by cooperating with NATO and EU mem- ber states in a crisis situation. To receive efective support  when necessary and to strengthen cyber security mea- sures in the Euro-Atlantic space, the development of both  collective and individual cyber protection capabilities of  each member state should be facilitated in accordance  with the approved NATO and EU cyber security planning  documents. NATO has approved the Cyber Defence Con- cept and Action Plan and corresponding planning docu- ments, which provide for the necessity to promote the de- velopment of cyber security capabilities of both NATO as  a whole and each individual member state.  Required actions: 1. Strengthen cooperation with countries from the Bal-  tic and Northern European countries and improve the   cooperation with NATO, the EU, OSCE and UN to  improve the security, accessibility and freedom of ICT.  2. Support international eforts in enhancing mutual trust  and cooperation, emphasising the equal applicability of  international legal norms to both the physical and the  virtual environment.  3. Create a common Baltic university study programme   to combine regional educational resources to preparing  strong and qualiied experts.  4. Organise international cyber security events in Latvia  on a regular basis, highlighting Latvia as a country that  takes care of the security of ICT at a national and inter- national level.  5. Develop and test national procedures to receive prompt  and efective help in case of a cyber threat according  to the Memorandum of Understanding between Latvia  and NATO and pursuant to the NATO Cyber Defence  Concept and Action Plan.  6. Strengthen cyber protection capabilities by participat- ing in various international training courses, exercises  and cyber attack simulations within NATO, the EU,  and other international organizations and forums,  giving local experts and the Cyber Defence Unit the  opportunity to improve their knowledge about the  latest solutions in information systems security.

LINK TO OTHER DEVELOPMENT PLANNING DOCUMENTS  PDF Compressor Pro  http://www.pdfcompressor.org/buy.html   17  An ex-ante evaluation of the proposed solution has not  been carried out, since cyber security is constantly and  rapidly developing, but the ields of action established in  the guidelines are a continuation of priorities speciied in  the National Security Concept and actions initiated so far.  he evaluation of the cyber security provided for in the  guidelines will create a basis for assessing and improving  further policy and the action plan.  Based on the guidelines, an action plan will be devel- oped, which will include detailed results of the actions  and calculations on the inluence on state and municipal   budgets in 2014 and in the following years. Every two  years, the Ministry of Defence performs an evaluation  of the guidelines and implementation of the action plan  within the Council and submits an informative report  and, if necessary, proposals for raising the issues of the  guidelines to the Cabinet of Ministers.  here are no policy planning documents that are be  deemed as having lost their validity. At the same time,  implementation of priorities laid down by the National  Security Concept shall continue.    6. CONCLUSIONS  PDF Compressor Pro  http://www.pdfcompressor.org/buy.html   18  7.

The Strategy takes a holistic approach, where cyber security is seen as an integral part of digital ecosystem rather than an independent national goal or as a set of tools designed for responding to challenges of the digital age. our aim is to raise public awareness and enhance the resistance of the lithuanian society to cyber incidents which pose national security threats, present risks to the fulfilment of functions assigned to the governmental and municipal authorities and institutions as well as to the provision of e. public services rendered by such public bodies, to the development of business, to personal data protection and to the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. I am confident that we will considerably strengthen lithuania’s cyber resistance, if we respond to the most relevant challenges the lithuanian digital society and economy faces and take the responsibility for the security of our activities in cyber space all together. raimundas Karoblis, Minister of national Defence ThE fIRST target of the strategy – to strengthen cyber security of the country and the development of cyber defence capabilities. ThE SECONd target of the strategy – to ensure prevention and investigation of criminal offences in cyber space. ThE ThIRd target of the strategy – to promote cyber security culture and development of innovation. ThE fOuRTh target of the strategy – to strengthen a close cooperation between private and public sectors. ThE fIfTh target of the strategy – to enhance international cooperation and ensure the fulfilment of international obligations in the field of cyber security. The main purpose of the Strategy is to provide the Lithuanian people with the opportunity to explore the potential of information and communications technology (ICT) by identifying cyber incidents timely and effectively, by preventing cyber incidents and their recurrence, and by managing the impact of cybersecurity breaches. N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y 5 General Provisions 1. the national cyber security strategy (here- inafter referred to as the “Strategy”) defines the most important pillars of the national cyber security policy. the strategy is aimed at strengthening the development of the state’s cyber security and cyber defence capabilities preventing and investigating cybercrimes, promoting cyber security culture and the development of innovation, enhancing close private-public partnership (ppp) and international cooperation, and ensuring the fulfilment of interna- tional cyber security obligations within the country until 2023. 2. the strategy has been developed in con- sideration of the environmental analysis, data from the conducted research, and suggestions offered by public and private sector representatives. it meets the provisions of the programme of the seventeenth Government of the republic of lithuania, which was accepted by resolution no. Xiii-82 of the seimas of the republic of lithuania of 13 December 2016 “on the programme of the Government of the republic of lithuania” (hereinafter referred to as the “pro- gramme of the Government of the republic of lithu- ania”), the national security strategy approved by resolution no. iX-907 of the seimas of the republic of lithuania of 28 May 2002 “on the approval of the national security strategy”, the law of the republic of lithuania on cyber security, the communications and recommendations made by the european par- liament, the council, and the european commission in the field of cyber security as well as the Commu- nication from the commission to the european par- liament, the council, the european economic and social committee and the committee of the regions “a Digital single Market strategy for europe” dated 6 May 2015 and the lithuanian information society Development programme 2014–2020 “Digital agenda of the republic of lithuania” approved by resolu- tion no. 244 of the Government of the republic of lithuania of 12 March 2014 “on the approval of lithu- anian information society Development programme 2014-2020 “Digital agenda of the republic of lithu- ania”. after lithuania joined the organisation for economic co-operation and Development (oecD), recommendations produced by this organisation on Digital security risk Management for economic and social prosperity have also become part of the key guidelines reflected in the Strategy. 3. terms used in the strategy shall have the same meanings as those defined in the Law on Cyber security, the law of the republic of lithuania on the organisation of the national Defence system and Military service, the law of the republic of lithuania on higher education and research and the law of the republic of lithuania on the right to obtain in- formation from state and Municipal institutions and agencies. © iS to ck N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y 7 Cyber Security and Cyber Defence Capabilities of the State Targets and Objectives of the Strategy, evaluation criteria and their Values 1 The State Security Department of the Republic of Lithuania and the Second Investigation Department under the Ministry of National Defence (2018). National Security Threat Assessment; National Cyber Security Centre under the Ministry of National Defence (2018). National Cyber Se- curity Status Report 2017. 5. The first target of the Strategy is to strength- en cyber security in the country and to develop cy- ber defence capabilities. 6. like other countries of the world that have well-developed broadband infrastructures and in which ict potential is being actively explored, lithu- ania has become attractive not only to individuals, groups of individuals or organised groups but also to the countries specified in the reports of national security threats and issued annually by the state security Department of the republic of lithuania and the second investigation Department under the Ministry of national Defence of the republic of lithuania (hereinafter referred to as the “ssD” and “siD”, accordingly). those countries threaten lithu- ania’s national security and conduct hostile activi- ties in global and lithuanian cyberspace. Data col- lected by the national cyber security centre under the Ministry of national Defence (ncsc), ssD and siD reveal that lithuania continuously encounters various types of cyber incidents that are intended to encroach on the information resources and critical information infrastructures. according to forecasts, the number and extent of cyber incidents are ex- pected to increase.1 7. according to data in the national cyber se- curity status report 2017, the national electronic communication networks and information security incidents investigation unit (also referred to as the “computer emergency response team in lithu- ania” or “cert-lt”) processed 54,414 cyber incidents in 2017. also in 2017, the number of recorded cyber incidents was 10% higher than in 2016. While cyber- espionage attacks primarily target lithuanian state information resources, private critical information infrastructures and other entities of strategic or significant importance to the national security are also at risk. While applying technical cyber security measures, the NCSC has identified that the highest number of malware was detected in the sectors of energy (27%), public security and legal order (22%) and foreign affairs and security policy (21%). com- pared to 2016, malware has mostly spread in the fields of public security and legal order, foreign af- fairs and security policy and energy. the condition of public sector websites, which according to the national cyber security status report 2017 has de- teriorated, also influence the state of cyber security. 8. the explosion of cyber incidents that is indi- cated in the annual reports of the ncsc, ssD and siD is proof that every cyber security entity must deter- mine the amount of time, money and other resourc- es to allot to the protection of their communica- tion and information systems and provided services. cyber security entities perform security risk assess- ments, but they are often of formal nature only and are conducted so as to comply with legal require- ments or internationally recognised standards. the Risk Analysis Manual published by the Ministry of the interior of the republic of lithuania 12 years ago reflects the progress in risk assessment in the light of current conditions of research and in- novation, but the security risk assessment method- ology has changed over time and the understanding of risk assessment performance has transformed from the assurance of control environment to the holistic approach of risk assessment of organisa- tions’ activities. 9. individual security risk assessment pro- cesses have already reached maturity level in lithu- ania, however, on the national level, the security risk 8 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y assessment culture and cyber security risk assess- ment processes are still fragmentary. cyber security threats and security gaps have not been adequately analysed and holistically integrated into the process of risk assessment. furthermore, rapid ict develop- ment presents a challenge to ensuring that cyber se- curity professionals have adequate knowledge, skills and practice. 10. in order to enhance the culture of effective cyber security policy making and implementation and to improve cyber security risk assessment and other requirements, the following changes occurred in 2018: 10.1. the provisions of the law on cyber secu- rity were recast to improve organisation, manage- ment and control of the cyber security system; the competence, functions, rights and duties of state in- stitutions responsible for cyber security policy mak- ing and implementation were specified; the duties and responsibilities of cyber security entities were defined in more detail, and additional cyber secu- rity assurance measures were established. 10.2. regulatory functions of state information resources security, activities of public communica- tions networks, public digital communication ser- vices and digital information hosting service pro- viders were consolidated which enabled systematic cyberspace monitoring, and management of cyber incidents occurring in communication and informa- tion systems of cyber security entities. the ncsc is the only agency in lithuania that organises cyber incident management and assists other state insti- tutions, businesses and residents on the one stop shop principle. 11. consolidation of capabilities aims at devel- oping an integral cyber security management sys- tem in lithuania to represent a systematic approach to the security management planning in any field, encouraging cyber security entities to focus on se- curity management quality, reducing administrative burden falling on cyber security entities, ensuring systematic assessment and evidence-based security management culture, and facilitating optimisation of security expenditure planning. consolidation of capabilities also aims at ensuring sustainable de- velopment of cyber security competences and en- hancement of regional cyber security capabilities. 12. the Ministry of national Defence of the re- public of lithuania and the ncsc continuously co- operate with cyber security entities, consult them on cyber security issues, and organise cyber security exercises. in 2017, the national cyber security exercise Cy- ber Security 2017 had around 200 participants from over 50 organisations of private and public sector. in cooperation with the communications regulatory authority of the republic of lithuania, the lithuani- an police and the state Data protection inspectorate, workshops for representatives of cyber security en- tities were organised. participants were familiarised with the requirements of legal acts related to cyber security and had training on management and coun- teraction to cyber incidents against critical commu- nication and information systems. the Ministry of national Defence will con- tinue to organise national cyber security exercises on a regular basis and will promote continuous im- provement of the cyber security skills not only in the national but international cyber security exer- cises as well. 13. the european union (eu) and the north atlantic treaty organisation (nato) acknowledge that cyberspace has been increasingly used as a separate military space or as a tool of hybrid war- fare. cyber tools may be used to sabotage activities of a country’s critical information infrastructure (e.g., the cyber-attack which took place in one of iran’s nuclear energy objects in 2010), might ad- versely affect national and public security (e.g., the cyber-attacks on ukraine’s power plants in 2015 and 2016), economy and social welfare. for this rea- son, protecting the national cyberspace is a matter of national security for every country. in accordance with the decision adopted dur- ing the nato Warsaw summit 2016 where cyber space was recognised as the fifth domain of war- fare the lithuanian armed forces have become the main cyberspace defence entity for the republic of lithuania. the strengthening of cyber defence in order to prevent military cyber threats and effec- tively manage cyber incidents is a prerequisite for ensuring vital and primary interests of national se- curity. To fulfil the objectives set for the Lithuanian armed forces, national cyber defence capabilities will be developed by ensuring interaction between the lithuanian armed forces and the country’s civil capabilities, also capabilities of the lithuanian armed forces to ensure reliable deterrence of ag- gressors in cyber space. in case of failure to ensure effective deterrence, the lithuanian armed forces would defend the republic of lithuania by using military cyber security measures acting autono- mously and in cooperation with allies. N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y 9 14.1. The first objective of the first target is to develop a systematic approach to cyber security and preventive activities. this objective will be accomplished by improving the meth- ods of cyber security risk identification, evaluation and fore- cast; by building up a picture of cyber security identification and a risk map to reveal the risks typically encountered in particular sectors; by establishing regional cyber security centre and state-controlled electronic communications net- work with a set of cyber security measures, linking state and municipal institutions, agencies and state companies, which perform state mobilisation tasks for ensuring vital state functions; by carrying out surveys on cyber security state, progress reports or maturity assessments; by implementing other measures and actions in order to enhance cyber secu- rity level and preventive activities. 14.2. The second objective of the first target is to impro- ve the efficiency of the cyber security policy making and implementation by reducing administrative burden falling on cyber security entities. this objective will be implemented by improving legal frame- work in the field of cyber security; by preparing standard- ised but differentiated cyber security requirements; by ana- lysing best practice, standards applicable to ensuring cyber security; by encouraging cyber security entities to follow such standards; by establishing a national integrated crisis management mechanism to ensure cooperation among con- cerned parties at all levels; by updating the cyber security risk assessment system; by assessing the methodological possibilities to monitor and control the funds which are nec- essary to ensure cyber security while establishing priorities for the funds’ allocation and use; by implementing any other measures of cyber security policy making and implementa- tion. 14.3. The third objective of the first target is to promote national cyber security exercises and participation in internatio- nal exercises. this objective will be implemented by periodically organi- sing complex national cyber security exercises and partici- pating in international cyber security exercises organised by the eu, nato and other countries; by incorporating lessons learned from national and international exercises into ma- nagement of situations, incident assessment, information communication and other activities. 14.4. The fourth objective of the first target is to develop cyber defence capabilities of the country. this objective will be achieved by ensuring effective inte- raction between the lithuanian armed forces and civilian cyber defence capabilities; by developing cyber defence capabilities; and by providing assistance to other state and municipal institutions and agencies. 14.

The second target of the Strategy is to ensure the prevention and investigation of cyber- crimes. 16. cybercrimes have a negative impact on the global economy. according to research2, global dam- age caused by cybercrimes amounts to hundred bil- lions euros a year and has been increasing. persons committing cybercrimes are interested not only in financial details, but also in data, in general. For this reason, the number of crimes that undermine elec- tronic data and information system security speci- fied in Chapter XXX of the Criminal Code of the Re- public of lithuania has also been steadily growing. according to the data of the institutional register of crimes, in 2017, 594 cybercrimes were recorded; in 2016, 336 offences were recorded. as the euro- pean cybercrime centre (ec3) operating within the European Police Office (hereinafter referred to as the “ec3”) states, cybercrimes are most often encoun- tered by those european union Member states that have a well-developed broadband infrastructure and well-functioning online payment systems.3 17. referring to the data of a survey conducted by pwc in 2018 (Global Economic Crime Survey 2018), in 2018, fraud crimes committed in cyberspace were among the most common crimes which caused the most damage to private sector entities. ec3 fore- casts that the rapid development of ict and meth- ods of social engineering, among other reasons, will increase the number of cybercrimes. Moreover, cy- bercrimes which do not necessarily involve the use of ict, for instance, fraud or extortion, are “going digital“. in order to commit cybercrimes or to con- ceal their traces, the latest ict solutions, cryptocur- rencies and services offered in anonymous networks are used. 18. the company cybersecurity Ventures cal- culated in 2017 that the financial damages caused by cybercrimes using malware have been increasing each year. additionally, they forecast that by the end of the year 2019, the world would suffer the damage of more than usD 11 billion due to the spread of ran- somware. ec3 predicts that this trend will continue due to the increase of the internet of things (iot) devices. although malware is only one type of cyber- crimes, the european union agency for network and N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y 11 4 According to the data of the Lithuanian national criminal records register, in 2016, 123 crimes were regis- tered as per definition provided in Article 309(2) of the Criminal Code, in 2017 – 132. 5 European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Co- operation (Europol) (2017). Europol Review 2016–2017. information security (enisa) in its threat landscape report 2017 which was published in 2018 indicated that malware is the most frequent cyber threat that has prevailed in recent years. 19. crimes related to the sexual exploitation of children in cyberspace are considered to be the most harmful and injurious cybercrimes, the spread of which is prompted by rapidly developing ict and its potential. according to the lithuanian national crim- inal records register and the europol, such crimes have been increasing and spreading in lithuania4 and in europe.5 in seeking to prevent crimes related to the sexual exploitation of children, lithuania has transposed Directive 2011/92/eu of the european Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploi- tation of children and child pornography, which re- placed council framework Decision 2004/68/Jha (oJ 2011 l 335, p. 1) into national legislation and on 6 no- vember 2012 ratified the Council of Europe Conven- tion on the protection of children against sexual ex- ploitation and sexual abuse dated 25 october 2007. 20. in order to combat international cyber- crimes, it is important to develop close cross-border cooperation and exchange of information, to main- tain and deepen agreements and membership- based relationships. to this end, it is necessary to have the strong political will to effectively fulfil inter- national obligations and comply with international standards to ensure cyber security and combat cy- bercrimes. to express a clear political will, lithuania ratified the convention on cybercrime of the council of europe of 23 november 2011 (hereinafter referred to as the “budapest convention”) and its additional protocols. in addition, lithuania transposed Direc- tive 2013/40/eu of the european parliament and of the Council of 12 August 2013 on attacks against in- formation systems, replacing council framework De- cision 2005/222/Jha (oJ 2013 l 218, p. 8) into national legislation. Obligations are successfully fulfilled on both legal and practical levels by cooperating with the international criminal police organisation (hereinafter referred to as the “interpol”) and the interpol Global complex for innovation (iGci), the europol and ec3 and the european union’s Judicial cooperation unit (eurojust). Moreover, lithuania has taken part in the activities of continuously operat- ing contact points of the network specialising in the field of cybercrime investigation which was founded on the basis of the european Judicial network (eJn) and in accordance with the budapest convention. 21. since cybercrimes continue to evolve, personnel of law enforcement authorities must be equipped with necessary skills to perform their al- located tasks. the appropriate competences of em- ployees and their superior officers of the prosecu- tion authorities and the courts must be taken into account as well. in relation to the investigation of cybercrimes, the competence of law enforcement authorities is crucial in order to detect, capture and investigate electronic evidence. 22.1. The first objective of the second target is to de- velop capabilities and capacities of the country for combating cybercrimes. this objective will be attained by improving the legal frame- work, by further strengthening the professional capacity of law enforcement authorities, by creating information and/ or analysis systems, putting in practice advanced opera- tional methods, procedures and technical tools specifically designed to combat cybercrimes. 22.2. The second objective of the second target is to strengthen the prevention and control of cybercrimes. this objective will be implemented by promoting the so- ciety’s culture of self-protection and responsible behaviour in cyberspace; by increasing the operational effectiveness of law enforcement authorities and ensuring effective in- ternational cooperation while investigating cybercrimes; by developing effective cooperation between law enforcement authorities and academia, private and public sector repre- sentatives and society. 22.

IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2018 (2018). 7 National Cyber Security Centre under the Ministry of National Defence (2018). National Cyber Security Status Report 2017. 23. The third target of the Strategy is to pro- mote cybersecurity culture and innovation. 24. it is impossible to avoid cyber incidents in the modern-day world, even if all existing cyber se- curity measures are to be applied. for this reason, public and private sector representatives must im- prove cybersecurity culture of their employees. ac- cording to ibM report published in 20176, the number of cyber incidents caused due to employee negli- gence has been growing (in 2017, the number of such cyber incidents constituted more than 20%, in 2016 – 15%). More than 30% of these cyber incidents hap- pened because employees opened malicious links or documents sent to them via email. in lithuania, the number of emails created using social engineer- ing methods has also been rising.7 25. according to the european innovation scoreboard dated 2018, private sector representa- tives in europe have been increasing their focus on ict training of their employees. While europe as a whole has an average index of 21%, in lithuania it is slightly greater than 10%. civil servants in lithuania are given opportunities to improve their skills in the field of cyber security and the number of civil serv- Cyber Security Culture and Innovation ants who have taken cybersecurity courses is grow- ing annually. according to civil service Department, there were 146 such civil servants in 2015, 249 – in 2015 and 289 – in 2017. routine and regularly up- dated training courses for private and public sector employees would increase employees’ duty of care as well as the overall cybersecurity culture. 26. Efficient and regular dissemination of in- formation on the latest cyber incidents and other factors that may cause personal data breach or pose a risk of becoming a victim of cybercrime is a key measure for strengthening cybersecurity culture of the lithuanian people. according to the special eurobarometer survey 464a which reveals europe- ans’ attitude towards cybersecurity, only 16% of the internet users in lithuania believe that the risk of becoming a victim of a cybercrime has not been in- creasing (the european union average is 11%). nev- ertheless, as 49% of the internet users in lithuania N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y 13 8 ISACA.

Quality public edu- cation which corresponds with the needs of labour market is a tool that can contribute to professional competence. presently, cyber security programmes are offered by four universities in lithuania; yet ac- cording to the results of the survey titled “the ict specialists in lithuania: situation in the labour Mar- ket and employers’ needs” that was carried out by the association infobalt and the public institution invest lithuania, current labour market needs are not met. in order to reduce the gap between sup- ply and demand of cybersecurity specialists, the existing cybersecurity study programmes must be improved and new study programmes shall be es- tablished. to boost cybersecurity culture, children and pupils should be provided with the fundamental knowledge of cybersecurity under nursery, pre- school, primary and/or secondary education pro- grammes since ict is used to ensure educational and learning processes. in the context of implementing programme of the Government of the republic of lithuania on reorganisation of the system of teachers’ up-skilling and training, efforts should be made to improve teachers’ qualifications in the area of cybersecurity. having the opportunity and ability to expand and deepen their cybersecurity knowledge, teachers of different educational areas would not only be able to educate young people better, but would contrib- ute to the development of knowledge and innova- tion based society and further cybersecurity aware- ness raising as well. 28. Many cybersecurity experts9 estimate that by the year 2019, there will be at least 1.5 million employment vacancies worldwide for cybersecurity professionals. the study “ict specialists in lithu- ania: situation in the labour Market and employers’ needs”, conducted by the association infobalt and public organisation invest lithuania in 2018, revealed that while there are 22,600 ict specialists in lithu- ania, about 13,300 more would be needed within the following three years. regrettably, researchers pro- vided no details about this shortage of cybersecurity specialists in lithuania, but it may be assumed that they are in high demand. to address this shortage, cybersecurity skills that cybersecurity specialists are expected to have in Lithuania first must be identi- fied because the demand for cybersecurity profes- sionals may vary in different countries and problems related to the lack of cybersecurity skills may differ according to the conclusions of studies carried out in other countries10. 29. With regard to rapid development of cyber- space, various opportunities for innovation, which, in turn, drives economic and productivity growth, have emerged. this prompts the creation of new and better jobs, increases social mobility and responds to social and security challenges globally. lithuania joined the european union a rela- tively short time ago, for this reason, there is neither long tradition of cybersecurity scientific research nor education, whereas they are present in other eu Member states. the european union has provided lithuania with a great opportunity to promote in- vestment in scientific research through the general research and innovation programme horizon 2020 (2014–2020). through this programme, lithuania may contribute to the development of the digital econ- omy and defence policy on both the national and the eu level. however, all efforts of the state in this direction must be focused on support measures that promote international networking in finding poten- tial employees and partners. this would stimulate private sector investment in the r&D and innova- tion areas, new technologies, tools and services and in the cyber security area as well. the designing of innovative cyber security products would not only provide additional support and leverage for the competitiveness of the lithuanian industry, but it is a key factor in responding to modern cyber inci- dents. it is also important to encourage lithuania’s academics to participate in joint international aca- demic publications in the field of cyber security, to attract as many students as possible to high-level r&D projects that focus on cyber security, to pro- mote public-private partnership and academia co- operation and to increase the number of foreign doctoral students in the area of cyber security. 30. according to the data from the european innovation scoreboard 2018, in comparison with other eu Member states, lithuania is a moderate in- novator but it has advanced considerably in terms of innovation and improvement of the ecosystem of innovation.11 in the european union, the private sec- 14 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y 32.1. The first objective of the third target is to develop scientific research and acti- vities that create high added value in the area of cyber security. this objective will be implemented by creating favourable con- ditions for the creation of new, advanced cybersecurity ini- tiatives; by promoting growth of the cybersecurity market, by expanding export of cybersecurity services to foreign markets; by developing cyber security sector of financial technology and by conducting research. 32.2. The second objecti- ve of the third target is to develop creativity, advanced capabilities and cyber secu- rity skills and competence that meet market needs. this objective will be implemented by creating a cybersecurity competence model; by establishing cybersecurity competence standards; by developing systems of training, accreditation and certification oriented towards the needs of the labour market; by attracting, nurturing and retaining talent; by creating trai- ning and testing environments for cybersecurity; by teaching newcomers and providing retraining opportunities for ict wor- kers; and by training employees working with sensitive data. 32.3. The third objective of the third target is to promote public, private, and academic partnerships while creating innovation in cyberse- curity field. this objective will be implemented by identifying the common needs of the private and public sectors and their importance in relation to scientific cybersecurity research; by creating techni- cal measures, methods and other resources; and by developing the requisite expertise for solving cybersecurity problems or fulfilling any other specific tasks for cybersecurity. 32.

The European Innova- tion Scoreboard (2018). tor still allocates insufficient resources to innova- tion compared to its rivals beyond european union borders. no reliable measurements of the cyber se- curity market have yet been carried out in lithuania, but it is acknowledged that this market has been growing and, for this reason, innovation would help strengthen lithuania’s competitive position in the development of new innovative products and ser- vices. this synergy could be attained by combining initiatives of innovation and general national poli- cies while promoting long-term science, technology and innovation development. 31. lithuania’s regulatory and supervisory en- vironment is favourable to financial services and promotes innovation in the finance sector. Pursuant to the data of lithuania fintech report 2017, there were 117 financial technology enterprises operating in Lithuania in 2017. The development of financial technology is one of the strategic activity directions for the bank of lithuania and its activity in one of the most promising and prospective areas of finan- cial technology innovation, blockchain technology, will further drive innovation in financial technology field.

The fourth target of the Strategy is to pro- mote close ppp. 34. in modern states, in which the broadband infrastructures are well developed, public sec- tor representatives as well as managers of critical information infrastructures who are often private sector representatives, are not always able to com- bat cyber incidents independently. thus coopera- tion between public and private sectors becomes inevitable in order to ensure comprehensive cyber- security. The PPP success factor is a fully-fledged partnership, which entails trust and mutual ben- efit. Thus public and private sectors should strive to work together to this end. 35. the cyber security council set up follow- ing the approval of resolution no. 422 of the Gov- ernment of the republic of lithuania of 23 april 2015 “on the approval of establishment of a cyber security council and its rules of procedure” is an example of ppp on a political level. all efforts must be made to effectively enjoy the rights of a cyber Security Council that are defined in the Law on Cy- ber security. 36. to ensure ppp, the cyber security infor- mation network (hereinafter referred to as the “network”) is used. the aim of the network is infor- mation sharing, exchange of cybersecurity recom- mendations, instructions, and technical solutions, and other measures which could help ensure cy- bersecurity of the network members. it is neces- sary to integrate appropriate measures in the net- work for more effective and trusted cooperation among the network members. 37. the advantages of ict are beyond ques- tion in the 21st century, but the issue of how to effectively address vulnerabilities in ict systems arises. security vulnerabilities may be detected by the persons who may have different goals; how- ever, in order to develop a responsible disclosure approach, it is important to give a particular op- portunity to a person, who has been able to iden- tify a vulnerability and wants to contribute to secu- rity of ict systems, to cooperate with cybersecurity N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y 17 38.1. The first objective of the fourth target is to improve coordination of ppp. this objective will be implemented by creating a sustainable PPP model in the field of cyber security; by identifying respon- sibilities and capabilities related to cybersecurity; by improv- ing effective exchange of relevant information about cyber threats, cyber incidents and lessons learned; by supporting an early warning system; and by creating new or improving the existing communication techniques and processes. 38.2. The second objective of the fourth target is to increase cybersecu- rity maturity of small and medium-sized enterprises (hereinafter sMes). this objective will be implemented by encouraging sMes to verify their cybersecurity state and address cybersecurity gaps. 38.3. The third objective of the fourth target is to develop a responsible vulner- ability disclosure practice. this objective will be implemented by establishing operational principles, methods, technical capabilities or other measures designed for this purpose. 38. Objectives for the attainment of the fourth target of the Strategy: entities whose security vulnerability was disclosed. establishment and public announcement of a formalised procedure for responsible disclosure would contribute to the protection of cybersecu- rity entities from possible damage caused by cy- ber incidents or could considerably diminish such damage. this would also enhance cybersecurity of the country and would give more opportunities for ppp. 18 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y International Cooperation 42.1. The first objective of the fifth target is to develop international, cross-border cooperation, including coopera- tion with the countries of the Baltic region in the field of cyber security. This objective will be fulfilled by participating in the activities of the european union, nato, the united nations, the organisa- tion for security and co-operation in europe (osce), organisa- tions of the baltic region and other international organisations. © iS to ck 42. Objectives for the fulfilment of the fifth target of the Strategy: 39. The fifth target of the Strategy is to en- hance international cooperation and ensure the fulfilment of international obligations in the field of cybersecurity. 40. lithuania’s national security and the pros- perity of the lithuanian society depend directly on stable, easily and freely accessible and secure cy- berspace. considering the fact that modern cyber threats and risks can easily cross national borders, lithuania will seek to strengthen its national cyber- security by actively cooperating with bilateral and multilateral partners and by participating in inter- national forums designed for resolving problems re- lated to cybersecurity and internet governance. 41. lithuania is eager to become an active partner in the international community which seeks to resolve cyber security and internet governance problems. lithuania is active in building cooperation with partners and allies by signing an international agreement for legal regulation of cyberspace which shall comply with the provisions of international law, standards and principles that apply to activities in cyberspace in relation to protection of the open internet principle as well as other principles on fun- damental freedoms and human rights. lithuania advocates more close and harmoni- ous cooperation with nato and the european union in the cybersecurity field with the aim of avoiding overlap of functions and activities. lithuania shall also strengthen bilateral political and technical co- operation with other countries which adhere to the principles of democracy, especially, with the united states of america. N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y 19 42.2. The second objective of the fifth target is to strengt- hen international cybersecurity capabilities and capacities. this objective will be implemented by initiating and leading the permanent structured cooperation in security and Defence po- licy (pesco) project for improvement of cooperation in security and defence area in terms of those eu member states that have military capabilities which meet higher criteria and are bound by greater commitments. 42.3. The third objective of the fifth target is to further develop the dialogue with the united states of america in the field of cyber defence and to strive for the involve- ment of the united states of america in lithuania’s cybersecurity projects. this objective will be implemented by developing bilateral coo- peration between lithuania and the usa at technical and politi- cal levels and by pursuing activities that would strengthen lithu- ania’s cyber defence and cybersecurity capabilities. N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y 21 Implementation of and Responsibility for the Strategy 43. the Government of the republic of lithu- ania shall approve an inter-institutional opera- tional plan where particular measures and funds will be foreseen in order to implement the targets and objectives of the strategy. the Ministry of na- tional Defence shall coordinate the drafting of this plan jointly with the ncsc. Ministries, other state or municipal authorities, agencies or organisations specified in the inter-institutional operational plan of the strategy shall, within the limits of their com- petence, participate in the implementation of the strategy (hereinafter referred to as the “strategy implementers”). 44. non-governmental organisations, repre- sentatives of public and private stakeholders and lithuania’s academia may contribute to the strate- gy’s implementation and the fulfilment of its goals and objectives. 45. each year the strategy shall be imple- mented using funds allocated from the republic of lithuania state budget, municipal budgets, the european union and other international funds, and other legally obtained sources. the responsibil- ity for planning of the required financial resources shall be assumed by the strategy implementers and shall be carried out according to the principle of subsidiarity as defined in the Law on Cybersecurity. 46. the accomplishment of the strategy’s goals shall be assessed according to the criteria for implementation of the strategy and the targeted values indicated in the annex to the strategy. Mon- itoring and assessment of the implementation of the strategy will be also based on publicly availa- ble data derived from the Department of statistics, eurostat, sociological surveys and other surveys. the Ministry of national Defence, the ncsc and the cyber security council shall monitor the results of the strategy’s implementation. 47. the strategy implementers shall provide the ncsc with information on the course of the im- plementation of the strategy and its effectiveness along with supporting documents after the end of a year but no later than before 15 January of the following year. this information may be accompa- nied where appropriate with proposals for revision of the strategy or its implementation documents. if requested by the ncsc, the strategy implement- ers are obliged to submit any other information required for monitoring of the strategy implemen- tation results. all stakeholders are entitled to pro- pose updates to the provisions of the strategy at any time during its implementation. 48. after receipt of the information speci- fied in Paragraph 47 of the Strategy, the NCSC shall provide the Ministry of national Defence with pro- cessed data on the state of implementation of the strategy’s targets and objectives of the previous year and shall also forward its suggestions and indicated problematic issues which hinder the im- plementation of the strategy no later than 1 febru- ary of the current year. 49. the Ministry of national Defence shall summarise the information received over the pre- vious year and the data about the course of im- plementation as well as efficiency of the Strategy by 1 March each year. aggregated information on the annual implementation of the strategy shall then be presented to the cyber security council and submitted to the Government. the Govern- ment shall report to the seimas of the republic of lithuania with regard to the implementation of the strategy annually by providing an annual report on the state of national security and Development. 50. all public information related to the an- nual and final Strategy implementation assess- ments shall be announced on the ncsc website. 51. The NCSC shall draft a final assessment of the implementation of the strategy six months before the strategy’s implementation deadline and shall submit it to the Ministry of national Defence. it shall be then forwarded to the cyber security council and the Government. 22 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y Ite m N um be r Name of the Evaluation Criterion Value of the Evaluation Criterion Responsible state institution Initial known value in 2017 2021 2023 The main purpose of the National Cyber Security Strategy (hereinafter referred to as the “strategy”) is to provide the lithuanian people with the opportunity to explore the potential of information and communications technology (ict) by identifying cyber incidents timely and effec- tively, by preventing cyber incidents and their recurrence, and by managing the impact of cybersecurity breaches. position of the republic of lithuania in the global cyber security index (not lower than specified) 57 30 20 Ministry of national Defence 1. level of cyber incident threat (not higher than specified) 3.4 3.2 3 Ministry of national Defence The first target of the Strategy to strengthen cyber security in the country and to develop cyber defence capabilities. 2. percentage of cyber security entities that meet cyber security requirements (not lower than specified) * 35 50 Ministry of national Defence 3. percentage of public sector websites that are difficult to hack (not lower than specified) 25 28 32 Ministry of national Defence 4. percentage of managers of critical information infrastructure and state information resources that participate in national cyber security exercises (not lower than specified) 42 60 70 Ministry of national Defence 5. percentage of modernised cyber security and cyber defence capabilities of the state (not lower than specified) restrict- ed (r) r r Ministry of national Defence The second target of the Strategy is to ensure the prevention and investigation of cybercrimes. 6.

The Strategy takes a holistic approach, where cyber  security is seen as an integral part of digital ecosystem rather than an independent national goal or as a  set of tools designed for responding to challenges of the digital age.  our aim is to raise public awareness and enhance the resistance of the lithuanian society to cyber  incidents which pose national security threats, present risks to the fulfilment of functions assigned to the  governmental and municipal authorities and institutions as well as to the provision of e. public services  rendered by such public bodies, to the development of business, to personal data protection and to  the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. I am confident that we will considerably strengthen  lithuania’s cyber resistance, if we respond to the most relevant challenges the lithuanian digital society  and economy faces and take the responsibility for the security of our activities in cyber space all together.   raimundas Karoblis,  Minister of national Defence    ThE fIRST target of the strategy –   to strengthen cyber security of the country and the development   of cyber defence capabilities.  ThE SECONd target of the strategy –  to ensure prevention and   investigation of criminal offences in cyber space.  ThE ThIRd target of the strategy –   to promote cyber security culture and development of innovation.  ThE fOuRTh target of the strategy –   to strengthen a close cooperation between private and public sectors.  ThE fIfTh target of the strategy –   to enhance international cooperation and ensure   the fulfilment of international obligations in the field of cyber security.  The main purpose of the Strategy is to provide the Lithuanian people with the   opportunity to explore the potential of information and communications technology   (ICT) by identifying cyber incidents timely and effectively, by preventing cyber incidents   and their recurrence, and by managing the impact of cybersecurity breaches.     N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R  S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y 5  General  Provisions  1. the national cyber security strategy (here- inafter referred to as the “Strategy”) defines the  most important pillars of the national cyber security  policy. the strategy is aimed at strengthening the  development of the state’s cyber security and  cyber  defence capabilities preventing and investigating  cybercrimes, promoting cyber security culture and  the development of innovation, enhancing close  private-public partnership (ppp) and international  cooperation, and ensuring the fulfilment of interna- tional cyber security obligations within the country  until 2023.  2. the strategy has been developed in con- sideration of the environmental analysis, data from  the conducted research, and suggestions offered by  public and private sector representatives. it meets  the provisions of the programme of the seventeenth  Government of the republic of lithuania, which was  accepted by resolution no. Xiii-82 of the seimas of  the republic of lithuania of 13 December 2016 “on  the programme of the Government of the republic  of lithuania” (hereinafter referred to as the “pro- gramme of the Government of the republic of lithu- ania”), the national security strategy approved by  resolution no. iX-907 of the seimas of the republic  of lithuania of 28 May 2002 “on the approval of the  national security strategy”, the law of the republic  of lithuania on cyber security, the communications  and recommendations made by the european par- liament, the council, and the european commission  in the field of cyber security as well as the Commu-  nication from the commission to the european par- liament, the council, the european economic and  social committee and the committee of the regions  “a Digital single Market strategy for europe” dated  6 May 2015 and the lithuanian information society  Development programme 2014–2020 “Digital agenda  of the republic of lithuania” approved by resolu- tion no. 244 of the Government of the republic of  lithuania of 12 March 2014 “on the approval of lithu- anian information society Development programme  2014-2020 “Digital agenda of the republic of lithu- ania”. after lithuania joined the organisation for  economic co-operation and Development (oecD),  recommendations produced by this organisation on  Digital security risk Management for economic and  social prosperity have also become part of the key  guidelines reflected in the Strategy.  3. terms used in the strategy shall have the  same meanings as those defined in the Law on Cyber  security, the law of the republic of lithuania on the  organisation of the national Defence system and  Military service, the law of the republic of lithuania  on higher education and research and the law of  the republic of lithuania on the right to obtain in- formation from state and Municipal institutions and  agencies.      ©  iS  to ck    N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R  S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y 7  Cyber Security and Cyber Defence  Capabilities of the State  Targets and Objectives of the Strategy,   evaluation criteria and their Values  1 The State Security Department of the Republic of  Lithuania and the Second Investigation Department under  the Ministry of National Defence (2018).

The first target of the Strategy is to strength- en cyber security in the country and to develop cy- ber defence capabilities.  6. like other countries of the world that have  well-developed broadband infrastructures and in  which ict potential is being actively explored, lithu- ania has become attractive not only to individuals,  groups of individuals or organised groups but also  to the countries  specified in the reports of national  security threats and issued annually by the state  security Department of the republic of lithuania  and the second investigation Department under  the Ministry of national Defence of the republic of  lithuania (hereinafter referred to as the “ssD” and  “siD”, accordingly). those countries threaten lithu- ania’s national security and conduct hostile activi- ties in global and lithuanian cyberspace. Data col- lected by the national cyber security centre under  the Ministry of national Defence (ncsc), ssD and  siD reveal that lithuania continuously encounters  various types of cyber incidents that are intended to  encroach on the information resources and critical  information infrastructures. according to forecasts,  the number and extent of cyber incidents are ex- pected to increase.1  7. according to data in the national cyber se- curity status report 2017, the national electronic  communication networks and information security  incidents investigation unit (also referred to as the  “computer emergency response team in lithu- ania” or “cert-lt”) processed  54,414 cyber incidents  in 2017. also in 2017, the number of recorded cyber  incidents was 10% higher than in 2016. While cyber- espionage attacks primarily target lithuanian state   information resources, private critical information  infrastructures  and other entities of strategic or  significant importance to the national security are  also at risk. While applying technical cyber security   measures, the NCSC has identified that the highest  number of malware was detected  in the sectors of  energy (27%), public security and legal order (22%)  and foreign affairs and security policy (21%). com- pared to 2016, malware has mostly spread in the  fields of public security and legal order, foreign af- fairs and security policy and energy. the condition  of public sector websites, which  according to the  national cyber security status report 2017 has de- teriorated, also influence the state of cyber security.   8. the explosion of cyber incidents that is indi- cated in the annual reports of the ncsc, ssD and siD  is proof that every cyber security entity must deter- mine the amount of time, money and other resourc- es to allot to the protection of their  communica- tion and information systems and provided services.  cyber security entities perform security risk assess- ments, but  they are often of formal nature only and  are conducted so as to comply with legal require- ments or internationally recognised standards.   the Risk Analysis Manual published by the  Ministry of the interior of the republic of lithuania  12 years ago reflects the progress in risk assessment  in the light of current conditions of research and in- novation, but the security risk assessment method- ology has changed over time and the understanding  of risk assessment performance has transformed  from the assurance of control environment to the  holistic approach of risk assessment of organisa- tions’ activities.   9. individual security risk  assessment pro- cesses have already reached maturity level  in lithu- ania, however, on the national level, the security risk     8 N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R  S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  assessment culture and cyber security risk assess- ment processes are still fragmentary. cyber security  threats and security gaps  have not been adequately  analysed and holistically integrated into the process  of risk assessment. furthermore, rapid ict develop- ment presents a challenge to ensuring that cyber se- curity professionals have adequate knowledge, skills  and practice.  10. in order to enhance the culture of effective  cyber security policy making  and implementation  and to improve cyber security risk assessment and  other requirements, the following changes occurred  in 2018:  10.1. the provisions of the law on cyber secu- rity were recast to improve  organisation, manage- ment and control of the cyber security system; the   competence, functions, rights and duties of state in- stitutions responsible for cyber security policy mak- ing and implementation were specified; the duties  and responsibilities of cyber security entities were  defined in more detail, and  additional cyber secu- rity assurance measures were established.  10.2. regulatory functions of state information  resources security, activities of public communica- tions networks, public digital communication ser- vices and digital information hosting service pro- viders were consolidated which enabled systematic  cyberspace monitoring, and management of cyber  incidents occurring in communication and informa- tion systems of cyber security entities. the ncsc is  the only agency in lithuania that organises cyber  incident management and assists other state insti- tutions, businesses and residents on the  one stop  shop principle.   11. consolidation of capabilities aims at devel- oping an integral cyber security management sys- tem in lithuania to represent a systematic approach  to the security management planning in any field,  encouraging cyber security entities to focus on se- curity management quality, reducing administrative  burden falling on cyber security entities, ensuring  systematic assessment and evidence-based security  management culture, and facilitating optimisation  of security expenditure planning. consolidation of  capabilities also aims at ensuring  sustainable de- velopment of cyber security competences and en- hancement of regional cyber security capabilities.  12. the Ministry of national Defence of the re- public of lithuania and the ncsc continuously co- operate with cyber security entities, consult them on   cyber security issues, and organise cyber security  exercises.   in 2017, the national cyber security exercise Cy- ber Security 2017 had around 200 participants from  over 50 organisations of private and public sector.  in cooperation with the communications regulatory  authority of the republic of lithuania, the lithuani- an police and the state Data protection inspectorate,  workshops for representatives of cyber security en- tities were organised. participants were familiarised  with the requirements of legal acts related to cyber  security and had training on management and coun- teraction to cyber incidents against critical commu- nication and information systems.  the Ministry of national Defence will con- tinue to organise national cyber security exercises  on a regular basis and will promote continuous im- provement of the  cyber security skills not only in  the national but international cyber security exer- cises as well.   13. the european union (eu) and the north  atlantic treaty organisation (nato) acknowledge  that cyberspace has been increasingly used as a  separate military space or as a tool of hybrid war- fare. cyber tools may be used to sabotage activities  of a country’s critical information infrastructure   (e.g., the cyber-attack which took place in one of  iran’s nuclear energy objects in 2010), might ad- versely affect national and public security (e.g., the  cyber-attacks on ukraine’s power plants in 2015  and 2016), economy and social welfare. for this rea- son, protecting the national cyberspace is a matter  of national security for every country.   in accordance with the decision adopted dur- ing the nato Warsaw summit 2016 where  cyber  space was recognised as the fifth domain of war- fare the lithuanian armed forces have become the  main cyberspace defence entity for the republic of  lithuania. the strengthening of cyber defence in  order to prevent military cyber threats and effec- tively manage cyber incidents is a prerequisite for  ensuring  vital and primary interests of national se- curity. To fulfil the objectives set for the Lithuanian  armed forces, national cyber defence capabilities  will be developed by ensuring interaction between  the lithuanian armed forces and the country’s civil  capabilities, also capabilities of the lithuanian  armed forces to ensure reliable deterrence of ag- gressors in cyber space. in case of failure to ensure  effective deterrence, the lithuanian armed forces  would defend the republic of lithuania by using  military  cyber security measures acting autono- mously  and in cooperation with allies.    N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R  S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y 9    14.1. The first objective   of the first target is to develop  a systematic approach to  cyber security and preventive  activities.  this objective will be accomplished by improving the meth- ods of cyber security risk identification, evaluation and fore- cast; by building up a picture of cyber security identification   and a risk map to reveal the risks  typically encountered in  particular sectors; by establishing regional cyber security  centre and state-controlled electronic communications net- work with a set of cyber security measures, linking state and  municipal institutions, agencies and state companies, which  perform state mobilisation tasks for ensuring vital state  functions; by carrying out surveys on cyber security state,  progress reports or maturity assessments;  by implementing  other measures and actions in order to enhance cyber secu- rity level and preventive activities.       14.2. The second objective  of the first target is to impro- ve the efficiency of the cyber  security policy making and  implementation by reducing  administrative burden falling  on cyber security entities.  this objective will be implemented by improving legal frame- work in the field of cyber security; by preparing standard- ised but differentiated cyber security requirements; by ana- lysing best practice, standards applicable to ensuring cyber  security; by encouraging cyber security entities to follow  such standards; by establishing a national integrated crisis  management mechanism to ensure cooperation among con- cerned parties at all levels; by updating the cyber security  risk assessment system; by assessing the methodological  possibilities to  monitor and control the funds which are nec- essary to ensure cyber security while establishing priorities  for the funds’ allocation and  use; by implementing any other  measures of cyber security policy making and implementa- tion.       14.3. The third objective   of the first target is to promote  national cyber security exercises   and participation in internatio- nal exercises.  this objective will be implemented by periodically organi- sing  complex national cyber security exercises and partici- pating in international cyber security exercises organised by   the eu, nato and other countries; by incorporating lessons  learned from national and international exercises into ma- nagement of situations, incident assessment, information  communication and other activities.        14.4. The fourth objective   of the first target is to develop  cyber defence capabilities   of the country.  this objective will be achieved by ensuring effective inte- raction between the lithuanian armed forces and civilian  cyber defence capabilities; by developing cyber defence  capabilities; and by providing assistance to other state and  municipal institutions and agencies.  14.

The second target of the Strategy is to   ensure the prevention and investigation of cyber- crimes.  16. cybercrimes have a negative impact on the  global economy. according to research2, global dam- age caused by cybercrimes amounts to hundred bil- lions euros a year  and has been increasing. persons  committing cybercrimes are interested not only in  financial details, but also in data, in general. For this  reason, the number of crimes that undermine elec- tronic data and information system security speci- fied in Chapter XXX of the Criminal Code of the Re- public of lithuania has also been steadily growing.  according to the data of the institutional register  of crimes, in 2017, 594 cybercrimes  were recorded;  in 2016, 336 offences were recorded. as  the euro- pean cybercrime centre (ec3) operating within the  European Police Office (hereinafter referred to as the  “ec3”) states, cybercrimes are most often encoun-  tered by those european union Member states that  have a well-developed broadband infrastructure  and well-functioning online payment systems.3  17. referring to the data of a survey conducted  by pwc in 2018 (Global Economic Crime Survey 2018),  in 2018, fraud crimes committed in cyberspace were  among the most common crimes which caused the  most damage to private sector entities. ec3 fore- casts that the rapid development of ict and meth- ods of social engineering, among other reasons, will  increase the number of cybercrimes. Moreover, cy- bercrimes which do not necessarily involve the use  of ict, for instance, fraud or extortion, are “going  digital“. in order to commit cybercrimes or to con- ceal their traces, the latest ict solutions, cryptocur- rencies and services offered in anonymous networks  are used.   18. the company cybersecurity Ventures cal- culated in 2017 that the financial damages caused  by cybercrimes using malware have been increasing  each year. additionally, they forecast that by the end  of the year 2019, the world would suffer  the damage  of more than usD 11 billion due to the spread of ran- somware. ec3 predicts that this trend will continue  due to the increase of  the internet of things (iot)  devices. although malware is only one type of cyber- crimes, the european union agency for network and     N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R  S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y 11  4 According to the data of the Lithuanian national  criminal records register, in 2016, 123 crimes were regis- tered as per definition provided in Article 309(2) of the  Criminal Code, in 2017 – 132.  5 European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Co- operation (Europol) (2017). Europol Review 2016–2017.     information security (enisa) in its threat landscape  report 2017 which was published in 2018 indicated  that malware is the most frequent cyber threat that  has prevailed in recent years.   19. crimes related to the sexual exploitation of  children in cyberspace are considered to be the most  harmful and injurious cybercrimes,  the spread of  which is prompted by rapidly developing ict and its  potential. according to the lithuanian national crim- inal records register and the europol, such crimes   have been increasing and spreading in lithuania4  and in europe.5 in seeking to prevent crimes related  to the sexual exploitation of children, lithuania has  transposed Directive 2011/92/eu of the european  Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011  on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploi- tation of children and child pornography, which re- placed council framework Decision 2004/68/Jha (oJ  2011 l 335, p. 1) into national legislation and on 6 no- vember 2012 ratified the Council of Europe Conven- tion on the protection of children against sexual ex- ploitation and sexual abuse dated 25 october 2007.  20. in order to combat international cyber- crimes, it is important to develop close cross-border  cooperation and exchange of information, to main- tain and deepen agreements and membership- based relationships. to this end, it is necessary to  have the strong political will to effectively fulfil inter- national obligations and comply with international  standards to ensure cyber security and combat cy- bercrimes. to express a clear political will, lithuania  ratified the convention on cybercrime of the council  of europe of 23 november 2011 (hereinafter referred  to as the “budapest convention”) and its additional   protocols. in addition, lithuania transposed Direc- tive 2013/40/eu of the european parliament and of  the Council of 12 August 2013 on attacks against in- formation systems, replacing council framework De- cision 2005/222/Jha (oJ 2013 l 218, p. 8) into national  legislation. Obligations are successfully fulfilled  on both legal and practical levels by cooperating  with the international criminal police organisation  (hereinafter referred to as the “interpol”) and the  interpol Global complex for innovation (iGci), the  europol and ec3 and the european union’s Judicial  cooperation unit (eurojust). Moreover, lithuania has  taken part in the activities of continuously operat- ing contact points of the network specialising in the  field of cybercrime investigation which was founded  on the basis of the european Judicial network (eJn)  and in accordance with the budapest convention.  21. since cybercrimes continue to evolve,  personnel of law enforcement authorities must be  equipped with necessary skills  to perform their al- located tasks. the appropriate competences of em- ployees and their superior officers of the prosecu- tion authorities and the courts must be taken into  account as well. in relation to the investigation of  cybercrimes, the competence of law enforcement  authorities is crucial in order to detect, capture and  investigate electronic evidence.    22.1. The first objective   of the second target is to de- velop capabilities and capacities  of the country for combating  cybercrimes.   this objective will be attained by improving the legal frame- work, by further strengthening the professional capacity of  law enforcement authorities, by creating information and/ or analysis  systems, putting in practice  advanced opera- tional methods, procedures and technical tools specifically  designed to combat cybercrimes.       22.2. The second objective   of the second target is to  strengthen the prevention and  control of cybercrimes.  this objective will be implemented by promoting the so- ciety’s culture of self-protection and responsible behaviour  in cyberspace; by increasing the operational effectiveness  of law enforcement authorities  and ensuring effective in- ternational cooperation while investigating cybercrimes; by  developing effective cooperation between law enforcement  authorities and academia, private and public sector repre- sentatives and society.   22.

IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Index 2018  (2018).   7 National Cyber Security Centre under the Ministry  of National Defence (2018). National Cyber Security Status  Report 2017.   23. The third target of the Strategy is to pro- mote cybersecurity culture and innovation.  24. it is impossible to avoid cyber incidents in  the modern-day world, even if all existing cyber se- curity measures are to be applied. for this reason,  public and private sector representatives must im- prove cybersecurity culture of their employees. ac- cording to ibM report published in 20176, the number  of cyber incidents caused due to employee negli- gence has been growing (in 2017, the number of such  cyber incidents constituted more than 20%, in 2016 –  15%). More than 30% of these cyber incidents hap- pened because employees opened malicious links  or documents sent to them via email. in lithuania,  the number of emails created using social engineer- ing methods has also been rising.7   25. according to the european innovation  scoreboard dated 2018, private sector representa- tives in europe have been increasing their focus on  ict training of their employees. While europe as a  whole has an average index of 21%, in lithuania it is  slightly greater than 10%. civil servants in lithuania  are given opportunities to improve their skills in the  field of cyber security and the number of civil serv-  Cyber Security Culture  and Innovation  ants who have taken cybersecurity courses is grow- ing annually. according to civil service Department,  there were 146 such civil servants in 2015, 249 – in  2015 and 289 – in 2017. routine and regularly up- dated training courses for private and public sector  employees would increase employees’ duty of care  as well as the overall cybersecurity culture.   26. Efficient and regular dissemination of in- formation on the latest cyber incidents and other  factors that may cause personal data breach or pose  a risk of becoming a victim of cybercrime is a key  measure for strengthening cybersecurity culture  of the lithuanian people. according to the special  eurobarometer survey 464a which reveals europe- ans’ attitude towards cybersecurity, only 16% of the  internet users in lithuania believe that the risk of  becoming a victim of a cybercrime has not been in- creasing (the european union average is 11%). nev- ertheless, as 49% of the internet users in lithuania     N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R  S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y 13  8 ISACA.

Quality public edu- cation which  corresponds with the needs of labour  market is a tool that can contribute to professional  competence. presently, cyber security programmes  are offered by four universities in lithuania; yet ac- cording to the results of the survey titled “the ict  specialists in lithuania: situation in the labour Mar- ket and employers’ needs” that was carried out by  the association infobalt and the public institution  invest lithuania, current labour market needs are  not met. in order to reduce the gap between sup- ply and demand of cybersecurity specialists, the  existing cybersecurity study programmes must be  improved  and new study programmes shall be es- tablished.  to boost cybersecurity culture, children and  pupils should be provided with the fundamental  knowledge of cybersecurity under nursery,   pre- school, primary and/or secondary education pro- grammes  since ict is used to ensure educational  and learning processes.  in the context of implementing programme  of the Government of the republic of lithuania on  reorganisation of the system of teachers’ up-skilling  and training, efforts should be made to improve  teachers’ qualifications in the area of cybersecurity.  having the opportunity and ability to expand and  deepen their cybersecurity knowledge, teachers of  different educational areas would not only be able  to educate young people better, but would contrib- ute to the development of  knowledge and innova- tion based  society and further cybersecurity aware- ness raising as well.   28. Many cybersecurity experts9 estimate that  by the year 2019, there will be at least 1.5 million  employment vacancies worldwide for cybersecurity  professionals. the study “ict specialists in lithu- ania: situation in the labour Market and employers’  needs”, conducted by the association infobalt and   public organisation invest lithuania in 2018, revealed  that while there are 22,600 ict specialists in lithu- ania, about 13,300 more would be needed within the  following three years. regrettably, researchers pro- vided no details about this shortage of cybersecurity  specialists in lithuania, but it may be assumed that  they are in high demand. to address this shortage,  cybersecurity skills that cybersecurity specialists are  expected to have in Lithuania  first must be identi- fied because the demand for cybersecurity profes- sionals may vary in different countries and problems  related to the lack of cybersecurity skills may differ  according to the conclusions of studies carried out  in other countries10.   29. With regard to rapid development of cyber- space, various opportunities for innovation, which,  in turn, drives economic and productivity growth,  have emerged. this prompts the creation of new and  better jobs, increases social mobility and responds  to social and security challenges globally.  lithuania joined the european union a rela- tively short time ago, for this reason, there is neither  long tradition of cybersecurity scientific research  nor education, whereas they are present in other eu  Member states. the european union has provided  lithuania with a great opportunity to promote in- vestment in scientific research through the general  research and innovation programme horizon 2020  (2014–2020). through this programme, lithuania may  contribute to the development of the digital econ- omy and defence policy on both the national and  the eu level. however, all efforts of the state in this  direction must be focused on support measures that  promote international networking in finding poten- tial employees and partners. this would stimulate  private sector investment in the r&D and innova- tion areas, new technologies, tools and services and  in the cyber security area as well. the designing of  innovative cyber security products would not only  provide additional support and leverage for the  competitiveness of the lithuanian industry, but it  is a key factor in responding to modern cyber inci- dents. it is also important to encourage lithuania’s  academics  to participate in  joint international aca- demic publications  in the field of cyber security, to  attract as many students as possible to high-level  r&D  projects that focus on cyber security, to pro- mote public-private partnership and academia co- operation and to increase the number of foreign  doctoral students in the area of cyber security.  30. according to the data from the european  innovation scoreboard 2018, in comparison with  other eu Member states, lithuania is a moderate in- novator but it has advanced considerably in terms  of innovation and improvement of the ecosystem of  innovation.11 in the european union, the private sec-    14 N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R  S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y    32.1. The first objective   of the third target is to develop  scientific research and acti- vities that create high added   value in the area of cyber  security.  this objective will be implemented by creating favourable con- ditions for the creation of new, advanced cybersecurity ini- tiatives; by promoting growth of the cybersecurity market, by  expanding  export of cybersecurity services to foreign markets;  by developing cyber security sector of financial technology and  by conducting research.         32.2. The second objecti- ve of the third target is to  develop creativity, advanced  capabilities and cyber secu- rity skills and competence  that meet market needs.  this objective will be implemented by creating a cybersecurity  competence model; by establishing cybersecurity competence  standards; by developing systems of training, accreditation and  certification oriented towards the needs of the labour market;  by attracting, nurturing and retaining talent; by creating trai- ning and testing environments for cybersecurity; by teaching  newcomers and providing retraining opportunities for ict wor- kers; and by training employees working with  sensitive data.       32.3. The third objective   of the third target is to  promote public, private, and  academic partnerships while  creating innovation in cyberse- curity field.  this objective will be implemented by identifying the common  needs of the private and public sectors and their importance in  relation to scientific cybersecurity research; by creating techni- cal measures, methods and other resources; and by developing  the requisite expertise for solving cybersecurity problems or  fulfilling any other specific tasks for cybersecurity.  32. Objectives for achieving the third target of the Strategy:  11 European Commission. 2018. The European Innova- tion Scoreboard (2018).  tor still allocates insufficient resources  to innova- tion compared to its rivals beyond european union  borders. no reliable measurements of the cyber se- curity market have yet been carried out in lithuania,  but it is acknowledged that this market has been  growing and, for this reason, innovation would help  strengthen lithuania’s competitive position in the  development of new innovative products and ser- vices. this synergy could be attained by combining  initiatives of innovation and general national  poli- cies while promoting long-term science, technology  and innovation development.  31. lithuania’s regulatory and supervisory en- vironment is favourable to financial services and  promotes innovation in the finance sector. Pursuant  to the data of lithuania fintech report 2017, there  were 117 financial technology enterprises operating  in Lithuania in 2017. The development of financial  technology is one of the strategic activity directions  for the bank of lithuania and its activity in one of  the most promising and prospective areas of finan- cial technology innovation, blockchain technology,  will further drive innovation in financial technology  field.

The fourth target of the Strategy is to pro- mote close ppp.  34. in modern states, in which the broadband  infrastructures are well developed, public sec- tor representatives as well as managers of critical  information infrastructures who are often private  sector representatives, are not always able to com- bat cyber incidents independently. thus coopera- tion between public and private sectors becomes  inevitable in order to ensure comprehensive cyber- security. The PPP success factor is a fully-fledged  partnership, which entails trust and mutual ben- efit. Thus public and private sectors should strive  to work together to this end.  35. the cyber security council set up follow- ing the approval of resolution no. 422 of the Gov- ernment of the republic of lithuania of 23 april  2015 “on the approval of establishment of a cyber  security council and its rules of procedure” is an  example of ppp on a political level. all efforts must  be made to effectively enjoy the rights of a cyber   Security Council that are defined in the Law on Cy- ber security.  36. to ensure ppp, the cyber security infor- mation network (hereinafter referred to as the  “network”) is used. the aim of the network is infor- mation sharing, exchange of cybersecurity recom- mendations, instructions, and technical solutions,  and other measures which could help ensure cy- bersecurity of the network members. it is neces- sary to integrate appropriate measures in the net- work for more effective and trusted cooperation  among the network members.   37. the advantages of ict are beyond ques- tion in the 21st century, but the issue of how to  effectively address vulnerabilities in ict systems  arises. security vulnerabilities may be detected by  the persons who may have different goals; how- ever, in order to develop a responsible disclosure  approach, it is important to give a particular op- portunity to a person, who has been able to iden- tify a vulnerability and wants to contribute to secu- rity of ict systems, to cooperate with cybersecurity     N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R  S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y 17    38.1. The first objective   of the fourth target is to   improve coordination of ppp.  this objective will be implemented by creating a sustainable  PPP model in the field of cyber security; by identifying respon- sibilities and capabilities related to cybersecurity; by improv- ing  effective exchange of relevant information about cyber  threats, cyber incidents and lessons learned; by supporting an  early warning system; and by creating new or improving the  existing communication techniques and processes.       38.2. The second objective  of the fourth target is   to increase cybersecu- rity maturity  of small and  medium-sized enterprises  (hereinafter sMes).  this objective will be implemented by encouraging sMes to  verify their cybersecurity state and address cybersecurity gaps.       38.3. The third objective   of the fourth target is to   develop a responsible vulner- ability disclosure  practice.   this objective will be implemented by establishing operational  principles, methods, technical capabilities or  other measures  designed for this purpose.  38. Objectives for the attainment of the fourth target of the Strategy:  entities whose security vulnerability was disclosed.  establishment and public announcement of a  formalised procedure for responsible disclosure  would contribute to the protection of cybersecu- rity entities from possible damage caused by cy-  ber incidents or could considerably diminish such  damage. this would also enhance cybersecurity of  the country  and would give more opportunities for  ppp.    18 N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R  S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  International   Cooperation    42.1. The first objective   of the fifth target is to develop  international, cross-border   cooperation, including coopera- tion with the countries   of the Baltic region in the field  of cyber security.  This objective will be fulfilled by participating in the activities   of the european union, nato, the united nations, the organisa- tion for security and co-operation in europe (osce), organisa- tions of the baltic region and other international organisations.     ©  iS  to ck  42. Objectives for the fulfilment of the fifth target of the Strategy:  39. The fifth target of the Strategy is to en- hance international cooperation and ensure the  fulfilment of international obligations in the field  of cybersecurity.   40. lithuania’s national security and the pros- perity of the lithuanian society depend directly on  stable, easily and freely accessible and secure cy- berspace. considering the fact that modern cyber  threats and risks can easily cross national borders,  lithuania will seek to strengthen its national cyber- security by actively cooperating with bilateral and  multilateral partners and by participating in inter- national forums designed for resolving problems re- lated to cybersecurity and internet governance.   41. lithuania is eager to become an active  partner in the international community which  seeks   to resolve cyber security and internet governance  problems. lithuania is active in building cooperation  with partners and allies by signing an international  agreement for legal regulation of cyberspace which  shall comply with the provisions of international  law, standards and principles that apply to activities  in cyberspace in relation to protection of the open  internet principle as well as other principles on fun- damental freedoms and human rights.    lithuania advocates more close and harmoni- ous cooperation with nato and the european union  in the cybersecurity field with the aim of avoiding  overlap of functions and activities. lithuania shall  also strengthen bilateral political and technical co- operation with other countries which adhere to the  principles of democracy, especially, with the united  states of america.

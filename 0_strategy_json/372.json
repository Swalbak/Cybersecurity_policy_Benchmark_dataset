Improvements in telecommunications infrastructure in Malawi has contributed to the ever increasing over-all adoption of ICTs thereby contributing to an emerging digitally enabled society. Furthermore, the Malawi Government recognizes the significance of ICT to achieving inclusive and sustainable growth and development. It is against this background that the Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS) identifies ICT as one of its key pillars among the priority sectors for economic growth. In addition, Government has put in place further instruments such as National ICT Policy (2013), National ICT Masterplan (2014), The Electronic and Cybersecurity Act (2016) to enable inclusive growth of the sector. The recent deployment of a nationwide fiber-optic network infrastructure further underscores the commitment that the Government has to ensure interconnectivity. Such developments provide a plethora of opportunities to the once “unserved peripheral communities” to join the bandwagon of the digital world and effectively take part in the global ICT revolution. The public and private sectors have embraced technology at the center of their business leveraging improved availability of higher capacities of bandwidth and better ICT innovations. Innovations in ICT contribute to efficient service provisioning, enable e-commerce and enhanced collaboration to curb geographical barriers in knowledge transfer and sharing of ideas. However, a number of risks and threats exist or have emerged in the cyber space. The threats range from mere real time hacking of systems, phishing, mobile money fraud, organised online human trafficking, child pornography, bullying among other threats perpetrated over the internet. These restrict the smooth operation and resilience of ICT systems, and consequently the socio- economic development of the nation. The Government is committed to keep the nation safe from cyber threats. I therefore call upon all stakeholders in the sector to join hands in the implementation of this Strategy. Hon. Gospel Kazako MINISTER OF INFORMATION ii PREFACE This National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2019 – 2024 aims to provide a national framework for ensuring secure, safe and resilient cyberspace, as well as fostering trust and confidence in cyberspace by Malawians. This has been achieved by describing the high level Strategic Goals and Specific Objectives that provide the basis of the nation’s direction with respect to cybersecurity, and establishes the Actions that need to be taken for each. It is a bold and ambitious approach to tackling the many threats our country faces in cyberspace. The Government recognizes its special responsibility to lead the national efforts in managing and mitigating cyber threats. The Strategy defines Malawi’s cybersecurity vision, key objectives, and ongoing commitment to support national priorities by encouraging ICT growth while aggressively protecting critical information infrastructures.

Malawi has seen the growth of access and usage of ICT services, including an increasing number of online transactions for services. The increasing demand for the ICT applications and services coupled with the provision of high-capacity fibre backbone connectivity across the nation has resulted in the creation of substantial opportunities for further growth in the ICT sector. It is also expected that these developments will drive significant socio-economic growth in Malawi. Consequently, and in an effort to create a conducive environment for the sustained growth and use of ICTs in Malawi, as well as address the threats that come with increased adoption of ICTs, the Government of Malawi undertook a review of existing legislation and developed the Communications Act (2016) and the Electronic Transactions & Cyber Security Act (2016). ICT has become a critical driver for socio-economic development, with the deployment and adoption of ICTs across the nation resulting in noteworthy improvements in all aspects of lives and institutional operations in the nation. However, a number of risks and threats exist or have emerged that restrict the smooth operation and resilience of ICT systems, and consequently the socio-economic development of the nation. This Strategy aims to provide a national framework for ensuring secure, safe and resilient cyberspace, as well as fostering trust and confidence in cyberspace by Malawians, by describing the high level strategic goals and specific objectives that provide the basis of the nation’s direction with respect to cybersecurity, and establishes actions that need to be taken. Chapter 1 of the Strategy provides an introduction to cybersecurity in Malawi while chapter 2 details the guiding principles upon which the Strategy is built on, and which will underpin the implementation of the Strategy. Chapter 3 outlines the core components of the National Strategy including the vision mission statement, high-level strategic goals and specific objectives. It further describes the various actions necessary for achieving the Specific objectives and strategic goals of the strategy. Chapter 4 describes the roles and responsibilities of the key stakeholders in the implementation of the strategy and further proposes an approach for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the strategy. The implementation logical frameworks for the strategy which provide details on Deliverables, Key Performance Indicators (KPI), Timeframes, Lead Organisations and Funding options are described in the Appendix. This Strategy therefore outlines the Government of Malawi’s approach to ensuring a safe and secure cyberspace that can be fully leveraged by citizens and institutions. Consequently, driving further growth of the ICT sector, as well as socio-economic development across Malawi. vii 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1. Background Major reforms in the ICT Sector of Malawi go as far back as the 1990s with the advent of sector liberalisation through the separation and commercialisation of the then incumbent Telecommunications operator, Malawi Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (MPTC) into the Malawi Telecommunications Limited (MTL) and Malawi Posts Corporation (MPC). Subsequent major reforms include the implementation of the Communications Sector Policy (1998) and the Communications Act (1998) that led to the establishment of the Malawi Communications Regulatory Authority (MACRA). Due to advances in technology over the years, the Communications Act (1998) was reviewed in 2016 and also the Electronic Transactions and Cyber Security Act (2016) were enacted. These are the two current legislations for the sector. Currently, the mobile penetration rate in Malawi is quite low in comparison to the average African penetration rates, highlighting the tremendous potential for further growth in Malawi. Currently, the mobile penetration rate is at 45 percent compared to the African region average of 77.8 percent. The broadband access prices in Malawi are among the highest in the region due to high cost and limited availability of international bandwidth. However, the internet sector has about 50 licensed ISPs out of which only 20% are active. The mobile penetration and broadband are expected to grow exponentially over the next couple of years. Since, the current mobile market in Malawi is a duopoly, the Government of Malawi has introduced a converged licensing regime in an effort to encourage further market competition and growth. It is expected that the converged licensing regimes will introduce new entrants into the sector and enhance competition resulting in lower prices. In addition, service providers in Malawi have launched 3G services, invested in LTE infrastructure or continued to extend their WIMAX wireless broadband networks. Furthermore, Malawi gained access to international submarine cables recently following the completion of a transit link via neighbouring countries and is currently deploying a national fibre backbone. As a result of these recent developments within the sector, as well as the high potential for further rapid proliferation of ICTs within Malawi, it is evident that Malawians will increasingly get connected to the Internet and use ICTs overtime. This increased connectivity and use of ICT’s come with increased threats to activities of businesses and people in Malawi. If Malawi is to fully leverage ICTs to spur socio-economic development of the nation, it has to be ready and capable of addressing these threats. 1 NCS 2019-2024 sets out a multi-stakeholder framework for ensuring Malawians can access and use cyberspace with trust and confidence, and ensuring the nation responds to threats to ICT systems and services in a coherent and effective manner. 1.2. Situational Analysis 1.2.1. National Development and the Role of ICT The Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS III) recognizes how critical a well-developed ICT system is in the development of Malawi. Currently, ICT contributes about 5 percent to the country’s GDP while the sector’s growth rate is at 6.4 percent. The telecom sector accounts for 95 percent of the ICT sector employment and revenue. The Government embarked on implementing a number of strategies resulting in a number of desired outcomes including improved ICT broadband infrastructure; increased access and usage to ICT services; improved postal and broadcasting services; improved ICT governance; and enhanced ICT capacity for the general public. This is consistent with the Government’s current overarching Policy Goal for ICTs in Malawi, as described within the National ICT Policy (2013) which is “to contribute to socio-economic development through maximum integration of ICT in all sectors and the provision of ICT services to the rural areas”. The development of the MGDS follows a phased approach to address the ICT development needs of the country in support of the prevailing policies and the legal framework. The MGDS was developed to be the overarching operational medium-term strategy for Malawi in the attainment of its set vision. The main thrust of the MGDS is to create wealth through sustainable economic growth and infrastructure development as a means of achieving poverty reduction. The MGDS I was developed to lay the framework while MGDS II was tasked with putting in place the operational mechanism. The NCS therefore builds on initiatives implemented in MGDS II as well as feed into MGDS III thereby addressing Government goals of universal ICT access within a safe and secure operational environment. This policy direction is quite consistent with global research studies and evidence that clearly demonstrates the connection between ICT adoption and usage of ICT services with national GDP growth. In fact, the World Bank has demonstrated the greater development impact of broadband specifically on emerging economies as compared to high-income countries. Currently, Malawi’s broadband penetration has risen from 6% in 2013 to around 17.1% in 2016, which is relatively low compared to other Southern African 2 Development Community (SADC) countries and the rest of the world. However, with the rapid development of the ICT sector, the Government of Malawi through the MGDS III, recognizes the potential broadband growth which puts the users of ICT services at a cyber risk. Thus, the Government of Malawi needs to be prepared and deploy effective strategies or measures to create a conducive environment that builds trust and confidence in the use of ICTs by Malawian businesses and citizens. 1.2.2. Cybersecurity in Malawi Understanding the current cybersecurity-related activities of Malawi is critical to ensuring the effective cooperation between Malawi’s stakeholders and their cybersecurity-related mandates and activities. Therefore, this Strategy considers the various functions and activities of the different stakeholders in Malawi relating to cybersecurity. Noteworthy cybersecurity-related activities undertaken in Malawi over the past year include the recent approval of the Electronic Transactions and Cyber Security Act (2016) and the development of this National Cybersecurity Strategy. The recently promulgated Electronic Transactions and Cyber ecurity Act (2016) address a number of ICT security issues like cybercrime, data protection, and privacy among others. For instance, the Electronic-Transactions and Cybersecurity Act (2016) will enable citizens to undertake various electronic transactions with the full protection of the law, as well as ensure citizens are protected from computer related harms like cybercrimes, viruses and hacks. Part 6 of the Electronic-Transactions and Cyber Security Act (2016) provides details of offences; Clause 87, for instance, addresses events where an individual knowingly introduces or spreads a software code that damages computer, computer system or network. Other issues addressed in the Act include cryptography, Country Code Top Level Domain (ccTLD), the establishment of the Malawi National CERT and the appointment of cyber inspectors. However, efforts to address challenges within the cyberspace in Malawi were fragmented due to the absence of a coordinated strategic approach by all key stakeholders. This Strategy will therefore provide a link among all these stakeholders to provide effective solutions to the identified challenges. The NCS as an overarching strategy provides a platform for: the Ministry of Justice to deal with the legal issues related to the cyberspace in conjunction with all law enforcement agencies; the regulatory authorities to review the effectiveness of the legal and regulatory framework; and the academia to review the curricula and offer training suited to the trends in addressing challenges in the cyberspace. The extent of cybersecurity issues entails generic actions to specific sectors that eventually feeds into the national strategy. For instance the banking sector has embarked on sector 3 specific training to address the needs of the banks, likewise the academia has also incorporated various courses for cybersecurity in order to enhance the level of knowledge and awareness for cybersecurity. 1.2.3. Cybercrime in Malawi The high levels of ICT access and usage in the country coupled with the absence of specific legislation dealing with cybersecurity issues in Malawi is a big challenge in the fight against common forms of cybercrime. The Government’s position on cybercrime, like other nations across the world, continues to be a real threat and facet of life in Malawi. Cyber criminals continue to commit cybercrimes of larger scales and sophistication across various countries. Many of these cyber criminals seek to make use of confidential and sensitive information and usually have detrimental effects on individuals, businesses and Government institutions. Consistent with global trends, a major sector targeted by cyber criminals in Malawi is the financial sector. Other notable cybercrime incidents that have been observed in the country include and not limited to child pornography, sexual harassment, fraud, forgery, crime recorded, mobile money fraud, Government Websites defacement, identity theft, email scams, distribution of compromising images, attacks on computer data and systems. In the National ICT Policy (2013), the Government set out to establish sufficient national capacity to deal with national security, the violation of human rights, and the undesirable impacts of ICTs. Furthermore, the enactment of the Electronic Transactions & Cyber Security Act (2016) has provided a platform to harness all the efforts that were being hampered by lack of appropriate legislation. Malawi is also benefiting from regional initiatives and harmonization of strategies to provide a model standard for the region. Therefore, it is critical that Malawi develops a Strategy that protects its citizens and institutions from these cyber criminals and enhances the nation’s ability to detect, prosecute and prevent cybercrimes. 1.2.4. Linkages with other National Policies and Programmes The National Cybersecurity Strategy is aligned with and will complement the following key strategic documents: ● The National ICT Policy (2013) - The policy recognizes that Malawi needs to establish adequate capacity to deal with undesirable impacts of ICTs including the violation of privacy, spread of undesirable materials, cyber-crimes, digital frauds and terrorism. 4 ● The National ICT Master Plan (2014 – 2031) - this is to operationalize the National ICT Policy. ● Electronic Transaction and Cybersecurity Act (2016) - This makes provision for criminalizing offences related to computer systems and information communication technologies. ● The Payment Systems Act (2016) - This act provides for the regulation, management and supervision of payment systems and electronic money transfer in Malawi. ● Malawi Growth and Development Strategy III (2017 -2022) – This highlights the need to have developed ICT infrastructure and improved e-governance a system that is conducive to business operations; and enacting appropriate legislation that promotes interest of new entrants in ICT sector. ● Vision 2020 - Vision 2020 has acknowledged in its mission statement of Malawi being a technologically driven middle-income economy and has highlighted the need for improved communications infrastructure promoting the effective use of information technology as a tool to facilitate better management and access to information resources ● Communications Act (2016) - This provides for the regulation of the provision of services in the electronic communications sector, posts, information society. ● Science and Technology Policy (2002) – This aims at attaining sustainable socio- economic development through the development and application of science and technology in order to improve the standard and quality of life of Malawians. 2. METHODOLOGY The development of the Cybersecurity Strategy was highly participatory and consultative to ensure full ownership of the outputs. All key critical information infrastructure stakeholders in terms of their interest, power and influence were identified in order to involve them in the development of the Strategy. The consultative process included workshops, working groups; and steering committee meetings. 3.

CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS (CSFS) The CMM that was used to assess cybersecurity posture of Malawi revealed a number of critical success factors that will lead to successful achievement of cybersecurity goals of Malawi. These factors include: 6.1. Political Will ● Enhancing Malawi’s cybersecurity posture needs to be a top priority for the Government. ● Cybersecurity requires adequate organizational and political support. ● At the national level, cybersecurity has to be driven from the highest office to provide a unified agenda that will guide all relevant national stakeholders. ● At organization level, the success of cybersecurity efforts depend mainly on the commitment and support of top management to get stakeholders support and secure budget for cybersecurity. ● security governance should be led by competent security managers 6.2. Funding and Resources ● The successful implementation of Malawi’s NCS will depend on adequate funds and resources. Considering that ICTs and Cyberspace spur socio-economic growth, the National Cybersecurity Strategy implementation logical frameworks have identified possible lead organization and funding sources for various measures proposed in the NCS. 6.3. Effective coordination of efforts ● Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility among different players with different responsibilities and abilities requiring unified coordination across a wide spectrum of stakeholders. ● Successful implementation of the NCS will therefore, require developing a comprehensive national structure that will facilitate national cohesion at all levels and meaningful participation by all stakeholders, working together toward a common goal of securing Malawi’s cyberspace. 6.4. Awareness, education and training ● The success of cybersecurity depends on availability of the requisite knowledge, awareness, trust to use information systems and reduced exposure to risks. ● It is important to inform, educate and raise awareness of public and private organizations, owners of critical infrastructures and the civil society of their security responsibilities. ● Security awareness among ICT professionals and users can prevent them from becoming easy and soft target for cyber criminals. It is also important for the nation to provide qualified human resources with enhanced technological capabilities of dealing with 24 complex challenges of cybersecurity. 6.5. Collaboration and networking ● The world today is highly linked and interdependent as such cybersecurity requires close cooperation and collaboration among national, regional and international partners, based on mutual trust. ● Effective response to challenges of cyberspace security requires a networked approach among stakeholders in various fields to facilitate information and resource sharing. 6.6. Protection of Critical information infrastructure ● ICT infrastructure supporting critical societal functions must be secure, robust and reliable so that adverse incidents are avoided or mitigated as much as possible. 6.7. Innovation, Research & Development ● Cyber threats continue to evolve in complexity and gravity requiring new solutions and approaches. Research and Development will provide a platform for innovation and creativity to deal with emerging issues in cyberspace. 25 7. MONITORING AND EVALUATION The Monitoring and Evaluation Plan will enable the assessment of the operational issues encountered during the implementation of the strategy, as well as the assessment of the long- term impact and outcomes of the strategy based on periodic reviews. The Monitoring and Evaluation Plan will also provide mechanisms or tools for data collection and reporting, and further information on the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders, and frequency of reports. The implementation of the NCS will require a Monitoring and Evaluation Framework that: ▪ Supports the attainment of the NCS Vision and Strategic Goals; and ▪ Enables accurate reporting on progress and identification of lessons learned and challenges encountered for informed decision making and effective planning. This can be used to elaborate new measures as well as amend and tailor existing initiatives under the strategy. This section of the Strategy details the proposed systematic approach to monitoring and evaluating progress as an integral part in implementing the NCS of Malawi. The monitoring is scheduled to be periodic in order to track the progress of implementation of the NCS. The monitoring will, therefore, focus on periodic and objective assessment of progress towards the attainment of the set objectives. The key objectives of the monitoring and evaluation approach are: ● Establishment of Performance Targets for various Government institutions or relevant stakeholders responsible for implementing specific actions of the NCS. ● Development of performance plans to establish a shared understanding of the expected end results, the approach to achieving these end results and identify the resources necessary to ensure a successful implementation. The plans will be based on the KPIs, Performance Targets and Deadlines provided in the Implementation Logical Framework ● Monitoring and reporting performance and progress in achieving expected end results by identifying and promptly reporting observed or likely deviations. ● Periodically evaluating institutional or individual performance against established performance targets 26 7.1. Monitoring Implementation of this Strategy will be through annual work plans and budgets. The tasks detailed in the NCS implementation plan will form the basis for preparing annual work plans and budgets. In this regard, the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology and all relevant stakeholders will ensure that annual work plans and budgets are prepared within the framework of the Strategy. Activities of this strategy will be continuously monitored and monthly performance reports will be prepared by all implementing agencies and submitted to MoICT. The Ministry will in turn submit to the National Steering Committee quarterly performance reports highlighting the progress made towards the achievement of key performance indicators (KPIs) in general and quarterly targets. Furthermore, quarterly monitoring exercises will be conducted. Lastly, a comprehensive annual progress report will be produced highlighting the progress made towards achievement of the KPIs in general and annual targets. The purpose of periodic reporting is to account for the resources utilized and output/results. 7.2. Joint Annual Reviews The MICECT in conjunction with other stakeholders shall set the Terms of Reference for the Joint Annual Reviews (JARs). The JARs will start at organizational level, sector and national level in order to allow for wider participation and analysis of implementation bottlenecks. Participation at national level will include representatives from all ICT stakeholders, who will discuss policy recommendations from the organizations as well as sector and achieved Annual Implementation Plan milestones. Emphasis will be placed on challenges being experienced in the achievement of the targets and how these can best be addressed. 7.3. Evaluation Performance evaluation is very important as it helps in objective comparison of actual against expected results and the resultant impact. In a changing environment, some of the key assumptions in the strategy may dramatically change and affect implementation of the set outcome targets. It is in the course of evaluation that the effects of such changes will be determined and appropriate corrective action taken. The evaluations, therefore, will assess the relevance of the strategic goals and objectives, efficiency and effectiveness of the strategies, assumptions, the strengths and weaknesses in the implementation of the NCS. 27 A mid-term and full review will be conducted. As such, an independent stakeholder will be commissioned to undertake the mid-term and long- term review of the strategy to determine the short and long-term impact and outcomes of the strategy based on annual reviews, and if necessary effect remedial actions following the mid-term review to keep implementation on track. The mid-term review will be undertaken at the end of 3rd Quarter of Year 3 of the Strategy and the long term review at the end of the 5th year. 28 APPENDIX A - NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION LOGICAL FRAMEWORKS This section presents the key elements necessary to successfully implement the strategy detailed in Chapter 3 and these include: ● Strategic Goal: the substantive long term goal that Malawi would like to achieve in each priority area; ● Specific Objective: the specific steps to be undertaken to achieve the Strategic Goal ● Strategies/Actions: The activities that must be undertaken, under this Strategic Plan, in pursuit of the Specific Objective objectives ● Deliverables/Outputs: The formal work products that Malawi will achieve in the pursuit of the objectives and the implementation of the Strategy ● Lead Implementing Agency and Support: The Malawian Institutions with primary responsibility for managing completion of each objective, and the institutions that will provide support. ● Time Period: Period of time within which deliverables/outputs are produced and/or Strategies/ Actions are implemented. ● Key Performance Indicators: The indices, data measurements, and trends that should be monitored to evaluate the progress in implementing the Strategy and achieving the objectives and deliverables ● Possiible Funding Sources and Mechanisms: An overview of different possible funding sources and mechanisms that can be adopted by Malawi to fund the implementation of the NCS. 29 32 Sp ec ifi c O bj ec tiv es St ra te gi es / Ac tio ns D el iv er ab le s/ O ut pu ts Le ad Im pl em en tin g Ag en cy a nd Su pp or t Ti m e Fr am e Ke y Pe rf or m an ce In di ca to rs Po ss ib le Fu nd in g So ur ce s an d M ec ha ni sm s Fo cu s Ar ea 1 : C ri tic al I nf or m at io n In fr as tr uc tu re St ra te gi c G oa l – 1 : Id en tif y an d m an ag e th e Cr iti ca l I nf or m at io n In fr as tr uc tu re o f M al aw i 4. 5. 1 Sp ec ifi c O bj ec tiv e 1: Id en tif y an d pr ot ec t th e Cr iti ca l In fo rm at io n In fr as tr uc tu re of M al aw i 4. 5. 1. 1.

	"original document": "Government of Malawi  NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY  CONTACT INFORMATION   For more information, please contact:   Secretary for Information, Civic Education and Communications Technology  Central Office of Information  Private Bag 310, Lilongwe 3.  Tel: 01 772 702 Fax: 01 770 650  Email: principal.secretary@information.gov.mw       i    FOREWORD  Information Communications Technology (ICT) has become a critical driver for socio-economic  development, with the deployment and adoption of ICTs across the nation resulting in noteworthy  improvements in all aspects of life and institutional operations in the nation. Improvements in  telecommunications infrastructure in Malawi has contributed to the ever increasing over-all  adoption of ICTs thereby contributing to an emerging digitally enabled society. Furthermore, the  Malawi Government recognizes the significance of ICT to achieving inclusive and sustainable  growth and development. It is against this background that the Malawi Growth and Development  Strategy (MGDS) identifies ICT as one of its key pillars among the priority sectors for economic  growth. In addition, Government has put in place further instruments such as National ICT Policy  (2013), National ICT Masterplan (2014), The Electronic and Cybersecurity Act (2016) to enable  inclusive growth of the sector.  The recent deployment of a nationwide fiber-optic network infrastructure further underscores  the commitment that the Government has to ensure interconnectivity.  Such developments  provide a plethora of opportunities to the once “unserved peripheral communities” to join the  bandwagon of the digital world and effectively take part in the global ICT revolution. The public  and private sectors have embraced technology at the center of their business leveraging improved  availability of higher capacities of bandwidth and better ICT innovations. Innovations in ICT  contribute to efficient service provisioning, enable e-commerce and enhanced collaboration to  curb geographical barriers in knowledge transfer and sharing of ideas.  However, a number of risks and threats exist or have emerged in the cyber space. The threats  range from mere real time hacking of systems, phishing, mobile money fraud, organised online  human trafficking, child pornography, bullying among other threats perpetrated over the internet.  These restrict the smooth operation and resilience of ICT systems, and consequently the socio- economic development of the nation.   The Government is committed to keep the nation safe from cyber threats. I therefore call upon all  stakeholders in the sector to join hands in the implementation of this Strategy.   Hon. Gospel Kazako MINISTER OF INFORMATION  ii    PREFACE  This National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCS) 2019 – 2024 aims to provide a national framework  for ensuring secure, safe and resilient cyberspace, as well as fostering trust and confidence in  cyberspace by Malawians. This has been achieved by describing the high level Strategic Goals and  Specific Objectives that provide the basis of the nation’s direction with respect to cybersecurity,  and establishes the Actions that need to be taken for each. It is a bold and ambitious approach to  tackling the many threats our country faces in cyberspace. The Government recognizes its special  responsibility to lead the national efforts in managing and mitigating cyber threats.   The Strategy defines Malawi’s cybersecurity vision, key objectives, and ongoing commitment  to support national priorities by encouraging ICT growth while aggressively protecting critical  information infrastructures. Government is committed to the safety, security, and prosperity of  our nation and its partners. In order to achieve this, cybersecurity is a key component in providing  organizations and citizens with confidence in online and mobile transactions. Furthermore,  foreign investment will be greatly encouraged and a broader set of trade opportunities within the  global marketplace will be opened. Successful implementation of the Strategy will further enable  Malawi to achieve its economic and societal goals.   The formulation of this Strategy followed a participatory process that involved various  stakeholders, including Government, private sector, the academia, development partners and the  general public. As such, Government will also rely on these partners to implement this Strategy  in the most efficient and effective way possible.  The Government is committed to ensuring that the commitments set out in this Strategy are carried  out and accurately monitored and regular reports are produced. As a Ministry responsible for  ICTs, we are determined to see this Strategy implemented. I, therefore, call upon all stakeholders  to work with Government to achieve the goals that have been set in this Strategy.

Malawi has seen  the growth of access and usage of ICT services, including an increasing number of online  transactions for services. The increasing demand for the ICT applications and services coupled  with the provision of high-capacity fibre backbone connectivity across the nation has resulted in  the creation of substantial opportunities for further growth in the ICT sector. It is also expected  that these developments will drive significant socio-economic growth in Malawi. Consequently,  and in an effort to create a conducive environment for the sustained growth and use of ICTs in  Malawi, as well as address the threats that come with increased adoption of ICTs, the Government  of Malawi undertook a review of existing legislation and developed the   Communications Act  (2016) and the Electronic Transactions & Cyber Security Act (2016).  ICT has become a critical driver for socio-economic development, with the deployment and  adoption of ICTs across the nation resulting in noteworthy improvements in all aspects of lives  and institutional operations in the nation. However, a number of risks and threats exist or have  emerged that restrict the smooth operation and resilience of ICT systems, and consequently the  socio-economic development of the nation. This Strategy aims to provide a national framework  for ensuring secure, safe and resilient cyberspace, as well as fostering trust and confidence in  cyberspace by Malawians, by describing the high level strategic goals and specific objectives that  provide the basis of the nation’s direction with respect to cybersecurity, and establishes actions  that need to be taken.     Chapter 1 of the Strategy provides an introduction to cybersecurity in Malawi while chapter 2  details the guiding principles upon which the Strategy is built on, and which will underpin the  implementation of the Strategy. Chapter 3 outlines the core components of the National Strategy  including the vision   mission statement, high-level strategic goals and specific objectives. It  further describes the various actions necessary for achieving the Specific objectives and strategic  goals of the strategy. Chapter 4 describes the roles and responsibilities of the key stakeholders  in the implementation of the strategy and further proposes an approach for monitoring and  evaluating the implementation of the strategy. The implementation logical frameworks for the  strategy which provide details on Deliverables, Key Performance Indicators (KPI), Timeframes,  Lead Organisations and Funding options are described in the Appendix.  This Strategy therefore outlines the Government of Malawi’s approach to ensuring a safe and  secure cyberspace that can be fully leveraged by citizens and institutions. Consequently, driving  further growth of the ICT sector, as well as socio-economic development across Malawi.      vii    1. INTRODUCTION  1.1. Background  Major reforms in the ICT Sector of Malawi go as far back as the 1990s with the advent  of sector liberalisation through the separation and commercialisation of the then  incumbent Telecommunications operator, Malawi Posts and Telecommunications   Corporation (MPTC) into the Malawi Telecommunications Limited (MTL) and Malawi Posts  Corporation (MPC). Subsequent major reforms include the implementation of the  Communications Sector Policy (1998) and the Communications Act (1998) that led to the  establishment of the Malawi Communications Regulatory Authority (MACRA). Due to  advances in technology over the years, the Communications Act (1998) was reviewed in  2016 and also the Electronic Transactions and Cyber Security Act (2016) were enacted.  These are the two current legislations for the sector.  Currently, the mobile penetration rate in Malawi is quite low in comparison to the average  African penetration rates, highlighting the tremendous potential for further growth in  Malawi. Currently, the mobile penetration rate is at 45 percent compared to the African  region average of 77.8 percent. The broadband access prices in Malawi are among the  highest in the region due to high cost and limited availability of international bandwidth.  However, the internet sector has about 50 licensed ISPs out of which only 20% are active.   The mobile penetration and broadband are expected to grow exponentially over the next  couple of years. Since, the current mobile market in Malawi is a duopoly, the Government  of Malawi has introduced a converged licensing regime in an effort to encourage further  market competition and growth. It is expected that the converged licensing regimes  will introduce new entrants into the sector and enhance competition resulting in lower  prices.  In addition, service providers in Malawi have launched 3G services, invested in  LTE infrastructure or continued to extend their WIMAX wireless broadband networks.  Furthermore, Malawi gained access to international submarine cables recently following  the completion of a transit link via neighbouring countries and is currently deploying a  national fibre backbone.   As a result of these recent developments within the sector, as well as the high potential  for further rapid proliferation of ICTs within Malawi, it is evident that Malawians  will increasingly get connected to the Internet and use ICTs overtime. This increased  connectivity and use of ICT’s come with increased threats to activities of businesses and  people in Malawi. If Malawi is to fully leverage ICTs to spur socio-economic development  of the nation, it has to be ready and capable of addressing these threats.   1    NCS 2019-2024 sets out a multi-stakeholder framework for ensuring Malawians can access  and use cyberspace with trust and confidence, and ensuring the nation responds to threats  to ICT systems and services in a coherent and effective manner.   1.2. Situational  Analysis  1.2.1. National Development and the Role of ICT   The Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS III) recognizes how critical a  well-developed ICT system is in the development of Malawi. Currently, ICT contributes  about 5 percent to the country’s GDP while the sector’s growth rate is at 6.4 percent.  The telecom sector accounts for 95 percent of the ICT sector employment and revenue.  The Government embarked on implementing a number of strategies resulting in a number  of desired outcomes including improved ICT broadband infrastructure; increased access  and usage to ICT services; improved postal and broadcasting services; improved ICT  governance; and enhanced ICT capacity for the general public. This is consistent with the  Government’s current overarching Policy Goal for ICTs in Malawi, as described within  the National ICT Policy (2013) which is “to contribute to socio-economic development  through maximum integration of ICT in all sectors and the provision of ICT services to the  rural areas”.    The development of the MGDS follows a phased approach to address the ICT development  needs of the country in support of the prevailing policies and the legal framework. The  MGDS was developed to be the overarching operational medium-term strategy for  Malawi in the attainment of its set vision. The main thrust of the MGDS is to create  wealth through sustainable economic growth and infrastructure development as a means  of achieving poverty reduction. The MGDS I was developed to lay the framework while  MGDS II was tasked with putting in place the operational mechanism. The NCS therefore  builds on initiatives implemented in MGDS II as well as feed into MGDS III thereby  addressing Government goals of universal ICT access within a safe and secure operational  environment.  This policy direction is quite consistent with global research studies and evidence that  clearly demonstrates the connection between ICT adoption and usage of ICT services with  national GDP growth. In fact, the World Bank has demonstrated the greater development  impact of broadband specifically on emerging economies as compared to high-income  countries. Currently, Malawi’s broadband penetration has risen from 6% in 2013 to  around 17.1% in 2016, which is relatively low compared to other Southern African   2    Development Community (SADC) countries and the rest of the world. However, with the  rapid development of the ICT sector, the Government of Malawi through the MGDS III,  recognizes the potential broadband growth which puts the users of ICT services at a cyber  risk. Thus, the Government of Malawi needs to be prepared and deploy effective strategies  or measures to create a conducive environment that builds trust and confidence in the use  of ICTs by Malawian businesses and citizens.   1.2.2. Cybersecurity in Malawi  Understanding the current cybersecurity-related activities of Malawi is critical to ensuring  the effective cooperation between Malawi’s stakeholders and their cybersecurity-related  mandates and activities. Therefore, this Strategy considers the various functions and  activities of the different stakeholders in Malawi relating to cybersecurity. Noteworthy  cybersecurity-related activities undertaken in Malawi over the past year include the recent  approval of the Electronic Transactions and Cyber Security Act (2016) and the development  of this National Cybersecurity Strategy.  The recently promulgated Electronic Transactions  and Cyber ecurity Act (2016) address a number of ICT security issues like cybercrime,  data protection, and privacy among others. For instance, the Electronic-Transactions and  Cybersecurity Act (2016) will enable citizens to undertake various electronic transactions  with the full protection of the law, as well as ensure citizens are protected from computer  related harms like cybercrimes, viruses and hacks. Part 6 of the Electronic-Transactions  and Cyber Security Act (2016) provides details of offences; Clause 87, for instance,  addresses events where an individual knowingly introduces or spreads a software code  that damages computer, computer system or network.  Other issues addressed in the Act  include cryptography, Country Code Top Level Domain (ccTLD), the establishment of the  Malawi National CERT and the appointment of cyber inspectors.   However, efforts to address challenges within the cyberspace in Malawi were fragmented  due to the absence of a coordinated strategic approach by all key stakeholders. This Strategy  will therefore provide a link among all these stakeholders to provide effective solutions to  the identified challenges. The NCS as an overarching strategy provides a platform for: the  Ministry of Justice to deal with the legal issues related to the cyberspace in conjunction  with all law enforcement agencies; the regulatory authorities to review the effectiveness  of the legal and regulatory framework; and the academia to review the curricula and offer  training suited to the trends in addressing challenges in the cyberspace.   The extent of cybersecurity issues entails generic actions to specific sectors that eventually  feeds into the national strategy. For instance the banking sector has embarked on sector   3    specific training to address the needs of the banks, likewise the academia has also  incorporated various courses for cybersecurity in order to enhance the level of knowledge  and awareness for cybersecurity.  1.2.3. Cybercrime in Malawi  The high levels of ICT access and usage in the country coupled with the absence of specific  legislation dealing with cybersecurity issues in Malawi is a big challenge in the fight  against common forms of cybercrime. The Government’s position on cybercrime, like  other nations across the world, continues to be a real threat and facet of life in Malawi.  Cyber criminals continue to commit cybercrimes of larger scales and sophistication across  various countries. Many of these cyber criminals seek to make use of confidential and  sensitive information and usually have detrimental effects on individuals, businesses  and Government institutions. Consistent with global trends, a major sector targeted by  cyber criminals in Malawi is the financial sector. Other notable cybercrime incidents that  have been observed in the country include and not limited to child pornography, sexual  harassment, fraud, forgery, crime recorded, mobile money fraud, Government Websites  defacement, identity theft, email scams, distribution of compromising images, attacks on  computer data and systems.   In the National ICT Policy (2013), the Government set out to establish sufficient national  capacity to deal with national security, the violation of human rights, and the undesirable  impacts of ICTs. Furthermore, the enactment of the Electronic Transactions & Cyber  Security Act (2016) has provided a platform to harness all the efforts that were being  hampered by lack of appropriate legislation. Malawi is also benefiting from regional  initiatives and harmonization of strategies to provide a model standard for the region.  Therefore, it is critical that Malawi develops a Strategy that protects its citizens and institutions  from these cyber criminals and enhances the nation’s ability to detect, prosecute and prevent  cybercrimes.      1.2.4. Linkages with other National Policies and Programmes  The National Cybersecurity Strategy is aligned with and will complement the following  key strategic documents:  ● The National ICT Policy (2013) - The policy recognizes that Malawi needs to establish  adequate capacity to deal with undesirable impacts of ICTs including the violation of  privacy, spread of undesirable materials, cyber-crimes, digital frauds and terrorism.  4    ● The National ICT Master Plan (2014 – 2031) - this is to operationalize the National  ICT Policy.  ● Electronic Transaction and Cybersecurity Act (2016) - This makes provision for  criminalizing offences related to computer systems and information communication  technologies.  ● The Payment Systems Act (2016) - This act provides for the regulation, management  and supervision of payment systems and electronic money transfer in Malawi.  ● Malawi Growth and Development Strategy III (2017 -2022) – This highlights the  need to have developed ICT infrastructure and improved e-governance a system  that is conducive to business operations; and enacting appropriate legislation that  promotes interest of new entrants in ICT sector.   ● Vision 2020 - Vision 2020 has acknowledged in its mission statement of Malawi being  a technologically driven middle-income economy and has highlighted the need for  improved communications infrastructure promoting the effective use of information  technology as a tool to facilitate better management and access to information  resources  ● Communications Act (2016) - This provides for the regulation of the provision of  services in the electronic communications sector, posts, information society.  ● Science and Technology Policy (2002) – This aims at attaining sustainable socio- economic development through the development and application of science and  technology in order to improve the standard and quality of life of Malawians.  2. METHODOLOGY   The development of the Cybersecurity Strategy was highly participatory and consultative to  ensure full ownership of the outputs. All key critical information infrastructure stakeholders  in terms of their interest, power and influence were identified in order to involve them in  the development of the Strategy. The consultative process included workshops, working  groups; and steering committee meetings.  3.

CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS (CSFS)  The CMM that was used to assess cybersecurity posture of Malawi revealed a number of critical  success factors that will lead to successful achievement of cybersecurity goals of Malawi. These  factors include:  6.1. Political Will ● Enhancing Malawi’s cybersecurity posture needs to be a top priority for the Government. ● Cybersecurity requires adequate organizational and political support. ● At the national level, cybersecurity has to be driven from the highest office to provide a   unified agenda that will guide all relevant national stakeholders.  ● At organization level, the success of cybersecurity efforts depend mainly on the   commitment and support of top management to get stakeholders support and secure  budget for cybersecurity.  ●  security governance should be led by competent security managers   6.2. Funding and Resources ● The successful implementation of Malawi’s NCS will depend on adequate funds and   resources. Considering that ICTs and Cyberspace spur socio-economic growth, the  National Cybersecurity Strategy implementation logical frameworks have identified  possible lead organization and funding sources for various measures proposed in the NCS.   6.3. Effective coordination of efforts ● Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility among different players with different   responsibilities and abilities requiring unified coordination across a wide spectrum of  stakeholders.   ● Successful implementation of the NCS will therefore, require developing a comprehensive  national structure that will facilitate national cohesion at all levels and meaningful  participation by all stakeholders, working together toward a common goal of securing  Malawi’s cyberspace.  6.4. Awareness, education and training ● The success of cybersecurity depends on availability of the requisite knowledge,   awareness, trust to use information systems and reduced exposure to risks.  ● It is important to inform, educate and raise awareness of public and private organizations,   owners of critical infrastructures and the civil society of their security responsibilities. ● Security awareness among ICT professionals and users can prevent them from becoming   easy and soft target for cyber criminals. It is also important for the nation to provide  qualified human resources with enhanced technological capabilities of dealing with   24    complex challenges of cybersecurity.   6.5. Collaboration and networking ● The world today is highly linked and interdependent as such cybersecurity requires close   cooperation and collaboration among national, regional and international partners, based  on mutual trust.  ● Effective response to challenges of cyberspace security requires a networked approach  among stakeholders in various fields to facilitate information and resource sharing.  6.6. Protection of Critical information infrastructure ● ICT infrastructure supporting critical societal functions must be secure, robust and   reliable so that adverse incidents are avoided or mitigated as much as possible.  6.7. Innovation, Research & Development ● Cyber threats continue to evolve in complexity and gravity requiring new solutions   and approaches. Research and Development will provide a platform for innovation and  creativity to deal with emerging issues in cyberspace.  25    7. MONITORING AND EVALUATION  The Monitoring and Evaluation Plan will enable the assessment of the operational issues  encountered during the implementation of the strategy, as well as the assessment of the long- term impact and outcomes of the strategy based on periodic reviews. The Monitoring and  Evaluation Plan will also provide mechanisms or tools for data collection and reporting, and  further information on the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders, and frequency of reports.  The implementation of the NCS will require a Monitoring and Evaluation Framework that:  ▪ Supports the attainment of the NCS Vision and Strategic Goals; and  ▪ Enables accurate reporting on progress and identification of lessons learned and challenges  encountered for informed decision making and effective planning.   This can be used to elaborate new measures as well as amend and tailor existing initiatives under  the strategy.  This section of the Strategy details the proposed systematic approach to monitoring  and evaluating progress as an integral part in implementing the NCS of Malawi. The monitoring  is scheduled to be periodic in order to track the progress of implementation of the NCS. The  monitoring will, therefore, focus on periodic and objective assessment of progress towards the  attainment of the set objectives.   The key objectives of the monitoring and evaluation approach are:  ● Establishment of Performance Targets for various Government institutions or relevant  stakeholders responsible for implementing specific actions of the NCS.   ● Development of performance plans to establish a shared understanding of the expected end  results, the approach to achieving these end results and identify the resources necessary  to ensure a successful implementation. The plans will be based on the KPIs, Performance  Targets and Deadlines provided in the Implementation Logical Framework   ● Monitoring and reporting performance and progress in achieving expected end results by  identifying and promptly reporting observed or likely deviations.   ● Periodically evaluating institutional or individual performance against established  performance targets  26    7.1. Monitoring Implementation of this Strategy will be through annual work plans and budgets. The  tasks detailed in the NCS implementation plan will form the basis for preparing annual  work plans and budgets. In this regard, the Ministry of Information and Communications  Technology and all relevant stakeholders will ensure that annual work plans and budgets  are prepared within the framework of the Strategy.   Activities of this strategy will be continuously monitored and monthly performance reports  will be prepared by all implementing agencies and submitted to MoICT. The Ministry  will in turn submit to the National Steering Committee quarterly performance reports  highlighting the progress made towards the achievement of key performance indicators  (KPIs) in general and quarterly targets. Furthermore, quarterly monitoring exercises will be  conducted. Lastly, a comprehensive annual progress report will be produced highlighting  the progress made towards achievement of the KPIs in general and annual targets. The  purpose of periodic reporting is to account for the resources utilized and output/results.     7.2. Joint Annual Reviews  The MICECT in conjunction with other stakeholders shall set the Terms of Reference for  the Joint Annual Reviews (JARs). The JARs will start at organizational level, sector and  national level in order to allow for wider participation and analysis of implementation  bottlenecks. Participation at national level will include representatives from all ICT  stakeholders, who will discuss policy recommendations from the organizations as well as  sector and achieved Annual Implementation Plan milestones. Emphasis will be placed on  challenges being experienced in the achievement of the targets and how these can best be  addressed.  7.3. Evaluation  Performance evaluation is very important as it helps in objective comparison of actual  against expected results and the resultant impact. In a changing environment, some of the  key assumptions in the strategy may dramatically change and affect implementation of  the set outcome targets. It is in the course of evaluation that the effects of such changes  will be determined and appropriate corrective action taken. The evaluations, therefore,  will assess the relevance of the strategic goals and objectives, efficiency and effectiveness  of the strategies, assumptions, the strengths and weaknesses in the implementation of the  NCS.   27    A mid-term and full review will be conducted. As such, an independent stakeholder will be  commissioned to undertake the mid-term and long- term review of the strategy to determine  the short and long-term impact and outcomes of the strategy based on annual reviews, and  if necessary effect remedial actions following the mid-term review to keep implementation  on track. The mid-term review will be undertaken at the end of 3rd Quarter of Year 3 of the  Strategy and the long term review at the end of the 5th year.   28    APPENDIX A - NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION  LOGICAL FRAMEWORKS  This section presents the key elements necessary to successfully implement the strategy detailed in Chapter  3 and these include:  ● Strategic Goal: the substantive long term goal that Malawi would like to achieve in each priority  area;  ● Specific Objective: the specific steps to be undertaken to achieve the  Strategic Goal  ● Strategies/Actions:  The activities that must be undertaken, under this Strategic Plan, in pursuit of   the Specific Objective objectives ● Deliverables/Outputs:  The formal work products that Malawi will achieve in the pursuit of the   objectives and the implementation of the Strategy ● Lead Implementing Agency and Support:  The Malawian Institutions with primary responsibility   for managing completion of each objective, and the institutions that will provide support. ● Time Period:  Period of time within which deliverables/outputs are produced and/or Strategies/  Actions are implemented.  ● Key Performance Indicators:  The indices, data measurements, and trends that should be monitored   to evaluate the progress in implementing the Strategy and achieving the objectives and deliverables ● Possiible Funding Sources and Mechanisms: An overview of different possible funding sources   and mechanisms that can be adopted by Malawi to fund the implementation of the NCS.  29    32     Sp ec  ifi c   O bj  ec tiv  es    St ra  te gi  es /   Ac tio  ns    D el  iv er  ab le  s/    O ut  pu ts    Le  ad    Im pl  em en  tin g   Ag en  cy  a  nd    Su pp  or t   Ti m  e  Fr  am e   Ke y   Pe rf  or m  an ce    In  di ca  to rs    Po  ss ib  le    Fu nd  in g   So ur  ce s   an d   M ec  ha ni  sm s   Fo cu  s  Ar  ea  1  : C ri  tic al   I nf  or m  at io  n  In  fr as  tr uc  tu re     St ra  te gi  c  G  oa l –   1 :   Id en  tif y   an d   m an  ag e   th e   Cr iti  ca l I  nf or  m at  io n   In fr  as tr  uc tu  re  o  f M al  aw i   4. 5.  1  Sp  ec ifi  c  O  bj ec  tiv e   1:     Id en  tif y   an d   pr ot  ec t   th e   Cr iti  ca l   In fo  rm at  io n   In fr  as tr  uc tu  re    of  M  al aw  i   4. 5.  1. 1.

The role of MHA is specialized and focuses on establishing guidelines to help secure the “information” which may impact internal security and national security. These guidelines are based on the analysis of existing global security standards, and frameworks; and the emerging trends and discourse in the wake of persistent threats, and cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure of nations globally. The scope of MHA’s “National Information Security Policy & Guidelines” encompasses Government and Public Sector organizations and associated entities and third parties, for protecting the information under their control or ownership during information’s life-cycle including creation, storage, processing, accessing, transmission, destruction etc. The objective of this document is to improve the information security posture of an organization possessing any information, including classified information, and does not restrict organizations from adopting additional stringent practices over and above these guidelines. Organizations may evaluate various additional measures for the security of information they possess for protecting their information depending upon the sensitivity, criticality and importance of such information in the overall Internal Security and National Security interest of the country. National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 2 Foreword Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has been designated as the lead agency for the protection of the “Information” in Cyberspace. The Ministry is tasked with finalizing and issuing guidelines on the codification and classification, of information, and keeping it updated in the ever expanding cyberspace. Earlier, MHA has issued the manual of departmental security instructions 1994 which is presently applicable and is being used today by all the Government Ministries/departments/agencies. The government at all levels, central, state and local, is increasingly using Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to enhance productivity, improve efficiency in service delivery, speed-up development in all sectors of economy and improve the governance while safeguarding overall Internal Security and National Security interests of the country. Paper based records, which were earlier held in the files and filing cabinets, are now created, stored, processed, accessed, transmitted and destroyed in electronic formats. Such information can be accessed from different parts of the country by authorized personnel; however, this information is also vulnerable to unauthorized access which can compromise confidentiality, availability and integrity of information through cyber-attacks from anywhere in India or from outside the Indian borders. Adoption of international standards and best practices for security of information in the complex and borderless cyber space has, therefore, become paramount to protect national information assets in the overall national security interest. This is more important for organizations dealing with strategic information related to internal security, national security, economic security, and external affairs which handling large data/ information in electronic format. Also, the critical infrastructures such as power, banking and finance, telecommunications, transport, air traffic control etc., which are using ICT for increasing efficiency and productivity, are prone to cyber- attacks. This can have a crippling effect on the nation’s stability, economy and security. This policy document on “National Information Security and Guidelines 2014” includes a comprehensive review of the “Manual on Departmental Security Instructions” of 1994 for the present day information security requirements in the Cyber space to address the above mentioned challenges. It will serve as an extension to the existing “Manual on Departmental Security Instructions”, 1994 which primarily addresses the handling of the security of paper based information. The National Information Security Policy and Guidelines (NISPG) has been prepared by the Ministry of Home Affairs, based on the experience of the existing security standards and frameworks and the global best practices and experience of implementation in the wake of expanding information security threat scenario. This policy document will supplement the existing guidelines issued by DeitY, NIC, IB and NTRO for the security of ICT infrastructure, assets, networks, applications, user management, email etc. I hope that the organizations directly involved in handling the information in any form, including the digital form, which is relevant to the internal security and national security shall implement these guidelines and make further suggestions, if any, to improve the next version of NISPG. (Union Home Secretary) National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 3 Executive summary The digital world is a reality today in all aspects of our lives. Digital infrastructure is the backbone of prosperous economies, vigorous research communities, strong militaries, transparent governments and free societies. Lacs of people across the country rely on the electronic services in cyberspace every day. As never before, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is fostering transnational dialogue and facilitating the global flow of information, goods and services. These social and trade links have become indispensable to our daily lives as well as the economy of our country. Critical life-sustaining infrastructures that deliver electricity and water, telecommunication, Internet and broadband connectivity, control air traffic, and support our financial systems all depend on networked information systems. The reach of networked technology is pervasive and global. For all nations, the underlying digital infrastructure has become a critical national asset. Therefore improving and securing this digital infrastructure in all its dimensions including increased availability of next generation broadband connectivity, citizen/ customer centric applications and services, security of information, is critical to India’s future. Traditionally, information available with the government has been safely managed by keeping it in paper records throughout its lifecycle i.e. creation, storage, access, modification, distribution, and destruction. However, to make all government services accessible to the common man in his locality, through efficient service delivery outlets, along with transparency & reliability, the government has steadily graduated towards using electronic formats of information. Now, several forms of information have been converted to the electronic format by the ministries, departments and agencies, both in the central as well as state governments. The classification, storage and protection of such information in electronic format have always remained an area of concern. The challenge, as with the information contained in paper format, remains the same, namely the ability to categorize, protect, archive, discover, and attribute information during its useful life and eventual destruction. Even though the lifecycle of information remains the same in electronic documents and online transactions, the methods to secure information in electronic environment are different. In the present age, the “Manual of Departmental Security Instructions”, issued in 1994, is no longer sufficient to protect against the threats facing electronic forms of information. Information security is one of the important components of cyber security and is gradually taking centre stage in the national security deliberations and discussions. In fact, it has become a key component of national security design and is shaping international strategies of nations globally. Threats to information are increasingly organized and targeted, helping criminals, state actors and hacktivists to reap immense benefits out of information compromise, theft or espionage. Cybercriminals can carry out identity theft and financial fraud; steal corporate information such as intellectual property; conduct espionage to steal state and military secrets; and recruit criminals or disrupt critical infrastructures by exploiting the vulnerabilities in any system connected to the Internet. The cybercriminals could be located anywhere in the world and they can target a particular user, system or a particular service in a country or a region. Worse still, the cybercriminals can cover their tracks so that they cannot be traced. It is extremely difficult to prove whether the cybercriminal is an individual, a gang, a group of state actors or a nation-state. As the government broadens the scope of its drive to move towards e-governance and embraces technology for citizen-centric services, it faces threats from multiple sources. Each government process or project introduces a different level of complexity as a result of varied data transactions, National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 4 involvement of multiple players, and exposure to increasing compliance requirements, diverse operational and infrastructure environments and embracing of technological innovations. This complexity is true of the private sector as well, even though they are early adopters of technology and innovation. Such complexity associated with the lifecycle of information poses serious challenges in managing and governing security and ensuring compliance. Thus, it is essential to establish a focused policy initiative for the security of information and to sensitize public and private sector towards national security concerns and drive their actions for securing information. This will not only secure the IT systems but also instill trust in IT services provided by the government agencies, which can further expand and help in improved e-governance services to various stakeholders. Information security brings up a set of different problems that have the potential to challenge the comfort in the conventional methods of managing security concerns. Cyber threats do not respect physical boundaries. They explore and innovate, discovering new methods for compromising security. Further, the identity of the attacker and the source is difficult to ascertain. Attribution in cyberspace has emerged as an intimidating challenge. In most cases, it is extremely difficult to collect irrefutable evidence against a cyber-attacker, and almost impossible to link any cyber-attack to nation-states, even if clearly established. Current symptoms of problem in India Securing sensitive information is important for the strategic security and defense of a country. Economic stability of the country depends on uninterrupted operations of banking and finance; critical infrastructure such as power generation and distribution, transport systems of rail, road, air and sea; which in turn are critical dependent on ICT. It is important for national security and continued prosperity of people. For example, the financial sector in India uses ICT extensively – it is an early adopter of leading and emerging technologies. It is not surprising to note that intellectual property developed both in public and private sector also contributes to the economic growth of a nation in a knowledge based economy. Cyberattacks are specially targeted at companies and organizations to steal intellectual property in what is known as economic espionage. Malware like Stuxnet and Flame have provided evidence of cyberattacks leading to kinetic and long lasting damage to strategic capabilities of a nation, and of espionage, respectively. The public sector, although increasingly relying on ICT, has not fully awakened to the challenges of information security. The private sector, which makes investments in information security for intrinsic requirements, needs to ensure that these security practices are also aligned with national security concerns. So far, even though focus has been on improving ICT systems and providing e- governance services by various institutions, the IT systems and business processes have not placed the desired emphasis on Information Security. The time has come to drive both sectors towards a strong information security culture, which is sensitive to national imperatives. There have been revisions of Departmental Security Instructions and Guidelines from DeitY, IB, NIC and NTRO to streamline and tighten up the various aspects of documentation, personnel and physical security procedures. However, a comprehensive approach for managing information security was missing. Consideration of the underlying causes of the problem Information security is not merely a technology problem; it requires alignment with organizational processes as well as the legal and regulatory framework in the nation. However, for successful and National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 5 optimized implementation of security, organizations need to weigh their strategic and financial options, establish a policy framework to set directions, define or comply with standards for ensuring baseline, establish procedures for ensuring consistency of operations and issue guidelines for implementation which must be carried out in spirit, and not just for the sake of obtaining a certificate. The compliance to the defined Information Security (IS) processes/ guidelines needs to be periodically audited both by internal and external auditors. Organizations are yet to awaken completely to embrace these challenges and incorporate measures and align their efforts to the cause of national security. The drivers for security go beyond securing ICT assets and protection of intellectual property rights (IPRs), where public and private entities have invested the bulk of their resources and efforts. Cyber Security and National Security require adequate priority and attention from organizations, beyond their usual areas of focus. Information security policy measures should address the requirements of legal framework, provide strategic measures and develop a mechanism to address various problems related to standards, procedures and guidelines. The policy needs to be aligned to the requirements of National Security, Cyber Security, IPR and Privacy protection. The National Information Security Policy and Guidelines Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has been entrusted with the responsibility of coordinating and overseeing information security initiatives of public as well as private sector. It is empowered to create a National Information Security Policy and Guidelines (NISPG), define procedures for handling information and issue guidelines for security of classified information assets. Accordingly, a Cyber Security Committee under the chairmanship of Joint Secretary, MHA with members from other stakeholder organizations was formed for this purpose. However, draft guidelines on protection of information in cyberspace and codification and classification (of electronic documents), prepared by this committee was not found to be comprehensive. In view of the fact that MHA and Intelligence Bureau (IB) do not have in-house expertise to handle a highly technical and advanced subject like this, it was proposed to outsource the work to National Institute of Smart Governance (NISG)/Data Security Council of India (DSCI) to develop a robust and comprehensive policy document, given DSCI’s experience in developing the DSCI Security Framework (DSF©), which was formulated in consultation with the Indian Industry which has experience in offering secure IT solutions to clients in over 90 countries, and DSCI’s engagement with International Standards Organization (ISO) in the development of global security standards The work plan for creation of NISPG included a study of existing laws, regulations and practices within the Government of India, international best practices followed worldwide and security requirements of various regulatory bodies. A review of global best practices, frameworks and information security standards was undertaken to understand and incorporate global learnings and align the developed practices with the same. Two workshops involving senior representatives from about 40 public sector organizations and Industry were also conducted, in addition to receiving their inputs over email. Based on learnings from these frameworks, emerging disciplines, and viewpoint of the industry, specific guidelines and detailed control objective and statements have been developed. This policy document will supplement the existing guidelines issued by Deity, NIC, IB and NTRO for the security of ICT infrastructure, assets, networks, applications etc. and would serve as an extension to the existing Manual on Departmental Security Instructions of 1994, which primarily addresses the handling of the security of paper based information. National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 6 Approach This document elaborates baseline Information security policy and highlights the relevant security concepts and best practices, which government ministries, departments, and organizations must implement to protect their information. The policy recommends creation of a security division within each government organization, with the responsibility of planning, implementing and governing all tasks related with information security in a comprehensive and focused manner. The security division is expected to perform risk analysis based on threat and risk assessment emanating from the adoption of technology. Further, the document provides guidance and control objectives aligned in eight main domains and six additional areas which form the core of information security practices and frameworks globally. These domains are essential for implementation of an effective information security program, since they address the specifics which have become essential for its effectiveness. The contribution of each domain to the success of the information security program is intertwined with the level of maturity and success of all the other domains. Thus, together they help create a baseline for a robust information security program. The following core domains have been covered as part of this document. These are: 1. Network and Infrastructure security 2. Identity, access and privilege management 3. Physical security 4. Application security 5. Data security 6. Personnel security 7. Threat and vulnerability management and 8. Security and incident management Further, guidelines have been provided for technology specific ICT deployment and trends: 1. Cloud computing 2. Mobility and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) 3. Virtualization 4. Social media Additionally, guidelines for essential security practices have been provided: 1. Security testing 2. Security auditing 3. Business continuity 4. Open source technology Each domain is supported by a brief introduction about its relevance to information security along with an outline of the importance of establishing practices pertinent to that domain. This is supported by essential guidelines which encompass various processes and procedures under which the information may traverse during its lifecycle. National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 7 The guidelines are reinforced with the help of specific control objectives and statements which will help organizations initiate their journey towards establishing a security baseline and further help them in obtaining maturity in these practices. To help the readers of this document appreciate the work already undertaken globally in the field of information security, the annexures have been updated with a brief summary of some globally accepted information security frameworks, standards and practices. The readers can comprehend the guidelines and controls provided in this document, from the detailed chart which provides mapping of guidelines and controls mentioned in this manual with that of other globally accepted frameworks, standards, practices and controls such as ISO 27001 (2005 as well as 2013), SANS 20, NTRO 40 and FISMA. There are 112 different guidelines and 135 controls and 181 implementation guidelines defined in NISP as against 133 controls in ISO 27001, 40 controls defined by NTRO, 20 controls by SANS and about 200 controls by FISMA. Further, some guidance has also been provided on the methodology which may be used by the organizations for carrying out risk assessments for the purpose of information security. The first and second drafts of the “National Information Security Policy and Guidelines” (NISPG) were circulated by MHA in January 2014. Since then, feedback and suggestions have been received from various ministries, departments and agencies on the guidelines contained in the NISPG. The feedback received has provided valuable insight into specific areas to improve the guidelines. Further guidance was added in Version 3.0 of the document encompassing areas such as business continuity, security testing and security audits. Additionally, guidance on securing technology specific areas has also been incorporated, based on the feedback received from various departments. These guidelines include security measures for cloud computing, BYOD and virtualization. In the current version i.e. NISPG 4.0, implementation guidelines have been added to help organizations in comprehending requirements of each domain, along with additional controls and areas that have emerged after the feedback from some other government agencies. Establishing visibility over information and its lifecycle Organizations need to establish a process of identification and discovery of information at each of its operational processes, relationships and functions. Information is an empowerment and has a strategic as well as an economic value associated with it. The security posture of the organization has to be dynamic and should evolve with the change in the value of information, underlying ICT infrastructure, information access methods and threat ecosystem. It should have the ability to address the security requirements of all data transactions across all possible data leakage scenarios. The security solutions should help address security of information, not only at the different layers of ICT infrastructure, but also in the extended operational ecosystem, i.e. other ministries and agencies may be given access to information. This should also provide guidance for securing emerging technology platforms such as mobility, cloud computing, virtualization etc. While designing the strategy for security, information centric approach in operational lifecycle should be an important consideration. The identified information item and its characteristics such as its origin, sensitivity, strategic and economic value, geography of operation, access methods and the department(s) or the financial ecosystem within which transactions take place along with the operations performed on the information help identify the security requirements. Developing an information centric security framework The consideration of information security in the life cycle is important from people, process and technical design perspective. Information can be classified based on its category or type, sensitivity, National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 8 value and the context throughout its life cycle. The departments should ensure that there exists a structural thought process in designing information security initiatives, such that adequate measures are taken with respect to formation, grouping and arrangement of countermeasures for security of information. It is also important that adequate efforts are taken for integrating information security measures with the enterprise ICT architecture to address contemporary and changing threats to information. Moreover, an organization should have capability towards responsiveness to the new issues or threats through integrating internal and external intelligence measures, deployment of tools, techniques and methods in identifying threats, collaboration mechanisms which generate timely and desired response from other security and ICT infrastructure management processes. Finally, departments should have the ability to identify, alert, evoke responses and resolve a data breach in a timely manner. This requires integration with other security processes and ICT infrastructure management processes, arrangement and relationships with external parties or bodies and standardization of procedures defined and deployed for handling data breaches. To make all this possible, departments need to focus on establishing accountability through design and implementation of an ownership structure for information security, where tasks and responsibilities are clearly distributed with respect to administrative and technical arrangements required for information security. The way forward Increasing digitization of information, expanding exposure of government organizations due to connectivity and the use of external providers, rising dependence on the global ICT supply chain are posing serious threats to information security. Growing instances of cyber espionage involving serious information breaches, call for action at a higher level. The Government of India recognizes this challenge – more so in the context of national security. National Information Security Policy and Guidelines, which focuses on security of information possessed both by public (Government and PSUs) and private sector, is an important step towards achieving new age goals of national cyber security. The policy is directed to build and foster an ecosystem for information security in the organizations (operating in public as well as private domain) that addresses the National Security requirements.

Traditionally, information available with the government has been safely managed by keeping it in paper records throughout its life cycle i.e. when it is created, stored, accessed, modified, distributed, and destroyed. This information could be strategic, demographical, historical, legal, or may contain financial statements, procedural documents, data of citizens, industry or resources etc. Even though the lifecycle of information remains the same in electronic documents, the methods to secure information in electronic environment are significantly different. The challenges, as with the information contained in paper format, remain of similar nature, namely the ability to categorize, protect, archive, discover, transmit and attribute information during its useful life and eventual destruction 1.1.2. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has empowered the government to create generate, store, transmit, and access information with much ease and efficiency. However, the importance of incorporating effective, state-of-the-art information security measures is being realized now. The departments, agencies and divisions recognize the security concerns in the electronic environment and are creating policies to secure the information in all stages of information lifecycle. The government and its officers have tremendous experience in securing paper documents. For example, several manual methods such as use of catalogs and paper-based chain-of-custody logs help keep track of the locations of files within secure record rooms. It is also known that information in the paper format may be exposed to physical damage, fraud or modification which may be sometimes difficult to track. The government is aware of the benefits of electronic form of information - it has not only been able to identify and gain visibility over the type of information available with its various departments, and agencies, but also attribute changes or modification to this information to specific personnel, thus making it easier to categorize, archive, discover and attribute 1.1.3. The government organizations deploy a number of technologies and in the process access, store and analyze vast amount of information. While the ease of access to information in the electronic format has helped revitalize governance, there are a number of threats which are emerging and required to be tackled on top priority. Today, information has acquired critical status for regulatory initiatives, policies and strategies, e-Governance, user services, financial transactions; however, security threats are becoming more organized and targeted, which pose serious threats – and in the event of any compromise of information, it could lead to major threats to internal and national security, and/or embarrassment to the government. Information is the reason for empowerment as well as a concern of threat for government organizations and needs a specific and granular focus on information which is created, stored, processed, transacted or accessed. Additionally, the IT infrastructure of a government organization is getting significantly transformed through increasing use of technical innovations, work-flow applications, mobility and extension to allow its usage by other stakeholders, partners, and service providers from the private sector 1.1.4. Complexity of information is a big hurdle in managing and governing security, privacy and compliance. Each government process or project introduces a different level of complexity as a result of wide-ranging data transactions, involvement of multiple stakeholders, exposure to National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 14 diverse set of infrastructure environments, networks, devices, platforms and information assets 1.2. Key areas of national concern for ministries/ departments/ agencies (management) 1.2.1. Meeting dynamic security threats: Protecting information has not typically been considered as a strategic element by the top level executives in the ministries/ departments/ agencies (management); even after promulgating various regulatory measures, global threats and many security incidents. Information security remains an afterthought, either as a line item or – even worse – not addressed at all by the top bureaucracy in the ministries/ departments/ agencies. The growing complexity of managing information security, rising exposure of an organization and close inter-linkage of Government information with the strategic security of the nation necessitates the elevation of the security function. 1.2.2. Creating visibility over activities and operations: The security threat environment is becoming more widespread and dangerous and it is important that ministries/ departments/ agencies have visibility over their activities, functions and operations. Security as a discipline has also evolved over a period of time. The stimuli have been many - the dynamic threat landscape, threats to national security, internal security concerns, strengthening regulatory regime, privacy issues, economic value of information, research & innovation, globalization, business models, emerging technologies, etc. 1.2.3. Intelligence gathering, knowledge management and skill development: For an organization to be secure in today’s technology driven work environment, it is important that it keeps track of all the latest developments in the field of information security – be it skills, technologies or services. An organization is required to provide strategic attention to security through commitment in all the facets of information security i.e. people, process and technology. It should be equipped with adequate knowledge, tools and techniques and human resources for gathering, assessing and presenting information security events to the top executive management levels in the ministries/ departments/ agencies. The aspects of designing, implementing and governing security although a key challenge for a ministries/ departments/ agencies, need to be addressed suitably by a framework for managing the affairs of security 1.3. Ministries/ Departments/ Agencies/ Management commitment towards Information security 1.3.1. Introduction: Information security program implementations often suffer due to inadequate resources—commitment of the ministries/ departments/ agencies, time, budget, human resources or expertise. By understanding the challenges of meeting compliance objectives, an organization can understand and appreciate the level of commitment required towards information security to overcome the obstacles and appreciate the gains achieved through implementing effective security practices. The following concerns emerge as executives in the ministries/ departments/ agencies decode the complexity and inter-linkage of security and performance: 1.3.1.1. Coverage of security risks: The foremost goal of an organization’s risk management process is to protect the organization, and its ability to perform its functions, not just protect its information and assets. Therefore, the security risk management process should be treated as an essential management function of the ministries/ departments/ agencies/ National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 15 organizations, rather than a technical function carried out by the IT system administrators alone 1.3.1.2. Protection from interruption in services: Ineffective security measures due to inadequate budget/commitment or inflexibility of the ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations to obtain advanced security capability, may cause disruption of vital services/ offerings. Information is one of the most important assets of an organization. Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of this strategic asset allows ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations to carry out their objectives and realize their goals in a responsible manner 1.3.1.3. Non-availability of information: Risks to operations can arise through a variety of sources, in some cases resulting in damage to infrastructure and the complete shutdown of the services. For example, loss of all Internet connectivity, denial of service attacks, APTs, ransom-ware, physical theft etc and environmental factors (e.g., power outages, floods, and fires) can result in a loss of availability of key / strategic information, rendering any ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations incapable of achieving their objectives. Investment in security can assist in mitigating risks to operations 1.3.1.4. Financial loss due to disclosure/ theft of information: Inappropriate security measures may have a huge impact on an organizations financial position. A data breach may not only have direct financial loss, but will also dissolve the trust of residents, citizens, suppliers, other government bodies etc. Further, in order to minimize the damage of the breach, the organization may have to incur additional expenses 1.3.1.5. Non- compliance with legal/ regulatory requirements: The ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations may face administrative and/or legal actions for not complying with security advisories. Security is ultimately the responsibility of executive management Secretary, Joint Secretary, Managing Directors, CEOs, Directors, head of the department heads and other senior program officials of the ministries/ departments/ agencies/ organizations. The Management should deploy proactive security to enable delivery of its services and enhance value of the organization, rather than viewing security as an afterthought or as a reactionary mechanism to legislation, regulation, security event and oversight 1.3.1.6. Investment and resource channelization disproportionate with risks: Ignoring security as a design principle results in ad hoc investments, which more often than not focuses on adding controls after the systems are made operational—or in the worst case, after an organization has had a security breach or incident. The ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations may not realize the specific performance gains and financial savings by building security into systems as they are developed. However, these save the organization from incurring huge unbudgeted costs in covering up post an incident or breach National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 16 1.4. Need for an information-centric approach 1.4.1. While designing a strategy for security, information-centric approach in operational lifecycle should be an important consideration. Information and its attributes such as its origin, creator, nature of transaction, life, sensitivity, strategic importance and the operations performed on the information are some of the factors which help identify security requirements. Government ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations need to establish a process of identification and discovery of information for each of its processes, relationships and functions. The security posture has to be dynamic and should evolve with change in the value of information, information access methods and threat ecosystem. The capability of security processes and infrastructure to address information security should not only cover the different layers of ICT infrastructure, but also address the extended government ecosystem and new trends like mobility, big data and cloud computing. The consideration of information security in the lifecycle of information is also important from people, process and technical design perspective Figure 1: Domains impacting information security 1.4.2. Information can be classified based on its category or type, sensitivity, value and the context throughout its lifecycle. Ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations should ensure that a structural thought process in designing information security initiatives and measures is taken with respect to formation, grouping and arrangement of countermeasures for security of information. Moreover, they should have capability for responding to emerging threats by gathering intelligence on the nature of threats; deploying tools, techniques and methods to identify threats, build collaboration mechanisms which generate timely response from other security & IT infrastructure management processes 1.4.3. To make all this possible, organizations require a focused accountability and ownership structure for information security, where tasks are clearly distributed with respect to National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 17 administrative and technical arrangements. The IT initiatives of an organization need to be revitalized to incorporate the principles of information security. The disciplines of security, presented in this document, need to be carefully and diligently implemented 1.5. Information Security – focus areas 1.5.1. Managing scale and complexity: The increasing scale and complexity of organizations requires a more coordinated and collaborative security approach. The information age demands right proportions of security and requires graduation of security from a technical specialty to an operational strategy. The scope and reach of security function has been expanding with innovative and extensive use of IT for operational transactions, changing the nature of IT infrastructure and the ability of threats that impact the security posture of an organization in different directions and at different layers. Organization should be well equipped to overcome these aspects establish some key objectives which demonstrate its commitment to security 1.5.2. Alignment of security with processes and functions: The ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations need to distinguish between security related operational tasks from strategic security tasks. They need to estimate all security elements which are distributed across the organizational ecosystem. This requires significant efforts in building security characteristics and aligning the security function with organizational processes and IT, thereby ensuring that security hygiene is reflected across the organization. The management needs to focus its efforts on helping the organization identify enterprise information assets, processes and information resources and the commensurate protection required to secure them. To achieve this, the security function needs to work in close consultation and coordination with the ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations and sub functions to conduct risk assessments, and help them articulate the confidentiality, integrity and availability requirements of their resources, and develop appropriate security practices to ensure non-repudiation, accountability, authenticity and due authorization for information handling 1.5.3. Compliance with laws and regulations: The responsibilities of, and the extent of the role of security function within an organization is expanding; crossing the traditionally defined boundaries of IT, and covering all horizontal and vertical functions of ministries/ departments/ agencies/ organizations. Based on the nature of work and information handled, each horizontal and vertical function of an organization may need to comply with several laws and regulations. The Secretary/ the top management needs to drive security in all organizations functions and should promote adequacy of role & responsibility and efficacy of skills within its operational units. This will help ensure compliance with information security laws, regulations, standards, and guidance which are applicable to different departments and units, breach of which poses a severe threat not only to the organization's reputation, but also towards national security and internal security of the nation 1.5.4. Formulating effective security functions and divisions: Meeting the information security needs, necessitates ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations to focus on effective information security practices and functions which integrate security into the strategic and daily operations of an organization, focuses more on information-centric security strategy and ensures that security is part of the design principle and maturity of National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 18 security practices acts as a key differentiator in service delivery. Formulating effective security function in the organization ensures integration and builds collaboration between security, IT and other organizations functions 1.5.5. Allocation of budgets: There is a need for an effective and responsive security organization that is competent and committed in managing the complexity of security affairs and aligned to departmental requirements. For that to happen there is a need for provisioning adequate budgetary commitments towards security. This will help security to act not only as deterrence but as also as an operational advantage. Globally, there are many studies which suggest that budget for security should be proportional to the size of the organization or proportional to its IT budget. On an average, globally the budget for security varies between 8-10% of the ICT budget. However there are various parameters which should be evaluated before defining the security budget, it may be the sensitivity of information that ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations possess, the amount of transactions through varied platform, involvement of third parties, etc. Ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations should ensure that security budgets should be based on reasonable analysis and risks to operations and the allocation should depend on threat scenarios and risk to information 1.5.6. Availability of security professionals and tools: Apart from investing in adoption of newer technology platforms for better business effectiveness, ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations should also be committed towards investment in hiring skilled resources, procuring tools or increasing the efforts of the existing workforce. In order to augment the existing skills and expertise, top executives should be flexible to outsource specialized activities/operations to Subject Matter Experts (SME’s) and be open to hire external consultants and experts post due security vetting. The ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations should also be flexible in changing procedural aspects of managing security and consult with the hired ICT organization to evaluate and implement effective security technologies and architecture 1.5.7. Building and fostering culture of information security: While protection of information is of paramount importance, ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations should support the broader aim of securing the enterprise. This requires fostering a culture of information security through commitment from top leadership who need to demonstrate the strategic nature and value of information to its workforce in the enterprise. This may be achieved by establishing the principles of protecting information assets for the organization, as a priority. The ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations should focus on imbibing a \"risk-aware\" culture across the ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations concerned, ensuring that key personnel fully understand the risk implications associated with their assets, processes and information HP Sticky Note BUDGET ALLOCATION National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 19 2. Purpose 2.1. Purpose of NISPG 2.1.1. The National Information Security Policy and Guidelines (NISPG), developed by the Ministry of Home Affairs once implemented, will help classify and protect the classified information possessed by ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations, and public sector undertakings. Breach of such classified information may have an impact on national security, or may cause unfavorable impact on internal security 2.1.2. This document elaborates baseline information security policy and highlights relevant security concepts and best practices, which government ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations should implement to protect their classified information 2.1.3. These guidelines will help ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations to establish minimum security processes and controls and devise appropriate information security programs. The ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations may need to apply enhanced security measures commensurate with risks identified with their specific operating environment and the information being handled by them 2.1.4. These guidelines will help organizations to focus on security objectives and strategy to protect their classified information, during every stage of information lifecycle such as creation, acquiring, storing, accessing, processing, transacting, retaining or disposal. These guidelines will help drive organizations towards designing, implementing and operating focused information security initiatives 2.1.5. The NISPG aims to provide: 2.1.5.1.

Supplementary documents and references 5.1. References 5.1.1. The policies and procedures suggested in this document take into account the previous guidelines issued by various competent bodies and authorities of the government e.g. ‘Computer Security Guidelines’ 2006’ by Intelligence Bureau (IB), ‘Cyber Security Policy for Government of India’ by National Informatics Centre (NIC), Guidelines and controls mentioned in “Cyber Security Policy for Government of India” ver 2.0 released 30th August, 2010, Guidelines issued by National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre, National Technical Research Organization and various ‘Security Guidelines’ issued by CERT-In. The directions laid out in this document are inclusive in nature and have referred to the content and suggestions from the above mentioned guidelines, wherever appropriate. However, the ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations concerned are advised to consult the previous documents on the same subjects as well 5.1.2. MHA has done extensive work of studying various, international and national standards and regulatory guidelines prevalent in the information security domain worldwide. The guidelines have been influenced by, and draw references from, the global standards and practices such as ISO 27001 (2005 as well as 2013), NIST Special Publication 800-53, Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of USA, SANS “20 Critical Security Controls”, Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) for information technology (IT) management and IT governance, PCI –DSS, DSCI Security Framework (DSF) etc. National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 22 6. Approach 6.1. Security of classified information 6.1.1. Securing classified information in government and public sector processes lifecycle: The ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations should ensure that they establish appropriate processes and capabilities to secure information throughout its lifecycle i.e. as information is created, accessed, modified, stored, processed, transacted, transmitted, deleted, disposed of or destroyed. Information can be classified based on its category or type, sensitivity, value and the context throughout its lifecycle 6.2. Security risk assessment 6.2.1. Conducting periodic risk assessment: Security risk assessments should be conducted periodically to evaluate risks and associated threats leading to loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Threat and vulnerabilities associated with the information must also be evaluated for their potential impact, including impact on internal and national security. 6.2.2. Risk assessment framework: Due to the diverse nature of operations of different organizations there can be no single approach recommended for risk assessment. However, to develop a risk based methodology which helps develop resilience to changing threat environment, ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations need to integrate information security risk assessment with the broader risk management framework for operations. Frameworks such as ISO 27005:2008 or others may be referred to based on the organization’s requirements 6.2.3. Periodicity of risk assessments: Information security risk assessment should be an on-going activity, triggered early into the lifecycle of system design and development. It should be conducted at least once every year or when changes are made to existing information assets or when threat perception over information and information systems changes. For systems containing classified data, a thorough risk assessment should be conducted at-least once every quarterly 6.2.4. Methodology: A comprehensive security risk assessment may include methodologies prescribed in Section 18 of this document for threat and vulnerability management 6.2.5. Additional insights: A comprehensive information security risk assessment will also provide insights into expected ICT security expenditure, thereby helping formulate budgets and estimate costs and help strategic decision making 6.3. Principles for establishing organization wide security framework 6.3.1. Core security goals: Information security frameworks should be designed to ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability of information to authenticated and authorized users, while establishing accountability over transactions conducted over the lifecycle of information and establishing non- repudiation of information, across layers of people, process and technology 6.3.1.1. Architecture: Adequate steps must be taken for integrating information security measures with the IT architecture of organizations to address contemporary security threats. National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 23 Capability to respond to new issues or threats through integrating internal and external intelligence measures, deployment of tools, techniques and methods in identifying threats, which generate timely and desired response from other security & IT management processes, must be established 6.3.2. Security division structure: The ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations must establish accountability and ownership structure for information security, where tasks are clearly distributed with respect to administrative and technical arrangements required for information security. The head of security must report directly to the head of the ministries, departments, agencies or organizations and not to the IT head. 6.3.3. Deployment of professionals and skill development: The ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations must ensure that trained professionals in the field of Information Security are deployed to address their Information Security initiatives, at appropriate levels. Further, adequate measures to train existing users, human resources, to acquaint them with best practices for securing information and align them with the overall objectives of the organization for protection of information and information assets must be undertaken at periodic intervals. Every new employee should go through the information security awareness program which could be organized in-house. Also every employee should be given training in information security atleast once every two years. 6.4. Security audit 6.4.1. Security audits: The ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations must conduct appropriate evaluation, testing and audits of all organizational structures, mechanisms, policies, procedures, technologies and controls to ensure their alignment with the implementation objectives of the information security policy and guidelines at regular intervals. Areas of improvement should be identified and a mechanism to improve the overall deployment of such structures, mechanisms, policies, procedures, technologies and controls should be undertaken 6.4.2. Identification and response to data breach: The ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations should develop the ability to identify, alert, evoke responses & resolve a data breach in timely manner 6.4.3. Coordination with agencies: The ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations should interact with relevant agencies in the domain of information security to gather and share intelligence about threats and vulnerabilities 6.5. Exception to implementation of recommended guidelines and controls 6.5.1. The ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations are expected to conduct a thorough risk assessment and use the practices outlined in this document to help implement a framework within the organization 6.5.2. The ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations must exercise its own discretion in customizing and adapting the guidelines mentioned in this document, while upholding the core objectives and principles of the NISPG. Further, the ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations are free to deploy relevant National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 24 capabilities in the form of tools, solutions etc. to help implement information security practices and its governance framework 6.5.3. The MHA, through its agencies, may seek compliance in the form of audit reports to demonstrate adherence to controls and guidelines specified in the NISPG from ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations 6.5.4. In case some guidelines and controls are not adhered to, ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations should be able to substantiate their stance by reproduction of appropriate documentation specifying at a minimum, the following parameters: 6.5.4.1. Reason for non-conformance to guidelines 6.5.4.2. Risk evaluation reports detailing the risks due to non-conformance 6.5.4.3. Additional controls implemented, if any 6.5.4.4. Timeline for introduction of recommended controls 6.5.5. Such instances should also be brought to the notice of the Information security steering committee (refer section 8) and a formal signoff should be undertaken in all cases, where guidelines specified under the NISPG are not followed National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 25 6.6. Limitations The figure below summarizes the overall security ecosystem by explaining the relationship between national security, cyber security, organization security and information security. The policy focuses on protection of classified information and hence intends to only provide guidance, procedures and controls which are relevant to this specific area. While it is beyond the scope of this document to detail every single practice involved in the design, implementation, configuration, management and security enforcement, an effort has been made to capture information security measures through security domains. Figure 2: Each area encompasses information which has ramifications towards National Security National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 26 7. Information classification guidelines 7.1. Information classification All information available with organizations should be classified into one of the following categories (based on existing classification of Manual on paper records Issued by Ministry of Home Affairs, 1994): 7.1.1. Top Secret: Information, unauthorized disclosure of which could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security or national interest. This category is reserved for nation’s closest secrets and is to be used with great reserve 7.1.2. Secret: Information, unauthorized disclosure of which could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security or national interest or cause serious embarrassment in its functioning. This classification should be used for highly important information and is the highest classification normally used 7.1.3. Confidential: Information, unauthorized disclosure of which could be expected to cause damage to the security of the organization or could be prejudicial to the interest of the organization, or could affect the organization in its functioning. Most information, on proper analysis, will be classified no higher than confidential 7.1.4. Restricted: Information, which is essentially meant for official use only and which would not be published or communicated to anyone except for official purpose 7.1.5. Unclassified: Information that requires no protection against disclosure. e.g. Public releases Information handling: Appropriate information handling procedures must be developed, commensurate with the level of classification.

There are several information security management standards which are adopted by organizations worldwide. The ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations may use such globally accepted standards to design, implement and govern information security within their organization and mandate all partner organizations and third parties to implement similar practices (For more details on globally accepted information security management standards refer to Annexure 10) National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 30 10. Domains impacting information security 10.1. Overview 10.1.1. Alignment with security framework: While following the above framework, the ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations should consider developing strategy and competence in specific disciplines to enhance security. The NISPG has identified eight core domains namely, network and infrastructure security, identity and access management, physical security, application security, data security, personnel security, threat & vulnerability management, security monitoring & incident management. Additionally, the areas of security audit, security testing and business continuity, which cut across all domains, have been covered as part of the guidelines. Further, guidelines for technology specific areas such as virtualization, cloud computing, mobility and social media are provided in a separate section 10.1.2. Achieving maturity in security domains: Domains mentioned above need to be understood critically for security of classified information. Strategies for each of them, along with tactical guidelines for implementation, and security controls are essential for making security robust. The ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations should organize, allocate and drive resources towards each of these security domains and strive to achieve maturity over time to counter the increasing threats and attacks 10.1.3. Information security domains 10.1.3.1. Network and infrastructure security: The architectural plan of locating information in a network arrangement and other infrastructure security arrangements such as internal and external connections to information, protocols that are used to transfer information, preparedness to withstand attacks etc. require specific consideration and treatment from the perspective of securing information 10.1.3.2. Identity and access management: Sensitivity and criticality of information specifies the requirements with respect to ability of an individual or group of users to access and perform a set of operations on the said information. The increasing reliance on third parties and external SMEs makes it imperative for the organization to secure itself against risk arising from misuse of identities or additional or illegitimate access provided to the users 10.1.3.3. Physical security: Organizations generally have multiple touch points from where information can be accessed physically. To add to that, technology enables easy availability of portable devices. This can defeat traditional physical screenings of individuals. With more solutions and techniques becoming available in the market, physical security concepts are also evolving, establishing it as an important discipline for protecting information security. While it focuses more on restriction to physical intrusion, technological solutions provide means to raise alarms by detecting anomalies and patterns of information being accessed which help in detection and containment of information security incidents 10.1.3.4. Application security: The primary objective of application security is to secure information as it is processed, transferred or stored during the lifecycle of an application. The National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 31 characteristics of applications vary from basic versions, to context aware, and Internet rich usage of apps. These variations at various fronts expose the information processed, stored, accessed, transacted through these applications to a larger threat landscape 10.1.3.5. Data security: Each data item collected, stored, processed, transmitted and accessed by an organization has to be protected against cyber-attacks especially that are sensitive or critical for internal and national security as stated in classification of information. The entire focus and effort is to secure data. It is this which has led to the evolution of the discipline of data security - the ultimate goal of an organization’s security 10.1.3.6. Personnel security: Risks due to insider threat and internal security breach undermines all security measures taken to fortify information systems and data from the outside world. The personnel security focuses on both the aspects of employee as well as third party security and focuses on sourcing patterns of an organization which requires specifics checks from a security viewpoint 10.1.3.7. Threat & vulnerability management: There is an ever increasing rise of security threats with enhanced capabilities, varieties and scales; exploring new ways to find vulnerabilities and exploits in an organization’s infrastructure to cause maximum possible damage. Threat and Vulnerability Management (TVM) ensures that an organization’s resources are protected against the perennial as well as evolving threats, and provides assurance over the management of its resources in a way that the relevance of new vulnerabilities, exploits or malware is immediately tested and that the organization responds swiftly to them. TVM adds critical value to an organization’s security initiatives, which not only delivers protection capabilities but also provides means to manage IT infrastructure securely 10.1.3.8. Security monitoring & incident management: Security Monitoring and incident response management is a key component of an organization’s information security program, as it demonstrates its ability to respond to an information breach which might emanate from external or internal sources 10.1.3.9. Security audit and testing: Security audit, testing and reviews should be conducted on a continuous basis to check for conformance of security measures deployed by the organization with security policies, standards and requirements. Specific requirements are implicit in all disciplines. Moreover, general best practices have been provided as part of this document 10.1.3.10. Business continuity: Business continuity of the operations has to be planned by the respective government departments and is kept outside the scope of this policy. However, this document covers areas which are important from the perspective of ensuring availability of critical operations and classified information National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 32 Figure 3: Information security domains Business Continuity/ Disaster Recovery Security Audit and Testing National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 33 11.

Background 12.1.1. The increased adoption of information technologies has created immense opportunities to connect, expand and integrate different entities. This led to the expansion of the network capabilities and adoption of emerging connectivity techniques 12.1.2. The network infrastructure itself has evolved with various options of network topologies, types of routing and switching devices and different connectivity options. Networks are playing important role in providing access to information and information systems; providing new ways for executing transactions and helping organizations leverage fruits of globalization and hyper specialization. The diversity of these topologies, devices and connections contributes to creating immense possibilities, however; it also introduces several new security issues and concerns 12.1.3. The organizational ecosystem is undergoing transformation, extending its boundaries by increasingly providing access to third parties and vendors, integrating external interfaces, adopting innovations in endpoint, mobility and wireless technologies, while relaxing norms of standardization and ownership of connecting devices. Enterprise architectures are becoming more complex, multiple new system components are under deployment, and their capabilities are extensively utilized through virtualization. This provides multiple opportunities by which security can be compromised 12.2. Relevance of domain to Information Security 12.2.1. Network plays an important role as it binds all the information assets together and provides a means for operational transaction where different entities can participate, exchange information and carry operations over the information by making use of specific ports, protocols and services provided by the network. This may create the possibilities of exposure of information 12.2.2. Network plays a role in provisioning users and devices access to data as it is the first point of connects. Users seek flexibility in accessing data across different devices and access paths. This may expose organization’s information through these devices and the way users access information 12.2.3. Network infrastructure typically spreads across geographies, providing access, facilitating exchange of information and executing a variety of transactions. A combination of network solutions and devices are required in order for these transactions to be successful. They may create possibilities of compromising security of information at various levels 12.2.4. Traffic flow, connections, devices and traffic patterns introduce significant vulnerabilities and weaknesses. These vulnerabilities and weaknesses may lead to serious security threats to information 12.2.5. Insiders have easy access information and IT systems. Network aids their access to the information and IT systems. They may be source or reason for compromise of security of information National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 35 12.2.6.

Application security 15.1. Background 15.1.1. Application portfolios of organizations are becoming increasingly complex with a mix of legacy applications, addition of new applications, deployment of enterprise packaged applications and adoption of externally provisioned applications. Each of these applications and their modules provide means of achieving a certain set of organizations objectives. These variations at various fronts expose information to a larger threat landscape 15.1.2. Protecting applications against attacks simply by defending the perimeter with firewalls and network traffic encryption has proven to be insufficient. To address the risks at application layer, several technology and tactical measures have emerged that have helped the evolution of ‘application security’ as an important discipline in itself. The application itself should build in additional security measures, depending on the vulnerability of the system and the sensitivity of the data it is dealing with 15.2. Relevance of discipline to information security 15.2.1. As most information, both for operational and governance operations, is processed and transacted through applications, it becomes important to secure applications throughout their lifecycle 15.2.2. Information of the organization may be compromised or exposed if applications are not securely designed, developed, tested, configured and deployed 15.2.3. Inadequate visibility over how applications handle information; inadequate effort and resources deployed for application security; and lack of key application security capabilities endanger security of information 15.2.4.

Personnel security 17.1. Background 17.1.1. Insider threat has been a large contributor towards a number of security incidents faced by organizations. Additionally, the sourcing patterns of an organization are increasingly dependent on external service providers, for bridging gaps in their skills and competence, saving costs, augmenting capabilities to improve scalability and for making operations lean and efficient 17.1.2. However, granting access to organizations information assets and systems to third-party service providers (TPSP’s) increases the security risk. As employees and third parties have access to confidential information during their tenure of employment it is crucial that greater emphasis be given to securing threats originating from human resources 17.1.3. The organization may have robust security framework; however, the third party may not have a similar framework, thus placing the information at risk of compromise or theft. The third party may become the weakest link in the security ecosystem of the organization 17.2. Relevance of domain to information security 17.2.1. Personnel are owners, custodian or users of information assets and systems.

Threat and vulnerability management 18.1. Background 18.1.1. Organizations typically deploy security measures to guard against known threats. However, evolving threats add a different set of challenges, which require continuous vigil, monitoring and analysis. The discovery of a new vulnerability, disclosure of a new exploit or emergence of a new malware threat and the capability to incorporate protection from them on a real time basis fall under Threat and Vulnerability Management (TVM) 18.1.2. Keeping the infrastructure security posture up-to-date, scanning the infrastructure for identification of new issues or vulnerabilities that could potentially lead to a security compromise, taking corrective measures in case of a likely compromise, effectively managing infrastructure that inherently is risk prone and delivering a fast response in case of compromise are essential characteristics of the TVM function 18.2. Relevance of domain to information security 18.2.1. ICT Assets (infrastructure and application) are used for creation, processing, transaction, and retention of information. These information assets are vulnerable to attacks because of issues such as configurations gaps or newer vulnerabilities with respect to the infrastructure or unpatched systems, etc. 18.2.2. Compromise of one element of ICT infrastructure may have catastrophic effect jeopardizing security of overall infrastructure and information 18.2.3. ICT infrastructure is increasingly becoming diverse, introducing complexity of dealing with multiple entities and their independencies. This complexity makes managing threats and vulnerabilities a daunting challenge. Information that is stored, transmitted, accessed and processes by these entities will be compromised if their exposure to threats and vulnerabilities are managed effectively 18.2.4. Threat and vulnerability information is diverse in nature reflecting diversity of infrastructure in an organization on the one hand. On the other hand, each element of ICT infrastructure is made up of components sourced from around the globe.

Virtualization 22.1. Background 22.1.1. Virtualization allows the creation of virtual versions of an ICT asset or resource such as desktop, a server, a storage device or other network resources. Devices, applications and human users are able to interact with virtual resource as if it forms a real logical resource. One or more combination of several Virtual Machines (VMs) may be used for ICT operations. Various forms of virtualization exist such as server virtualization, desktop virtualization, application virtualization and operating system virtualization etc. 22.1.2. The virtual machines are managed by a virtual machine manager also known as the hypervisor. A hypervisor manages various VMs on a physical machine and controls the flow of instructions between a Virtual Machine and the underlying physical infrastructure such as CPU, Storage disk etc. A hypervisor may either run directly on the hardware, or as an application on top of an existing operating system referred to as the host OS. The VM running on top of the host operating system (host OS) is known as the guest operating system (guest OS) 22.1.3. Virtualization presents organizations with tremendous opportunities, as well as some significant security challenges. It provides the basis for the convergence of mobile and cloud computing, allowing organizations to consolidate resources, improve responsiveness and become agile in a cost effective manner. However, such consolidation of physical infrastructure and the creation of hybrid environments lead to the emergence of new types of risks for the organization. A virtualization platform must be able to securely segregate multiple workloads consolidated from mixed trust zones and host them from a single pool of shared system resources 22.1.4. Organizations should undertake an assessment of security risks and evaluate the risks associated with operating an ICT component in a non-virtualized environment compared with those in a virtual environment. The security of a virtualized environment largely depends on the individual security of each component, from the hypervisor and host OS to the VMs, applications and storage. Virtualization technologies also connect to network infrastructure and storage networks and require careful planning with regard to access controls, user permissions, and traditional security controls.

Security testing 24.1. Background 24.1.1. Security testing is the process of determining how effectively an entity being assessed meets specific security objectives. The process is intended to reveal flaws in the security mechanisms of an information system that protects data and maintain functionality as intended. Organizations conduct focused security testing with vulnerability assessment to discover and identify security vulnerabilities followed by penetration testing to simulate an attack by a malicious party and involves exploitation of found vulnerabilities to gain further access 24.1.2. Security testing uncovers the current state of security in the organization to safeguard three main objectives of confidentiality, availability and integrity. It helps organizations to strengthen the security by mitigating and addressing all the vulnerabilities and weaknesses found as a result of the exercise. This further enhances organization’s defenses against the exploitation of vulnerabilities by the attackers 24.1.3. In the absence of appropriate security testing, present vulnerabilities may go unaddressed and exploitation by attackers may incur huge reputational and financial losses to the organization. 24.2. Security testing management guidelines 24.2.1.

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework 1.1. Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity was the subject of the Executive Order 13636, issued by President Obama on February 12, 2013. It vested the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with the responsibility of developing a voluntary cybersecurity framework. NIST coordinated the industry-led effort that draws on existing standards, guidelines, and best practices, to develop the Cybersecurity Framework. The Framework, aimed at the owners and operators of the critical infrastructure, is expected to help reduce cyber risks to critical infrastructure. NIST began the development of the Cybersecurity Framework by issuing a Request for Information (RFI) in February, 2013, to gather relevant input from industry, academia, and other stakeholders to:  Identify existing cybersecurity standards, guidelines, frameworks, and best practices that are applicable to increase the security of critical infrastructure sectors and other interested entities;  Specify high-priority gaps for which new or revised standards are needed; and  Collaboratively develop action plans by which these gaps can be addressed 1.1.1. The idea was to use existing standards, guidelines and best practices to reduce cyber risk across sectors and develop capabilities to address the full-range of quickly changing threats. The framework will provide a flexible toolkit any business or other organization can use to gauge how well prepared it is to manage cyber risks and what can be done to strengthen its defenses 1.1.2. It is vital that companies understand their digital assets and accurately assess the maturity of their cyber protections so they can properly allocate resources. They need to continuously invest in maintaining awareness of existing threats to preventing, detecting, and responding to attacks to recovering from them. 1.1.3. The Framework to reduce Cyber Risks to Critical Infrastructure, after several rounds of public consultation, was released in February, 2014 1.2. Outline of Cybersecurity Framework: The focus is on defining the overall Framework and provides guidance on its usage. The Framework is intended to be used throughout the organization. 1.2.1. Senior executives can use it to evaluate how prepared they are to deal with potential cybersecurity-related impacts on their assets, and on their ability to deliver their business services and products 1.2.2. User guide will help organizations understand how to apply the Framework. It is not a detailed manual; it will help users at different levels to: 1.2.2.1. Understand and assess the cybersecurity capabilities, readiness, and risks of their organizations National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 225 1.2.2.2. Identify areas of strength and weakness and aspects of cybersecurity on which they should productively focus, and learn what informative standards, guidelines, and practices are available and applicable to their organizations 1.3. The Framework’s core structure: 1.3.1. Five major cybersecurity functions and their categories, sub-categories, and information references. Key functions: Know, Prevent, Detect, Respond, and Recover. Broken further into categories, e.g. prevent categories: identity and access management, physical security, and training and awareness. It further identifies underlying key sub-categories. Then matches them with informative references such as existing standards, guidelines, and practices for each sub-category. A matrix showing the functions, categories, sub-categories, and informative references is provided. 1.3.2. Three Framework Implementation Levels (FILs) associated with an organization’s cybersecurity functions and how well that organization implements the framework. Three implementation levels reflect organizational maturity. The approach rolls up functions and FILs in a way that allows them to assess an organization’s risk and readiness viewed through their specific roles and responsibilities – whether they are senior executives, business process managers, or operations managers. 1.3.3. A compendium of informative references, existing standards, guidelines, and practices to assist with specific implementation 1.4. The Framework has been designed and is intended to: 1.4.1. Be an adaptable, flexible, and scalable tool for voluntary use 1.4.2. Assist in assessing, measuring, evaluating, and improving an organization’s readiness to deal with cybersecurity risks 1.4.3. Be actionable across an organization 1.4.4. Be prioritized, flexible, repeatable, performance-based, and cost-effective to rely on standards, methodologies, and processes that align with policy, business, and technological approaches to cybersecurity 1.4.5. Complement rather than to conflict with current regulatory authorities 1.4.6. Promote, rather than to constrain, technological innovation in this dynamic arena 1.4.7. Focus on outcomes 1.4.8. Raise awareness and appreciation for the challenges of cybersecurity but also the means for understanding and managing the related risks 1.4.9. Be consistent with voluntary international standards 1.5. The NIST cybersecurity framework (provides a “language for expressing, understanding and managing cybersecurity risk, both internally and externally”. It helps in identification and prioritization of actions for reducing risk and provides a tool for aligning policy, business and technological approaches to managing risk. The core framework consists of five functions: 1.5.1. Identify: develop visibility over systems, assets, data and capabilities which need to be protected, in accordance with their criticality National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 226 1.5.2. Protect: develop and implement appropriate safeguards, prioritizing through the organizations risk management process 1.5.3. Detect: develop and implement appropriate activities to identify occurrence of a breach of event 1.5.4. Respond: develop and implement appropriate activities to take action regarding a detected breach or event 1.5.5. Recover: develop and implement appropriate activities, to restore the appropriate capabilities that we impaired through a breach or event B. DSCI Security Framework 1.1. Numerous organizations worldwide have adopted widely accepted & internationally recognized security frameworks and standards such as ISO 27001, which provide guidance & direction for establishing enterprise wide security program, processes and procedures. But problem arises when organizations channelize investments and resources to demonstrate compliance to such standards (e.g. extensive documentation, huge checklists) instead of identifying and mitigating real risks. Similar case has been observed with FISMA implementation in the United States – compliance to it has taken precedence over real security concerns in the networks and systems of the federal agencies. Thus focus has shifted towards the compliance, leaving maturity aspect at bay. 1.2. Given the rate at which attack proliferation has happened, and data breach incidents are increasing, organizations today need to develop and integrate a comprehensive security program to stay at pace with the attackers and attack vectors to stay secure. Threat environment in which we operate is getting complex and dynamic; attackers are evolving innovative techniques. In such a scenario, organizations cannot solely rely on certifications alone; though it may help provide assurance and demonstrate organization’s commitment to their stakeholders and outside world. Though ISO 27001 standard, is a good starting point for organizations for implementing security, it is not an end by itself. When organizations operate in a vibrant, dynamic, evolving and competent environment – be it business, regulatory or threat environment as in case of security, organizations can only survive if they are able to draw a roadmap for coming years that entails future conditions & requirements, strategic options, building required competencies, etc. and not just focus on the present. This is achieved by doing long term planning and drawing a strategy to achieve the defined goals. But how many organizations today have a security strategy? How many organizations have a 5 year vision for security? Unfortunately - not many. Though, ISO 27001 has been phenomenal in establishing enterprise wide security processes, it falls short in the following areas: 1.2.1. Long Term Strategic Planning in Security –Today, security practitioners strongly believe that security should be treated as a business enabler and not as a hurdle – adding value to business, by allowing business to offer innovative solutions & services to international markets round the clock, increasing productivity, reducing cost, providing customer delight, etc. If such an approach needs to materialize, security needs to be revitalized by working more closely with the business and IT and being given strategic importance within the organization. Unfortunately, many standards are controls based standard - controls that are static in nature, National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 227 focused on mitigating the existing risks, not focused on addressing the futuristic requirements / risks that emerge from business expansion and innovation 1.2.2. Building Security Capability / Competence, using Maturity Criteria - Security is a continuous journey, and no organization can be 100% secure. However, it is important to measure the progress made / capabilities built over a period of time to address the evolving and perennial threats. This can be achieved by defining criteria against which an organization can measure its capability maturity in security. Many standards on the other hand promotes a ‘yes/no’ kind of approach to security, wherein an organization is certified as fully compliant if it has implemented the relevant controls. It does not provide any maturity criteria, which organizations can leverage to improve their security competence 1.2.3. Focus on Protecting Data – Many standards follow an asset centric and process oriented standard. Processes help provide guidelines for conducting operational tasks in a pre-defined manner, but if too much focus is given on processes, then it may happen that the objective for deploying a particular process may get lost (outcome may not be achieved). This also at times results in loss of productivity and is perceived as bureaucratic. In today’s digital world, data has an economic value attached to it. In fact, in some industries like pharmaceutical, data is the life line of the organizations operating in the sector. Hackers and rogue insiders vie for this critical data. In such a scenario, the focus of all the security efforts should be on data, with lean processes and intelligent technologies deployed to protect it 1.2.4. Tracking Security Evolution – Security as a discipline has evolved over a period of time. The stimuli have been many - the dynamic threat landscape, strengthening regulatory regime, research & innovation, globalization, business models, technologies, etc. For an organization to be secure it is important that it keeps track of all the latest developments taking place in the field of security – be it skills, technologies or services. Today, specific security disciplines have evolved with very specific approaches to address the unique challenges faced. Specific trends and practices have been emerging to address the exact requirements of an individual discipline. The security market, both technology products and services, has solution offerings specific to an individual discipline. Security profession is also charting a path of specialization in these individual security disciplines. For e.g. Management of threats & vulnerabilities is a very critical discipline today, requiring specific skills, technologies and practices. Similarly, disciplines like Secure Content Management, Governance, Risk and Compliance do not find their rightful place in ISO 27001 standard. It fails to provide strategic and contemporary directions and guidance to organizations that are implementing and maintaining security 1.2.5. Integration and Interdependencies – Security disciplines, as explained in the point above, have number of interdependencies and therefore there is need for taking an integrated approach that links these disciplines appropriately for better protection. For e.g. Security Incident Management as a discipline requires inputs from Threat & Vulnerability Management, Infrastructure Management, Application Development, etc. to be effective. The ISO 27001 standard does not take such an integrative approach as it is focused on individual controls that are described and deployed in silos 1.2.6. There is a need to approach security differently - a way that helps overcome the above shortcomings of ISO 27001 and enables an organization focus on real threats in its environment, without worrying about compliance to regulations. It should be able to assess National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 228 organization’s maturity in implementing security in different areas with a view to continually improve the same. Such an assessment should further help organization draw a strategic plan based on evolution of different disciplines of security, and their interdependencies, with continuous focus on protecting data. Compliance should be the outcome along with dynamic and vibrant security that enables quick response to threats, vulnerabilities and actual cyber- attacks 1.3. DSCI Security Framework (DSF©) is based on the following three foundational elements: 1.3.1. Security Principles: Starting point of DSF© is a set of security principles that an organization should seek to adhere to. These include information visibility, vigilance, coverage & accuracy, discipline in defense; focus on strategic, tactical and operational layers and compliance demonstration. DSCI believes that approach to security which is based on these principles helps remove the focus from extensive documentation, checklists and controls, and enables an organization achieve dynamism in security which gives it the agility to respond to threats and attacks. 1.3.2. Discipline Specific Approach: DSF© view of security is discipline-specific. Unlike other standards, it does not specify any controls. Instead, it outlines best practices in these disciplines that are based on recent learning by organizations, analysts, and technology and solution providers. It leaves to the organization to select and implement controls specific to its operating environment and business requirements 1.3.3. It identifies maturity criteria in each of the 16 disciplines that form part of DSF©. While these disciplines are organized in four layers, it encourages organizations to focus on each individual discipline of security by implementing best practices, and moving up in maturity rating by using the maturity criteria. Focus on individual disciplines, and striving to achieve excellence in them is the path to real security. National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 229 1.3.4. Data-Centric Methodology. DSCI focuses on a ‘Visibility’ exercise, which brings a consolidated view of data at the central level. It analyses and identifies the integrated view of the data within the findings. It creates a risk profile that is data centric. DSCI makes uses of its Best Practices approach to evaluate strategic options, both in terms of the processes and technological solutions available for addressing these risks, and strengthening the security posture. DSCI believes that once visibility over data is created at the central level, it is easier to bring dynamism in the security program as recent trends, vulnerabilities and incidents can be considered and appropriate risk management measures can be taken on a continuous basis. 1.3.5. Corollary to the visibility exercise is the establishment of privacy initiatives in the organization, since the flow of personal information processed reveals exposure to privacy risks at various stages. The DSCI Privacy Framework (DPF©), which has identified nine privacy principles for achieving privacy in an organization, through the implementation of nine best practices which are organized in three layers – Privacy Strategy & Processes, Information Usage, Access, Monitoring & Training and Personal Information Security for establishing privacy initiatives in an organization, helps an organization do that 1.4. Practices in each discipline of DSF© have been articulated under the following four sections: 1.4.1. Approach to the Security Discipline: DSCI believes that there is a significant requirement of discussing the approaches, trends and practices that are driving an individual discipline. This section in each discipline articulates DSCI approach towards the discipline under discussion. 1.4.2. Strategy for the Security Discipline: DSCI also believes that each security discipline deserves a strategic treatment that will not only mature its endeavor but also optimize the resources and efforts deployed. For each discipline, DSCI recommend approaches and processes that help take a strategic review of an organization’s initiatives. This section will help managers to provide a strategic direction to the organization’s initiatives in each discipline. 1.4.3. Best Practices for the Security Discipline: DSCI recognizes a need for providing a detailed guidance for systematically planning and implementing security in the organization. This section, in each discipline, compiles the best practices for the security implementer. 1.4.4. Maturity of the Security Discipline: DSCI believes in assessment of the outcomes and for fair assessment, comprehension of appropriate parameters is necessary. The DSF© has defined a total of 170 maturity criteria for the 16 disciplines. 1.4.5. DSF© especially through its maturity criteria can be used to determine an organization’s security capability in different disciplines of security. This can be of particular relevance in outsourcing relationships where client organizations want to determine the overall and / or Line of Service specific security capability of service provider organizations. National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 230 1.5. Framework Benefits DSF© offers key benefits as follows: Offers a set of principles for implementation of true security Helps align security to current trends understanding & practices Focuses on bringing relevance to security, hence, realistic security Provides means to improve dynamism in security Ensures comprehensiveness & coverage through the disciplines Provides strategic directions to security initiatives Offers detailed guidance for implementation Supports maturity improvement through outcome based metrics Promises revitalization of security initiatives for data security Provides means for integration, convergence & collaboration Content support to manager, implementer, consultant, auditor Comprehensive and structured ecosystem around the framework C. PCI – DSS 1.1. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of requirements designed to ensure that companies that process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment and that operations and transactions are secure 1.2. The Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) was launched on September 7, 2006 to manage the ongoing evolution of the Payment Card Industry (PCI) security standards with focus on improving payment account security throughout the transaction process. The PCI DSS is administered and managed by the PCI SSC ( an independent body that was created by the major payment card brands (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover and JCB.). The Standard can be found here: 1.3. PCI DSS 2.0 (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 2.0) is the second version and was released in 2010. The third revision is due in 2014.It is important to note, the payment brands and acquirers are responsible for enforcing compliance, not the PCI council. 1.4. The PCI DSS specifies and elaborates on six major objectives1: 1.4.1. First, a secure network must be maintained in which transactions can be conducted. This requirement involves the use of firewalls that are robust enough to be effective without causing undue inconvenience to cardholders or vendors. Specialized firewalls are available for wireless LANs, which are highly vulnerable to eavesdropping and attacks by malicious hackers. In addition, authentication data such as personal identification numbers (PINs) and passwords must not involve defaults supplied by the vendors. Customers should be able to conveniently and frequently change such data 1.4.2. Second, cardholder information must be protected wherever it is stored. Repositories with vital data such as dates of birth, mothers' maiden names, Social Security numbers, phone numbers and mailing addresses should be secure against hacking. When cardholder data is transmitted through public networks, that data must be encrypted in an effective way. Digital 1 Industry-Data-Security-Standard National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 231 encryption is important in all forms of credit-card transactions, but particularly in e-commerce conducted on the Internet 1.4.3. Third, systems should be protected against the activities of malicious hackers by using frequently updated anti-virus software, anti-spyware programs, and other anti-malware solutions. All applications should be free of bugs and vulnerabilities that might open the door to exploits in which cardholder data could be stolen or altered. Patches offered by software and operating system (OS) vendors should be regularly installed to ensure the highest possible level of vulnerability management 1.4.4. Fourth, access to system information and operations should be restricted and controlled. Cardholders should not have to provide information to businesses unless those businesses must know that information to protect themselves and effectively carry out a transaction. Every person who uses a computer in the system must be assigned a unique and confidential identification name or number. Cardholder data should be protected physically as well as electronically. Examples include the use of document shredders, avoidance of unnecessary paper document duplication, and locks and chains on dumpsters to discourage criminals who would otherwise rummage through the trash 1.4.5. Fifth, networks must be constantly monitored and regularly tested to ensure that all security measures and processes are in place, are functioning properly, and are kept up-do-date. For example, anti-virus and anti-spyware programs should be provided with the latest definitions and signatures. These programs should scan all exchanged data, all applications, all random- access memory (RAM) and all storage media frequently if not continuously 1.4.6. Sixth, a formal information security policy must be defined, maintained, and followed at all times and by all participating entities. Enforcement measures such as audits and penalties for non-compliance may be necessary 1.5. The 12 requirements of PCI DSS are as follows: 1.5.1. Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data 1.5.2. Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters 1.5.3. Protect stored cardholder data 1.5.4. Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks 1.5.5. Use and regularly update antivirus software 1.5.6. Develop and maintain secure systems and applications 1.5.7. Restrict access to cardholder data by business need-to-know 1.5.8. Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access 1.5.9. Restrict physical access to cardholder data 1.5.10. Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data 1.5.11. Regularly test security systems and processes 1.5.12. Maintain a policy that addresses information security National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 232 D. SANS 20 Controls 1.1. SANS has created the “20 Critical Security Controls” as a way of providing effective cyber defense against current and likely future Internet based attacks. Following these 20 controls will help establish, in their words, a “prioritized baseline of information security measures and controls.” The target audience is Federal enterprise environments but it certainly could be used by commercial organizations. 1.2. It is a set of recommendations developed by a consortium of companies with the purpose of identifying specific controls that will make systems safer. In addition, most of the controls can be automated to various degrees through the use of tools.2 1.3. They offer a prioritized list of controls that have the greatest impact on improving security posture against real-world threats. Consortium for Cybersecurity Action (CCA) was established in 2012 to ensure that updated versions of the Critical Controls incorporate the most relevant threat information and to share lessons learned by organizations implementing them. The Critical Controls encompass and amplify efforts over the last decade to develop security standards, including the Security Content Automation Program (SCAP) sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Associated Manageable Network Plan Milestones and Network Security Tasks developed by the National Security Agency (NSA).3 1.4. The presentation of each Critical Control includes: 1.4.1. Proof that the control blocks known attacks and an explanation of how attackers actively exploit the absence of this control. 1.4.2. Listing of the specific actions that organizations are taking to implement, automate, and measure effectiveness of this control. The sub-controls are grouped into four categories: 1.4.3. Quick wins that provide solid risk reduction without major procedural, architectural, or technical changes to an environment, or that provide such substantial and immediate risk reduction against very common attacks that most security-aware organizations prioritize these key controls. 1.4.4. Visibility and attribution measures to improve the process, architecture, and technical capabilities of organizations to monitor their networks and computer systems to detect attack attempts, locate points of entry, identify already-compromised machines, interrupt infiltrated attackers' activities, and gain information about the sources of an attack. 1.4.5. Improved information security configuration and hygiene to reduce the number and magnitude of security vulnerabilities and improve the operations of networked computer systems, with a focus on protecting against poor security practices by system administrators and end-users that could give an attacker an advantage. 1.4.6. Advanced sub-controls that use new technologies that provide maximum security but are harder to deploy or more expensive than commoditized security solutions. 2 3 National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 233 E. NIST 800-53 1.1. NIST Special Publication 800-53, \"Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations,\" catalogs security controls for all U.S. federal information systems except those related to national security. It is published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which is a non-regulatory agency of the United States Department of Commerce. NIST develops and issues standards, guidelines, and other publications to assist federal agencies in implementing the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) and to help with managing cost effective programs to protect their information and information systems 1.2. NIST Special Publication 800-53 is part of the Special Publication 800-series that reports on the Information Technology Laboratory’s (ITL) research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in information system security, and on ITL’s activity with industry, government, and academic organizations. The catalog of security controls in Special Publication 800-53 can be effectively used to protect information and information systems from traditional and advanced persistent threats in varied operational, environmental, and technical scenarios 1.3. Specifically, NIST Special Publication 800-53 covers the steps in the Risk Management Framework that address security control selection for federal information systems in accordance with the security requirements in Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 200. This includes selecting an initial set of baseline security controls based on a FIPS 199 worst-case impact analysis, tailoring the baseline security controls, and supplementing the security controls based on an organizational assessment of risk. The security rules cover 17 areas including access control, incident response, business continuity, and disaster recoverability 1.4. A key part of the certification and accreditation process for federal information systems is selecting and implementing a subset of the controls (safeguards) from the Security Control Catalog NIST 800-53, (Appendix F). These controls are the management, operational, and technical safeguards (or countermeasures) prescribed for an information system to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information. To implement the needed safeguards or controls, agencies must first determine the security category of their information systems in accordance with the provisions of FIPS 199, “Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems.” The security categorization of the information system (low, moderate or high) determines the baseline collection of controls that must be implemented and monitored. Agencies have the ability to adjust these controls and tailor them to fit more closely with their organizational goals or environments 1.5. The guidelines have been developed to achieve more secure information systems and effective risk management within the federal government by:4 1.5.1. Facilitating a more consistent, comparable, and repeatable approach for selecting and specifying security controls for information systems and organizations; 4 National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 234 1.5.2. Providing a stable, yet flexible catalog of security controls to meet current information protection needs and the demands of future protection needs based on changing threats, requirements, and technologies; 1.5.3. Providing a recommendation for security controls for information systems categorized in accordance with FIPS Publication 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems; 1.5.4. Creating a foundation for the development of assessment methods and procedures for determining security control effectiveness; and 1.5.5. Improving communication among organizations by providing a common lexicon that supports discussion of risk management concepts. 1.6. In addition to the security controls described above, this publication: i) provides a set of information security program management controls that are typically implemented at the organization level and not directed at individual organizational information systems; ii) provides a set of privacy controls based on international standards and best practices that help organizations enforce privacy requirements derived from federal legislation, directives, policies, regulations, and standards; and iii) establishes a linkage and relationship between privacy and security controls for purposes of enforcing respective privacy and security requirements which may overlap in concept and in implementation within federal information systems, programs, and organizations. Standardized privacy controls provide a more disciplined and structured approach for satisfying federal privacy requirements and demonstrating compliance to those requirements. Incorporating the same concepts used in managing information security risk, helps organizations implement privacy controls in a more cost- effective, risked-based manner F. COBIT 1.1. COBIT5 is an IT governance framework and supporting toolset that allows managers to bridge the gap between control requirements, technical issues and business risks. COBIT enables clear policy development and good practice for IT control throughout organizations. COBIT emphasizes regulatory compliance, helps organizations to increase the value attained from IT, enables alignment and simplifies implementation of the COBIT framework. 1.2. With COBIT 5, ISACA introduced a framework for information security. It includes all aspects of ensuring reasonable and appropriate security for information resources. Its foundation is a set of principles upon which an organization should build and test security policies, standards, guidelines, processes, and controls: 1.2.1. Meeting stakeholder needs 1.2.2. Covering the enterprise end-to-end 1.2.3. Applying a single integrated framework 1.2.4. Enabling a holistic approach 1.2.5. Separating governance from management 5 National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 235 1.3. Principle 1: Meeting stakeholder needs6: A group of stakeholders includes any individual or group affected by the current state or future state of a process, system, policy, etc. Stakeholder analysis is the process of identifying stakeholders so that their input can ensure outcomes match requirements. This is an important step in both project planning and risk management. Failure to involve all stakeholders, including InfoSec and audit teams, usually results in less than optimum outcomes at best. Worst case outcomes include failed projects or material audit deficiencies. Successful stakeholder analysis results in maximizing benefits, minimizing risk to or beyond expected outcomes, and optimizing resources. Further, ensuring integration of business and information assurance requirements into the development or acquisition of a solution is always preferable to trying to “hang” something onto a finished—but incomplete— system, network, or a physical controls framework. 1.4. Principle 2: Covering the enterprise end-to-end: Information security is often applied as series of point solutions, as defined in more detail in Principle 3. However, general application of security and assurance best practices requires security reviews as part of all business processes and IT development and implementation activities. This isn’t just a horizontal integration. Rather, all levels of management must include InfoSec in every business strategic and operational planning activity. 1.5. Principle 3: Applying a single integrated framework: Application of security controls is often a point-and-shoot activity. Many organizations tend to fix specific issues without stepping back and applying policies and controls that impact multiple vulnerabilities in network or system attack surfaces. Designing a complete framework includes all aspects of information storage, flow, and processing, providing a foundation for more efficient control implementation. 1.6. Principle 4: Enabling a holistic approach: As support for developing an integrated framework, it’s important to see information security as a set of related components: not as set of silos. Each component is driven by enablers and other factors affecting organization risk. COBIT 5 for Information Security provides a list of enablers and describes how they interrelate. Enablers help organizations integrate operations and security into the outcomes of all principles defined here. As always, this is done in a way to meet stakeholder requirements. 1.7. Principle 5: Separating governance from management: This principle establishes a line between setting objectives and measuring outcomes. According to COBIT 5 for Information Security: “Governance ensures that stakeholder needs, conditions, and options are evaluated to determine balances, agreed-on enterprise objectives to be achieved; setting direction through prioritization and decision making; and monitoring performance and compliance against agreed- on direction and objectives.” While governance and management are separate functions performed by designated teams, they must support each other. Governance defines outcomes and management implements technology and processes to meet those outcomes. Governance then determines if outcomes are met and provides feedback to help management make necessary adjustments. 6 the-underlying-principles/#. National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 236 Annexure 11 – Security as business imperative 1.1. The Cost of Security: Traditionally, Information security has focused resources to keep all assets within the environment of the government ministry/department by building secure firewalls to ward off any attacks. However, with an evolving threat landscape that includes social engineering, spear phishing, etc., there may be several vulnerable attack points, which make it imperative for the security function to be revitalized. If organizations fail to understand the value of their own assets, risk becomes immaterial; therefore it is important to put a value on information from several perspectives. Information security should be seen as a solution that reduces the fear by creating trust. Trust that the risk is taken away and used for malicious intent and activities detrimental to the security and interests of our nation 1.2. Any security breach or loss of information may have an adverse impact on the functioning of government organizations and may have an adverse impact on national security or national interests. A breach in the United States - referred to as wiki-leaks - led to public disclosure of thousands of confidential government reports, documents, intelligence and diplomatic cables; much to the embarrassment of the US government. A security breach may not only cause loss of information and data, but also have a daunting financial effect, loss of reputation and confidence of the public against the government, which may lead to an overall decrease in trust in the government, litigation or lead to adverse conditions for national security and national interests. There have been similar incidents worldwide, as illustrated in the table below. 1.3. Other similar breaches have been reported worldwide and continue to menace governments and the industry. To stay ahead of the evolving security threat curve, government bodies need to be proactive, rather than being reactive to incidents and breaches. The real benefits of a robust security framework and practices and the return on investment made on security may not be directly realized; however organizations need to understand the importance and value of robust security architecture after an incident occurs – which involves additional, avoidable costs to the government. Global studies have indicated that in the majority of cases, investment in quality, effective IT security would have been considerably less than the costs incurred following a breach. National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 237 Annexure 12 – Positioning of security division within the organization 1.1. Security Division traditionally has been part of the IT department within an organization. However, over a period of time, there emerged many elements that needed attention of the security division, which fall outside the boundaries of IT. Security requires organization wide efforts to bring different functions together; establish collaboration that spreads awareness and seeks cooperation; focuses on coordination while managing security affairs, and requires integrated approach while analyzing and solving the problems. Positioning of the security division matters a lot for its effectiveness and security organization has to be independent of IT and perhaps report to the board. Some of the key recommendation for establishing security organization should be: 1.1.1. The growing complexity of managing security, increasing role of security in the success of ventures, and rising exposure of a government organization to these risks necessitates the elevation of security in an organization’s ecosystem. Security should be part of the strategic planning of organization and should be involved in the compliance management or organizations risk management functions. It should coordinate with other government organizations such as departments/ ministry for ensuring security as part of the service delivery 1.1.2. The key skills required by a successful security leader or CISO should be more managerial, collaborative and communicative, rather than primarily technical. She/he should have the ability to build consensus and influence decisions, inside the organization and within IT 1.1.3. The Security leader or CISO should ensure that his team has the necessary skill-set and competencies, both from procedural and technical aspects across relevant security domains within the organization. He/she should ensure that there is adequate number of qualified professionals; and wherever required the gaps should be full-filled through services from subject matter experts by options such as hiring 3rd parties/contracts/offshore models National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 238 Annexure 13 – Risk Assessment for information security 1.1. Purpose 1.1.1. Risk assessments are a means of informing the management on information security risks; provide insights into effectiveness of existing control measures (including alternative plans); and help determine what is necessary to reduce risks to information to a reasonable level 1.1.2. Risk assessment requires application of management policies, procedures and practices to the tasks of identifying, analyzing, treating, and monitoring risk and includes assessment of risk based on the context and criticality of information assets to organizations 1.1.3. As reliance on computer systems and electronic data has grown, information security risk has joined the array of risks that governments and businesses must manage. Regardless of the types of risk being considered, all risk assessments generally include the following elements: 1.1.3.1. Identifying threats that could harm and, thus, adversely affect classified information and information assets. Threats include such things as intruders, criminals, disgruntled employees, terrorists, and natural disasters 1.1.3.2. Identify information security threats relevant to the information they hold 1.1.3.3. Assessing vulnerabilities, both internal and external to organizations 1.1.3.4. Estimating the likelihood that such threats will materialize based on historical information 1.1.3.5. Identifying the value, sensitivity, and criticality of the operations and assets that could be affected should a threat materialize in order to determine which operations and assets are the most important 1.1.3.6. Estimating, the potential losses or damage that could occur if a threat materializes, including recovery costs 1.1.3.7. Analyzing impact (i.e., harm) to national security and internal security, and the likelihood that harm will occur with disclosure, theft or misuse of such information 1.1.3.8. Identifying cost-effective actions to mitigate or reduce the risk. These actions can include implementing new organizational policies and procedures as well as technical or physical controls 1.1.3.9. Deploying appropriate controls or measures which adequately respond to information risk or reduce the impact or help in evaluating the alternative courses of action or determine appropriate courses of action consistent with organizational, and/or national risk acceptance 1.1.3.10. Documenting the results and developing an action plan 1.1.3.11. Assessing the residual risks and undertake monitoring measures for appropriate governance through determination of the effectiveness of risk responses consistent with organizational risk frame and identify risk-impacting changes to organizational information systems National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 239 1.1.3.12. Verifying that planned risk responses are implemented and information security requirements derived from and traceable to organizational functions, national security requirements, government directives, regulations and guidelines are satisfied 1.2. Threats to information 1.2.1. Information systems are subject to threats because of either known or unknown vulnerabilities or the change in the threat landscape or when there are inadequate controls/measures over the known vulnerabilities. 1.2.2. Although addressing vulnerabilities in an operational ecosystem is the primary reason for conducting risk assessment, organization should be aware of the fact that any change in the current process/technological ecosystem or addition of new components (process/technology) may expose it to new security risk that may compromise national security. 1.2.3. The applicability of these threats depends on the details of the evaluation of the vulnerabilities or newer or changed processes, and can have adverse effects on operations and assets, individuals, organizations, and the nation, through exploitation of both known and unknown vulnerabilities compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the information being processed, stored, or transmitted by those systems 1.2.4. Threats to information systems can include purposeful attacks to information system, environmental disruptions, human/machine errors, and structural technological integration issues, process failures, and can result in harm to the national and economic security interests of the country 1.2.5. Therefore, it is imperative that leaders and managers at all levels understand their responsibilities and are held accountable for managing information security risk—that is, the risk associated with the operation and use of information systems that support the IT and operational functions of their organizations. One of the important mitigating factors is clear and unambiguous responsibilities for each role, and positioning trained personnel for that role 1.3. Risk Assessment Indicators 1.3.1. The Risk Assessment table below provides guidance to organizations on indicators of key risks and advises them on the security impact that a trigger might impose on the organization 1.3.2. The model below is indicative and only provides reference ideas for an organization to make use of, while conducting risk assessment exercise 1.4. Scope and Applicability of Risk Assessments 1.4.1. Risk assessment is a key part of effective information security management and facilitates decision making at all tiers of operations including at organization level, operational process level, and information system level. Risk assessments are generally conducted throughout the system development lifecycle, from pre-system acquisition (i.e., solution analysis and technology development), system acquisition (i.e., development and production deployment), and on implementation (i.e. operations/support). National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 240 1.4.2. There are no specific requirements with regard to level of detail that characterizes any particular risk assessment. The methodologies7, tools, and techniques used to conduct such risk assessments or the format and content of assessment results and any associated reporting mechanisms vary from organization to organization depending on requirement and information sensitivity. 1.4.3. Organizations should be cautioned that risk assessments are often not precise instruments of measurement and reflect the limitations of the specific assessment methodologies, tools, and techniques employed; the subjectivity, quality, and trustworthiness of the data used; the interpretation of assessment results; and the skills and expertise of those individuals or groups conducting the assessments. 1.4.4. Risk assessments can support a wide variety of risk-based decisions and activities by organizational officials across all three tiers in the risk management. As organizational functions, processes, information systems, threats, and environments of operation tend to change over time, the validity and usefulness of any risk assessment is bounded with time. Figure 4: Risk Assessment overview 1.5. Key Recommendations 1.5.1. Risk assessment is an important measure of organization effectiveness towards information security and provides management requisite information needed to determine appropriate courses of action in response to identified risks. For providing a comprehensive view to the management, it is imperative that security leaders perform the following: 7 Risk Assessment Methodologies: 1. OCTAVE - 2. COSO - 3. FMEA - National Information Security Policy and Guidelines | Ministry of Home Affairs NISPG - Version 5.0 Restricted Page 241 1.5.1.1. Work with management and department heads to identify information and classify it based on its sensitive to information security. They should develop information security policies and standards that focus on protection of critical processes and technology that have implication on organizational security 1.5.1.2. Adopt a strategic Information risk management approach that balances national requirements with the objectives of the organization. They need to work with the management and department heads to identify and resolve information risks arising from technology or operational process on an ongoing basis 1.5.1.3. Centralize Information security risk program to enable a composite view of risk issues across the organization and its partner ecosystem i.e. suppliers, vendors, service providers, etc. It needs to establish consistent risk assessment and compliance processes that help the organization understand its information security risk exposure 1.5.1.4. Establish clear accountability between the organization and IT for Information security risk and define liabilities in case of breach of information 1.6. Initiating a Risk Assessment 1.6.1. There are various models and methods for assessing risk, and the extent of an analysis and the resources expended can vary depending on the scope of the assessment and the availability of reliable data on risk factors 1.6.2. In addition, the availability of data can affect the extent to which risk assessment results can be reliably quantified. A quantitative approach should estimate the ramification towards national security and internal security due to risk based on (1) the likelihood that a damaging event will occur, or threats on classified information shall be realized, (2) the importance of classified information towards national security and internal security, and (3) the potential costs and consequence of mitigating actions that could be taken 1.6.3. When reliable data is not available to draw such conclusions, a qualitative approach can be taken by defining risk in more subjective and general terms such as high, medium, and low. In this regard, qualitative assessments depend more on the expertise, experience, and judgment of those conducting the assessment. It is also possible to use a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods 1.6.4. A few sample security risk assessment triggers are mentioned in the table below: Trigger Details Security aspects Decisions Known/unknown vulnerability or change in threat landscape Information that may be sensitive to national security Criticality of the information towards national security Is the information under threat of national concern?

These guidelines are based   on the analysis of existing global security standards, and frameworks; and the emerging trends and   discourse in the wake of persistent threats, and cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure of nations   globally.    The scope of MHA’s “National Information Security Policy & Guidelines” encompasses Government   and Public Sector organizations and associated entities and third parties, for protecting the   information under their control or ownership during information’s life-cycle including creation,   storage, processing, accessing, transmission, destruction etc.     The objective of this document is to improve the information security posture of an organization   possessing any information, including classified information, and does not restrict organizations from   adopting additional stringent practices over and above these guidelines. Organizations may evaluate   various additional measures for the security of information they possess for protecting their   information depending upon the sensitivity, criticality and importance of such information in the   overall Internal Security and National Security interest of the country.          National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 2     Foreword    Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has been designated as the lead agency for the protection of the   “Information” in Cyberspace.  The Ministry is tasked with finalizing and issuing guidelines on the   codification and classification, of information, and keeping it updated in the ever expanding   cyberspace.  Earlier, MHA has issued the manual of departmental security instructions 1994 which is   presently applicable and is being used today by all the Government   Ministries/departments/agencies.     The government at all levels, central, state and local, is increasingly using Information and   Communication Technologies (ICT) to enhance productivity, improve efficiency in service delivery,   speed-up development in all sectors of economy and improve the governance while safeguarding   overall Internal Security and National Security interests of the country.   Paper based records, which were earlier held in the files and filing cabinets, are now created, stored,   processed, accessed, transmitted and destroyed in electronic formats.  Such information can be   accessed from different parts of the country by authorized personnel; however, this information is   also vulnerable to unauthorized access which can compromise confidentiality, availability and   integrity of information through cyber-attacks from anywhere in India or from outside the Indian   borders.  Adoption of international standards and best practices for security of information in the   complex and borderless cyber space has, therefore, become paramount to protect national   information assets in the overall national security interest.  This is more important for organizations   dealing with strategic information related to internal security, national security, economic security,   and external affairs which handling large data/ information in electronic format. Also, the critical   infrastructures such as power, banking and finance, telecommunications, transport, air traffic   control etc., which are using ICT for increasing efficiency and productivity, are prone to cyber-  attacks. This can have a crippling effect on the nation’s stability, economy and security.   This policy document on “National Information Security and Guidelines 2014” includes a   comprehensive review of the “Manual on Departmental Security Instructions” of 1994 for the   present day information security requirements in the Cyber space to address the above mentioned   challenges.  It will serve as an extension to the existing “Manual on Departmental Security   Instructions”, 1994 which primarily addresses the handling of the security of paper based   information.     The National Information Security Policy and Guidelines (NISPG) has been prepared by the Ministry   of Home Affairs, based on the experience of the existing security standards and frameworks and the   global best practices and experience of implementation in the wake of expanding information   security threat scenario.  This policy document will supplement the existing guidelines issued by   DeitY, NIC, IB and NTRO for the security of ICT infrastructure, assets, networks, applications, user   management, email etc.  I hope that the organizations directly involved in handling the information   in any form, including the digital form, which is relevant to the internal security and national security   shall implement these guidelines and make further suggestions, if any, to improve the next version   of NISPG.             (Union Home Secretary)      National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 3     Executive summary   The digital world is a reality today in all aspects of our lives. Digital infrastructure is the backbone of   prosperous economies, vigorous research communities, strong militaries, transparent governments   and free societies. Lacs of people across the country rely on the electronic services in cyberspace   every day.  As never before, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is fostering   transnational dialogue and facilitating the global flow of information, goods and services. These   social and trade links have become indispensable to our daily lives as well as the economy of our   country. Critical life-sustaining infrastructures that deliver electricity and water, telecommunication,   Internet and broadband connectivity, control air traffic, and support our financial systems all   depend on networked information systems. The reach of networked technology is pervasive and   global.  For all nations, the underlying digital infrastructure has become a critical national asset.    Therefore improving and securing  this digital infrastructure in all its dimensions including increased   availability of next generation broadband connectivity, citizen/ customer centric applications and   services, security of information, is critical to India’s future.   Traditionally, information available with the government has been safely managed by keeping it in   paper records throughout its lifecycle i.e. creation, storage, access, modification, distribution, and   destruction. However, to make all government services accessible to the common man in his   locality, through efficient service delivery outlets, along with transparency & reliability, the   government has steadily graduated towards using electronic formats of information. Now, several   forms of information have been converted to the electronic format by the ministries, departments   and agencies, both in the central as well as state governments. The classification, storage and   protection of such information in electronic format have always remained an area of concern. The   challenge, as with the information contained in paper format, remains the same, namely the ability   to categorize, protect, archive, discover, and attribute information during its useful life and eventual   destruction. Even though the lifecycle of information remains the same in electronic documents and   online transactions, the methods to secure information in electronic environment are different. In   the present age, the “Manual of Departmental Security Instructions”, issued in 1994, is no longer   sufficient to protect against the threats facing electronic forms of information.    Information security is one of the important components of cyber security and is gradually taking   centre stage in the national security deliberations and discussions. In fact, it has become a key   component of national security design and is shaping international strategies of nations globally.   Threats to information are increasingly organized and targeted, helping criminals, state actors and   hacktivists to reap immense benefits out of information compromise, theft or espionage.   Cybercriminals can carry out identity theft and financial fraud; steal corporate information such as   intellectual property; conduct espionage to steal state and military secrets; and recruit criminals or   disrupt critical infrastructures by exploiting the vulnerabilities in any system connected to the   Internet. The cybercriminals could be located anywhere in the world and they can target a particular   user, system or a particular service in a country or a region. Worse still, the cybercriminals can cover   their tracks so that they cannot be traced. It is extremely difficult to prove whether the   cybercriminal is an individual, a gang, a group of state actors or a nation-state.      As the government broadens the scope of its drive to move towards e-governance and embraces   technology for citizen-centric services, it faces threats from multiple sources. Each government   process or project introduces a different level of complexity as a result of varied data transactions,     National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 4     involvement of multiple players, and exposure to increasing compliance requirements, diverse   operational and infrastructure environments and embracing of technological innovations. This   complexity is true of the private sector as well, even though they are early adopters of technology   and innovation. Such complexity associated with the lifecycle of information poses serious   challenges in managing and governing security and ensuring compliance. Thus, it is essential to   establish a focused policy initiative for the security of information and to sensitize public and private   sector towards national security concerns and drive their actions for securing information. This will   not only secure the IT systems but also instill trust in IT services provided by the government   agencies, which can further expand and help in improved e-governance services to various   stakeholders.    Information security brings up a set of different problems that have the potential to challenge the   comfort in the conventional methods of managing security concerns. Cyber threats do not respect   physical boundaries. They explore and innovate, discovering new methods for compromising   security. Further, the identity of the attacker and the source is difficult to ascertain. Attribution in   cyberspace has emerged as an intimidating challenge. In most cases, it is extremely difficult to   collect irrefutable evidence against a cyber-attacker, and almost impossible to link any cyber-attack   to nation-states, even if clearly established.   Current symptoms of problem in India   Securing sensitive information is important for the strategic security and defense of a country.   Economic stability of the country depends on uninterrupted operations of banking and finance;   critical infrastructure such as power generation and distribution, transport systems of rail, road, air   and sea; which in turn are critical dependent on ICT. It is important for national security and   continued prosperity of people. For example, the financial sector in India uses ICT extensively – it is   an early adopter of leading and emerging technologies. It is not surprising to note that intellectual   property developed both in public and private sector also contributes to the economic growth of a   nation in a knowledge based economy. Cyberattacks are specially targeted at companies and   organizations to steal intellectual property in what is known as economic espionage. Malware like   Stuxnet and Flame have provided evidence of cyberattacks leading to kinetic and long lasting   damage to strategic capabilities of a nation, and of espionage, respectively.     The public sector, although increasingly relying on ICT, has not fully awakened to the challenges of   information security. The private sector, which makes investments in information security for   intrinsic requirements, needs to ensure that these security practices are also aligned with national   security concerns. So far, even though focus has been on improving ICT systems and providing e-  governance services by various institutions, the IT systems and business processes have not placed   the desired emphasis on Information Security. The time has come to drive both sectors towards a   strong information security culture, which is sensitive to national imperatives.  There have been   revisions of Departmental Security Instructions and Guidelines from DeitY, IB, NIC and NTRO to   streamline and tighten up the various aspects of documentation, personnel and physical security   procedures. However, a comprehensive approach for managing information security was missing.     Consideration of the underlying causes of the problem   Information security is not merely a technology problem; it requires alignment with organizational   processes as well as the legal and regulatory framework in the nation. However, for successful and     National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 5     optimized implementation of security, organizations need to weigh their strategic and financial   options, establish a policy framework to set directions, define or comply with standards for ensuring   baseline, establish procedures for ensuring consistency of operations and issue guidelines for   implementation which must be carried out in spirit, and not just for the sake of obtaining a   certificate. The compliance to the defined Information Security (IS) processes/ guidelines needs to   be periodically audited both by internal and external auditors. Organizations are yet to awaken   completely to embrace these challenges and incorporate measures and align their efforts to the   cause of national security. The drivers for security go beyond securing ICT assets and protection of   intellectual property rights (IPRs), where public and private entities have invested the bulk of their   resources and efforts. Cyber Security and National Security require adequate priority and attention   from organizations, beyond their usual areas of focus. Information security policy measures should   address the requirements of legal framework, provide strategic measures and develop a mechanism   to address various problems related to standards, procedures and guidelines. The policy needs to be   aligned to the requirements of National Security, Cyber Security, IPR and Privacy protection.   The National Information Security Policy and Guidelines   Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has been entrusted with the responsibility of coordinating and   overseeing information security initiatives of public as well as private sector. It is empowered to   create a National Information Security Policy and Guidelines (NISPG), define procedures for handling   information and issue guidelines for security of classified information assets. Accordingly, a Cyber   Security Committee under the chairmanship of Joint Secretary, MHA with members from other   stakeholder organizations was formed for this purpose. However, draft guidelines on protection of   information in cyberspace and codification and classification (of electronic documents), prepared by   this committee was not found to be comprehensive. In view of the fact that MHA and Intelligence   Bureau (IB) do not have in-house expertise to handle a highly technical and advanced subject like   this, it was proposed to outsource the work to National Institute of Smart Governance (NISG)/Data   Security Council of India (DSCI) to develop a robust and comprehensive policy document, given   DSCI’s experience in developing the DSCI Security Framework (DSF©), which was formulated in   consultation with the Indian Industry which has experience in offering secure IT solutions to clients   in over 90 countries, and DSCI’s engagement with International Standards Organization (ISO) in the   development of global security standards   The work plan for creation of NISPG included a study of existing laws, regulations and practices   within the Government of India, international best practices followed worldwide and security   requirements of various regulatory bodies. A review of global best practices, frameworks and   information security standards was undertaken to understand and incorporate global learnings and   align the developed practices with the same. Two workshops involving senior representatives from   about 40 public sector organizations and Industry were also conducted, in addition to receiving their   inputs over email. Based on learnings from these frameworks, emerging disciplines, and viewpoint   of the industry, specific guidelines and detailed control objective and statements have been   developed. This policy document will supplement the existing guidelines issued by Deity, NIC, IB and   NTRO  for the security of ICT infrastructure, assets, networks, applications etc. and would serve as   an extension to the existing Manual on Departmental Security Instructions of 1994, which primarily   addresses the handling of the  security of paper based information.         National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 6     Approach   This document elaborates baseline Information security policy and highlights the relevant security   concepts and best practices, which government ministries, departments, and organizations must   implement to protect their information. The policy recommends creation of a security division   within each government organization, with the responsibility of planning, implementing and   governing all tasks related with information security in a comprehensive and focused manner. The   security division is expected to perform risk analysis based on threat and risk assessment emanating   from the adoption of technology. Further, the document provides guidance and control objectives   aligned in eight main domains and six additional areas which form the core of information security   practices and frameworks globally. These domains are essential for implementation of an effective   information security program, since they address the specifics which have become essential for its   effectiveness. The contribution of each domain to the success of the information security program is   intertwined with the level of maturity and success of all the other domains. Thus, together they help   create a baseline for a robust information security program.   The following core domains have been covered as part of this document. These are:   1. Network and Infrastructure security   2. Identity, access and privilege management   3. Physical security   4. Application security   5. Data security   6. Personnel security   7. Threat and vulnerability management and   8. Security and incident management   Further, guidelines have been provided for technology specific ICT deployment and trends:   1. Cloud computing   2. Mobility and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)   3. Virtualization   4. Social media   Additionally, guidelines for essential security practices have been provided:   1. Security testing   2. Security auditing   3. Business continuity   4. Open source technology   Each domain is supported by a brief introduction about its relevance to information security along   with an outline of the importance of establishing practices pertinent to that domain. This is   supported by essential guidelines which encompass various processes and procedures under which   the information may traverse during its lifecycle.      National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 7     The guidelines are reinforced with the help of specific control objectives and statements which will   help organizations initiate their journey towards establishing a security baseline and further help   them in obtaining maturity in these practices. To help the readers of this document appreciate the   work already undertaken globally in the field of information security, the annexures have been   updated with a brief summary of some globally accepted information security frameworks,   standards and practices. The readers can comprehend the guidelines and controls provided in this   document, from the  detailed chart which provides  mapping of guidelines and controls mentioned   in this manual with that of other globally accepted frameworks, standards, practices and controls   such as  ISO 27001 (2005 as well as 2013), SANS 20, NTRO 40 and FISMA. There are 112 different   guidelines and 135 controls and 181 implementation guidelines defined in NISP as against 133   controls in ISO 27001, 40 controls defined by NTRO, 20 controls by SANS  and about 200 controls by   FISMA. Further, some guidance has also been provided on the methodology which may be used by   the organizations for carrying out risk assessments for the purpose of information security.   The first and second drafts of the “National Information Security Policy and Guidelines” (NISPG)   were circulated by MHA in January 2014. Since then, feedback and suggestions have been received   from various ministries, departments and agencies on the guidelines contained in the NISPG. The   feedback received has provided valuable insight into specific areas to improve the guidelines.   Further guidance was added in Version 3.0 of the document encompassing areas such as business   continuity, security testing and security audits. Additionally, guidance on securing technology   specific areas has also been incorporated, based on the feedback received from various   departments. These guidelines include security measures for cloud computing, BYOD and   virtualization. In the current version i.e. NISPG 4.0, implementation guidelines have been added to   help organizations in comprehending requirements of each domain, along with additional controls   and areas that have emerged after the feedback from some other government agencies.   Establishing visibility over information and its lifecycle   Organizations need to establish a process of identification and discovery of information at each of its   operational processes, relationships and functions. Information is an empowerment and has a   strategic as well as an economic value associated with it. The security posture of the organization   has to be dynamic and should evolve with the change in the value of information, underlying ICT   infrastructure, information access methods and threat ecosystem. It should have the ability to   address the security requirements of all data transactions across all possible data leakage scenarios.   The  security solutions should help address security of information, not only at the different layers of   ICT infrastructure, but also in the extended operational ecosystem, i.e. other ministries and agencies   may be given access to information. This should also provide guidance for securing emerging   technology platforms such as mobility, cloud computing, virtualization etc. While designing the   strategy for security, information centric approach in operational lifecycle should be an important   consideration. The identified information item and its characteristics such as its origin, sensitivity,   strategic and economic value,  geography of operation, access methods and the department(s) or   the financial ecosystem  within which transactions take place along with the operations performed   on the information help identify the security requirements.   Developing an information centric security framework   The consideration of information security in the life cycle is important from people, process and   technical design perspective. Information can be classified based on its category or type, sensitivity,     National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 8     value and the context throughout its life cycle. The departments should ensure that there exists a   structural thought process in designing information security initiatives, such that adequate   measures are taken with respect to formation, grouping and arrangement of countermeasures for   security of information. It is also important that adequate efforts are taken for integrating   information security measures with the enterprise ICT architecture to address contemporary and   changing threats to information. Moreover, an organization should have capability towards   responsiveness to the new issues or threats through integrating internal and external intelligence   measures, deployment of tools, techniques and methods in identifying threats, collaboration   mechanisms which generate timely and desired response from other security and ICT infrastructure   management processes. Finally, departments should have the ability to identify, alert, evoke   responses and resolve a data breach in a timely manner. This requires integration with other   security processes and ICT infrastructure management processes, arrangement and relationships   with external parties or bodies and standardization of procedures defined and deployed for handling   data breaches. To make all this possible, departments need to focus on establishing accountability   through design and implementation of an ownership structure for information security, where tasks   and responsibilities are clearly distributed with respect to administrative and technical   arrangements required for information security.    The way forward   Increasing digitization of information, expanding exposure of government organizations due to   connectivity and the use of external providers, rising dependence on the global ICT supply chain are   posing serious threats to information security. Growing instances of cyber espionage involving   serious information breaches, call for action at a higher level. The Government of India recognizes   this challenge – more so in the context of national security.   National Information Security Policy and Guidelines, which focuses on security of information   possessed both by public (Government and PSUs) and private sector, is an important step towards   achieving new age goals of national cyber security. The policy is directed to build and foster an   ecosystem for information security in the organizations (operating in public as well as private   domain) that addresses the National Security requirements.

Overview   1.1. Background   1.1.1. Traditionally, information available with the government has been safely managed by keeping   it in paper records throughout its life cycle i.e. when it is created, stored, accessed, modified,   distributed, and destroyed. This information could be strategic, demographical, historical,   legal, or may contain financial statements, procedural documents, data of citizens, industry or   resources etc. Even though the lifecycle of information remains the same in electronic   documents, the methods to secure information in electronic environment are significantly   different. The challenges, as with the information contained in paper format, remain of similar   nature, namely the ability to categorize, protect, archive, discover, transmit and attribute   information during its useful life and eventual destruction   1.1.2.  Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has empowered the government to create   generate, store, transmit, and access information with much ease and efficiency. However,   the importance of incorporating effective, state-of-the-art information security measures is   being realized now. The departments, agencies and divisions recognize the security concerns   in the electronic environment and are creating policies to secure the information in all stages   of information lifecycle. The government and its officers have tremendous experience in   securing paper documents. For example, several manual methods such as use of catalogs and   paper-based chain-of-custody logs help keep track of the locations of files within secure   record rooms. It is also known that information in the paper format may be exposed to   physical damage, fraud or modification which may be sometimes difficult to track. The   government is aware of the benefits of  electronic form of information - it has not only been   able  to identify and gain visibility over the type of information available with its various   departments, and agencies, but also attribute changes or modification to this information to   specific personnel, thus making it easier to categorize, archive, discover and attribute   1.1.3. The government organizations deploy a number of technologies and in the process access,   store and analyze vast amount of information. While the ease of access to information in the   electronic format has helped revitalize governance, there are a number of threats which are   emerging and required to be tackled on top priority. Today, information has acquired critical   status for regulatory initiatives, policies and strategies, e-Governance, user services, financial   transactions; however, security threats are becoming more organized and targeted, which   pose serious threats – and in the event of any compromise of information, it could lead to   major threats to internal and national security, and/or embarrassment to the government.   Information is the reason for empowerment as well as a concern of threat for government   organizations and needs a specific and granular focus on information which is created, stored,   processed, transacted or accessed. Additionally, the IT infrastructure of a government   organization is getting significantly transformed through increasing use of technical   innovations, work-flow applications, mobility and extension to allow its usage by other   stakeholders, partners, and service providers from the private sector   1.1.4. Complexity of information is a big hurdle in managing and governing security, privacy and   compliance. Each government process or project introduces a different level of complexity as   a result of wide-ranging data transactions, involvement of multiple stakeholders, exposure to     National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 14     diverse set of infrastructure environments, networks, devices, platforms and information   assets   1.2. Key areas of national concern for ministries/ departments/ agencies (management)   1.2.1. Meeting dynamic security threats: Protecting information has not typically been considered   as a strategic element by the top level executives  in the ministries/ departments/ agencies   (management); even after promulgating various regulatory measures, global threats and many   security incidents. Information security remains an afterthought, either as a line item or –   even worse – not addressed at all by the top bureaucracy in the ministries/ departments/   agencies. The growing complexity of managing information security, rising exposure of an   organization and close inter-linkage of Government information with the strategic security of   the nation necessitates the elevation of the security function.   1.2.2. Creating visibility over activities and operations: The security threat environment is   becoming more widespread and dangerous and it is important that ministries/ departments/   agencies have visibility over their activities, functions and operations. Security as a discipline   has also evolved over a period of time. The stimuli have been many - the dynamic threat   landscape, threats to national security, internal security concerns, strengthening regulatory   regime, privacy issues, economic value of information,  research & innovation, globalization,   business models, emerging technologies, etc.    1.2.3. Intelligence gathering, knowledge management and skill development: For an organization   to be secure in today’s technology driven work environment, it is important that it keeps track   of all the latest developments in the field of information security – be it skills, technologies or   services. An organization is required to provide strategic attention to security through   commitment in all the facets of information security i.e. people, process and technology. It   should be equipped with adequate knowledge, tools and techniques and human resources for   gathering, assessing and presenting information security events to the top executive   management levels in the ministries/ departments/ agencies. The aspects of designing,   implementing and governing security although a key challenge for a ministries/ departments/   agencies, need to be addressed suitably by a framework for managing the affairs of security   1.3. Ministries/ Departments/ Agencies/ Management commitment towards   Information security   1.3.1. Introduction: Information security program implementations often suffer due to inadequate   resources—commitment of the ministries/ departments/ agencies, time, budget, human   resources or expertise. By understanding the challenges of meeting compliance objectives, an   organization can understand and appreciate the level of commitment required towards   information security to overcome the obstacles and appreciate the gains achieved through   implementing effective security practices. The following concerns emerge as executives in the   ministries/ departments/ agencies decode the complexity and inter-linkage of security and   performance:   1.3.1.1. Coverage of security risks: The foremost goal of an organization’s risk management   process is to protect the organization, and its ability to perform its functions, not just   protect its information and assets. Therefore, the security risk management process should   be treated as an essential management function of the ministries/ departments/ agencies/     National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 15     organizations, rather than a technical function carried out by the IT system administrators   alone   1.3.1.2. Protection from interruption in services: Ineffective security measures due to inadequate   budget/commitment or inflexibility of the ministries, departments, agencies and their   subordinate organizations to obtain advanced security capability, may cause disruption of   vital services/ offerings. Information is one of the most important assets of an organization.   Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of this strategic asset allows   ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations to carry out their   objectives and realize their goals in a responsible manner   1.3.1.3. Non-availability of information: Risks to operations can arise through a variety of sources,   in some cases resulting in damage to infrastructure and the complete shutdown of the   services. For example, loss of all Internet connectivity, denial of service attacks, APTs,   ransom-ware, physical theft etc and environmental factors (e.g., power outages, floods,   and fires) can result in a loss of availability of key / strategic information, rendering any   ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations incapable of   achieving their objectives. Investment in security can assist in mitigating risks to operations   1.3.1.4. Financial loss due to disclosure/ theft of information: Inappropriate security measures   may have a huge impact on an organizations financial position. A data breach may not only   have direct financial loss, but will also dissolve the trust of residents, citizens, suppliers,   other government bodies etc. Further, in order to minimize the damage of the breach, the   organization may have to incur additional expenses    1.3.1.5. Non- compliance with legal/ regulatory requirements: The ministries, departments,   agencies and their subordinate organizations may face administrative and/or legal actions   for not complying with security advisories. Security is ultimately the responsibility of   executive management Secretary, Joint Secretary, Managing Directors, CEOs, Directors,   head of the department heads and other senior program officials of the ministries/   departments/ agencies/ organizations. The Management should deploy proactive security   to enable delivery of its services and enhance value of the organization, rather than   viewing security as an afterthought or as a reactionary mechanism to legislation,   regulation, security event and oversight   1.3.1.6. Investment and resource channelization disproportionate with risks: Ignoring security as a   design principle results in ad hoc investments, which more often than not focuses on   adding controls after the systems are made operational—or in the worst case, after an   organization has had a security breach or incident. The ministries, departments, agencies   and their subordinate organizations may not realize the specific performance gains and   financial savings by building security into systems as they are developed. However, these   save the organization from incurring huge unbudgeted costs in covering up post an incident   or breach              National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 16     1.4. Need for an information-centric approach   1.4.1. While designing a strategy for security, information-centric approach in operational lifecycle   should be an important consideration. Information and its attributes such as its origin, creator,   nature of transaction, life, sensitivity, strategic importance and the operations performed on   the information are some of the factors which help identify security requirements.   Government ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations need to   establish a process of identification and discovery of information for each of its processes,   relationships and functions. The security posture has to be dynamic and should evolve with   change in the value of information, information access methods and threat ecosystem. The   capability of security processes and infrastructure to address information security should not   only cover the different layers of ICT infrastructure, but also address the extended   government ecosystem and new trends like mobility, big data and cloud computing. The   consideration of information security in the lifecycle of information is also important from   people, process and technical design perspective      Figure 1: Domains impacting information security   1.4.2. Information can be classified based on its category or type, sensitivity, value and the context   throughout its lifecycle. Ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations   should ensure that a structural thought process in designing information security initiatives   and measures is taken with respect to formation, grouping and arrangement of   countermeasures for security of information. Moreover, they should have capability for   responding to emerging threats by gathering intelligence on the nature of threats; deploying   tools, techniques and methods to identify threats, build collaboration mechanisms which   generate timely response from other security & IT infrastructure management processes   1.4.3. To make all this possible, organizations require a focused accountability and ownership   structure for information security, where tasks are clearly distributed with respect to     National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 17     administrative and technical arrangements. The IT initiatives of an organization need to be   revitalized to incorporate the principles of information security. The disciplines of security,   presented in this document, need to be carefully and diligently implemented   1.5. Information Security – focus areas   1.5.1. Managing scale and complexity: The increasing scale and complexity of organizations requires   a more coordinated and collaborative security approach. The information age demands right   proportions of security and requires graduation of security from a technical specialty to an   operational strategy. The scope and reach of security function has been expanding with   innovative and extensive use of IT for operational transactions, changing the nature of IT   infrastructure and the ability of threats that impact the security posture of an organization in   different directions and at different layers.  Organization should be well equipped to   overcome these aspects establish some key objectives which demonstrate its commitment to   security   1.5.2. Alignment of security with processes and functions: The ministries, departments, agencies   and their subordinate organizations need to distinguish between security related operational   tasks from strategic security tasks. They need to estimate all security elements which are   distributed across the organizational ecosystem. This requires significant efforts in building   security characteristics and aligning the security function with organizational processes and IT,   thereby ensuring that security hygiene is reflected across the organization. The management   needs to focus its efforts on helping the organization identify enterprise information assets,   processes and information resources and the commensurate protection required to secure   them. To achieve this, the security function needs to work in close consultation and   coordination with the ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations   and sub functions to conduct risk assessments, and help them articulate the confidentiality,   integrity and availability requirements of their resources, and develop appropriate security   practices to ensure non-repudiation, accountability, authenticity and due authorization for   information handling   1.5.3. Compliance with laws and regulations: The responsibilities of, and the extent of the role of   security function within an organization is expanding; crossing the traditionally defined   boundaries of IT, and covering all horizontal and vertical functions of ministries/ departments/   agencies/ organizations. Based on the nature of work and information handled, each   horizontal and vertical function of an organization may need to comply with several laws and   regulations. The Secretary/ the top management needs to drive security in all organizations   functions and should promote adequacy of role & responsibility and efficacy of skills within its   operational units. This will help ensure compliance with information security laws, regulations,   standards, and guidance which are applicable to different departments and units, breach of   which poses a severe threat not only to the organization's reputation, but also towards   national security and internal security of the nation   1.5.4. Formulating effective security functions and divisions: Meeting the information security   needs, necessitates ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations to   focus on effective information security practices and functions which integrate security into   the strategic and daily operations of an organization, focuses more on information-centric   security strategy and ensures that security is part of the design principle and maturity of     National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 18     security practices acts as a key differentiator in service delivery.  Formulating effective security   function in the organization ensures integration and builds collaboration between security, IT   and other organizations functions   1.5.5. Allocation of budgets: There is a need for an effective and responsive security organization   that is competent and committed in managing the complexity of security affairs and aligned to   departmental requirements. For that to happen there is a need for provisioning adequate   budgetary commitments towards security. This will help security to act not only as deterrence   but as also as an operational advantage. Globally, there are many studies which suggest that   budget for security should be proportional to the size of the organization or proportional to its   IT budget. On an average, globally the budget for security varies between 8-10% of the ICT   budget. However there are various parameters which should be evaluated before defining the   security budget, it may be the sensitivity of information that ministries, departments, agencies   and their subordinate organizations possess, the amount of transactions through varied   platform, involvement of third parties, etc. Ministries, departments, agencies and their   subordinate organizations should ensure that security budgets should be based on reasonable   analysis and risks to operations and the allocation should depend on threat scenarios and risk   to information   1.5.6. Availability of security professionals and tools: Apart from investing in adoption of newer   technology platforms for better business effectiveness, ministries, departments, agencies and   their subordinate organizations should also be committed towards investment in hiring skilled   resources, procuring tools or increasing the efforts of the existing workforce.  In order to   augment the existing skills and expertise, top executives should be flexible to outsource   specialized activities/operations to Subject Matter Experts (SME’s) and be open to hire   external consultants and experts post due security vetting. The ministries, departments,   agencies and their subordinate organizations should also be flexible in changing procedural   aspects of managing security and consult with the hired ICT organization to evaluate and   implement effective security technologies and architecture   1.5.7. Building and fostering culture of information security: While protection of information is of   paramount importance, ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations   should support the broader aim of securing the enterprise. This requires fostering a culture of   information security through commitment from top leadership who need to demonstrate the   strategic nature and value of information to its workforce in the enterprise. This may be   achieved by establishing the principles of protecting information assets for the organization,   as a priority. The ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations should   focus on imbibing a \"risk-aware\" culture across the ministries, departments, agencies and   their subordinate organizations concerned, ensuring that key personnel fully understand the   risk implications associated with their assets, processes and information          HP Sticky Note BUDGET ALLOCATION    National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 19     2. Purpose   2.1. Purpose of NISPG   2.1.1. The National Information Security Policy and Guidelines (NISPG), developed by the Ministry of   Home Affairs once implemented, will help classify and protect the classified information   possessed by ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations, and   public sector undertakings. Breach of such classified information may have an impact on   national security, or may cause unfavorable impact on internal security   2.1.2. This document elaborates baseline information security policy and highlights relevant security   concepts and best practices, which government ministries, departments, agencies and their   subordinate organizations should implement to protect their classified information   2.1.3. These guidelines will help ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate   organizations to establish minimum security processes and controls and devise appropriate   information security programs.  The ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate   organizations may need to apply enhanced security measures commensurate with risks   identified with their specific operating environment and the information being handled by   them   2.1.4. These guidelines will help organizations to focus on security objectives and strategy to protect   their classified information, during every stage of information lifecycle such as creation,   acquiring, storing, accessing, processing, transacting, retaining or disposal. These guidelines   will help drive organizations towards designing, implementing and operating focused   information security initiatives   2.1.5. The NISPG aims to provide:   2.1.5.1.

Supplementary documents and references   5.1. References   5.1.1. The policies and procedures suggested in this document take into account the previous   guidelines issued by various competent bodies and authorities of the government e.g.   ‘Computer Security Guidelines’ 2006’ by Intelligence Bureau (IB), ‘Cyber Security Policy for   Government of India’ by National Informatics Centre (NIC), Guidelines and controls mentioned   in “Cyber Security Policy for Government of India” ver 2.0 released 30th August, 2010,   Guidelines issued by National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre, National   Technical Research Organization and various ‘Security Guidelines’ issued by CERT-In. The   directions laid out in this document are inclusive in nature and have referred to the content   and suggestions from the above mentioned guidelines, wherever appropriate. However, the   ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations concerned are  advised   to consult the previous documents on the same subjects as well   5.1.2. MHA has done extensive work of studying various, international and national standards and   regulatory guidelines prevalent in the information security domain worldwide. The guidelines   have been influenced by, and draw references from, the global standards and practices such   as ISO 27001 (2005 as well as 2013), NIST Special Publication 800-53, Federal Information   Security Management Act (FISMA) of USA, SANS “20 Critical Security Controls”, Control   Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT) for information technology (IT)   management and IT governance, PCI –DSS, DSCI Security Framework (DSF) etc.          National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 22     6. Approach   6.1. Security of classified information   6.1.1. Securing classified information in government and public sector processes lifecycle: The   ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations should ensure that they   establish appropriate processes and capabilities to secure information throughout its lifecycle   i.e. as information is created, accessed, modified, stored, processed, transacted, transmitted,   deleted, disposed of or destroyed.  Information can be classified based on its category or type,   sensitivity, value and the context throughout its lifecycle   6.2. Security risk assessment   6.2.1. Conducting periodic risk assessment: Security risk assessments should be conducted   periodically to evaluate risks and associated threats leading to loss of confidentiality, integrity   and availability of information. Threat and vulnerabilities associated with the information   must also be evaluated for their potential impact, including impact on internal and national   security.   6.2.2. Risk assessment framework: Due to the diverse nature of operations of different   organizations there can be no single approach recommended for risk assessment. However, to   develop a risk based methodology which helps develop resilience to changing threat   environment, ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations need to   integrate information security risk assessment with the broader risk management framework   for operations. Frameworks such as ISO 27005:2008 or others may be referred to based on   the organization’s requirements   6.2.3. Periodicity of risk assessments: Information security risk assessment should be an on-going   activity, triggered early into the lifecycle of system design and development. It should be   conducted at least once every year or when changes are made to existing information assets   or when threat perception over information and information systems changes. For systems   containing classified data, a thorough risk assessment should be conducted at-least once   every quarterly    6.2.4. Methodology: A comprehensive security risk assessment may include methodologies   prescribed in Section 18 of this document for threat and vulnerability management   6.2.5. Additional insights: A comprehensive information security risk assessment will also provide   insights into expected ICT security expenditure, thereby helping formulate budgets and   estimate costs and help strategic decision making   6.3. Principles for establishing organization wide security framework   6.3.1. Core security goals: Information security frameworks should be designed to ensure   confidentiality, integrity, availability of information to authenticated and authorized users,   while establishing accountability over transactions conducted over the lifecycle of information   and establishing non- repudiation of information, across layers of people, process and   technology    6.3.1.1. Architecture:  Adequate steps must be taken for integrating information security measures   with the IT architecture of organizations to address contemporary security threats.     National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 23     Capability to respond to new issues or threats through integrating internal and external   intelligence measures, deployment of tools, techniques and methods in identifying threats,   which generate timely and desired response from other security & IT management   processes, must be established   6.3.2. Security division structure: The ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate   organizations must establish accountability and ownership structure for information security,   where tasks are clearly distributed with respect to administrative and technical arrangements   required for information security. The head of security must report directly to the head of the   ministries, departments, agencies or organizations and not to the IT head.   6.3.3. Deployment of professionals and skill development: The ministries, departments, agencies   and their subordinate organizations must ensure that trained professionals in the field of   Information Security are deployed to address their Information Security initiatives, at   appropriate levels. Further, adequate measures to train existing users, human resources, to   acquaint them with best practices for securing information and align them with the overall   objectives of the organization for protection of information and information assets must be   undertaken at periodic intervals. Every new employee should go through the information   security awareness program which could be organized in-house. Also every employee should   be given training in information security atleast once every two years.   6.4. Security audit   6.4.1. Security audits: The ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations   must conduct appropriate evaluation, testing and audits of all organizational structures,   mechanisms, policies, procedures, technologies and controls to ensure their alignment with   the implementation objectives of the information security policy and guidelines at regular   intervals. Areas of improvement should be identified and a mechanism to improve the overall   deployment of such structures, mechanisms, policies, procedures, technologies and controls   should be undertaken   6.4.2. Identification and response to data breach: The ministries, departments, agencies and their   subordinate organizations should develop the ability to identify, alert, evoke responses &   resolve a data breach in timely manner   6.4.3. Coordination with agencies: The ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate   organizations should interact with relevant agencies in the domain of information security to   gather and share intelligence about threats and vulnerabilities   6.5. Exception to implementation of recommended guidelines and controls   6.5.1.

There are several standards accepted globally which help an organization conduct  risk   assessment , gap analysis and govern security implementation at different levels such as   network access points, user authentication, applications etc. across the people, process, and   technology (PPT) layers. There are several information security management standards which   are adopted by organizations worldwide. The ministries, departments, agencies and their   subordinate organizations may use such globally accepted standards to design, implement and   govern information security within their organization and mandate all partner organizations   and third parties to implement similar practices   (For more details on globally accepted information security management standards refer to  Annexure 10)            National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 30     10.  Domains impacting information security   10.1. Overview   10.1.1. Alignment with security framework: While following the above framework, the ministries,   departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations should consider developing   strategy and competence in specific disciplines to enhance security. The NISPG has identified   eight core domains namely, network and infrastructure security, identity and access   management, physical security, application security, data security, personnel security, threat   & vulnerability management, security monitoring & incident management. Additionally, the   areas of security audit, security testing and business continuity, which cut across all domains,   have been covered as part of the guidelines. Further, guidelines for technology specific areas   such as virtualization, cloud computing, mobility and social media are provided in a separate   section   10.1.2. Achieving maturity in security domains: Domains mentioned above need to be understood   critically for security of classified information. Strategies for each of them, along with tactical   guidelines for implementation, and security controls are essential for making security robust.   The ministries, departments, agencies and their subordinate organizations should organize,   allocate and drive resources towards each of these security domains and strive to achieve   maturity over time to counter the increasing threats and attacks   10.1.3. Information security domains   10.1.3.1. Network and infrastructure security: The architectural plan of locating information in a   network arrangement and other infrastructure security arrangements such as internal and   external connections to information, protocols that are used to transfer information,   preparedness to withstand attacks etc. require specific consideration and treatment from   the perspective of securing information   10.1.3.2. Identity and access management: Sensitivity and criticality of information specifies the   requirements with respect to ability of an individual or group of users to access and   perform a set of operations on the said information. The increasing reliance on third   parties and external SMEs makes it imperative for the organization to secure itself against   risk arising from misuse of identities or additional or illegitimate access provided to the   users   10.1.3.3. Physical security: Organizations generally have multiple touch points from where   information can be accessed physically. To add to that, technology enables easy availability   of portable devices. This can defeat traditional physical screenings of individuals. With   more solutions and techniques becoming available in the market, physical security   concepts are also evolving, establishing it as an important discipline for protecting   information security. While it focuses more on restriction to physical intrusion,   technological solutions provide means to raise alarms by detecting anomalies and patterns   of information being accessed which help in detection and containment of information   security incidents   10.1.3.4. Application security: The primary objective of application security is to secure information   as it is processed, transferred or stored during the lifecycle of an application. The     National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 31     characteristics of applications vary from basic versions, to context aware, and Internet rich   usage of apps. These variations at various fronts expose the information processed, stored,   accessed, transacted through these applications to a larger threat landscape   10.1.3.5. Data security: Each data item collected, stored, processed, transmitted and accessed by an   organization has to be protected against cyber-attacks especially that are sensitive or   critical for internal and national security as stated in classification of information. The   entire focus and effort is to secure data. It is this which has led to the evolution of the   discipline of data security - the ultimate goal of an organization’s security   10.1.3.6. Personnel security: Risks due to insider threat and internal security breach undermines all   security measures taken to fortify information systems and data from the outside world.   The personnel security focuses on both the aspects of employee as well as third party   security and focuses on sourcing patterns of an organization which requires specifics   checks from a security viewpoint   10.1.3.7. Threat & vulnerability management: There is an ever increasing rise of security threats   with enhanced capabilities, varieties and scales; exploring new ways to find vulnerabilities   and exploits in an organization’s infrastructure to cause maximum possible damage. Threat   and Vulnerability Management (TVM) ensures that an organization’s resources are   protected against the perennial as well as evolving threats, and provides assurance over   the management of its resources in a way that the relevance of new vulnerabilities,   exploits or malware is immediately tested and that the organization responds swiftly to   them. TVM adds critical value to an organization’s security initiatives, which not only   delivers protection capabilities but also provides means to manage IT infrastructure   securely   10.1.3.8. Security monitoring & incident management: Security Monitoring and incident response   management is a key component of an organization’s information security program, as it   demonstrates its ability to respond to an information breach which might emanate from   external or internal sources    10.1.3.9. Security audit and testing: Security audit, testing and reviews should be conducted on a   continuous basis to check for conformance of security measures deployed by the   organization with security policies, standards and requirements. Specific requirements are   implicit in all disciplines. Moreover, general best practices have been provided as part of   this document    10.1.3.10. Business continuity: Business continuity of the operations has to be planned by the   respective government departments and is kept outside the scope of this policy. However,   this document covers areas which are important from the perspective of ensuring   availability of critical operations and classified information        National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 32              Figure 3: Information security domains              Business Continuity/ Disaster Recovery   Security Audit and Testing     National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 33     11.

Section X.1: Background – This section provides an overview and the coverage of each  domain and states the important evolutions and developments in each area. This section  provides an overview of each domain for the reader to understand the importance and  significance of achieving maturity in each area.   11.1.2. Section X.2: Relevance of domain to information security – This section establishes role and  scope of a domain in context of Information Security. It provides insights into the impact of  compromise of information due to the current and emerging threats and vulnerabilities of  the said domain.   11.1.3. Section X.3: Management guidelines– This section provides domain specific  recommendations in the form of guidelines and objectives. These guidelines will help the  senior management in an organization to institute security processes, procedures and  governance mechanisms.  The management guidelines section provides a high level view of  each domain, focusing on areas which are of significant importance in order to establish  practices in each domain.    This section also provides intent to senior management in order to pursue further action in  design, development, implementation and governance of security domain. The management  guidelines can also be used to derive assurance from operating divisions and will help in the  high level performance evaluation of the security function. Each guideline is mapped with a  number of security controls which provide clarity on the diverse elements contained in a  management guideline.   These are denoted by the nomenclature “G” followed by the guideline number. For  example, G1, G2, G3 … G112   11.1.4. Section X.4: Security controls– Provides control statements which are administrative,  technical, operational or procedural and need to be diligently followed. Security controls  provide insight into multiple areas which need to be implemented/ addressed in order to  achieve the objectives laid out in the management guidelines section. Security controls  provide exact direction and articulate expectations needed to develop adequate protection.   Each control statement is further complimented by implementation guidelines, which  provide specific information with respect to area covered in each security control.   These are denoted by the nomenclature “C” followed by the control number. For example,  C1, C2, C3… C135    11.1.5. Section X.5: Implementation guidelines – This section provides specific recommendations to  aid implementation of management guidelines and security controls. Implementation  guidelines offer granular detail on the expectations from each organization, for  implementation of controls and management guidelines.

These are denoted by the nomenclature “IG” followed the implementation guideline  number. For example, IG1, IG2, IG3 …IG181            National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 34     12.  Network and infrastructure security   12.1. Background   12.1.1. The increased adoption of information technologies has created immense opportunities to   connect, expand and integrate different entities. This led to the expansion of the network   capabilities and adoption of emerging connectivity techniques   12.1.2. The network infrastructure itself has evolved with various options of network topologies,   types of routing and switching devices and different connectivity options. Networks are   playing important role in providing access to information and information systems; providing   new ways for executing transactions and helping organizations leverage fruits of globalization   and hyper specialization. The diversity of these topologies, devices and connections   contributes to creating immense possibilities, however; it also introduces several new   security issues and concerns   12.1.3. The organizational ecosystem is undergoing transformation, extending its boundaries by   increasingly providing access to third parties and vendors, integrating external interfaces,   adopting innovations in endpoint, mobility and wireless technologies, while relaxing norms of   standardization and ownership of connecting devices. Enterprise architectures are becoming   more complex, multiple new system components are under deployment, and their   capabilities are extensively utilized through virtualization.  This provides  multiple   opportunities by which security can be compromised   12.2. Relevance of domain to Information Security   12.2.1. Network plays an important role as it binds all the information assets together and provides a   means for operational transaction where different entities can participate, exchange   information and carry operations over the information by making use of specific ports,   protocols and services provided by the network. This may create the possibilities of exposure   of information   12.2.2. Network plays a role in provisioning users and devices access to data as it is the first point of   connects. Users seek flexibility in accessing data across different devices and access paths.   This may expose organization’s information through these devices and the way users access   information    12.2.3. Network infrastructure typically spreads across geographies, providing access, facilitating   exchange of information and executing a variety of transactions. A combination of network   solutions and devices are required in order for these transactions to be successful. They may   create possibilities of compromising security of information at various levels    12.2.4. Traffic flow, connections, devices and traffic patterns introduce significant vulnerabilities and   weaknesses. These vulnerabilities and weaknesses may lead to serious security threats to   information     12.2.5. Insiders have easy access information and IT systems. Network aids their access to the   information and IT systems. They may be source or reason for compromise of security of   information      National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 35     12.2.6. The new components and architectural elements incorporated as a part of the plan for   infrastructure transition may introduce serious security issues.

Application security   15.1. Background    15.1.1. Application portfolios of organizations are becoming increasingly complex with a mix of   legacy applications, addition of new applications, deployment of enterprise packaged   applications and adoption of externally provisioned applications. Each of these applications   and their modules provide means of achieving a certain set of organizations objectives.   These variations at various fronts expose information to a larger threat landscape   15.1.2. Protecting applications against attacks simply by defending the perimeter with firewalls and   network traffic encryption has proven to be insufficient. To address the risks at application   layer, several technology and tactical measures have emerged that have helped the   evolution of ‘application security’ as an important discipline in itself. The application itself   should build in additional security measures, depending on the vulnerability of the system   and the sensitivity of the data it is dealing with   15.2. Relevance of discipline to information security   15.2.1. As most information, both for operational and governance operations, is processed and   transacted through applications, it becomes important to secure applications throughout   their lifecycle    15.2.2. Information of the organization may be compromised or exposed if applications are not   securely designed, developed, tested, configured and deployed   15.2.3. Inadequate visibility over how applications handle information; inadequate effort and   resources deployed for application security; and lack of key application security capabilities   endanger security of information    15.2.4. Applications liberate access to information and information systems, providing multiple   avenues for internal as well as external users to connect and perform their respective tasks.   However, they provide opportunities to attackers or introduce security threats which may   help attackers penetrate into information systems   15.2.5. Applications are undergoing continuous innovation, several architectural ideas and platforms   are under evolution and numerous have already been deployed. New ways of managing and   setting up sessions are being implemented and transaction processing is undergoing change   with respect to the way information is handled. This makes applications vulnerable to many   new types of attacks   15.3. Application security guidelines   15.3.1.

Personnel security   17.1. Background   17.1.1. Insider threat has been a large contributor towards a number of security incidents faced by   organizations. Additionally, the sourcing patterns of an organization are increasingly   dependent on external service providers, for bridging gaps in their skills and competence,   saving costs, augmenting capabilities to improve scalability and for making operations lean   and efficient   17.1.2.  However, granting access to organizations information assets and systems to third-party   service providers (TPSP’s) increases the security risk. As employees and third parties have   access to confidential information during their tenure of employment it is crucial that greater   emphasis be given to securing threats originating from human resources   17.1.3. The organization may have robust security framework; however, the third party may not   have a similar framework, thus placing the information at risk of compromise or theft. The   third party may become the weakest link in the security ecosystem of the organization   17.2. Relevance of domain to information security   17.2.1. Personnel are owners, custodian or users of information assets and systems. Lack of data   about these personnel, who may be either employees or third parties, will lead to inadequate   protection of these assets and systems from a security standpoint   17.2.2. As processes and sub processes continue to be outsourced or managed by third party   personnel, it is important to keep track of information and data they have access to. All   vendors, third parties, consultants etc. should be contractually liable to implement and   follow security best practices for personnel security, understanding the applicable legal and   regulatory compliances, assessment of the sensitivity of information and formulation of   robust contractual agreements   17.2.3. Without the knowledge over how and what employees access, it will be difficult to assess risk   posed to information and IT systems by employee actions   17.2.4. Without training and awareness, employees may not be aware of the security implications of   their actions, resulting in unintentional loss   17.2.5. Third party environment and employees may not be sensitive to the specific security   requirements of the organization. If coverage of the personnel security does not extend to   them, it will be difficult to get the desired level of assurance   17.3. Personnel security guidelines   17.3.1.

Threat and vulnerability management   18.1. Background   18.1.1. Organizations typically deploy security measures to guard against known threats. However,   evolving threats add a different set of challenges, which require continuous vigil, monitoring   and analysis. The discovery of a new vulnerability, disclosure of a new exploit or emergence   of a new malware threat and the capability to incorporate protection from them on a real   time basis fall under Threat and Vulnerability Management (TVM)   18.1.2. Keeping the infrastructure security posture up-to-date, scanning the infrastructure for   identification of new issues or vulnerabilities that could potentially lead to a security   compromise, taking corrective measures in case of a likely compromise, effectively managing   infrastructure that inherently is risk prone and delivering a fast response in case of   compromise are essential characteristics of the TVM function   18.2. Relevance of domain to information security   18.2.1. ICT Assets (infrastructure and application) are used for creation, processing, transaction, and   retention of information. These information assets are vulnerable to attacks because of   issues such as configurations gaps or newer vulnerabilities with respect to the infrastructure   or unpatched systems, etc.    18.2.2. Compromise of one element of ICT infrastructure may have catastrophic effect jeopardizing   security of overall infrastructure and information   18.2.3. ICT infrastructure is increasingly becoming diverse, introducing complexity of dealing with   multiple entities and their independencies. This complexity makes managing threats and   vulnerabilities a daunting challenge. Information that is stored, transmitted, accessed and   processes by these entities will be compromised if their exposure to threats and   vulnerabilities are managed effectively   18.2.4. Threat and vulnerability information is diverse in nature reflecting diversity of infrastructure   in an organization on the one hand. On the other hand, each element of ICT infrastructure is   made up of components sourced from around the globe. Configuration and positioning of   these elements and components also contribute to exposure to threats and vulnerabilities.   Security of information may be compromised due to vulnerabilities identified in the   components and elements of ICT infrastructure. Insecure configuration may lead to serious   security breach   18.3. Threat and vulnerability management guidelines   18.3.1.

Virtualization   22.1. Background   22.1.1. Virtualization allows the creation of virtual versions of an ICT asset or resource such as   desktop, a server, a storage device or other network resources.  Devices, applications and   human users are able to interact with virtual resource as if it forms a real logical resource.   One or more combination of several Virtual Machines (VMs) may be used for ICT   operations. Various forms of virtualization exist such as server virtualization, desktop   virtualization, application virtualization and operating system virtualization etc.    22.1.2. The virtual machines are managed by a virtual machine manager also known as the   hypervisor. A hypervisor manages various VMs on a physical machine and controls the   flow of instructions between a Virtual Machine and the underlying physical infrastructure   such as CPU, Storage disk etc.  A hypervisor may either run directly on the hardware, or as   an application on top of an existing operating system referred to as the host OS. The VM   running on top of the host operating system (host OS) is known as the guest operating   system (guest OS)   22.1.3. Virtualization presents organizations with tremendous opportunities, as well as some   significant security challenges. It provides the basis for the convergence of mobile and   cloud computing, allowing organizations to consolidate resources, improve   responsiveness and become agile in a cost effective manner. However, such consolidation   of physical infrastructure and the creation of hybrid environments lead to the emergence   of new types of risks for the organization. A virtualization platform must be able to   securely segregate multiple workloads consolidated from mixed trust zones and host   them from a single pool of shared system resources   22.1.4. Organizations should undertake an assessment of security risks and evaluate the risks   associated with operating an ICT component in a non-virtualized environment compared   with those in a virtual environment. The security of a virtualized environment largely   depends on the individual security of each component, from the hypervisor and host OS   to the VMs, applications and storage. Virtualization technologies also connect to network   infrastructure and storage networks and require careful planning with regard to access   controls, user permissions, and traditional security controls. Organization should deploy   virtualization with a complete view of its benefits and risks, and a comprehensive, defined   set of effective system, application and data   22.2. Virtualization management guidelines   22.2.1.  Evaluate risks associated with virtual technologies: Organization should  carefully and thoroughly evaluate the risks associated with virtualizing system   a. Evaluate and address risk: Organization must carry out risk assessment  that should identify whether any additional measures are necessary to  secure and protect information in a virtualized environment   G 82    22.2.2.

National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cybersecurity framework    1.1. Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity was the subject of the Executive Order 13636,   issued by President Obama on February 12, 2013.  It vested the National Institute of Standards   and Technology (NIST) with the responsibility of developing a voluntary cybersecurity   framework. NIST coordinated the industry-led effort that draws on existing standards,   guidelines, and best practices, to develop the Cybersecurity Framework. The Framework,   aimed at the owners and operators of the critical infrastructure, is expected to help reduce   cyber risks to critical infrastructure.    NIST began the development of the Cybersecurity Framework by issuing a Request for   Information (RFI) in February, 2013, to gather relevant input from industry, academia, and   other stakeholders to:     Identify existing cybersecurity standards, guidelines, frameworks, and best practices that are   applicable to increase the security of critical infrastructure sectors and other interested   entities;     Specify high-priority gaps for which new or revised standards are needed; and     Collaboratively develop action plans by which these gaps can be addressed   1.1.1. The idea was to use existing standards, guidelines and best practices to reduce cyber risk   across sectors and develop capabilities to address the full-range of quickly changing threats.   The framework will provide a flexible toolkit any business or other organization can use to   gauge how well prepared it is to manage cyber risks and what can be done to strengthen its   defenses   1.1.2. It is vital that companies understand their digital assets and accurately assess the maturity of   their cyber protections so they can properly allocate resources.  They need to continuously   invest in maintaining awareness of existing threats to preventing, detecting, and responding   to attacks to recovering from them.   1.1.3. The Framework to reduce Cyber Risks to Critical Infrastructure, after several rounds of public   consultation, was released in February, 2014    1.2. Outline of Cybersecurity Framework: The focus is on defining the overall Framework and   provides guidance on its usage. The Framework is intended to be used throughout the   organization.    1.2.1. Senior executives can use it to evaluate how prepared they are to deal with potential   cybersecurity-related impacts on their assets, and on their ability to deliver their business   services and products   1.2.2. User guide will help organizations understand how to apply the Framework. It is not a detailed   manual; it will help users at different levels to:   1.2.2.1. Understand and assess the cybersecurity capabilities, readiness, and risks of their   organizations     National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 225     1.2.2.2. Identify areas of strength and weakness and aspects of cybersecurity on which they should   productively focus, and learn what informative standards, guidelines, and practices are   available and applicable to their organizations   1.3.  The Framework’s core structure:   1.3.1. Five major cybersecurity functions and their categories, sub-categories, and information   references. Key functions: Know, Prevent, Detect, Respond, and Recover. Broken further into   categories, e.g. prevent categories: identity and access management, physical security, and   training and awareness. It further identifies underlying key sub-categories. Then matches   them with informative references such as existing standards, guidelines, and practices for each   sub-category. A matrix showing the functions, categories, sub-categories, and informative   references is provided.   1.3.2. Three Framework Implementation Levels (FILs) associated with an organization’s   cybersecurity functions and how well that organization implements the framework. Three   implementation levels reflect organizational maturity. The approach rolls up functions and FILs   in a way that allows them to assess an organization’s risk and readiness viewed through their   specific roles and responsibilities – whether they are senior executives, business process   managers, or operations managers.   1.3.3. A compendium of informative references, existing standards, guidelines, and practices to   assist with specific implementation   1.4. The Framework has been designed and is intended to:   1.4.1. Be an adaptable, flexible, and scalable tool for voluntary use   1.4.2. Assist in assessing, measuring, evaluating, and improving an organization’s readiness to deal   with cybersecurity risks    1.4.3. Be actionable across an organization   1.4.4. Be prioritized, flexible, repeatable, performance-based, and cost-effective to rely on   standards, methodologies, and processes that align with policy, business, and technological   approaches to cybersecurity   1.4.5. Complement rather than to conflict with current regulatory authorities   1.4.6. Promote, rather than to constrain, technological innovation in this dynamic arena   1.4.7. Focus on outcomes    1.4.8. Raise awareness and appreciation for the challenges of cybersecurity but also the means for   understanding and managing the related risks   1.4.9. Be consistent with voluntary international standards   1.5. The NIST cybersecurity framework (provides a “language for expressing, understanding and   managing cybersecurity risk, both internally and externally”. It helps in identification and   prioritization of actions for reducing risk and provides a tool for aligning policy, business and   technological approaches to managing risk. The core framework consists of five functions:   1.5.1. Identify: develop visibility over systems, assets, data and capabilities which need to be   protected, in accordance with their criticality      National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 226     1.5.2. Protect: develop and implement appropriate safeguards, prioritizing through the   organizations risk management process   1.5.3. Detect: develop and implement appropriate activities to identify occurrence of a breach of   event   1.5.4. Respond: develop and implement appropriate activities to take action regarding a detected   breach or event   1.5.5. Recover: develop and implement appropriate activities, to restore the appropriate   capabilities that we impaired through a breach or event   B. DSCI Security Framework   1.1. Numerous organizations worldwide have adopted widely accepted & internationally   recognized security frameworks and standards such as ISO 27001, which provide guidance &   direction for establishing enterprise wide security program, processes and procedures. But   problem arises when organizations channelize investments and resources to demonstrate   compliance to such standards (e.g. extensive documentation, huge checklists) instead of   identifying and mitigating real risks. Similar case has been observed with FISMA   implementation in the United States – compliance to it has taken precedence over real security   concerns in the networks and systems of the federal agencies. Thus focus has shifted towards   the compliance, leaving maturity aspect at bay.   1.2. Given the rate at which attack proliferation has happened, and data breach incidents are   increasing, organizations today need to develop and integrate a comprehensive security   program to stay at pace with the attackers and attack vectors to stay secure. Threat   environment in which we operate is getting complex and dynamic; attackers are evolving   innovative techniques. In such a scenario, organizations cannot solely rely on certifications   alone; though it may help provide assurance and demonstrate organization’s commitment to   their stakeholders and outside world. Though ISO 27001 standard, is a good starting point for   organizations for implementing security, it is not an end by itself. When organizations operate   in a vibrant, dynamic, evolving and competent environment – be it business, regulatory or   threat environment as in case of security, organizations can only survive if they are able to   draw a roadmap for coming years that entails future conditions & requirements, strategic   options,  building required competencies, etc. and not just focus on the present. This is   achieved by doing long term planning and drawing a strategy to achieve the defined goals. But   how many organizations today have a security strategy? How many organizations have a 5 year   vision for security? Unfortunately - not many. Though, ISO 27001 has been phenomenal in   establishing enterprise wide security processes, it falls short in the following areas:   1.2.1. Long Term Strategic Planning in Security –Today, security practitioners strongly believe that   security should be treated as a business enabler and not as a hurdle – adding value to   business, by allowing business to offer innovative solutions & services to international markets   round the clock, increasing productivity, reducing cost, providing customer delight, etc. If such   an approach needs to materialize, security needs to be revitalized by working more closely   with the business and IT and being given strategic importance within the organization.   Unfortunately, many standards are controls based standard - controls that are static in nature,     National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 227     focused on mitigating the existing risks, not focused on addressing the futuristic requirements   / risks that emerge from business expansion and innovation   1.2.2. Building Security Capability / Competence, using Maturity Criteria - Security is a continuous   journey, and no organization can be 100% secure. However, it is important to measure the   progress made / capabilities built over a period of time to address the evolving and perennial   threats. This can be achieved by defining criteria against which an organization can measure   its capability maturity in security. Many standards on the other hand promotes a ‘yes/no’ kind   of approach to security, wherein an organization is certified as fully compliant if it has   implemented the relevant controls. It does not provide any maturity criteria, which   organizations can leverage to improve their security competence   1.2.3. Focus on Protecting Data – Many standards follow an asset centric and process oriented   standard. Processes help provide guidelines for conducting operational tasks in a pre-defined   manner, but if too much focus is given on processes, then it may happen that the objective for   deploying a particular process may get lost (outcome may not be achieved). This also at times   results in loss of productivity and is perceived as bureaucratic. In today’s digital world, data   has an economic value attached to it. In fact, in some industries like pharmaceutical, data is   the life line of the organizations operating in the sector. Hackers and rogue insiders vie for this   critical data. In such a scenario, the focus of all the security efforts should be on data, with   lean processes and intelligent technologies deployed to protect it   1.2.4. Tracking Security Evolution – Security as a discipline has evolved over a period of time. The   stimuli have been many - the dynamic threat landscape, strengthening regulatory regime,   research & innovation, globalization, business models, technologies, etc. For an organization   to be secure it is important that it keeps track of all the latest developments taking place in   the field of security – be it skills, technologies or services. Today, specific security disciplines   have evolved with very specific approaches to address the unique challenges faced. Specific   trends and practices have been emerging to address the exact requirements of an individual   discipline. The security market, both technology products and services, has solution offerings   specific to an individual discipline. Security profession is also charting a path of specialization   in these individual security disciplines. For e.g. Management of threats & vulnerabilities is a   very critical discipline today, requiring specific skills, technologies and practices. Similarly,   disciplines like Secure Content Management, Governance, Risk and Compliance do not find   their rightful place in ISO 27001 standard. It fails to provide strategic and contemporary   directions and guidance to organizations that are implementing and maintaining security   1.2.5. Integration and Interdependencies – Security disciplines, as explained in the point above,   have number of interdependencies and therefore there is need for taking an integrated   approach that links these disciplines appropriately for better protection. For e.g. Security   Incident Management as a discipline requires inputs from Threat & Vulnerability   Management, Infrastructure Management, Application Development, etc. to be effective. The   ISO 27001 standard does not take such an integrative approach as it is focused on individual   controls that are described and deployed in silos   1.2.6. There is a need to approach security differently - a way that helps overcome the above   shortcomings of ISO 27001 and enables an organization focus on real threats in its   environment, without worrying about compliance to regulations. It should be able to assess     National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 228     organization’s maturity in implementing security in different areas with a view to continually   improve the same. Such an assessment should further help organization draw a strategic plan   based on evolution of different disciplines of security, and their interdependencies, with   continuous focus on protecting data. Compliance should be the outcome along with dynamic   and vibrant security that enables quick response to threats, vulnerabilities and actual cyber-  attacks   1.3. DSCI Security Framework (DSF©) is based on the following three foundational elements:   1.3.1. Security Principles: Starting point of DSF© is a set of security principles that an organization   should seek to adhere to. These include information visibility, vigilance, coverage & accuracy,   discipline in defense; focus on strategic, tactical and operational layers and compliance   demonstration. DSCI believes that approach to security which is based on these principles   helps remove the focus from extensive documentation, checklists and controls, and enables   an organization achieve dynamism in security which gives it the agility to respond to threats   and attacks.    1.3.2. Discipline Specific Approach: DSF© view of security is discipline-specific. Unlike other   standards, it does not specify any controls. Instead, it outlines best practices in these disciplines   that are based on recent learning by organizations, analysts, and technology and solution   providers. It leaves to the organization to select and implement controls specific to its   operating environment and business requirements   1.3.3. It identifies maturity criteria in each of the 16 disciplines that form part of DSF©. While these   disciplines are organized in four layers, it encourages organizations to focus on each individual   discipline of security by implementing best practices, and moving up in maturity rating by   using the maturity criteria. Focus on individual disciplines, and striving to achieve excellence in   them is the path to real security.     National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 229     1.3.4. Data-Centric Methodology. DSCI focuses on a ‘Visibility’ exercise, which brings a consolidated   view of data at the central level. It analyses and identifies the integrated view of the data   within the findings. It creates a risk profile that is data centric. DSCI makes uses of its Best   Practices approach to evaluate strategic options, both in terms of the processes and   technological solutions available for addressing these risks, and strengthening the security   posture. DSCI believes that once visibility over data is created at the central level, it is easier to   bring dynamism in the security program as recent trends, vulnerabilities and incidents can be   considered and appropriate risk management measures can be taken on a continuous basis.   1.3.5. Corollary to the visibility exercise is the establishment of privacy initiatives in the organization,   since the flow of personal information processed reveals exposure to privacy risks at various   stages. The DSCI Privacy Framework (DPF©), which has identified nine privacy principles for   achieving privacy in an organization, through the implementation of nine best practices which   are organized in three layers – Privacy Strategy & Processes, Information Usage, Access,   Monitoring & Training and Personal Information Security for establishing privacy initiatives in   an organization, helps an organization do that   1.4. Practices in each discipline of DSF© have been articulated under the following four sections:   1.4.1. Approach to the Security Discipline: DSCI believes that there is a significant requirement of   discussing the approaches, trends and practices that are driving an individual discipline. This   section in each discipline articulates DSCI approach towards the discipline under discussion.   1.4.2. Strategy for the Security Discipline: DSCI also believes that each security discipline deserves a   strategic treatment that will not only mature its endeavor but also optimize the resources and   efforts deployed. For each discipline, DSCI recommend approaches and processes that help   take a strategic review of an organization’s initiatives. This section will help managers to   provide a strategic direction to the organization’s initiatives in each discipline.   1.4.3. Best Practices for the Security Discipline: DSCI recognizes a need for providing a detailed   guidance for systematically planning and implementing security in the organization. This   section, in each discipline, compiles the best practices for the security implementer.   1.4.4. Maturity of the Security Discipline: DSCI believes in assessment of the outcomes and for fair   assessment, comprehension of appropriate parameters is necessary. The DSF© has defined a   total of 170 maturity criteria for the 16 disciplines.   1.4.5. DSF© especially through its maturity criteria can be used to determine an organization’s   security capability in different disciplines of security. This can be of particular relevance in   outsourcing relationships where client organizations want to determine the overall and / or   Line of Service specific security capability of service provider organizations.         National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 230     1.5.

PCI – DSS   1.1. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of requirements designed   to ensure that companies that process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a   secure environment and that operations and transactions are secure   1.2. The Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) was launched on September 7,   2006 to manage the ongoing evolution of the Payment Card Industry (PCI) security standards   with focus on improving payment account security throughout the transaction process.  The   PCI DSS is administered and managed by the PCI SSC (www.pcisecuritystandards.org), an   independent body that was created by the major payment card brands (Visa, MasterCard,   American Express, Discover and JCB.). The Standard can be found   here: https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/pci_dss.shtml   1.3. PCI DSS 2.0 (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Version 2.0) is the second version   and was released in 2010. The third revision is due in 2014.It is important to note, the payment   brands and acquirers are responsible for enforcing compliance, not the PCI council.   1.4. The PCI DSS specifies and elaborates on six major objectives1:   1.4.1. First, a secure network must be maintained in which transactions can be conducted. This   requirement involves the use of firewalls that are robust enough to be effective without   causing undue inconvenience to cardholders or vendors. Specialized firewalls are available for   wireless LANs, which are highly vulnerable to eavesdropping and attacks by malicious hackers.   In addition, authentication data such as personal identification numbers (PINs) and passwords   must not involve defaults supplied by the vendors. Customers should be able to conveniently   and frequently change such data   1.4.2. Second, cardholder information must be protected wherever it is stored. Repositories with   vital data such as dates of birth, mothers' maiden names, Social Security numbers, phone   numbers and mailing addresses should be secure against hacking. When cardholder data is   transmitted through public networks, that data must be encrypted in an effective way. Digital                                                               1  http://searchfinancialsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/PCI-DSS-Payment-Card-  Industry-Data-Security-Standard     National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 231     encryption is important in all forms of credit-card transactions, but particularly in e-commerce   conducted on the Internet   1.4.3. Third, systems should be protected against the activities of malicious hackers by using   frequently updated anti-virus software, anti-spyware programs, and other anti-malware   solutions. All applications should be free of bugs and vulnerabilities that might open the door   to exploits in which cardholder data could be stolen or altered. Patches offered by software   and operating system (OS) vendors should be regularly installed to ensure the highest possible   level of vulnerability management   1.4.4. Fourth, access to system information and operations should be restricted and controlled.   Cardholders should not have to provide information to businesses unless those businesses   must know that information to protect themselves and effectively carry out a transaction.   Every person who uses a computer in the system must be assigned a unique and confidential   identification name or number. Cardholder data should be protected physically as well as   electronically. Examples include the use of document shredders, avoidance of unnecessary   paper document duplication, and locks and chains on dumpsters to discourage criminals who   would otherwise rummage through the trash   1.4.5. Fifth, networks must be constantly monitored and regularly tested to ensure that all security   measures and processes are in place, are functioning properly, and are kept up-do-date. For   example, anti-virus and anti-spyware programs should be provided with the latest definitions   and signatures. These programs should scan all exchanged data, all applications, all random-  access memory (RAM) and all storage media frequently if not continuously   1.4.6. Sixth, a formal information security policy must be defined, maintained, and followed at all   times and by all participating entities. Enforcement measures such as audits and penalties for   non-compliance may be necessary   1.5. The 12 requirements of PCI DSS are as follows:   1.5.1. Install and maintain a firewall configuration to protect cardholder data   1.5.2. Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters   1.5.3. Protect stored cardholder data    1.5.4. Encrypt transmission of cardholder data across open, public networks   1.5.5. Use and regularly update antivirus software    1.5.6. Develop and maintain secure systems and applications   1.5.7. Restrict access to cardholder data by business need-to-know    1.5.8. Assign a unique ID to each person with computer access    1.5.9. Restrict physical access to cardholder data   1.5.10. Track and monitor all access to network resources and cardholder data    1.5.11. Regularly test security systems and processes   1.5.12. Maintain a policy that addresses information security         National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 232     D. SANS 20 Controls   1.1. SANS has created the “20 Critical Security Controls” as a way of providing effective cyber   defense against current and likely future Internet based attacks. Following these 20 controls   will help establish, in their words, a “prioritized baseline of information security measures and   controls.” The target audience is Federal enterprise environments but it certainly could be used   by commercial organizations.    1.2. It is a set of recommendations developed by a consortium of companies with the purpose of   identifying specific controls that will make systems safer. In addition, most of the controls can   be automated to various degrees through the use of tools.2   1.3. They offer a prioritized list of controls that have the greatest impact on improving security   posture against real-world threats. Consortium for Cybersecurity Action (CCA) was established   in 2012 to ensure that updated versions of the Critical Controls incorporate the most relevant   threat information and to share lessons learned by organizations implementing them. The   Critical Controls encompass and amplify efforts over the last decade to develop security   standards, including the Security Content Automation Program (SCAP) sponsored by the   National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Associated Manageable Network   Plan Milestones and Network Security Tasks developed by the National Security Agency (NSA).3   1.4. The presentation of each Critical Control includes:   1.4.1. Proof that the control blocks known attacks and an explanation of how attackers actively   exploit the absence of this control.   1.4.2. Listing of the specific actions that organizations are taking to implement, automate, and   measure effectiveness of this control. The sub-controls are grouped into four categories:   1.4.3. Quick wins that provide solid risk reduction without major procedural, architectural, or   technical changes to an environment, or that provide such substantial and immediate risk   reduction against very common attacks that most security-aware organizations prioritize   these key controls.   1.4.4. Visibility and attribution measures to improve the process, architecture, and technical   capabilities of organizations to monitor their networks and computer systems to detect attack   attempts, locate points of entry, identify already-compromised machines, interrupt infiltrated   attackers' activities, and gain information about the sources of an attack.   1.4.5. Improved information security configuration and hygiene to reduce the number and   magnitude of security vulnerabilities and improve the operations of networked computer   systems, with a focus on protecting against poor security practices by system administrators   and end-users that could give an attacker an advantage.   1.4.6. Advanced sub-controls that use new technologies that provide maximum security but are   harder to deploy or more expensive than commoditized security solutions.                                                                     2  http://systemexperts.com/media/pdf/SystemExperts-SANS20-1.pdf   3  http://www.sans.org/critical-security-controls/guidelines.php     National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 233     E. NIST 800-53   1.1. NIST Special Publication 800-53, \"Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information   Systems and Organizations,\" catalogs security controls for all U.S. federal information systems   except those related to national security. It is published by the National Institute of Standards   and Technology, which is a non-regulatory agency of the United States Department of   Commerce. NIST develops and issues standards, guidelines, and other publications to assist   federal agencies in implementing the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002   (FISMA) and to help with managing cost effective programs to protect their information and   information systems   1.2. NIST Special Publication 800-53 is part of the Special Publication 800-series that reports on the   Information Technology Laboratory’s (ITL) research, guidelines, and outreach efforts in   information system security, and on ITL’s activity with industry, government, and academic   organizations. The catalog of security controls in Special Publication 800-53 can be effectively   used to protect information and information systems from traditional and advanced persistent   threats in varied operational, environmental, and technical scenarios   1.3. Specifically, NIST Special Publication 800-53 covers the steps in the Risk Management   Framework that address security control selection for federal information systems in   accordance with the security requirements in Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)   200. This includes selecting an initial set of baseline security controls based on a FIPS 199   worst-case impact analysis, tailoring the baseline security controls, and supplementing the   security controls based on an organizational assessment of risk. The security rules cover 17   areas including access control, incident response, business continuity, and disaster   recoverability   1.4. A key part of the certification and accreditation process for federal information systems is   selecting and implementing a subset of the controls (safeguards) from the Security Control   Catalog NIST 800-53, (Appendix F). These controls are the management, operational, and   technical safeguards (or countermeasures) prescribed for an information system to protect the   confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information. To implement the   needed safeguards or controls, agencies must first determine the security category of their   information systems in accordance with the provisions of FIPS 199, “Standards for Security   Categorization of Federal Information and Information Systems.” The security categorization of   the information system (low, moderate or high) determines the baseline collection of controls   that must be implemented and monitored. Agencies have the ability to adjust these controls   and tailor them to fit more closely with their organizational goals or environments   1.5. The guidelines have been developed to achieve more secure information systems and effective   risk management within the federal government by:4    1.5.1. Facilitating a more consistent, comparable, and repeatable approach for selecting and   specifying security controls for information systems and organizations;                                                                4  http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r4.pdf     National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 234     1.5.2. Providing a stable, yet flexible catalog of security controls to meet current information   protection needs and the demands of future protection needs based on changing threats,   requirements, and technologies;    1.5.3. Providing a recommendation for security controls for information systems categorized in   accordance with FIPS Publication 199, Standards for Security Categorization of Federal   Information and Information Systems;    1.5.4. Creating a foundation for the development of assessment methods and procedures for   determining security control effectiveness; and    1.5.5. Improving communication among organizations by providing a common lexicon that supports   discussion of risk management concepts.    1.6. In addition to the security controls described above, this publication: i) provides a set of   information security program management controls that are typically implemented at the   organization level and not directed at individual organizational information systems; ii)   provides a set of privacy controls based on international standards and best practices that help   organizations enforce privacy requirements derived from federal legislation, directives,   policies, regulations, and standards; and iii) establishes a linkage and relationship between   privacy and security controls for purposes of enforcing respective privacy and security   requirements which may overlap in concept and in implementation within federal information   systems, programs, and organizations. Standardized privacy controls provide a more disciplined   and structured approach for satisfying federal privacy requirements and demonstrating   compliance to those requirements. Incorporating the same concepts used in managing   information security risk, helps organizations implement privacy controls in a more cost-  effective, risked-based manner   F. COBIT   1.1. COBIT5 is an IT governance framework and supporting toolset that allows managers to bridge   the gap between control requirements, technical issues and business risks. COBIT enables clear   policy development and good practice for IT control throughout organizations. COBIT   emphasizes regulatory compliance, helps organizations to increase the value attained from IT,   enables alignment and simplifies implementation of the COBIT framework.   1.2. With COBIT 5, ISACA introduced a framework for information security. It includes all aspects of   ensuring reasonable and appropriate security for information resources. Its foundation is a set   of principles upon which an organization should build and test security policies, standards,   guidelines, processes, and controls:   1.2.1. Meeting stakeholder needs   1.2.2. Covering the enterprise end-to-end   1.2.3. Applying a single integrated framework   1.2.4. Enabling a holistic approach   1.2.5. Separating governance from management                                                               5  http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/COBIT/Pages/Overview.aspx     National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 235     1.3. Principle 1: Meeting stakeholder needs6: A group of stakeholders includes any individual or   group affected by the current state or future state of a process, system, policy, etc. Stakeholder   analysis is the process of identifying stakeholders so that their input can ensure outcomes   match requirements. This is an important step in both project planning and risk management.   Failure to involve all stakeholders, including InfoSec and audit teams, usually results in less than   optimum outcomes at best. Worst case outcomes include failed projects or material audit   deficiencies. Successful stakeholder analysis results in maximizing benefits, minimizing risk to   or beyond expected outcomes, and optimizing resources. Further, ensuring integration of   business and information assurance requirements into the development or acquisition of a   solution is always preferable to trying to “hang” something onto a finished—but incomplete—  system, network, or a physical controls framework.   1.4. Principle 2: Covering the enterprise end-to-end: Information security is often applied as series   of point solutions, as defined in more detail in Principle 3. However, general application of   security and assurance best practices requires security reviews as part of all business processes   and IT development and implementation activities. This isn’t just a horizontal integration.   Rather, all levels of management must include InfoSec in every business strategic and   operational planning activity.   1.5. Principle 3: Applying a single integrated framework: Application of security controls is often a   point-and-shoot activity. Many organizations tend to fix specific issues without stepping back   and applying policies and controls that impact multiple vulnerabilities in network or   system attack surfaces. Designing a complete framework includes all aspects of information   storage, flow, and processing, providing a foundation for more efficient control   implementation.   1.6. Principle 4: Enabling a holistic approach: As support for developing an integrated framework,   it’s important to see information security as a set of related components: not as set of silos.   Each component is driven by enablers and other factors affecting organization risk. COBIT 5 for   Information Security provides a list of enablers and describes how they interrelate. Enablers   help organizations integrate operations and security into the outcomes of all principles defined   here. As always, this is done in a way to meet stakeholder requirements.   1.7. Principle 5: Separating governance from management: This principle establishes a line between   setting objectives and measuring outcomes.    According to COBIT 5 for Information Security:   “Governance ensures that stakeholder needs, conditions, and options are evaluated to   determine balances, agreed-on enterprise objectives to be achieved; setting direction through   prioritization and decision making; and monitoring performance and compliance against agreed-  on direction and objectives.”   While governance and management are separate functions performed by designated teams,   they must support each other. Governance defines outcomes and management implements   technology and processes to meet those outcomes. Governance then determines if outcomes   are met and provides feedback to help management make necessary adjustments.                                                                6  http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-security/cobit-5-for-information-security-  the-underlying-principles/#.

The Cost of Security: Traditionally, Information security has focused resources to keep all   assets within the environment of the government ministry/department by building secure   firewalls to ward off any attacks. However, with an evolving threat landscape that includes   social engineering, spear phishing, etc., there may be several vulnerable attack points, which   make it imperative for the security function to be revitalized. If organizations fail to understand   the value of their own assets, risk becomes immaterial; therefore it is important to put a value   on information from several perspectives.  Information security should be seen as a solution   that reduces the fear by creating trust. Trust that the risk is taken away and used for malicious   intent and activities detrimental to the security and interests of our nation   1.2. Any security breach or loss of information may have an adverse impact on the functioning of   government organizations and may have an adverse impact on national security or national   interests. A breach in the United States - referred to as wiki-leaks - led to public disclosure of   thousands of confidential government reports, documents, intelligence and diplomatic cables;   much to the embarrassment of the US government. A security breach may not only cause loss   of information and data, but also have a daunting financial effect, loss of reputation and   confidence of the public against the government, which may lead to an overall decrease in   trust in the government, litigation or lead to adverse conditions for national security and   national interests. There have been similar incidents worldwide, as illustrated in the table   below.   1.3. Other similar breaches have been reported worldwide and continue to menace governments   and the industry. To stay ahead of the evolving security threat curve, government bodies need   to be proactive, rather than being reactive to incidents and breaches. The real benefits of a   robust security framework and practices and the return on investment made on security may   not be directly realized; however organizations need to understand the importance and value   of robust security architecture after an incident occurs – which involves additional, avoidable   costs to the government. Global studies have indicated that in the majority of cases,   investment in quality, effective IT security would have been considerably less than the costs   incurred following a breach.             National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 237     Annexure 12 – Positioning of security division within the organization   1.1. Security Division traditionally has been part of the IT department within an organization.   However, over a period of time, there emerged many elements that needed attention of the   security division, which fall outside the boundaries of IT. Security requires organization wide   efforts to bring different functions together; establish collaboration that spreads awareness   and seeks cooperation; focuses on coordination while managing security affairs, and requires   integrated approach while analyzing and solving the problems. Positioning of the security   division matters a lot for its effectiveness and security organization has to be independent of IT   and perhaps report to the board. Some of the key recommendation for establishing security   organization should be:   1.1.1. The growing complexity of managing security, increasing role of security in the success of   ventures, and rising exposure of a government organization to these risks necessitates the   elevation of security in an organization’s ecosystem. Security should be part of the strategic   planning of organization and should be involved in the compliance management or   organizations risk management functions. It should coordinate with other government   organizations such as departments/ ministry for ensuring security as part of the service   delivery   1.1.2. The key skills required by a successful security leader or CISO should be more managerial,   collaborative and communicative, rather than primarily technical. She/he should have the   ability to build consensus and influence decisions, inside the organization and within IT   1.1.3. The Security leader or CISO should ensure that his team has the necessary skill-set and   competencies, both from procedural and technical aspects across relevant security domains   within the organization. He/she should ensure that there is adequate number of qualified   professionals; and wherever required the gaps should be full-filled through services from   subject matter experts by options such as hiring 3rd parties/contracts/offshore models         National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 238     Annexure 13 – Risk Assessment for information security   1.1. Purpose   1.1.1. Risk assessments are a means of informing the management on information security risks;   provide insights into effectiveness of existing control measures (including alternative plans);   and help determine what is necessary to reduce risks to information to a reasonable level   1.1.2. Risk assessment requires application of management policies, procedures and practices to the   tasks of identifying, analyzing, treating, and monitoring risk and includes assessment of risk   based on the context and criticality of information assets to organizations   1.1.3. As reliance on computer systems and electronic data has grown, information security risk has   joined the array of risks that governments and businesses must manage. Regardless of the   types of risk being considered, all risk assessments generally include the following elements:      1.1.3.1. Identifying threats that could harm and, thus, adversely affect classified information and   information assets. Threats include such things as intruders, criminals, disgruntled   employees, terrorists, and natural disasters   1.1.3.2. Identify information security threats relevant to the information they hold   1.1.3.3. Assessing vulnerabilities, both internal and external to organizations   1.1.3.4. Estimating the likelihood that such threats will materialize based on historical information    1.1.3.5. Identifying the value, sensitivity, and criticality of the operations and assets that could be   affected should a threat materialize in order to determine which operations and assets are   the most important   1.1.3.6. Estimating, the potential losses or damage that could occur if a threat materializes, including   recovery costs   1.1.3.7. Analyzing impact (i.e., harm) to national security and internal security, and the likelihood   that harm will occur with disclosure, theft or misuse of such information   1.1.3.8. Identifying cost-effective actions to mitigate or reduce the risk. These actions can include   implementing new organizational policies and procedures as well as technical or physical   controls   1.1.3.9. Deploying appropriate controls or measures which adequately respond to information risk   or reduce the impact or help in evaluating the alternative courses of action or determine   appropriate courses of action consistent with organizational, and/or national risk   acceptance   1.1.3.10. Documenting the results and developing an action plan    1.1.3.11. Assessing the residual risks and undertake monitoring measures for appropriate   governance through determination of the effectiveness of risk responses consistent with   organizational risk frame and identify risk-impacting changes to organizational information   systems     National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 239     1.1.3.12. Verifying that planned risk responses are implemented and information security   requirements derived from and traceable to organizational functions, national security   requirements, government directives, regulations and guidelines are satisfied   1.2. Threats to information   1.2.1. Information systems are subject to threats because of either known or unknown vulnerabilities   or the change in the threat landscape or when there are inadequate controls/measures over   the known vulnerabilities.    1.2.2. Although addressing vulnerabilities in an operational ecosystem is the primary reason for   conducting risk assessment, organization should be aware of the fact that any change in the   current process/technological ecosystem or addition of new components   (process/technology) may expose it to new security risk that may compromise national   security.    1.2.3. The applicability of these threats depends on the details of the evaluation of the vulnerabilities   or newer or changed processes, and can have adverse effects on operations and assets,   individuals, organizations, and the nation, through exploitation of both known and unknown   vulnerabilities compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the information   being processed, stored, or transmitted by those systems   1.2.4. Threats to information systems can include purposeful attacks to information system,   environmental disruptions, human/machine errors, and structural technological integration   issues, process failures, and can result in harm to the national and economic security interests   of the country   1.2.5. Therefore, it is imperative that leaders and managers at all levels understand their    responsibilities and are held accountable for managing information security risk—that is, the   risk associated with the operation and use of information systems that support the IT and    operational functions of their organizations. One of the important mitigating factors is clear   and unambiguous responsibilities for each role, and positioning trained personnel for that role   1.3. Risk Assessment Indicators   1.3.1. The Risk Assessment table below provides guidance to organizations on indicators of key risks   and advises them on the security impact that a trigger might impose on the organization   1.3.2. The model below is indicative and only provides reference ideas for an organization to make   use of, while conducting risk assessment exercise   1.4. Scope and Applicability of Risk Assessments   1.4.1. Risk assessment is a key part of effective information security management and facilitates   decision making at all tiers of operations including at organization level, operational process   level, and information system level. Risk assessments are generally conducted throughout the   system development lifecycle, from pre-system acquisition (i.e., solution analysis and   technology development), system acquisition (i.e., development and production deployment),   and on implementation (i.e. operations/support).      National Information Security Policy and Guidelines |   Ministry of Home Affairs      NISPG - Version 5.0                                                   Restricted      Page 240     1.4.2. There are no specific requirements with regard to level of detail that characterizes any   particular risk assessment. The methodologies7, tools, and techniques used to conduct such   risk assessments or the format and content of assessment results and any associated   reporting mechanisms vary from organization to organization depending on requirement and   information sensitivity.    1.4.3. Organizations should be cautioned that risk assessments are often not precise instruments of   measurement and reflect the limitations of the specific assessment methodologies, tools, and   techniques employed; the subjectivity, quality, and trustworthiness of the data used; the   interpretation of assessment results; and the skills and expertise of those individuals or groups   conducting the assessments.   1.4.4.  Risk assessments can support a wide variety of risk-based decisions and activities by   organizational officials across all three tiers in the risk management. As organizational   functions, processes, information systems, threats, and environments of operation tend to   change over time, the validity and usefulness of any risk assessment is bounded with time.      Figure 4: Risk Assessment overview   1.5. Key Recommendations   1.5.1. Risk assessment is an important measure of organization effectiveness towards information   security and provides management requisite information needed to determine appropriate   courses of action in response to identified risks. For providing a comprehensive view to the   management, it is imperative that security leaders perform the following:                                                                7  Risk Assessment Methodologies: 1.

Work with management and department heads to identify information and classify it based   on its sensitive to information security. They should develop information security policies   and standards that focus on protection of critical processes and technology that have   implication on organizational security   1.5.1.2. Adopt a strategic Information risk management approach that balances national   requirements with the objectives of the organization. They need to work with the   management and department heads to identify and resolve information risks arising from   technology or operational process on an ongoing basis   1.5.1.3. Centralize Information security risk program to enable a composite view of risk issues across   the organization and its partner ecosystem i.e. suppliers, vendors, service providers, etc.  It   needs to establish consistent risk assessment and compliance processes that help the   organization understand its information security risk exposure   1.5.1.4. Establish clear accountability between the organization and IT for Information security risk   and define liabilities in case of breach of information   1.6. Initiating a Risk Assessment   1.6.1. There are various models and methods for assessing risk, and the extent of an analysis and the   resources expended can vary depending on the scope of the assessment and the availability of   reliable data on risk factors   1.6.2. In addition, the availability of data can affect the extent to which risk assessment results can   be reliably quantified. A quantitative approach should estimate the ramification towards   national security and internal security due to risk based on (1) the likelihood that a damaging   event will occur, or threats on classified information shall be realized, (2) the importance of   classified information towards national security and internal security, and (3) the potential   costs and consequence of mitigating actions that could be taken   1.6.3. When reliable data is not available to draw such conclusions, a qualitative approach can be   taken by defining risk in more subjective and general terms such as high, medium, and low. In   this regard, qualitative assessments depend more on the expertise, experience, and judgment   of those conducting the assessment. It is also possible to use a combination of quantitative   and qualitative methods   1.6.4. A few sample security risk assessment triggers are mentioned in the table below:   Trigger  Details      Security aspects      Decisions      Known/unknown  vulnerability or  change in threat  landscape      Information that may  be sensitive to  national security      Criticality of the  information towards  national security      Is the information  under threat of national  concern?

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS 1 9 “Strategy for the Information Society Development of Montenegro 2020“ represents a strategy of continuity in relation with the previous one. The life cycle of the previous Stra- tegy ends in 2016. The period from 2012. to present day represents a time of an intensive and dynamic de- velopment of information society in Montenegro. As stated in the last World Economic Forum report on global competitive- ness in the field of ICT, Montenegro is a regional leader. This is also the case in the field of the development of the electronic government – Mon- tenegro is ranked 45. in the competi- tion of 194 United Nations member states. The development of an open, competitive, advanced and secure information society was accompani- ed by the increase in the number of the computer users and the Internet users, and also the progress achie- ved in the area of the broadband In- ternet access infrastructure. Signifi- cant advances have been made in the field of cyber security. All the main units of the educational institutions, up to the university level, are pro- vided with the Internet connection, the information systems in health and education are established, the scientific and research activities in the field of ICT are enhanced. Legislation in the field of the infor- mation society is largely harmoni- zed with the EU acquis. This is also stated in the European Commission report on Montenegro’s progress in 2015, in the field of the European in- tegration, within Chapter 10 that de- als with the area of the information society and media. “The European Union supports a well-functioning internal market for electronic com- munications, electronic commerce, and audio-visual services,” the re- port states, adding that “the rules protect consumers and support the universal availability of the modern services. The progress has been made regarding the issue of the con- struction of a national broadband network.“ „Strategy for the Information Socie- ty Development 2020“ outlines the strategic development tools in this development field, with a view to reaching the EU standards set out in the Digital Agenda 2020 and the Di- gital Single Market Strategy. The do- cument is divided into chapters that have been identified as the key steps to achieve the EU standards in this field, namely: broadband infrastruc- ture, cyber security, human capital, digital business, e-education, e-he- alth, e-inclusion, e-government and research, innovation and develo- pment. The above-mentioned chap- ters are tackled through both the Eu- ropean and the national context, the strategic development tools and the indicators that will serve as a kind of benchmarks of the information soci- ety development in Montenegro. STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. DIGITAL MONTENEGRO 2 11 “Strategy for the Information Society Development of Montenegro 2020” is a digital development strategy which, along with the ICT technolo- gies in the key development areas, also deals with the problem of the lack of the ICT skills, which signifi- cantly slows down the multiplicative effects that the modern technologi- es have on productivity growth. The strategic development tools are tar- geted to reaping the benefits brou- ght by the modern technologies. The digital technologies enable the deve- lopment of the commerce, enhance better use of capital and strengthen the national competitiveness. Rapid adoption of the digital technologies in the economy also signified the rapid diffusion of the benefits they have brought. The Internet has be- come an integral part of the national infrastructure, such as energy and transport, therefore becoming a fac- tor of production in most segments of the modern economy. In this sense, Internet connection remains an important goal, but also a significant challenge which should contribute to the creation of a digi- tal Montenegro, in combination with the selected strategic development tools. Broadband infrastructure, cy- ber security, human capital, digital business, e-inclusion, e-education, e- health, e-government, as well as re- search, innovation and development are the backbone of the information society development of Montenegro. Broadband Internet access at high speed is no longer considered a luxury, but a basic infrastructure for the economic development of a co- untry. Building adequate infrastruc- ture for the fast and secure Internet represents a demand of the digital era, and only those countries that possess the infrastructure which can provide fast data transfer via Inter- net can count on economic growth. The target group of users are all ci- tizens and the economy as a whole, which should be provided with avai- lable broadband, both in business and in everyday life, regardless of their location, education level, age or interests they have. This implies a greater density of broadband con- nections, the availability of sufficient speed and affordable price. Particu- lar attention should be paid to the households in rural areas, which need broadband in order to be able to use the services of the informa- tion society, towards achieving the balanced development of all Monte- negrin regions. Nowadays, the telecommunication sector is experiencing structural changes and it is still struggling with the unconnected national markets, the lack of regulatory consistency and predictability in the EU, especi- ally regarding the radio spectrum, as well as the lack of the sufficient in- vestment, particularly in rural areas. Those problems have been the focus STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. of a debate on the package for a sin- gle telecommunications market. In the area of the fixed networks, there is little real competition in the field of the infrastructure, except in very densely populated areas where the cable networks are already set up or in the areas where the local authorities are active. More simple and more proportionate regulation is needed in those areas where there has been a competition in the field of the infrastructure on the regional or the national level. It is necessa- ry to encourage the introduction of high-capacity networks and retain effective competition as well as the corresponding revenue in relation to the risks. The countries that manage to brid- ge the digital divide related to the Internet access are often faced with the new digital gap – the problem of the uneven distribution of the skills, which is precisely why the strategic tools of chapters human capital and e-inclusion are focused on eliminating this risk in the co- urse of the digital development of Montenegro. The administration becomes increa- singly digital, and the number of the jobs in the administration which are related to the ICT, i.e. the number of the jobs which require a certain le- vel of the ICT skills, is growing. By 2014, all 193 UN member states had their own national websites, 101 of which enabled citizens to open their personal accounts on the national portal, 73 of them enabled citizens to submit completed tax forms via portal and 60 of them enabled citi- zens to use portal to register a busi- ness. Montenegro, which joined this „company“ of countries, will contri- bute significantly to improving the quality of life of all its citizens, with the further development of the elec- tronic government, modernizati- on of administration and use of the Open Data. Successful integration of the ICT in education and improvement of the healthcare services through ICT are also recognized as the strategic tools aimed at increasing the social welfa- re. Strategic tools for research and innovation in the field of ICT are de- fined with the aim of increasing the level of investment in R&D in this area. Vision Digital Montenegro – a country that has recognized the economic and so- cial potential of the ICT, remains the guiding vision of the development of the information society in Montene- gro until 2020. As reported by the European Commission, share of the ICT sector in overall EU economy is 2.8%, and this sector, together with the investment in ICT, generates 50% of productivity growth. Accor- ding to MONSTAT official data, share 13 of ICT sector contribution to Monte- negrin GDP is 4.2%. In order to exploit the impact of the ICT to the economic growth, this sector is recognized as paramount for the economic development and strengthening of the national com- petitiveness. In that sense, the vision is focused on inclusive and develo- ped digital society where everyone has an opportunity to create, access and exchange information and kno- wledge. Mission Legal, organizational and technical framework for the information so- ciety development in Montenegro is based on the three components: • Infrastructure • Cyber security and • e-economy, which involves e-business, e-education, e- health, e-inclusion, e-gover- nment and research, innova- tion and development in the field of ICT, with the aim to provide for the grow- th of the ICT sector, through the rea- lization of the strategic development priorities, thus ensuring broader use of the ICT in other sectors as well and encouraging the economic gro- wth in general. strategic priorities Strategy for the Information Society Development in Montenegro 2020 identifies strategic development tools with the key performance indicators. The key performance indicators (KPI) represent important criteria to measure progress achieved in the scope of the defined development directions. Along with the quality and quantity indicators, there are also the exit performance indicators, that mostly measure the realization of the activities planned, which will be part of the action plans for the Strategy implementation. Defining the indicators in the adop- tion phase of the Strategy enables efficient monitoring of the progress achieved in terms of the strategic goals, during their implementation. The indicators can also be used du- ring the evaluation and goals revi- sion processes in the course of the Strategy life cycle. The specific strategic priorities, defi- ned out of the strategic development tools, will be of particular interest during the Strategy implementation. In this sense, the strategic priorities involve the following goals: Broadband access availability: • the basic broadband access ⇒ coverage: 100% of the po- pulation by 2018. STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. • the fast broadband access (30 Mbit/s or more) ⇒ cove- rage: 100% of the population by 2020. Strong organizational infrastructure for the prevention and combat aga- inst Internet incidents: • The capacities of the national CIRT for protection, preventi- on and combat against Inter- net incidents strengthened, with the total number of the team experts to increase to 20 by 2020. • The improvement of the structure of local CIRTs. Growth of the basic and advanced digital skills: • the percentage of the ICT gra- duates in total number of the graduates should amount to 10% by 2020. and • the number of the ECDL cer- tificates issued should reach 15.000 by 2020. In the field of the digital business, the share of the ICT in GDP should reach 6%, which will be reflected in economic growth and job creation in other sectors of the economy. The share of e-commerce in total com- merce should reach 1.5%. Focus of the e-education segment is the proportion of available compu- ters per student in schools, as well as the skills of the teaching staff, with the following aims: • Computer-Student proporti- on should be 1:10 by 2020. • The percentage of the te- achers trained to work on computers should be 30% of the total teaching staff, whilst the percentage of the teachers skilled in the field of cyber security should be 20% of the total number of the teaching staff. When it comes to e-health, the per- centage of e-prescriptions and e-ref- ferals issued, out of the total number of the prescriptions issued, should reach 60%, while online appoint- ments should surpass the traditional appointments, and reach 70% of the total number of appointments. The elimination of the digital divide between urban and rural areas, as well as income-based digital divide, and the divide based on social and demographic characteristics, repre- sents a priority of the e-inclusion se- gment of the Strategy. The orientation towards the further development of e-government in Montenegro should contribute to the increase in number of the users who choose to communicate electro- nically with the public administrati- on, so the percentage of the citizens who use e-services should be 50% 15 by 2020, and the percentage of legal entities using e-services should be 30%. The percentage of the scientific and research institutions in the field of ICT out of the total number of the licensed institutions should reach 30%, which will have positive effects on the increase in financing the re- search in this field in relation to the overall budget for research and in- novation. STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE 3 17 The society as a whole increasingly relies on the use of electronic com- munication services as well as the in- formation society services in general. The high quality digital infrastructure is a basis for almost every sector of the modern, innovative society. Digital society, the society that delivers susta- inable economic and social benefits, based on the contemporary network services and fast internet connection, is at the top of the strategic priorities of the developed economies. The introduction of the new ICT and other contemporary services, which require high data transaction speed, is unthinkable without the develo- ped broadband access and adequa- te infrastructure. The development and construction of modern elec- tronic communication networks, efficient use of the radio-frequency spectrum, geographic and economic accessibility of broadband, repre- sent a goal with respect to the deve- lopment of digital Montenegro. european context The expansion of fast and ultra-fast Internet access is one of the prio- rities set by the Digital Agenda for Europe, together with the of the be- nefits of Digital Single Market for ho- useholds and business sector. Digital Agenda has brought concrete me- asures and goals, as well as recom- mended deadlines for achievement of these goals. The main goals for improvement of the broadband access are the follo- wing: • the basic access ⇒ coverage: 100% of the EU population by 2013, • the fast access (30 Mbit/s or more) ⇒ coveraget: 100% of the EU population by 2020, • ultra-fast access (100 Mbit/s or more) ⇒ usage: 50% of the EU households by 2020. EU Member States have adopted national plans and strategies for the broadband access development, which differ among the Member States. The availability of the bro- adband access via fixed network is highest in the states that possess a well developed xDSL infrastructure amounting to more than 90%. In the recent years the availability of the broadband Internet access via xDSL hasn’t significantly changed, due to the fact that the EU states focused on NGA infrastructure (VDSL, DOCSIS 3, FTTP) and wireless technologies de- velopment. The availability of NGA infrastructure in EU Member States totals 68%. STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. The average penetration of broad- band subscriptions in EU is 31,1%. The share of different technologies in total number of broadband inter- net access subscriptions via fixed network is as follows: • The share of broadband access via xDSL (including VDSL) is 70% (from 100% in Greece to 15% in Bulgaria), • The share of broadband access via KDS (including DOCSIS 3) is 18% (from 51% in Belgium to 0% in Greece and Italy), • The share of FTTH/B is 8% (from 58% in Latvia to 0% in Greece and Malta), • The share of other technolo- gies of broadband access is 4%. The average availability of LTE te- chnologies in EU Member States is 79% (from 100% in Sweden to 0% in Cyprus). Taking into account all the active users, that is the users who access the Internet both via smartphones and data SIM cards, the penetration of broadband Inter- net access through mobile networks in EU amounts to 71,6%. Taking into consideration the needs of the operators of the mobile elec- tronic communication services for additional radio-frequency resour- ces, the majority of the EU countri- es have performed the allocation of the radio-frequencies from 800 MHz frequency band. Also, the question of freeing up the 694-790MHz (700 MHz) frequency band, with the aim of its faster appraisal for the mobi- le communication networks, repre- sents the ongoing issue in whole Europe. Several EU countries have already carried out the allocation of the radio-frequencies from 700 MHz frequency band to the operators of the mobile communication networks. national context As reported by the 2011. national census, Montenegro has 620.029 in- habitants and 192.242 households. According to the characteristics of the population, Montenegro is by large a rural country, with the ave- rage population density of 44.9 peo- ple per km2. The territory is divided into 23 municipalities with 1256 settlements, 40 of which are urban. The majority of the population is concentrated in urban areas, where 64% of the population lives. The main characteristics of the cur- rent level of development of broad- band network are as follows: • The late start of the deve- lopment of the broadband access market (ADSL: 2005, KDS: 2007, WiMAX: 2008, FTTx: 2011, satellite acces: 2012), 19 • The lower penetration of the broadband Internet access subscriptions compared to the EU average, • ADSL technology has the lar- gest share in broadband sub- scription – 63%, but in the past five years its share is in downfall, • Higher number of installed and active FTTH/B connecti- ons, with their current share in the number of active con- nections amounting to 9,3%, • A larger share of broadband connections via KDS, which currently equals 21,2%, • The share of the rest of the technologies is 6,5%, • Broadband infrastructure competition exists only in ur- ban areas, • Good coverage of the popu- lation with 3G mobile net- works signal and growth of the LTE coverage. The main features of the current sta- te of development of the broadband infrastructure through the NGA te- chnologies are the following: • Significant investment in FTTH network in some parts of the urban areas; • Until recently, the investment in advanced KDS infrastruc- ture (HFC, DOCSIS 3.0) has been mainly focused on some parts of the largest urban are- as. However, in recent period it spread to suburban areas; • The lack of recognition of the importance of fast develo- pment of fixed NGA networks and broadband mobile net- works by certain local gover- nments, required for adequa- te planning and issuing of necessary permits for their construction. • Fixed electronic communica- tion network infrastructure Operators have developed their own transport networks, used with the aim of connecting different ele- ments within their networks. The transport section of the operators’ network (the backbone) is based on SDH, DWDM and MPLS technologi- es and transport systems, which are realized through fiber optic cables and radio relay links as physical me- diums for signal transport. For the realization of the transfer system, mobile operators partly use the fi- ber optic cables leased from the in- frastructure operators. The access section of the fixed net- work in Montenegro is still predomi- nantly based on telecommunication cables with copper wires and coaxi- al cables. The largest operators have implemented IMS (IP Multimedia STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. Subsystem) platform and have ca- rried out the full migration of their users to this platform. Fixed connections based on tele- communication cables with copper wires are available in all of the Mon- tenegrin municipalities, in all urban, suburban and in some rural areas. 70% of households in Montenegro have this kind of connection. 93.000 ADSL connections are active. 64.400 ADSL connections are used for Inter- net access. Cable distribution system – the KDS, through the implementation of DO- CSIS 3.O standard, along with the di- stribution of the AVM content, also enables both the Internet access services and telephony. In the past period, the standard KDS with the coaxial cables has been replaced with HFC networks. The KDS con- nections are available in 13 munici- palities, in urban areas where 59% of the population resides. 31.400 connections via KDS networks are active. 19.800 connections via KDS networks are in actual use for Inter- net access. The development of access net- works based on fiber optic cables (FTTH/B) has intensified in the past years. Fiber optic connections are available to the end-users in 10 municipalities, in urban areas whe- re 54% of the total Montenegrin po- pulation resides. 51.000 FTTH con- nections have been installed, which means that 26% of households in Montenegro have the possibility for access via FTTH connection. 13.700 FTTH connections are active. 10.600 FTTH connections are in actual use for Internet access. The total number of active fixed bro- adband connections, independent of the type of the service provided, is 147.800. The penetration of fixed broadband connections compared to the number of households is 77%. 102.400 broadband connections are used for Internet access. The pene- tration of broadband Internet access (ADSL, FTTH/B, KDS-HFC, WiMAX et al) is 16.5% in relation to the popu- lation number, and 53.3% in relation to the number of households. Along with the increased number of users of the fixed broadband Internet access, there have also been changes in the structure of the users, related to the access technologies. The grea- test change happened with the share of KDS, ADSL and FTTH connections. In the past five years, the KDS share grew from 4% to 19.3%, the ADSL share fell from 78% to 62.9%, whi- le the FTTH share grew from 1% to 10.3%. With the development of the fiber optic networks, the preconditions for the access with greater capaci- ties have been created. Therefore, in the operators’ offer now we have fiber optic connection packages with 21 the Internet access speed between 20 Mb/s and 100 Mb/s, but these packages are still not being used to the full extent. The analysis of the fixed connection on the basis of the Internet access speed points to the following: • 23,6% of the users use pac- kages with Internet speed less than 2Mb/s, • 62,7% of the users use pac- kages with Internet spe- ed ≥2Mb/s, but less than 10Mb/s, • 10,1% of the users use pac- kages with Internet spe- ed ≥10Mb/s, but less than 30Mb/s, • 3,6 % of the users use pac- kages with Internet speed ≥30Mb/s. Mobile electronic communication network infrastructure The mobile electronic communi- cation services in Montenegro are provided by the three terrestrial mobile communication networks. All three networks are based on har- monized standards of the second generation (GSM, including its up- grades GPRS and EDGE), the third generation (UMTS, including HSDPA and HSPA+) and the fourth generati- on (4G, i.e. LTE technologies – Long Term Evolution). The transport segment of the net- works is still largely based on the microwave radio-relay links, and to a lesser extent on the fiber optic trans- fer. All three mobile operators have carried out the migration of transfer networks towards IP transfer. The radio access section GSM/ DCS1800 is realized within the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz frequency band, while the access section of the UMTS networks is realized within 900 MHz and 2 GHz. The unconditional refar- ming of the spectrum led to the im- plementation of the UMTS techno- logy within the 900 MHz frequency band and the LTE technology within the 1800 MHz. The coverage of the population with the GSM signal is around 99%. The coverage of the territory with the GSM signal invol- ves all the inhabited areas, the main roads and the tourist centers, which represents around 90% of the total territory of Montenegro. All urban areas, as well as the significant part of the suburban and rural areas, are covered with the UMTS network si- gnal. The UMTS signal, depending on the operator, covers 90% - 97% of the population. The LTE signal is available in the urban areas, via two operators’ networks. The level of the coverage of the population with the LTE network is from 45% to 65%, depending on the operator. STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. The number of the mobile service users that have accessed the Internet is 326.006, which means that the pe- netration of the broadband Internet access via mobile network amounts to 52.6% in Montenegro. The users don’t consider the Internet access via mobile network as a substitute for the access via fixed network yet, but this will change along with the technological progress and the avai- lability of the LTE technology. international internet link Six operators have established a di- rect link with international provi- ders of the Internet access abroad. The total capacity of the internatio- nal Internet link at the end of 2015. was 41 Gb/s. Compared to the last year, the total capacity of the inter- national Internet links have increa- sed by 43%. Montenegro internet exchange point (Mixp) The Montenegro Internet Exchan- ge Point is established in 2015. It is expected that the establishment of MXIP would enhance the develo- pment of the Internet in Montene- gro, lower the prices of the Internet access service, unburden the inter- national Internet links, improve the quality of the Internet access service and the communication safety. transfer to the internet protocol version 6 (ipv6) The Internet protocol of the new ge- neration, known as IPv6, has been developed in order to overcome the lack of Internet addresses. The bene- fits of the new protocol, along with the widening of the address space, are: improved efficiency, safety and the possibility of the implementa- tion of modern IoT solutions. This protocol is a prerequisite for the development of future Internet ser- vices and a basis for inclusion in the global electronic market. Having in mind the increase in num- ber of the users of electronic com- munication services, and the fact that the operators base the electro- nic communication services almost exclusively on IP platforms, the next logical step in the development of electronic communication networks and services is the implementation of IPv6 protocol. This is precisely why it is necessary to prepare a plan of a migration on protocol IPv6, in accordance with the standards, deci- sions and suggestions of the Europe- an and international authorities in the field. radio-frequency spectrum Through the radio-frequency spec- trum use plan in Montenegro for the implementation of the radio access section of public mobile electronic 23 communication networks, a number of radio frequency bands is alloca- ted, but the number of the reque- sts for additional radio-frequency resources, coming from the opera- tors who provide mobile electronic communication services, is constan- tly increasing. The necessary radio- frequency resources for the develo- pment of the wireless networks are provided through valorization of the free frequency bands, as well as the release of additional frequency ban- ds. After completion of the switchover from analogue to digital terrestrial broadcasting systems in Montenegro (June 2015), the 800 MHz frequency band became free for the implemen- tation of TRA-ECS system, as is the case with the 2.6 GHz frequency band. It is necessary to finish the allocation of the 800 MHz frequency band as soon as possible, with the increase of the availability of the broadband access as the overriding goal of the allocation of this frequency band for the purpose of the implementation of the LTE mobile networks. Currently, a number of radio- frequency bands is not appropriate- ly appraised, and they could be used for further increase of the availabili- ty of the broadband access. strategic deVelopMent tools For the purposes of this Strategy, the speed of data transfer which is to be considered as the basic bro- adband access is defined depending on the type of access network as fol- lows: • The fixed broadband Inter- net access includes access at a minimum of 2 Mb/s for do- wnload • The mobile broadband access includes access achi- eved at a minimum through 3G technology, or the UMTS. • The speed of data transfer that will be considered fast broadband is defined as the broadband speed of 30 Mb/s or more. • The speed of data transfer that will be considered ultra- fast broadband access is defi- ned as the speed of 100 Mb/s or more. As one of the main prerequisites for further development of Montenegro, both social and economic, and its transition towards digital society, it is necessary to provide the availabi- lity of broadband, through several steps: • basic broadband access ⇒ coverage: 100% population by 2018, • fast broadband access (30 Mbit/s or more) ⇒ coverage: 100% population by 2020, STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. • Ultra-fast broadband access (100 Mbit/s or more) ⇒ usa- ge: 50% households by 2020. It is necessary to construct electro- nic communication networks that will enable broadband access at high speed. The transport section of the- se networks should be implemented through fiber optic cables, to the greatest extent possible. All the avai- lable technologies should be used to ensure the broadband access, bearing in mind that no technology alone can provide the accessibility of the broadband services for all the citizens. In order to ensure the bro- adband coverage at the reasonable financial expenses, it is necessary to implement the optimal combination of the technologies for different geo- demographic conditions, and parti- cularly encourage the construction of the NGA networks (FTTx, DOCSIC 3.x) and the development of the mo- bile networks of the fourth generati- on (LTE). In order to make a significant step forward regarding the availability of the broadband Internet at high speed, it is necessary to increase the investment in the NGA networks and expand the NGA networks to su- burban and some rural areas. In this context, the development of NGA cable networks based on FTTx and DOCSIS 3.x is of particular signifi- cance. Also, by implementing new methods/technologies targeted at the increase in access speed, due to its wide presence in the access infra- structure, copper wires may remain an important medium for the delive- ry od the broadband services for a long time. It is necessary to create the con- ditions for the unhampered con- struction of the modern electronic communication networks, by way of enhancing investition, adequate planning, simplifying administrative procedures for issuing of the neces- sary permits and consents for the construction of electronic communi- cation networks. It is also important to secure necessary radio-frequency resources for the development of the electronic communication ne- tworks. Also, it is important to cre- ate the conditions for the expenses reduction for the construction of the NGA networks, by way of ensuring the common use of the existing elec- tronic communication infrastructu- re, the availability of the electronic communication infrastructure in- formation (the registry of the lines, the base of the electronic communi- cation infrastructure, the mapping of the broadband availability and the broadband speed) and the pu- blic construction works (the single information point on public works), the coordination of the operations and the construction of the facilities for the fast and ultra-fast Internet access. 25 The principle of the technological neutrality and the creation of possi- bilities to implement all the available technologies of the Next-generation access networks (NGA), as well as the emerging NGA technologies, is a path that should be followed, whilst using the benefits of both fixed and mobile electronic communication networks. The construction of the NGA net- works, due to the geo-demographic characterics of Montenegro, deman- ds significant investition. This is why the construction of the NGA ne- tworks outside of the city centers is not feasible for the operators at the common market conditions. The- refore, the construction of the NGA networks in the suburban and par- ticularly in the rural areas requires special incentive. However, despite the encourage- ment of the investment and the in- centives in this direction, the fixed cable networks connection will ne- ver be implemented in certain rural and distant areas. With this in mind, the further development of the ra- dio-communication infrastructure is extremely important. The deve- lopment of the wireless access net- works (either fixed or mobile) based on the modern, spectrum-efficient technologies, can enable the bro- adband access relatively fast and with significantly less investment, compared to the construction of the cable/ fiber optics infrastructure. This is particularly important for the rural and sparsely populated areas, with the traditionally low level of the development of the cable/fiber op- tics infrastructure. Further on, it is necessary to incite the development of the mobile networks of the fourth generation (LTE). To this end, it is necessary to exa- mine the possibilities of the use of the radio-frequencies from 694-790 MHz, 1452-1492 MHz, 2300-2400 MHz, 3400-3600 MHz and 3600- 3800 MHz frequency bands for the IMT systems. Also, taking into ac- count the decisions of the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-15) and the CEPT, as well as the determination of Montenegro regarding the harmonization of the radio-frequency use with the Euro- pean Union countries, it is important to release 700 MHz frequency band freeing it up for the mobile network needs, and take measures to allocate it to the mobile electronic communi- cation services operators. Also, it is necessary to take all acti- ons, revision of the regulations in- cluded, to facilitate the investment in broadband. In this regard, it is necessary: to take particular care to make sure that the construction works include all potential investors in a systematic way; to clarify the is- sue regarding the right of passage; to construct the maps of the available STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. passive infrastructure suitable for the cables installation and the up- grade of household installations. In addition to providing the infra- structure and geographic availabi- lity of the broadband access, it is necessary to ensure its economic availability, by way of price regula- tion for the independent broadband access and the broadband access in the related offers, according to the Law, as well as take measures to inc- rease the Internet use. Specifically, in the case if the com- petition in this market proves to be inefficient, the Agency for Electronic Communications and Postal Servi- ces, after the implementation of the legally defined procedures, may im- pose a regulatory measure of price control on the operator with signi- ficant power in the relevant market. 27 strategic indicators Indicator Current state 2018 2020 The availability of the NGA broadband access The percentage of the households in the area of the availability of the NGA (³30 Mbit/s) 26,5% 60% 100% The penetration of the broadband connections (house- holds) The share of the households which use, at least, the broadband access (³2 Mbit/s) 53,3% 80% 100% The availability of the broadband connections at high speed The share of the broadband access connections via fixed network at high speed (³30 Mbit/s) in a total number of the fixed broadband connections 3,6% 30% 70% The penetration of the ultra-fast broadband connec- tions (households) The share of the households that use ultra-fast broad- band access (³ 100 Mbit/s) 0% 20% 50% STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. CYBER SECURITY 4 29 Nowadays, the Internet, supported with the information and commu- nication technologies, represents a vital national resource of a co- untry and has become one of the main drivers of its socio-economic development. The information and communication infrastructure faci- litates daily operations, and citizens are increasingly dependent on the opportunities that it provides in the scope of cyberspace. In such cir- cumstances, its proper protection has become a challenge of national, regional and international impor- tance. The integration of the ICT in daily ac- tivities and operations has become more intense. Accordingly, threats to the information and communication infrastructure, that can endanger its availability, privacy and integrity, can also affect the functioning of a society as a whole. As countries and organizations are developing and implementing new security mechanisms, a parallel process is taking place - cybercri- minals find new techniques to over- come these mechanisms. In order to find an adequate and timely re- sponse to modern threats to infor- mation security, it is necessary to expand the focus, framework of ac- tion and the flexibility to cope with often unexpected high-risk security events. This strategic program is therefore aimed at identifying and setting the key strategic development courses to raise the overall level of informati- on security, especially at the national level, without neglecting the need for the regional and international cooperation. european context The European Union Cyber Security Strategy and the European Agenda on Security provide a general stra- tegic framework for the EU initiati- ves in the field of cyber security and cybercrime. The EU Cyber Security Strategy aims towards open, safe and secure cyberspace. In addition, trust and security in the ICT are the key pillars of the Digital Single Market Strategy. One of the 16 initiatives identified in the strategy is a public-private partnership that aims to strengthen the EU’s cyber security industry and provide the customers with innovative and safe solutions. The European Cyber Security Stra- tegy, which was adopted in 2013, states that cyberspace must rema- in open and free and that the same norms, principles and values that the EU supports offline should be applied online. The fundamental ri- ghts, democracy and law must be protected in cyberspace. Therefore, cyberspace must be protected from STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. incident, malicious activities and abuse. To achieve this, the role of gover- nment should be of great importan- ce, as well as the role of private sec- tor which owns a large part of the critical information infrastructure. Therefore, the cooperation between the public and private sectors is cru- cial. The EU’s vision, outlined in the Cy- ber Security Strategy, is defined through five strategic priorities: • Raising cyber resistance; • Drastic reduction of cybercri- me; • Developing policy on cyber defense and capacity in com- pliance with Common Se- curity and Defence Policy - CSPD; • Development of the industri- al and technological resour- ces for cyber security; • Establishment of a coherent international policy of the European Union cyberspace and promotion of the funda- mental values of the EU. In order to accomplish this, it is ne- cessary to have a) a completed legi- slation and specified criminal norms, b) the established and functional national teams for prevention and response to cyber incidents with the adequate technical, financial and hu- man resources, c) the qualified pri- vate sector to invest the necessary financial resources, d) complemen- tarity of the EU and NATO standards and procedures. Considering the crossborder nature of cyber attacks, the aspect of the in- ternational cooperation in the field of cyber security is also emphasized. The establishment of coordinated mechanisms of prevention, detecti- on, mitigation and response, enables the exchange of information and mutual assistance between the nati- onal authorities. In addition to the abovementioned activities, the emphasis is also pla- ced on raising level of awareness among the end-users and the whole society, as well as the protection of children on the Internet. national context In the previous period, through the legislation and policy documents, Montenegro followed the main stan- dards, guidelines and recommen- dations of the EU and NATO in the field of building cyber security and adequate protection of the critical infrastructure. Montenegro’s strategic goal is to build an integrated, functional and efficient cyber space, in accordance 31 with the international standards and principles. The strategic directions in this area are outlined in the Cyber Security Strategy 2013-2017. In accordance with the task to facili- tate early detection of cyber threats and incidents and adequately react and respond to them, the Main of- fice for the computer and security incidents protection on the Internet (CIRT) is established as an organi- zational unit within the Ministry for Information Society and Telecom- munications. CIRT is a central body for coordination of prevention and protection against the computer se- curity incidents on the Internet and other information systems security risks for Montenegro. CIRT, in line with its responsibilities, acts: • Preventive - providing useful information and advice on Internet safety. • Reactive – analyzing and per- forming detailed investigati- ons in the case of Internet in- cidents at the national level. In accordance with the recommen- dations of the EU, national CIRT has the function of the national contact address in the field of cyber security, and also acts as a coordinating body at the national level. In addition, Montenegrin national CIRT conducts activities aimed at establishing and enhancing partner- ships both at the national and at the international level, for the purpose of better and more efficient fight aga- inst cybercrime and cyber threats. The computer systems and users in Montenegro are exposed to the most of the cyber threats and attacks that affect the rest of the world. In 2015, there was an increase in the number of applications to 132, which was tripled compared to 2014. The attacks on the informa- tion infrastructure were registered, as well as the attacks on the Internet provider services, taking control of several websites of the Montenegrin institutions, as well as the banking sector. Also, it was noted that the attackers took control of the user profiles of the Montenegrin citizens on social networks and wrote ina- ppropriate content on behalf of tho- se users. National CIRT currently employs 4 people. In accordance with the Cy- ber Security Strategy of Montenegro 2013-2017, 29 local CIRTs were for- med. strategic deVelopMent tools After its formation, the National Co- uncil on Cyber Security will have the authority to discuss relevant issues concerning cyber security. The coor- dination in this sense will contribute STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. to the improvement of cyber secu- rity measures, through active coo- peration and proposing activities to CIRT in the establishment of the sy- stem of protection of computer and security incidents on the Internet, as well as assisting in identifying the ti- mely response to possible threats to the information infrastructure. Due to the constant growth in the number of services that the state authorities and the private sector provide over the Internet, both to the citizens and legal entities, it is necessary to define the critical in- formation infrastructure in Monte- negro and develop the protection procedures. The critical information infrastructure (CII) is the kind of the infrastructure that its compromising would, among other things, result in the loss of life, tremendous financi- al damage (expressed as a certain percentage of GDP), or have a very negative effect on the environment. In many developed countries, regu- latory role in protecting the critical information infrastructure, because of its exceptional importance, is per- formed by a separate organization as its only function. In Montenegro, the national CIRT is determined to perform this function, and in order to perform it effectively CIRT will need to have adequate human reso- urces at its disposal. The authority of CIRT, as the su- preme organization in the field of cyber security at the national level, as well as a range of services and capabilities it should possess, in accomplishing foreign policy goals of Montenegro - membership in the EU and NATO, will continually inc- rease. Among other things, it will include the protection and determi- nation of the critical infrastructure, as well as other activities related to it, operations on 24/7 basis, ac- tivities for reducing the number of incidents, the training of civil ser- vants and citizens. As recommen- ded by the international partners, CIRT team must have a minimum of 20 officers. It is necessary to strengthen the ca- pacities to modernize the Group for High Technology Crime, consisting of the representatives of the Mini- stry for Information Society and Telecommunications, the Police Ad- ministration, the National Security Agency. The improvement of the te- chnical and human capacities of the Forensic Center is also a task for the future period. Given that a large part of the critical information technology infrastruc- ture belongs to the private sector, it is necessary to strengthen public- private partnerships in this field especially in terms of defining the procedure of information exchange. Cooperation will be improved throu- gh the formation of local CIRTs with the legal entities or individuals who 33 access or handle the data. These te- ams will deal with the protection from the computer and security in- cidents on the Internet and other se- curity risks of these systems. These teams will work with CIRT in the ap- plication of cyber security measures. Currently, the cyber security pro- gram is studied through thirteen su- bjects at three universities in Monte- negro as part of bachelor, specialist and master studies. In cooperation with the Ministry of Education and Universities in Montenegro, the im- portance of this topic should be hi- ghlighted and it should be studied through more subjects in the field of cyber security, for the purpose of providing workforce with highly specialized knowledge in this field. This is also necessary due to the fact that cyber security is increasingly becoming a part of the general secu- rity of a country. In order to ensure a safer Internet environment for the Montenegrin citizens, it is necessary to work on education about the importance of cyber security, with a focus on chil- dren protection on the Internet, because of the fact that the statisti- cs show that over 95% of children under the age of 15 use computers and the Internet, and over 60% use the Internet every day or almost every day. Considering the fact that one child out of five has a negative experience when using the Internet, and that currently about 12% of the students from the sixth to the ninth grade of the elementary schools are educated on safe use of the Inter- net, we must work on increasing the number of children educated about the safe Internet use. Also, given the fact that in the secondary schools there is no subject that deals with cyber security, it is necessary to take measures to introduce at least one subject that will encompass this area. In addition, it is necessary to work on improving the hotlines for re- porting illegal content, as well as to work on establishing a Safe Internet Center, in cooperation with CIRT nad international networks INSAFE and INHOPE. The abovementioned includes the hotline for reporting il- legal Internet content, center for the promotion activites and the Internet safety awareness-raising center, as well as support hotlines. The aim of this project is the centra- lization of the activites in the field of Internet safety, with particular focus on children safety. In this sense, the existing infrastructure functioning within CIRT will be upgraded, thro- ugh the hotline for reporting the illegal Internet content. The most important segment of this project is the establishment of the web portal that will encompass all the functi- ons mentioned above. Long-term plan is for the Safe Internet Center STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. to bring together a significant num- ber of partners, particularly the NGOs, which will further ensure its sustainability. Also, it is necessary to strengthen the national capacities for an adequate response to cyber threats and at- tacks by way of organizing one-year simulation of large-scale attacks. 35 strategic indicators INDICATOR Current state 2018. 2020 Strengthening admini- strative capacities of CIRT 4 10 20 Local CIRTs in state bodi- es and local governments 29 45 60 Local CIRTs with legal en- tities 0 20 40 Educating children on safe Internet use 12% of students from the sixth to the ninth grade of the primary school educated 25% of students from the sixth to the ninth grade of the primary school educated 40% of students from the sixth to the ninth grade of the primary school educated STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. HUMAN CAPITAL 5 1 DESI-digital economy and society indeks is a composite index that represents the sum of the relevant indicators of the digital progress in Europe, which evaluates the evolution of the EU Member States in the field of the digital competitiveness 37 Information and communication technologies are advancing at a tre- mendous speed and introducing te- chnological changes that create con- ditions for a future in which routine work tasks will be done by machi- nes. Experts in the areas of human capital and markets seriously count on these predictions. This fact implies a necessity for a va- riety of skills which will follow the automation process in the future, taking the place of those skills that will become superfluous. Until now, educational systems were quite slow in responding to these changes. Sin- ce the changes are quite rapid, the required skills also change rapidly. According to the World Bank and their development report for 2016, this means that the workforce will have to complement their skills more and more often throughout their career. This dynamic is already present in many advanced and tran- sition countries, but it is also signi- ficant for the developing countries, which must be prepared for new cir- cumstances. european context According to the DESI1 indicator, “Human capital” dimension includes two sub-dimensions: the basic skills and use, as well as the advanced skills and development. The “basic skills and use” dimension encom- passes indicators of the Internet use by the individuals, as well as their di- gital skills. The “advanced skills and development” dimension includes indicators of the employment of the ICT professionals and graduates in science, technology and mathema- tics. Concerning the Internet use, accor- ding to the European Commission, 75% of the EU population uses the Internet at least once a week, while the majority of the citizens (65%) use the Internet on a daily basis. The number of the Internet users is inc- reasing. The objectives of the Digital Agenda on the Internet use are the- refore achieved ahead of the schedu- le, i.e. in 2015. If this trend continu- es, we can expect that by 2024. 90% of the EU population will become regular Internet users. However, differences between the European countries in this sense re- main significant - the highest rate of the Internet use on a weekly basis is STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. in Luxembourg, the Nordic countri- es, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, where this percentage is around 90% and more. On the other hand, the countries with the lowest rate of the Internet use during the week (Romania, Bulgaria) are facing the fact that about half of their popu- lation does not use the Internet du- ring the week. The percentage of the citizens who do not use the Internet at the EU level is around 18%. The greatest progress in reducing this number was recorded in Estonia, Bulgaria, Poland, Cyprus and Lithu- ania. The greatest obstacles to the Inter- net access are the lack of need, the insufficient level of the digital skills and costs. In the recent years, a lack of digital skills has been noted as a factor that affects the Internet use to a large extent. In 2014, 40% of the EU population did not have a suffi- cient level of the digital skills, while 22% of the population did not have the digital skills at all. The last figure varies - from 5% in Luxembourg to 45% in Bulgaria and 46% and Ro- mania. In eight countries (Portugal, Poland, Croatia, Cyprus, Italy, Spain, Bulgaria, Romania) about 30% and more of the population does not have the digital skills at all. In Italy, even 18 million people do not have digital skills. In 2014, 32% of the EU workforce did not have a sufficient level of the digital skills, while 13% did not have the digital skills at all. While in some countries, such as Poland, Italy, Cyprus, the rates of the workforce having digital skills are around 20% and more, in Romania and Bulgaria more than a third of the workforce does not have the digital skills. If this percentage is added to the per- cent of the workforce who has only a low level of digital skills, we come to an average of 32% of the workforce that can be considered insufficiently digitally literate, at the EU level. In Bulgaria and Romania, this percen- tage is 61% and 77%, accounting for the majority of the workforce. As for the employment of the ICT experts, this percentage is increased by 4% over the last decade in the EU. The largest increase occurred in Germany, the United Kingdom, France. However, it was significant in smaller countries also. Despite this, the EU is faced with the problem of the growing deficit of the ICT experts, which is projec- ted to be as high as 825,000 vacant jobs by 2020. Currently the largest gap between supply and demand of the ICT experts in the labor market was noted in Germany. However, it is anticipated that this gap will be gro- wing in the United Kingdom and in Italy, largely due to the inadequate number of the ICT graduates. 39 national context According to the Monstat survey from October 2015, the percenta- ge of the persons who have used a computer in the last three months is 67.2%, while the percentage of tho- se who have never used a computer is 26.1%. Regarding the Internet use, 68.1% of the people said they have used the Internet in the last three months, 79.9% of which used the In- ternet every day or almost every day, and 17.1% used the Internet at least once a week. Among the citizens who have used the Internet in this period, 90.6% of persons aged 16-24 use the Inter- net every day or almost every day. Among the reasons for not using the Internet, most of the people inter- viewed said that they did not need to use the Internet (45%), while for the 27% the lack of the skills was the reason for not using the Internet, for the 24.7% it was the cost of the In- ternet and for the 27.3% the cost of the equipment was the main reason. Regarding the basic and advanced digital skills, by the end of Mar- ch 2016 a total of 8,290 citizens of Montenegro has begun certification of their computer knowledge and skills according to the ECDL stan- dard, while 7,721 citizens gained the ECDL certificate. Through the pro- ject “Implementing ECDL standards in the education system”, which was completed in June 2014, the autho- rized ECDL test centers in the Exa- mination Center of Montenegro and the Human Resources Administrati- on of Montenegro were established to assume the role of centers for the ECDL training and certification in the educational system and in the state administration of Montenegro. According to the survey on the use of ICT in enterprises conducted by Monstat in 2015, 38.5% of the com- panies (out of a total number of com- panies that use computers in their business) reported to employ ICT/ IT experts who have the ability to develop, maintain and manage ICT or IT systems and applications, whi- ch represents an increase by 0.8% compared to 2014. According to the objectives of the Information Society Development Strategy 2012-2016, the number of the ICT graduates was to increase to 25% of the total number of the graduates by 2014, and to 30% by 2016. This task has not been accom- plished since during the 2011-2015 period there were 14,490 graduated students at the Montenegrin uni- versities, 1,208 of which graduated from the study programs related to the ICT, which amounts to 8.3% on average for this period. STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. The abovementioned facts confirm that, as is the case in the EU, a huge deficit of the ICT skills, both the ba- sic and the advanced, is evident in Montenegro. What is also emerging as a conclusion is that the existing education system and programs (formal and informal) will not miti- gate this deficit in the coming years. strategic deVelopMent tools The technological revolution turned the concept of non-formal education and lifelong learning into an urgent human need. The result of the dyna- mic development of the technology is that the knowledge becomes ob- solete very fast. Moreover, as a result of the rapid changes in the techno- logy, labor mobility and market de- mands of each individual’s career will be transformed up to five times during their lifetime. In this context, we come to the conclusion that the professional development is requi- red because of the retention of the existing positions as well as due to the increase in the competitive po- sition of the individuals in the labor market. Thus, the traditional con- cept of a career is becoming history in the digital age. According to a re- search, the competencies that a wor- ker acquires during the seven year period of work get outdated and are of no use in the business operati- ons anymore, so the worker has to acquire completely new competen- cies after that time. Starting with abovementioned cir- cumstances, one of the strategic tools of the development must be encou- raging the greater use of the Internet by all structures of society, as well as the acquisition of digital competen- ces. The second main action must be focused on creating a greater number of the ICT experts. Also, the efforts should be focused on elimi- nating the digital gap between gene- rations, while bearing in mind that a significant percent of the workforce in Montenegro use the modern tech- nology insufficiently. The emphasis should be on encouraging women towards the education and career in the ICT, because women compri- se less than 30% of the workforce in the ICT, and only 19% of them are ICT managers, according to the Eu- ropean Commission surveys. When it comes to local circumstances, the finds from the MONSTAT survey on the use of information-communica- tion technologies in Montenegro po- int to the fact that 30.7% of women have never used the computer, whi- ch is one of the reasons to organize a targeted campaign on raising aware- ness of women on the importance of the digital competencies. Strengthening human resources for the development and application of the ICT is a challenge for all se- gments of the society, particularly for the educational system, which must generate the knowledge and the skills that can, as a direct invest- 41 ment into enhancing the country’s competitiveness and higher econo- mic growth in the digital economy, support the creation of digital Mon- tenegro. Global IT labor market has shown stability in the times of the crisis, as evidenced by the fact that the ICT personnel is in deficit, confirmed by the fact that the ICT jobs are the most wanted at the global level. In order to monitor level of the di- gital literacy adequately, it is neces- sary to develop the indicators of the digital literacy in the country, in line with the EU standards. 1 com/best-jobs-of-the-future-2014-1?op=1 strategic indicators Indicator Current state 2018 2020 The percentage of the ICT ex- perts in relation to the total number of employees in enter- prises n/a 2 % 4 % The percentage of the ICT grad- uates in a total number of the graduates at all univeristies 8,3 % 9 % 10 % The number of the ECDL certifi- cates issued 7.721 10.000 15.000 STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. DIGITAL BUSINESS 6 43 Internet and information and com- munication technologies incite the inclusion of the companies in the global economy through the expan- sion of trade , increased productivity of capital, intensifying competition in the market, which in turn boosts innovation, making the ICT and bu- siness mutually inseparable in the modern economy. Their intercon- nectedness bears immediate be- nefits for households too, not only business and technology per se. On the other hand, creation of new jobs, better exploitation of human reso- urces, the production of consumer surplus, represent immediate bene- fits provided to the citizens by the digital economy itself. The share of the ICT sector in GDP is around 6% in the OECD countri- es, whereas in the developing world this share is significantly lower. As estimated by the World Bank, the greatest contribution of the digital technologies to the economic grow- th occurs in those cases when tradi- tional sectors of the economy exploit ICT to modernize their activity. european context Recent studies estimate that the di- gitalization of products and services can bring more than 110 billion in annual revenues to the European economy over the next five years. In April 2016, the European Com- mission launched the first initiative of the Digital Single Market package related to the industry. The aim of this initiative is to prepare Europe for the upcoming challenges of the digital products and services. This will require coordinated investment from both the private and the public sector. In that sense, the following areas are of particular importance: • “Startup Europe” aims to strengthen the business en- vironment for web and ICT entrepreneurs so their ideas and businesses can develop without restraints • The Future of the Internet - a stronger, more connected In- ternet, which corresponds to the needs of citizens both at work and at home • Data – referring to the need to exploit the benefits of the access to the important data, in order to create solutions designed for the health care system and the challenges in the field of transport • Cloud computing - better standards, more secure con- tracts and greater use of clo- ud in private and public sec- tor are the issues that need to be worked on in the future STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. • Digitalization of the Europe- an industry in the direction of maximizing the benefits of digital technology in every industrial sector in Europe • Regular meetings with web entrepreneurs and expert groups in order to discuss new ways to promote a more inclusive digital society. Standardization represents a very specific problem, and the European Commission suggests particular set of measures regarding this issue: • Five priority areas of focus: 5G, cloud computing, Inter- net of Things, data technolo- gies and cyber security. • Co-financing the tests and experiments in order to acce- lerate the setting of the stan- dards, which further contri- butes to innovation and busi- ness growth. national context Digitalization of the business and the online business concept repre- sent enormous economic potential for the development of small and medium enterprises. Research on the factors that crea- te obstacles to the introduction of the ICT in Montenegro has not been conducted so far, but judging by the other available studies, the price of introducing the ICT in business appears to be important factor influ- encing this decision. Despite the fact that products and services from the ICT sector increa- sed its share in the GDP up to 16.5 % in many countries in recent years, and more than a third of the econo- mic growth occurred due to the ac- tivities that were developed on the basis of the ICT technologies, there is no significant entrepreneurial nor company activities that rely on onli- ne business in Montenegro. According to the available data, the- re is a small number of companies registered for conducting online business in Montenegro. Collecting data on companies engaged in the information society services is com- plicated due to the fact that the in- formation society services and elec- tronic commerce are not specifically classified in the process of business registration. As stated in the last Monstat (Sta- tistical Office of Montenegro) re- port, despite the significant growth of 9.6% in 2014, we can say that a small number of companies use on- line business concepts. There are numerous reasons for such state of affairs: many companies are inert in this sense, and being satisfied with the common channels of sale and service delivery they do not want to change the sales platform; the com- 45 panies are insensible to the new te- chnologies, and so on. According to a survey conducted by Monstat in 2015, the percentage of the enterprises that have received orders via Internet is 24.3%, whi- le the percentage of the companies that have placed orders via Inter- net is 24.1%. When it comes to the exchange of electronic information in procurement management, 31.3% of the companies regularly exchange information in procurement mana- gement with their suppliers or cu- stomers. Analysis of the products and servi- ces that the Montenegrin IT sector offers at the market shows that the majority of the companies base their portfolio on hardware. The software development and IT services are at the second place. The fact that com- panies that mainly deal with hard- ware employ almost twice as many people as those engaged in services or software is particularly intere- sting. According to the “IT Industry Ba- rometer” for Southeast Europe for 2016. (SEE ITIB 2016), total of 219 companies are active on Montene- grin market (although there is a number of 560 companies officially registered) and majority of them ba- ses their portfolio on hardware. The software development and services are at the second place. Software products and hardware services are at the third place, and this is a trend in past three years. Montenegrin IT sector is largely lo- cally owned (84%), while there is 14% of foreign companies and 2% of the local representatives of the foreign companies. About 70% of domestic companies work with the international companies at the lo- cal market, and only 22% are in the export business. According to the survey, in 2016, the smallest percent of the companies is involved in procuring the services for the hardware products (38%), while the largest percent of the com- panies deals with hardware produc- ts as such (72%). There is an evident growth comparing to 2014. 88% companies are not members of the ICT associations, while 8% compani- es are members of the Montenegrin IT cluster. 65.2% have cooperated with the international clients, which is 8.8% decline comparing to 2015. Although import has grown for 8.1% comparing to 2015, only 26.1% of these companies export their ser- vices, which is the smallest percent among the countries involved in the survey. Besides, the survey has fo- und that the majority of the compa- nies in Montenegro are oriented to- wards the region, when it comes to developing the export potential. STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. Montenegrin companies recognize the lack of support by the gover- nment institutions, lack of suitable brending of the domestic IT indust- ry abroad, lack of information about the foreign markets, lack of adequate business contacts abroad, as well as lack of training and consulting servi- ces, as the main export obstacles. Montenegro has the lowest average number of the employees in the ICT companies, on a regional level – 46% of the companies have up to 5 emplo- yees. Also, the survey found that the ICT companies in all of the countries, except for Montenegro, plan to raise the number of the employees. However, greater use of the ICT by SMEs, which is at a relatively low le- vel at present, directly contributes to the digital business in general. Small number of innovative start- up and spin-off companies, which intensive participation at the mar- ket should be provided through the necessary administrative and mar- ket conditions, represents another weak point regarding Montenegrin IT market. strategic deVelopMent tools Although the number of the com- panies that use the Internet is con- tinuously growing, low percentage of companies that trade or operate online represents a limiting fac- tor in the development of not only business itself but also the digital economy of the country as a whole. Delay in use of new business models in the sector of small and medium- sized enterprises affects equally the competitiveness of the Montene- grin economy and the growth of the companies. In this context, strategic development tools point to encoura- gement of transformation of the tra- ditional to digital business models through e-commerce, e-banking, the use of e-invoices and e-public procu- rement. Towards building a digital economy, it is necessary to raise awareness on the importance of the ICT for busi- ness profitability through targeted campaigns in cooperation with all stakeholders. From the standpoint of the digitalization of a business, it is particularly important to create conditions for electronic business concept, which is why the focus sho- uld be on creating conditions for the use of e-segments of business. It is particularly important to crea- te a legislative framework for equal treatment of e-invoices and paper invoices, even more so because, in comparison with the paper invoices, e-invoice processing is easier, it is faster in reaching the user and it is easier to store. Hierarchical organization of the companies that prevailed in the 20th century is already past and it cannot function in the framework of 47 the global, ever growing digital eco- nomy. Montenegrin companies must base their business models on the users’ excpectations, product im- provement, cooperation in innova- tion and organizational leadership, which more and more involves data experts in decision-making process and organizational learning. These are only some of the activites to- wards digitalization of the Monte- negrin economy, which needs to be oriented towards maximizing the benefits of the digital technologies. Creating the conditions for the de- velopment and optimizing the use of cloud computing, by businesses and public sector equally, can also contribute to the growth of the digi- tal economy. This constatation deri- ves from the statistic data available, which confirm the multiple benefits of cloud computing. In 2011, Micro- soft conducted a survey, which fo- und that transfer to cloud services has made a contribution of 40% rise in income for small and medi- um enterprises, comparing to those that haven’t transferred to cloud. In 2012, the EU study found that, for over 80% of the surveyed compani- es, transfer to cloud computing me- ans decrease in expenses up to 20%. Also, the study found that producti- vity rises up to 40%. Since changes in the education sy- stem can deliver results in approxi- mately 10 year time and not before, the activities should be focused on “import” of the ICT experts and wor- kforce. There are examples of some developed countries which create the conditions for young educated people to recognize their chance of success in working within an envi- ronment that has its own advanta- ges, and this is something we can create in Montenegro. Production of organic (green) software should be in focus, because it requires a rela- tively small investment and produ- ces enormous economic growth and thus has had its “explosion” in the market. The creation of the necessa- ry environment includes: adopting simple procedures to open ICT com- panies like these, with certain bene- fits and incentives in the domain of tax legislation regarding these com- panies, the provision of sufficient infrastructure resources (commu- nication and power) and provision of premises with the necessary faci- lities. These measures are aimed at the development of the ICT market and encouragement of the economic development of Montenegro in ge- neral. Stimulating environment for the start-up companies, along with en- hancing the development of elec- tronic public procurement, would create a much favorable business environment. The start-up compa- nies enhance innovation, as they are the present and the future of the digital economy. Their development STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. has retroactive effect both on the economy as a whole and on the la- bor market, particularly on youth employment. E-procurement, as well as compre- hensive e-infrastructure for G2B and B2B services, in addition to simple procedures, offers significant time savings in public procurement pro- cedures, and, through the reduction of discretionary rights, directly con- tributes to reducing corruption, whi- ch is why it is identified as one of the strategic development tools. 49 strategic indicators INdICATor Current state 2018 2020 The percentage of the companies that use ERP systems for the internal commu- nication 43,8 % 51% 60 % The percentage of the companies that use RFID technologies n/a 3 % 6 % The percentage of the companies that use social networks in business 43,2 % 51% 60% The percentage of the companies that use e-invoices n/a 0,5% 1,5 % The percentage of SMEs that sell prod- ucts or services online 24,1 % 30 % 40 % The share of e-commerce in total com- merce (on the national level) n/a 0,5 % 1,5 % The share of the ICT-a in GDP 4,2 % 5 % 6% STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. E-EDUCATION 7 51 Modern labor markets are largely fluid by nature, and require creativi- ty, teamwork, problem solving, criti- cal thinking, in an ever-changing en- vironment - these are the skills that the traditional education systems do not offer, and they are, on the other hand, very difficult to measure. As more and more aspects of the modern economy become enormo- usly reliant on the Internet and te- chnology, the demand for advanced ICT skills is also rising. Although, compared to total numbers, propor- tionally small fraction of the labor force of the future will be directly involved in, for example, software development or system design, it is still important to introduce children in classrooms with programming and basic concepts of ICT, because it can and should influence their futu- re career choice. Nowadays, we can witness how di- gital technologies can help both te- achers and students – enabling tea- mwork in classrooms via Internet, through applications that stimulate creativity and problem solving, all the way to the educational video games. The development of skills starts at the very birth and lasts throughout the whole life, and the- refore technologies must find their place in the system of education. european context The Digital Agenda for Europe calls for the introduction of e-education in the national policies and programs, in order to modernize education and training, including the curriculum, the evaluation of knowledge acqui- red, as well as the professional de- velopment of the teachers and edu- cators. The European Commission estima- tes that e-education is not suffici- ently represented in education and educational policies of the Member States. Although education and lear- ning represent segments of the nati- onal policies that are the responsibi- lity of the Member States, the Euro- pean Union is authorized to support the States in their efforts to moder- nize education and training systems, particularly through the promotion of exchange of good practice, as well as through the support for research and studies that deal with the effici- ent use of the ICT in teaching. There are many benefits of e-educa- tion: acquiring new skills, adopting new teaching methods, the individu- alization of learning and teaching ac- cording to the needs of the students and teachers, the diversity and rich- ness of teaching and learning styles, the innovative teaching practices that encourage cooperation, effecti- ve training of the workforce, but also STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. the lowering of the training price and time saving . The new risk of the digital age is in focus - the emergence of the digital divide between those students who have access to the innovative educa- tion based on the use of the advan- ced technologies and those students who are, in this sense, digitally mar- ginalized. According to the European Commission’s position in this mat- ter, open technologies, which pro- vide access to the education for everyone, represent the solution to the problem. Owing to the techno- logies, students can build-up their knowledge out of the open and free resources, create the educational communities both within the school and classrooms and outside of them, learning becomes personalized ac- tivity, customized for the individual student, teachers create a communi- ty where they can share experience and teaching materials, access to a wider range of the educational reso- urces is provided. Problem of greater inclusion of the ICT in education concerns mainly the fact that the European Union, due to the lack of the ICT professio- nals, can expect the number of up to 825.000 vacant jobs by 2020. A total of 9 EU countries have inte- grated or will integrate the program- ming at the elementary school level in the curriculum. At this level, pro- gramming is part of the curriculum in Estonia, France, Spain, Slovakia, United Kingdom, and will become part of the curriculum in Belgium, Finland, Poland and Portugal. A total of 12 EU countries have alre- ady integrated or will integrate the programming at the upper seconda- ry education level - Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, France, Hungary, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, Spain and the United Kingdom. national context All of the main units of the educati- onal institutions, up to the universi- ty level, have access to the Internet connection (ADSL - 4Mbps or satel- lite internet - 8Mbps). The regional units of the educational institutions are not covered by the Internet con- nection. In all educational institu- tions up to the university level the minimum amount of the computer equipment is provided. The compu- ter - student proportion in primary schools is 1:16, and 1:14 in the se- condary schools. When it comes to the basic level of the IT skills, a series of the trainin- gs for the teaching staff have been conducted, in order to provide them with the basic knowledge in this fi- eld. Through the project “ECDL for digital Montenegro” around 20% of 53 the teachers and the administrative staff in the educational institutions have been trained. In addition, 150 teachers attended training on the IT security (1.5 %). The level of the development of the digital materials for teaching and learning is insuffici- ent (didactic software, e-books, e-le- arning, etc.). There is an evident deficiency of the primary and secondary education, which, either due to the late intro- duction of the information technolo- gy subjects, or the content of the su- bjects per se, pays little attention to the importance of the digital compe- tences in the information society, de- spite the fact that 90% of job positi- ons require workforce with acquired digital skills. This situation is further complicated by the fact that the edu- cational system lacks educated staff for teaching IT-related courses. Number of the graduates in ICT-re- lated study programs is at the low level. strategic deVelopMent tools Starting from the national context and conditions in e-education, it is necessary to work intensively on the Internet signal coverage of the regi- onal units of the primary schools, as well as to increase the Internet spe- ed in the main units of the educati- onal institutions which are covered with the Internet. Providing educati- onal institutions with the computer equipment must be a continuous process in order to provide enough equipment for the teaching perfor- mance and improve the computer- student proportion. In addition to training teachers to use the information technology at a basic level, it is of particular im- portance to train them to apply the ICT in the teaching process itself, so the students can benefit more from the Internet and the technologies as such. Consequently, it is necessary to further promote the web portal for teachers. It is also necessary to pro- vide didactic software that will ena- ble better and more effective appli- cation of the ICT in the teaching pro- cess. However, the e-education pro- cess must take into account students as well, so it is necessary to establish a suitable portal for students, which would accompany the curriculum, enable some kind of knowledge eva- luation and offer extra curricular activites aimed at general education such as culture, sport, music, film and such. It is important to establish a system of distance learning and upgrade the curriculum with the aim of in- troducing larger number of the IT subjects, due to the current state of late introduction of the information technology in the primary education and substantial lack of a mid-level education, which can, with a change in the concept, create useful experts STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. at the level of the technicians and contribute to eliminating the bottle- neck between the education system and the labor market needs. It is necessary to evaluate the distributi- on of the IT subjects in the primary and secondary schools, as well as the profile of the teaching staff that conducts the IT courses, and, on the basis of these results, to take the appropriate measures to improve the teaching process of the IT su- bjects and to improve the applicati- on of the optional IT subjects in the educational institutions at all levels of education. This is all the more important bea- cuse the skills acquired by the young are not necessarily helpful in maxi- mizing the benefits. 55 strategic indicators INdICATor Current state 2018 2020 Student - computer proportion 1:16 (elementary schools) 1:14 (secondary schools) 1:12 1:10 Internet coverage in regional school units 0% 50% 100% Internet speed in main units 4 mbps fixed 8 mbps satellite 8 mbps fixed 20 mbps fixed Percentage of teachers trained (basic IT skills) 20% 25% 30% Percentage of teachers trained in IT security 1,50% 10% 20% Percentage of use of teachers’ web portal 1% 10% 20% STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. E-HEALTH 8 57 One of the basic tools which, toge- ther with organizational changes and the development of new medical skills, can significantly contribute to the development and advancement of the healthcare system, impro- ving the availability and quality of the healthcare services, as well as their higher efficiency and produc- tivity, is a set of systems and servi- ces which is known as e-health. E- health encompasses a broad scope of application of information and communication technologies in the healthcare system and it is designed for all the system participants: the citizen (for receiving the right infor- mation in a customized form), the patient (e-prescription, e-referral, e- identification), healthcare workers (integrated approach to electronic patient records concerning the time and level of healthcare), and system administrators at various levels (providing organizational and ope- rational information), as well as the healthcare system as a whole (the exchange of the information among the various entities of the healthcare system). european context Starting with the presupposition that technology development for e-he- alth can enhance health care quality and reduce health service expanses, the European Commission has adop- ted a whole set of documents (action plans, recommendations, directives) for the purpose of furthering stan- dardization and interoperability as well as certification of electronic he- alth records and equipment. Also, a Directive aimed at establishing rules for simplifying the approach to se- cure and quality crossborder healt- hcare in the EU and ensuring patient mobility, as well as improving coo- peration in the field of health care between the Member States, while recognizing the responsibility of re- spective Member States for determi- ning health-related social insurance eligibility. Traditionally, the standard of invest- ment for the EU is that 2-4% of the total health budged is allotted for di- gitalization of health care. The chan- ges to health systems, the volume of work and other factors affecting their performance, make health care information system and information and communication technologies application a priority for the deve- lopment of total health care systems and strategic planning in health in general. national context The process of planned informati- zation of the health system began in 2000 with the development of infor- matic support to operational proces- ses of the Health Insurance Fund. In this phase, basic common resources (technical-technological) which lay the foundation for all further infor- STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. matization of the health care system, in accordance with the project of he- alth care system improvement and all related reform processes. The informatization of the different levels of the health care system star- ted in 2004 with the informational support of reforms of primary health care, and continued with the infor- mational support of secondary health care, statistical reporting, production and distribution control of drugs in Montenegro. The informatization of primary health care was focused on supporting implementation of new methods of financing the work in the beginning, later moving on to support of medical processes themselves. The informational health care sy- stem was implemented in the follo- wing institutions: • at the primary level (all com- munity health centers, priva- te dental offices under con- tract with the Fund, Emer- gency Department), • at the secondary level (all general hospitals), blood transfusion medical services (Blood Transfusion Institute of Montenegro), health insu- rance services (Health Insu- rance Fund), • health-statistics reporting system (public health) and microbiological diagnostics (Public Health Institute) • Pharmaceutics (ZU Pharma- cies of Montenegro “Monte- farm“), control of drug pro- duction and distribution in Montenegro (Drug and Medi- cal Resources Agency). All users of the health insurence sy- stem in Montenegro have an electro- nic health record (EZK) in the form of a centralized electronic document available to the health care employe- es, and the institutions connected to the integral health care information system (IZIS). Each patient’s EZK contains data structured according to the specifications and contents of the electronic record. Records of around 80% of the health care serices in the existing IZIS (not including labs, radiology and similar services) are kept by way of the ICT. The Clinical Center of Montenegro (KCCG), which keeps its own inter- nal records and procedures, is not connected to IZIS. Thereby, the ove- rall percentage of the records in IZIS is reduced significantly. Special attention is paid to the sy- stem security and data protection, considering that medical and health data require particular care in the sense of general human rights, as well as the international and natio- nal legal norms and ethical princi- ples of data protection and their use within the health care system. 59 Institutional inter-connectedness and linkage to the data center of the Fund is realised as part of the pro- cedures of connecting state institu- tions to the network of state organs and state administration bodies. The type of links are dominantly MPLS networks and VPN public network communications. The speed and range are not adapted to the advan- ced and demanding services. Such is the case of radiological information system which involves the transfer of images of great resolution and ca- pacity. On the health system level, there is yet to be introduced a stan- dardized document management sy- stem. strategic deVelopMent tools Strategic planning of the develo- pment of the health care informati- on system and e-health services, asi- de from the direct national benefits, enables better regional cooperation. This can be seen in the efforts of the EU countries to improve e-health to the mutual benefit of the citizens and the health care system. Seen as a use of the Internet and the related technologies in the he- alth care system, e-health improves access, efficacy, efficiency, and quali- ty of medical and operational proces- ses. Its overall purpose is to enhance the health care system as a whole. The concept of e-health represents the most complex application of the information and communication technologies in the social realm. It ensures the availability of patient- related information via Internet and related technologies, regardless of where that information is needed, so that particular segments of e-health, such as the e-record, e-prescription, e-referral, e-identification, diagno- stics information system, m-health, and telemedicine can be realised for the data significant for the direct segment of healthcare rights, while medical data of the patients are avai- lable within IZIS. The abovementio- ned is the focus of this chapter. In this sense, a modern, up-to-date, and integrated health care system, supported by the ICT, is the cen- tral goal of e-health. Aside from the functional support, the informati- on health system must support the health care system reforms. Activi- ties should focus on digitalization of operational processes, reducing the costs, simplifying administrative procedures and health care system processes. The focus should be on quality, secure, and fast information exchange between all health care sy- stem users, with due respect to the privacy rights of citizens and the safety of the information regarding their health. The development and enhancement of integral healthcare information STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. system and e-health is one of the priority strategic areas regarding functioning and organization of he- alth care system at the national level (Healthcare Master Development Plan 2015-2020). Therefore, the adoption of the Strategy of the deve- lopment of health care information system and e-health, while adapting to the EU standards, represents pre- requisite for achieving accessible, quality and efficient healthcare and better management of the whole healthcare system. It is necessary to connect functionally all the se- gments of the health care protection into integral health care information system. Due to the terrain configuration and barriers to health care in certain parts of Montenegro, the tertiary le- vel doctors can deliver their services via telemedicine, in radiology, cardi- ology, emergency medical help etc, and this very interconnectedness among doctors would be of great importance for the Montenegrin po- pulation. Also, the tertiary level doc- tors can receive services from the doctors from other clinics in Europe and beyond, for certain methods of the health care, via telemedicine. 61 strategic indicators INdICATor Current state 2018 2020 The percentage of the registered electron- ic health care services 0% 30% 50% Access to the data of the user of the com- pulsory health insurance by the electroni- cally identified users 0% 30% 50% The registration and deregistration of the user of the compulsory health insurance (e-service) 0% 50% 70% The percentage of e-referrals issued 0% 30% 60% The percentage of e-prescriptions issued 0% 30% 60% The percentage of online appointments 0% 40% 70% STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. 9 E-INCLUSION 63 The aim of this chapter is focused on inclusion of all social groups into the process of increasing the level of digital literacy, taking into acco- unt that the advanced digital society requires equality and inclusion at all levels. According to the last OECD study, as income inequality rises, the level of economic growth falls. Therefore, measures taken against all forms of inequality contribute to the building of a just society, but they also affect the economy, making it more stable and stronger. The most common reasons for “digital exclusion” are low income and insufficient level of education of population, geographic location, culture and various forms of disability, as reported by the Eu- ropean Commission. european context Improving the digital literacy, skills and inclusion represents one of the priority areas of the Digital Agenda for Europe and a key initiative of the Strategy Europe 2020, which is di- rected towards creating sustainable European economy and technologi- es accessible to all. As reported in 2010, 30% of Euro- peans have never used the Internet, which explains why this issue beca- me one of the priority areas of acti- on. This situation came as a result of general lack of skills and insufficient level of awareness of the need for the Internet use among population aged 65 – 74. At the same time, for the population with low income, the unemployed or less educated, the main obstacle to Internet access is the price – for them, Internet is too expensive. The accessibility and usability re- present a problem for the Europe- ans with disability. Therefore, Digi- tal Agenda for Europe points to the need to adjust the new electronic content in such a way so it is accessi- ble to the persons with disability. In addition to the legal obligations, there are also strong economic argu- ments that affect the area of e-inclu- sion. Improving e-inclusion is feasi- ble, because it enables better access to the services for marginalized so- cial groups, as well as meeting the requirements of inclusive digital so- ciety. Improving access to services, both private and public, opens new market possibilities for a significant part of the population, and can also help the sector of public services to play its part in a cost-effective way. Meeting the EU directives and rec- commendations will help along the way, in order to bring South-Eastern European countries closer to the EU Member States regarding this mat- ter. Electronic content should be com- pletely accessible to the persons STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. with disability. It is also of great si- gnificance to harmonize the public web pages and the Internet services with the international accessibility standards. The agreements such as Strategy of the Council of Europe and UN convention on the rights of persons with disabilities, in the field of information accessibility, commu- nication and ICT technologies, pose a demanding program of require- ments in the coming years. national context In order to build an inclusive, digital society in a proper way in Montene- gro, there is a need to provide equal conditions for all citizens on the way towards developed knowledge so- ciety and bridge the digital divide completely. In this sense, particular attention was paid to the universal access to the Internet and techno- logies in the recent years, through overcoming digital divide regarding sex and differences among demo- graphical groups. As reported by the Monstat, out of 68.1% of individuals aged 65-74, who have used the Internet in Mon- tenegro, 65.9% use the Internet on a daily basis. The survey found that there are no Internet users of this age who access Internet less than once a week. According to the MONSTAT report, issued on October 30th 2015, the computer presence in Montenegrin households differs on regional level, as well as depending on the settle- ment type (urban/rural). The percent of the computer pre- sence in the northern region is the smallest and amounts to 49.7%, while this percent is the largest in Podgorica, and amounts to 60.4%. The computer presence is larger in urban areas – 60.8% of the ho- useholds in urban settlements said to have computer access, while 46.7% of the households in non- urban areas declared to posses a computer. Internet access in non-urban areas is 52.7%, while this percent is larger in urban areas – 75.3%. Internet access in households also differs on the basis of income. Out of the households with the income up to 300 EUR, 44.1% have the In- ternet access at home. Out of the ho- useholds with the income between 300 EUR and 600 EUR, 76% have Internet access at home, while this percent is significantly larger for the households with the income over 600 EUR – 92.2%. There are also differences on the ba- sis of the age and sex. According to MONSTAT, the percent of the Inter- net usage is larger for men (80.7%), while for the women this percent is 78.1% (the percents are measured 65 among the individuals that use the Internet almost every day). In order to overcome social and eco- nomic exclusion, the Ministry for In- formation Society and Telecommu- nications has realized a whole range of projects which involved different population categories. The program of education and evaluation of di- gital skills according to the ECDL standard included various social groups, such as Roma population, persons with disability, primary and secondary school students, the reti- red. The computer equipment was provided through donations to the best students-users of social welfa- re who live in rural areas, as well as associations which gather persons with disability and other vulnerable groups. Ministry for Information Society and Telecommunications in cooperation with the Association of Youth with Disabilities and the Association of the Blind of Montenegro, created the e-accessibility guidelines, which outline the forms of e-accessibility as well as the methods to eliminate the obstacles in the process of the web pages design. The guidelines are made for everyone involved in web pages creation, with the aim to point to the importance of Internet content accessibility for the persons with disabilities. strategic deVelopMent tools The modern digital society must be built upon the principles of equality, inclusion, openness, equal opportu- nities. This means that every indi- vidual must be equal member and user of the digital environment, but at the same time the individual must also take part of the responsibility towards development of the society, being one of the users of the benefits the society provides. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate all the activi- ties that reduce digital exclusion into every social care program, as well as employment programs, programs of care for the elderly, persons with disability programs, or any other program that concerns vulnerable groups. Although enabling access to the in- formation and communication te- chnologies and services can provide all citizens with equal opportuniti- es, this is not the only guarantee of maximizing the benefits of technolo- gies that an individual or a society as a whole can achieve. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on raising general awareness on possibilities that tech- nologies can open to each aspect of everyday life. On the other hand, cre- ating electronic services that reco- gnize the contribution of these gro- ups to the society in general can help to overcome the social and economic exclusion of the vulnerable groups. STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. Having in mind the abovementio- ned, strategic tools for inclusion of the vulnerable and marginalized so- cial groups need to be taken indivi- dually. When it comes to the rights of the persons with disabilities, there is a growing focus on their integration into information society. Therefore, it is necessary to work on applicati- on and enhancement of the existing regulation in this area, in order to adhere to the e-inclusion standards, primarily on the regulatory level. On the other hand, public institutions’ web portals and e-services targeted at this population must develop in accordance with the technologies and methods that ensure the appli- cation of WAI standards. The elderly need particular support towards the improvement of their quality of life, through simplifying their access to information and communication te- chnologies. The establishment of the volunteer education network could increase the number of the elderly who are ready to enjoy the benefits of the ICT technologies. Various models of the Internet servi- ces should be used towards inclusi- on of the minority social groups and promotion of their rights. Namely, it is necessary to improve the quality of Internet content targeted at these groups. Taking into account the pro- blem of inclusion of the young peo- ple from the rural and poor areas, it is important to use the potential of the distance learning concept (the development of e-learning platform) for the purpose of enhancing possi- bilities of their education. The sur- veys show how the insufficient level of the digital literacy of the female population represents a barrier to the e-inclusion of this segment of the population. Therefore, it is ne- cessary to make additional efforts towards the creation of educatio- nal workshops and campaigns for women in rural areas, who use tech- nologies at a rather insufficient level. The accessibility to public service terminals (cash machines, tourism information offices, payment machi- nes etc) is one of the prerequisites for participation in society and indu- stry). The large number of technolo- gical solutions exists at the market in order to simplify further the use of the services for the customers. When it comes to e-accessbility of these terminals, together with the physical accessibility, it is necessa- ry to provide the possibility of voice output of the machines, as well as tactile boards and buttons in Braille letters, so the customers with hea- ring disabilities can also use them. The growing phenomenon of the “di- gital exclusion” needs to be viewed from both social and economic stan- dpoints in order to determine the ef- fects of the activities realized in the field of e-inclusion, with the aim to eliminate the “digital gap”, the one 67 based on urban-rural division, as well as the one based on income and various social and demographic fea- tures of the population. strategic indicators INdICATor Current state 2018 2020 The percentage of the persons with disability who use the Internet at least on a weekly basis out of the to- tal number of persons with disability n/a 35 % 60 % The number of accessible web sites of the state institutions out of the total number of the web sites of the state institutions n/a 30 % 50 % The percentage of persons who have never used the Internet 26,4 % 18 % 13 % STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. E-GOVERNMENT 10 69 The modern environment and smart devices, social networks, the signifi- cant increase in information availa- bility, new social and media culture and customs, represent a basis for the new business operations in the digitalized public administration. The public administration should build operational models that will remove the traditional and outdated process barriers, as well as informa- tion systems and data redundance and promote so called “lean” servi- ces, according to the principle of the single contact point and single ser- vices point (e-services) of the public administration. The main goal of the e-government is establishing simple electronic ser- vices, horizontally and vertically in- tegrated into national and local ad- ministration, and above all oriented towards the users, available through various channels 24/7, and customi- zed for users’ needs both regarding quality and speed. european context European directives and recommen- dations in this field are outlined in the Digital Agenda for Europe 2020, the Digital Single Market Strategy and the EU eGovernment Action Plan 2016-2020. The Digital Agenda for Europe calls for the maximum support to the innovative, crossborder e-gover- nment solutions, and it specifically points to the necessity to ensure the full interoperability of the e-go- vernment services, bridging legal, organizational, technical and se- mantic barriers. Towards this goal, it is important to pay care to the European Interoperability Frame- work EIF 2.0, and its basic princi- ples: subsidiarity and proportiona- lity, user orientation, inclusion and access, security and privacy, multi- lingualism, administrative simplifi- cation, transparency, data protecti- on, openness, possibility of re-use, technological neutrality and adap- tability, efficiency and efficacy. The European eGovernment Action Plan 2016-2020 encompasses ne- eds, requirements and expectations of all stakeholders, both the citizens and business, as well as the public administration. The further development and wide- ning of the Interoperability Soluti- ons for European Public Administra- tions ISA, which particularly tackles the interoperability, but also some other e-government areas, such as electronic identification (eID), re- presents one of the main activities prescribed by this Action plan. In that sense, project STORK (Secure idenTity acrOss boRders linKed) is particularly prominent. Its purpo- se is the creation of the interopera- ble-crossborder system at the EU level, targeted at the verification of STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. the electronic identity in such a way that the national electronic identity systems can be used in all Member States. The development and imple- mentation of the large, multi-scale projects like this one enables the creation of the innovative crossbor- der solutions. The Services Directive binds the Member States to eastablish the single contact point, through which the states could provide crossbor- der service delivery. In addition to the single contact point, the Member States are directly bound to connect to the EU information system IMI (In- ternal Market Information System) which will enable business and citi- zens to communicate and exchange the information with public admini- strations of other Member States. It is the responsibility of the Member States to ensure full implementation of this system at the internal level in each Member State. The Digital Single Market Strategy goal is to alleviate crossborder com- munication via Internet, enhance electronic service delivery and elec- tronic commerce, regardless of the location of business or citizen, with the purpose to: • Alleviate access to online go- ods and services for the citi- zens and the business • Improve the conditions whi- ch boost the development of the digital networks and ser- vices • Enhance the digital economy growth. national context In the recent period, the focus was on establishment of a new method of public administration operations – electronic operations, that is its direct application in projects that improve the information exchange in electronic form within state admi- nistration (G2G) as well as between individuals or legal entities and sta- te administration (G2C and G2B). In this context, the two basic factors are recognized to develop and im- prove e-government: the technical- technological and the legal and orga- nizational factors or preconditions. Through the implementation of two important projects: the e-gover- nment portal (web-services of the the state administration) and eDMS (the electronic document manage- ment system within the state admi- nistration), technical-technological preconditions for the establishment of e-government were created. Putting into power the Law on e-go- vernment (Official Gazette of Mon- tenegro, no 32/14) the formal le- gal conditions were created for the transfer from traditional, paper-ba- sed documentation procedures to electronic document procedures. 71 The e-government web portal, esta- blished in 2011, as a central online point of access to the public admini- stration services at the national and local level, enables administration to modernize and broaden its servi- ces by way of implementation of the electronic services. This is how the availability of the services increases, overcoming the barriers of working hours or location. At the end of 2015, 129 services, within the authority of 27 institutions, were available at the e-government portal. The basic divi- sion of all the e-services available at the e-government portal is the follo- wing: • Informative e-services (le- vel 1 and 2) – the e-services which provide only the infor- mation to the end-user or the possibility to retrieve certain forms and save them on their computer; • Electronic e-services (level 3, 4 and 5) – the e-services that enable the end-user to start and complete the whole service, from completing and sending the electronic form to receiving the information or the document wanted. At the end of 2015, at the e-gover- nment portal there were 35 infor- mative e-services and 94 electronic e-services, divided according to the users: • Individuals (citizens and en- trepreneurs) – 77 e-services • Legal entities (businesses and other legal entities) – 44 e-services • Public administration – 12 e-services One of the methods to measure the level of the e-services use is also a number of the registered or electro- nically identified users. For electro- nic services, there are various ways (types) of the electronic identifica- tion, from the lowest level, where no identification is required – so called anonymous login, up to the highest level of identification, whe- re the identification with the qua- lified digital certificate and digital signature of e-form is required. The number of the users registered in 2015. with e-mail account is 6505, while the number of the registered users witg the qualified digital cer- tificate (individuals and legal entiti- es) is 58. strategic deVelopMent tools The goal of the Strategy is to en- sure further development of e-go- vernment by way of increasing the number of user-oriented and busi- ness-oriented e-services developed on unique state information systems and solutions, acknowledging the fundamental principle “only once” (the citizen submits particular data STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. only once, and further on the data is only transferred). Starting with the main goal of the public administration, that is its role as public service for the citizens and business, the strategic goals must be focused on electronic public ser- vices, as well as requirements that must be met by 2020, in relation to the development of the modern, di- gital society which uses the potential of all the information available to the public sector at a maximum level. The interoperability system in Mon- tenegro is still developing. It should ensure the link between the infor- mation systems formerly developed according to the system of “silos” into a unique system which will en- sure overcoming the legal and orga- nizational as well as the technical-te- chnological barriers and differencies on the state administration level and enhance e-government. This system also, as a central interoperability sy- stem, enables public administration to exchange the information through secure channels with high level of protection and encryption which fol- low security conditions for system connection, particularly system of authorization with related safety certificates. The creation of public registry sho- uld be of particular importance – Metaregistry, which functions as col- laborative tool for the development of the system of connecting public registries. Aside from all the existing methods and options of connection being inserted, Metaregistry needs to ensure the coordination in chan- ges of the registry system and create so called “referential integrity”. Stra- tegic development tools encompass several components: • e-services – improve the exi- sting and develop new elec- tronic public services, inclu- ding crossborder electronic services • interoperability – establish a unique system for electronic data exchange (interoperabi- lity) at the state level • eID – adapt the existing and develop new eID systems and mechanisms with the purpo- se of meeting the require- ments by the service provi- der • Open Data – enable availabi- lity of the public administra- tion data in open formats for further use and processing • Digital Single Market (DSM) – provide business and citi- zens with the opportunity to realize their requests to the public administration, via Internet, in accordance with “once and only” principle. 73 e-services Improving the existing and creating and developing new electronic pu- blic services as well as evaluation and enhancement of their quality, while at the same time taking into account new possibilities that emer- ge in the context of the dynamic de- velopment of the digital technologi- es, and the availability of the digital content, is crucial goal of this part of the Strategy. Reaching this goal is ai- med at creation of the conditions for citizens and legal entities, but also the public administration, to access the useful, available, secure, mana- geable (user-friendly) tools which are adapted to various technologies. E-services provide the citizens with the possibility to use the public ad- ministration services regardless of their location and technology they use to access the Internet (hardwa- re, software) or electronic communi- cation channel chosen. Particular attention needs to be paid to the crossborder aspect of certain electronic services. Namely, the EU integration process takes place in the digital world too, and therefore it is necessary to create, both legal and technological, the conditions for the implementation of the crossborder electronic services. In the context of preparation for the delivery of modern e-services that will enable better quality of life and put a friendly face on public admini- stration, it is necessary to perform rationalization of the administrative procedures and connect and optimi- ze processes in various administrati- ve institutions. This is possible only through consistent implementation and control of legal obligations re- garding single access to e-services via e-government portal, along with ensuring the quality of these servi- ces expected by the user. The main concern is users’ satisfac- tion, taking into account availability and high level of accessibility to the different social groups. According to the Law on e-government, all state bodies are bound to prepare adequa- te applications for reception of all kinds of forms that can be submitted to that organ in an electronic format, with the purpose of creating conditi- ons to file the citizens’ requests via e-government portal. It is necessa- ry to implement as many e-services from level 4 and level 5 as possible and secure full implementation of the Law on e-government in the pe- riod from 2016 to 2020. interoperability At the state level, the interoperabi- lity must be based on the following presumptions: logical and purpose- ful circulation and use of the infor- mation, with the focus on processes and services of the public admini- stration, open administration (tran- STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. sparency, participation and coopera- tion), the technological neutrality. Introduction of the unique interope- rability system at the national level creates opportunities to transform e-services of public administration into fully interoperable ones, while overcoming organizational, techni- cal and semantic barriers. Reaching this goal will help avoid all the use- less technical conditions such as ap- plications that are operable only in certain technical environment, with special devices or on special digital platforms. In this manner, joint use of data will be alleviated, and the interaction between state organs will be simplified, at the same time providing users with more options, increasing efficacy, efficiency and transparency of the public admini- stration. The unique system for electronical exchange of information at the sta- te level will ensure interoperability between the existing and the new information systems in public admi- nistration, at the same time elimina- ting duplication of their functions. According to the Law on e-gover- nment, all state bodies and public administration organs are bound to exchange data via this information system, and it that sense its imple- mentation is absolutely necessary. e-identification Electronic identification (eID) re- presents the foundation for the le- gal performance of e-services. eID mechanisms exist on different le- vels, both internal and public. eID technologies and authentification services are of crucial importance for transactions via Internet, both in private and public sector. The most common authentification method today is password. For many appli- cations this may be enough, but the- re is a growing need for more secure solutions and solutions secured by the high level of authentification. The need for different mechanisms and eID solutions is particularly evi- dent in e-government services, de- pending on different requirements and needs of the service provider. Therefore, it is necessary to provi- de different solutions that satisfy the basic standards and the develo- pment platforms based on interope- rability requirements. The improve- ment and adaptation of the existing and the development of the new eID systems and mechanisms represents a necessity, particularly in terms of meeting the requirements by the service provider, i.e. type and level of e-service. Particular care should be paid to the systems that operate on mobile platform, smart phones and other mobile, personalized devices. In this context, electronic identification sy- 75 stem needs to be improved through the use of the mobile technology. open data Open data promote multilateral co- operation, support and enhance the development of the open, transpa- rent and responsible state admini- stration, binding the state instituti- ons to promote fight against corrup- tion and take active participation. This concept also encourages citi- zens and civil sector to participate actively in improving public services that the state provides. The need for the open data comes from its featu- res. The main features of the data are: accessibility in machine-reada- ble format, access to data as a whole, at a reasonable price which ranges within litims of the reproduction costs, the possibility to download the data, the possibility to re-use the data and redistribute it, the concept of universal participation in its use – anyone should be able to use and distribute the data etc. Open Data concept enables the pu- blic to access integral data without obstacles and to use it in such a man- ner as it finds convenient, with the obligation to cite the source. In this manner, the data that is produced once gains in value by the possibi- lity to be re-used or integrated with other data, thus becoming useful again, to the new user. EU supports Open Data for the fol- lowing reasons, recognized also in Montenegro for the purpose of im- proving the policy in this field: • Open Data has a significant potential to be re-used in new products and services; • Determinating/finding a so- lution for social challenges – having access to as much data as possible significan- tly influences the process of finding new and innovative solutions; • Reaching higher level of effi- ciency through data exchan- ge within public administra- tion and among its various institutions; • Enabling citizens’ participati- on in civil and social life and increasing administration transparency. • For all the reasons mentio- ned above, the standards for the Open Data will be defined and the concept and its im- plementation will be promo- ted accordingly. digital single Market The Services Directive and the Di- gital Single Market Strategy aim to enable business and citizens to rea- lize their requests to public admini- stration, through full implementati- on of the interoperability, via Inter- STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. net, according to the “once and only“ principle, regardless of their locati- on within EU. Digital single market is one of the the most promising areas of development which opens possibilities to boost economy by means of e-commerce, by simpli- fying administrative procedures and strengthenning e-government users. Public services developed within the digital single market are transferred from fixed to mobile platforms and they are increasingly present today, allowing the access to information and content at any time, any place and any device. This progress demands a regulatory framework that is favorable for the development of cloud computing, connectability of mobile data regar- dless of state borders and simple access to information and content, followed with full protection of per- sonal data and total implementation of cyber security tools. The process of EU accession poses demands such as the establishment of single contact point, as well as connecting to IMI – Internal Market Information System, which will ena- ble crossborder service provision as well as information exchange with public administration in other sta- tes. 77 strategic indicators INdICATor Current state 2018 2020 The number of e-services available at the e-government portal, out of the 20 priority services as listed and defined by the EU 6 15 20 The number of e-services at minimum of level 5 15 30 The percentage of the citizens that have used e-services in past 12 months n/a 20% 50% The percentage of legal entities that have used e-services n/a 15 30% The number of the electronic certificates of all types issued for the purpose of eID to ac- cess the e-government portal services 7,000 10,000 20.000 STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. RESEARCH, INNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT 11 79 Smart growth, with research and innovation at its core, in addition to improving the quality of education, demands strengthening of the rese- arch capacities, enhancement of in- novation and transfer of knowledge, as well as the use of ICT at a maxi- mum level. The development supported by in- novation is not the prerogative of high-income countries anymore. Montenegro has started with the im- plementation of whole range of re- forms with the purpose of creating a favorable environment for research and innovation. Increased regional cooperation in the field of research, increased possibilities for coopera- tion between research centers and private sector, as well as continuous work on legal framework, represent only some of the strategic tools tar- geted at advancing the state of ICT area of research and innovation. european context European framework for research, development and innovation is de- fined by the “Europe 2020”, strategy that combines research, education, financial support and intellectual property as the basic components of the EU development plan. The key initiative of this Strategy is the “Innovation Union”, targeted at en- hancement of the general conditions and financial support for research and innovation, in order to enable transformation of the innovative ideas into products and services, which will create economic growth and new jobs. The “Innovation Union” is imple- mented through various structures and programs, and Montenegro is an active participant in majority of them. The European Research Area – ERA, represents a unique coopera- tion framework in the field of rese- arch, development and innovation in Europe. “Horizon 2020” is the most signifi- cant EU program for research and innovation, with 78 billion euro fun- ds at its disposal. These funds are available for the period between 2014. and 2020. The ICT is one of the priority areas financed through this program. The most significant ICT infrastructure project within H2020 program is a pan-European acade- mic and research network (GEANT), with a whole decade of experience in providing European academic and research institutions (and not only European) with the necessary infra- structure services that enable rese- arch, development and cooperation at all levels of science and research. national context The scientific and research activity in Montenegro is realized in a total of 58 licensed scientific and resear- ch institutions in 2016. (universities, STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. institutes, faculties and companies). Research and development activiti- es in Montenegro are performed by a total of 1.395 researchers. Within the total number of licensed institu- tions, 8 of them (13.8%) deal with the ICT as the core activity. National science and research system is implemented dominantly through the scientific projects. During the re- search cycle 2012-2016, 104 projec- ts were financed with 5 million euro within the priority areas of science, and 17 of them (14.8%) were related to the ICT scientific field. The “Higher Education and Research for Innovation and Competitiveness” (HERIC) project finances 8 major re- search grants, with 2.54 million euro in the period 2015-2017, which con- tributes to improving the quality of of science and research system. Three projects among them (37.5%) are from the ICT scientific field. Draft Strategy for Innovation (2016- 2020), prepared by the Ministry of Science, defines the following the- matic priorities in the field of innova- tion for the period to 2020: Energy; Agriculture and Food; Sustainable Development and Tourism; Informa- tion and Communication Technolo- gies; Medicine and Health; New Ma- terials, Products and Services. The first Center of Excellence in Bi- oinformatics “BIO-ICT” is establis- hed at the University of Montenegro - Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Podgorica, which is funded with 3.4 million euro for the period of 3 years. The Center is financed by the project HERIC. The Center of Excellence is made of a consortium of 8 partners, and the research is conducted in 6 laboratories (2 of them are the new ones). 82 researchers work at the Center, and they come from different fields of science. 15 of them are yo- ung researchers - doctoral students and 5 of them are postdoctoral fel- lows. The Center of Excellence re- presents the interdisciplinary rese- arch center in the following resear- ch areas: ICT, agriculture and food, medicine and health and sustainable development and tourism. The main research objective of the Center is to increase the application and use of the modern ICT technologies in the areas of sustainable agricultu- re, crop monitoring, water/sea and forests ecosystems, development of techniques to control and reduce air pollution, analysis and standardiza- tion of food products, quality control of land and improvement of public health system. Montenegro will soon put into ope- ration the object is intended for science and innovation activity, “Technopolis” in Nikšić, which will contribute to: connecting science and business sector; improving the competitiveness of small and me- dium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and 81 promotion of entrepreneurship; support for new companies. All the abovementioned components en- hance technological development of Montenegro. Montenegrin Academic Network (MREN) is part of the GEANT H2020 project and the pan-European rese- arch network. This is an infrastruc- ture prerequisite for the realization of activities aimed at the inclusion of the national scientific community in international projects in the field. 28 (48.3%) of the licensed scientific and research institutions are con- nected to MREN. International scientific and techno- logical cooperation is realized thro- ugh Montenegrin participation in multilateral programs and projects: “Horizon 2020”; COST; EUREKA; NATO SpS; IAEA; ICGEB; CERN and IPA. During the period between 2011 and 2016, bilateral scientific and technological cooperation was rea- lized through 182 projects with 15 countries. strategic deVelopMent tools Regarding the European and natio- nal context and the fact that the ICT is one of the strongest drivers of the scientific research development in this century, it is clear the ICT should be one of the preferential strategic directions of scientific research and innovation activity in Montenegro by 2020. This can be done through the support by a number of strategic di- rections and activities that will make synergetic contribution to improving the overall scientific research and in- novation activities, inclusion in the European Research Area - ERA, as well as the achievement of the ove- rall objectives of this Strategy. The support for increasing the num- ber of research and innovation in- stitutions in the field of ICT will be implemented through the provision of infrastructural conditions in “Teh- nopolis” in Nikšić, the establishment of the first Science and Technology Park (NTP) in Podgorica, impulse centers in Pljevlja and Bar, and other programs and projects. This will contribute to strengthening the link between science, research, innovati- on and business. It will also enable connecting scientific research insti- tutions and higher education insti- tutions with the existing compani- es, the foundation of new small and medium enterprises, “start-up” and “spin-off” innovative ICT subjects and the creation of synergy in the sy- stem of science, research and inno- vation, in order to create new values that will have a direct impact on eco- nomic growth and the achievement of the projected goals. There are ongoing preparations for the establishment of another Center of Excellence that will contribute to STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. improving the quality of the resear- ch and innovation, by connecting se- veral scientific institutions and com- panies in Montenegro and abroad. These institutions and companies will be connected by the realization of the interdisciplinary research in priority areas of science, important for Montenegro. Financing and enhancement of the national and international projec- ts that are related to the ICT, or the projects supported by the ICT, is one of the important tools that will contribute to the necessary develo- pment of the scientific research and innovation activity in this field. Also, the fields of the science and the eco- nomy, in the form of the body organs involved in the development of the innovative activities in Montenegro, are of particular importance for the improvement of the use of funding instruments for innovation and the strengthening of innovation activiti- es by foreign programs and projects as well as credit support. The development of the Montene- grin Research and Education Net- work (MREN), enhancement and support to the scientific and resear- ch institutions to connect to this ne- twork and use the available services, is one of the tools that will contribu- te, above all, to the inclusion of the national institutions in the Europe- an research area (ERA) in terms of infrastructure. It will also enable lo- cal connection and, overall, give im- petus to the development of the ICT in Montenegro. Connecting educati- onal institutions to the MREN would contribute to the further increasing of scientific, research and innovati- on base of the ICT. Finally, this will enable the synergy and contribution in terms of the resources neecessary for the achievement of the mission of this Strategy. 83 strategic indicators INdICATor Current state 2018 2020 The share of the ICT in the activities of the research institutions and innovative organi- zations 13,8% 20% 30% The share of the ICT in the national scientific and innovative programs and projects 14,8 % 20% 30% The share of the ICT in the international sci- entific and innovative programs and projects 20 % 25% 30% The percentage of the scientific and re- search institutions connected to the MREN 48,3% 60% 80% STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020. METHODOLOGY OF THE STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION 12 85 The implementation of the Strategy is a complex process, with its reali- zation further complicated by the complexity of the reality itself and the problems which couldn’t be ar- ticulated at the time the strategic goals were outlined. In that sense, clear methodological plan of the Strategy implementation is the only guarantee of the achievement of the strategic goals. In order to avoid the risks that fol- low the long term plans, which are often also too abstract, and with the purpose to define the necessary tools for the realization of strategic development plans in the best way possible, yearly action plans for the implementation of the Strategy for Information Society Development 2020 are to be implemented. Activi- ties which are to be part of these ac- tion plans will be defined according to the identified development goals, with the aim of reaching the strate- gic indicators. Also, bearing in mind that the indica- tors are targeted to 2018. and 2020, there will be a two-year overview of the efficacy of the indicators defined. Efficient coordination, which falls with the Ministry for Information Society and Telecommunications, according to its authority, is necessa- ry for the successful implementation of the Strategy. The Agency for Ee- lectronic Communications and Po- stal Services, the Ministry of Educa- tion and the Ministry of Health, the NGOs, civil sector, as well as other governmental and local institutions who will be recognized as the carri- ers of the particular activities iden- tified to reach strategy goals. In this contect, coordination body will be formed, comprised of the subjects mentioned above, with the aim to monitor the Strategy implementati- on through the yearly action plans. Coordination body will define imple- mentation monitoring and evaluati- on mechanisms. STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.

INTRODUCTORY  REMARKS  1    9 “Strategy for the Information Society  Development of Montenegro 2020“  represents a strategy of continuity  in relation with the previous one.  The life cycle of the previous Stra- tegy ends in 2016. The period from  2012. to present day represents a  time of an intensive and dynamic de- velopment of information society in  Montenegro.  As stated in the last World Economic  Forum report on global competitive- ness in the field of ICT, Montenegro  is a regional leader. This is also the  case in the field of the development  of the electronic government – Mon- tenegro is ranked 45. in the competi- tion of 194 United Nations member  states. The development of an open,  competitive, advanced and secure  information society was accompani- ed by the increase in the number of  the computer users and the Internet  users, and also the progress achie- ved in the area of the broadband In- ternet access infrastructure. Signifi- cant advances have been made in the  field of cyber security. All the main  units of the educational institutions,  up to the university level, are pro- vided with the Internet connection,  the information systems in health  and education are established, the  scientific and research activities in  the field of ICT are enhanced.  Legislation in the field of the infor- mation society is largely harmoni- zed with the EU acquis. This is also   stated in the European Commission  report on Montenegro’s progress in  2015, in the field of the European in- tegration, within Chapter 10 that de- als with the area of the information  society and media. “The European  Union supports a well-functioning  internal market for electronic com- munications, electronic commerce,  and audio-visual services,” the re- port states, adding that “the rules  protect consumers and support the  universal availability of the modern  services. The progress has been  made regarding the issue of the con- struction of a national broadband  network.“  „Strategy for the Information Socie- ty Development 2020“ outlines the  strategic development tools in this  development field, with a view to  reaching the EU standards set out in  the Digital Agenda 2020 and the Di- gital Single Market Strategy. The do- cument is divided into chapters that  have been identified as the key steps  to achieve the EU standards in this  field, namely: broadband infrastruc- ture, cyber security, human capital,  digital business, e-education, e-he- alth, e-inclusion, e-government and  research, innovation and develo- pment. The above-mentioned chap- ters are tackled through both the Eu- ropean and the national context, the  strategic development tools and the  indicators that will serve as a kind of  benchmarks of the information soci- ety development in Montenegro.     STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  DIGITAL   MONTENEGRO 2    11 “Strategy for the Information Society  Development of Montenegro 2020”  is a digital development strategy  which, along with the ICT technolo- gies in the key development areas,  also deals with the problem of the  lack of the ICT skills, which signifi- cantly slows down the multiplicative  effects that the modern technologi- es have on productivity growth. The  strategic development tools are tar- geted to reaping the benefits brou- ght by the modern technologies. The  digital technologies enable the deve- lopment of the commerce, enhance  better use of capital and strengthen  the national competitiveness. Rapid  adoption of the digital technologies  in the economy also signified the  rapid diffusion of the benefits they  have brought. The Internet has be- come an integral part of the national  infrastructure, such as energy and  transport, therefore becoming a fac- tor of production in most segments  of the modern economy.  In this sense, Internet connection  remains an important goal, but also  a significant challenge which should  contribute to the creation of a digi- tal Montenegro, in combination with  the selected strategic development  tools. Broadband infrastructure, cy- ber  security, human capital, digital  business, e-inclusion, e-education, e- health, e-government, as well as re- search, innovation and development  are the backbone of the information  society development of Montenegro.  Broadband Internet access at high  speed is no longer considered a  luxury, but a basic infrastructure for  the economic development of a co- untry. Building adequate infrastruc- ture for the fast and secure Internet  represents a demand of the digital  era, and only those countries that  possess the infrastructure which can  provide fast data transfer via Inter- net can count on economic growth.  The target group of users are all ci- tizens and the economy as a whole,  which should be provided with avai- lable broadband, both in business  and in everyday life, regardless of  their location, education level, age  or interests they have. This implies  a greater density of broadband con- nections, the availability of sufficient  speed and affordable price. Particu- lar attention should be paid to the  households in rural areas, which  need broadband in order to be able  to use the services of the informa- tion society, towards achieving the  balanced development of all Monte- negrin regions.  Nowadays, the telecommunication  sector is experiencing structural  changes and it is still struggling with  the unconnected national markets,  the lack of regulatory consistency  and predictability in the EU, especi- ally regarding the radio spectrum, as  well as the lack of the sufficient in- vestment, particularly in rural areas.  Those problems have been the focus     STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  of a debate on the package for a sin- gle telecommunications market.  In the area of the fixed networks,  there is little real competition in the  field of the infrastructure, except in  very densely populated areas where  the cable networks are already set  up or in the areas where the local  authorities are active. More simple  and more proportionate regulation  is needed in those areas where there  has been a competition in the field  of the infrastructure on the regional  or the national level. It is necessa- ry to encourage the introduction of  high-capacity networks and retain  effective competition as well as the  corresponding revenue in relation to  the risks.  The countries that manage to brid- ge the digital divide related to the  Internet access are often faced with  the new digital gap – the problem  of the uneven distribution of the  skills, which is precisely why the  strategic tools of chapters human  capital and e-inclusion are focused  on eliminating this risk in the co- urse of the digital development of  Montenegro.  The administration becomes increa- singly digital, and the number of the  jobs in the administration which are  related to the ICT, i.e. the number of  the jobs which require a certain le- vel of the ICT skills, is growing. By  2014, all 193 UN member states had   their own national websites, 101 of  which enabled citizens to open their  personal accounts on the national  portal, 73 of them enabled citizens  to submit completed tax forms via  portal and 60 of them enabled citi- zens to use portal to register a busi- ness. Montenegro, which joined this  „company“ of countries, will contri- bute significantly to improving the  quality of life of all its citizens, with  the further development of the elec- tronic government, modernizati- on of administration and use of the  Open Data.  Successful integration of the ICT in  education and improvement of the  healthcare services through ICT are  also recognized as the strategic tools  aimed at increasing the social welfa- re. Strategic tools for research and  innovation in the field of ICT are de- fined with the aim of increasing the  level of investment in R&D in this  area.  Vision  Digital Montenegro – a country that  has recognized the economic and so- cial potential of the ICT, remains the  guiding vision of the development of  the information society in Montene- gro until 2020. As reported by the  European Commission, share of the  ICT sector in overall EU economy is  2.8%, and this sector, together with  the investment in ICT, generates  50% of productivity growth. Accor- ding to MONSTAT official data, share     13 of ICT sector contribution to Monte- negrin GDP is 4.2%.   In order to exploit the impact of the  ICT to the economic growth, this  sector is recognized as paramount  for the economic development and  strengthening of the national com- petitiveness. In that sense, the vision  is focused on inclusive and develo- ped digital society where everyone  has an opportunity to create, access  and exchange information and kno- wledge.   Mission  Legal, organizational and technical  framework for the information so- ciety development in Montenegro is  based on the three components:  • Infrastructure  • Cyber security and  •  e-economy, which involves  e-business, e-education, e- health, e-inclusion, e-gover- nment and research, innova- tion and development in the  field of ICT,  with the aim to provide for the grow- th of the ICT sector, through the rea- lization of the strategic development  priorities, thus ensuring broader use  of the ICT in other sectors as well  and encouraging the economic gro- wth in general.  strategic priorities  Strategy for the Information Society  Development in Montenegro 2020  identifies strategic development tools  with the key performance indicators.  The key performance indicators  (KPI) represent important criteria  to measure progress achieved in the  scope of the defined development  directions. Along with the quality  and quantity indicators, there are  also the exit performance indicators,  that mostly measure the realization  of the activities planned, which will  be part of the action plans for the  Strategy implementation.  Defining the indicators in the adop- tion phase of the Strategy enables  efficient monitoring of the progress  achieved in terms of the strategic  goals, during their implementation.  The indicators can also be used du- ring the evaluation and goals revi- sion processes in the course of the  Strategy life cycle.  The specific strategic priorities, defi- ned out of the strategic development  tools, will be of particular interest  during the Strategy implementation.  In this sense, the strategic priorities  involve the following goals:  Broadband access availability:  •  the basic broadband access  ⇒ coverage: 100% of the po- pulation by 2018.    STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  •  the fast broadband access  (30 Mbit/s or more) ⇒ cove- rage: 100% of the population  by 2020.  Strong organizational infrastructure  for the prevention and combat aga- inst Internet incidents:   •  The capacities of the national  CIRT for protection, preventi- on and combat against Inter- net incidents strengthened,  with the total number of the  team experts to increase to  20 by 2020.  •  The improvement of the  structure of local CIRTs.   Growth of the basic and advanced  digital skills:  •  the percentage of the ICT gra- duates in total number of the  graduates should amount to  10% by 2020. and  •  the number of the ECDL cer- tificates issued should reach  15.000 by 2020.  In the field of the digital business,  the share of the ICT in GDP should  reach 6%, which will be reflected in  economic growth and job creation  in other sectors of the economy. The  share of e-commerce in total com- merce should reach 1.5%.  Focus of the e-education segment is  the proportion of available compu- ters per student in schools, as well   as the skills of the teaching staff,  with the following aims:  •  Computer-Student proporti- on should be 1:10 by 2020.  •  The percentage of the te- achers trained to work on  computers should be 30%  of the total teaching staff,  whilst the percentage of the  teachers skilled in the field  of cyber security should be  20% of the total number of  the teaching staff.  When it comes to e-health, the per- centage of e-prescriptions and e-ref- ferals issued, out of the total number  of the prescriptions issued, should  reach 60%, while online appoint- ments should surpass the traditional  appointments, and reach 70% of the  total number of appointments.  The elimination of the digital divide  between urban and rural areas, as  well as income-based digital divide,  and the divide based on social and  demographic characteristics, repre- sents a priority of the e-inclusion se- gment of the Strategy.  The orientation towards the further  development of e-government in  Montenegro should contribute to  the increase in number of the users  who choose to communicate electro- nically with the public administrati- on, so the percentage of the citizens  who use e-services should be 50%     15 by 2020, and the percentage of legal  entities using e-services should be  30%.  The percentage of the scientific and  research institutions in the field of  ICT out of the total number of the  licensed institutions should reach  30%, which will have positive effects  on the increase in financing the re- search in this field in relation to the  overall budget for research and in- novation.    STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  BROADBAND   INFRASTRUCTURE  3    17 The society as a whole increasingly  relies on the use of electronic com- munication services as well as the in- formation society services in general.  The high quality digital infrastructure  is a basis for almost every sector of  the modern, innovative society. Digital  society, the society that delivers susta- inable economic and social benefits,  based on the contemporary network  services and fast internet connection,  is at the top of the strategic priorities  of the developed economies.  The introduction of the new ICT and  other contemporary services, which  require high data transaction speed,  is unthinkable without the develo- ped broadband access and adequa- te infrastructure. The development  and construction of modern elec- tronic communication networks,  efficient use of the radio-frequency  spectrum, geographic and economic  accessibility of broadband, repre- sent a goal with respect to the deve- lopment of digital Montenegro.   european   context  The expansion of fast and ultra-fast  Internet access is one of the prio- rities set by the Digital Agenda for  Europe, together with the of the be- nefits of Digital Single Market for ho- useholds and business sector. Digital  Agenda has brought concrete me- asures and goals, as well as recom- mended deadlines for achievement  of these goals.  The main goals for improvement of  the broadband access are the follo- wing:  •  the basic access ⇒ coverage:  100% of the EU population  by 2013,  •  the fast access (30 Mbit/s or  more) ⇒ coveraget: 100% of  the EU population by 2020,  •  ultra-fast access (100 Mbit/s  or more) ⇒ usage: 50% of  the EU households by 2020.  EU Member States have adopted  national plans and strategies for  the broadband access development,  which differ among the Member  States. The availability of the bro- adband access via fixed network is  highest in the states that possess a  well developed xDSL infrastructure  amounting to more than 90%. In the  recent years the availability of the  broadband Internet access via xDSL  hasn’t significantly changed, due to  the fact that the EU states focused on  NGA infrastructure (VDSL, DOCSIS 3,  FTTP) and wireless technologies de- velopment. The availability of NGA  infrastructure in EU Member States  totals 68%.    STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  The average penetration of broad- band subscriptions in EU is 31,1%.  The share of different technologies  in total number of broadband inter- net access subscriptions via fixed  network is as follows:  •   The share of broadband  access via xDSL (including  VDSL) is 70% (from 100% in  Greece to 15% in Bulgaria),  •  The share of broadband  access via KDS (including  DOCSIS 3) is 18% (from 51%  in Belgium to 0% in Greece  and Italy),  •  The share of FTTH/B is 8%  (from 58% in Latvia to 0% in  Greece and Malta),  •  The share of other technolo- gies of broadband access is  4%.  The average availability of LTE te- chnologies in EU Member States is  79% (from 100% in Sweden to 0%  in Cyprus). Taking into account all  the active users, that is the users  who access the Internet both via  smartphones and data SIM cards,  the penetration of broadband Inter- net access through mobile networks  in EU amounts to 71,6%.  Taking into consideration the needs  of the operators of the mobile elec- tronic communication services for  additional radio-frequency resour- ces, the majority of the EU countri-  es have performed the allocation of  the radio-frequencies from 800 MHz  frequency band. Also, the question  of freeing up the 694-790MHz (700  MHz) frequency band, with the aim  of its faster appraisal for the mobi- le communication networks, repre- sents the ongoing issue in whole  Europe. Several EU countries have  already carried out the allocation of  the radio-frequencies from 700 MHz  frequency band to the operators of  the mobile communication networks.  national   context  As reported by the 2011. national  census, Montenegro has 620.029 in- habitants and 192.242 households.  According to the characteristics of  the population, Montenegro is by  large a rural country, with the ave- rage population density of 44.9 peo- ple per km2. The territory is divided  into 23 municipalities with 1256  settlements, 40 of which are urban.  The majority of the population is  concentrated in urban areas, where  64% of the population lives.  The main characteristics of the cur- rent level of development of broad- band network are as follows:  •  The late start of the deve- lopment of the broadband  access market (ADSL: 2005,  KDS: 2007, WiMAX: 2008,  FTTx: 2011, satellite acces:  2012),    19 •  The lower penetration of the   broadband Internet access  subscriptions compared to  the EU average,  •  ADSL technology has the lar- gest share in broadband sub- scription – 63%, but in the  past five years its share is in  downfall,  •  Higher number of installed  and active FTTH/B connecti- ons, with their current share  in the number of active con- nections amounting to 9,3%,  •  A larger share of broadband  connections via KDS, which  currently equals 21,2%,  •  The share of the rest of the  technologies is 6,5%,  •  Broadband infrastructure  competition exists only in ur- ban areas,  •  Good coverage of the popu- lation with 3G mobile net- works signal and growth of  the LTE coverage.  The main features of the current sta- te of development of the broadband  infrastructure through the NGA te- chnologies are the following:  •  Significant investment in  FTTH network in some parts  of the urban areas;  •  Until recently, the investment  in advanced KDS infrastruc-  ture (HFC, DOCSIS 3.0) has  been mainly focused on some  parts of the largest urban are- as. However, in recent period  it spread to suburban areas;  •  The lack of recognition of the  importance of fast develo- pment of fixed NGA networks  and broadband mobile net- works by certain local gover- nments, required for adequa- te planning and issuing of  necessary permits for their  construction.  •  Fixed electronic communica- tion network infrastructure  Operators have developed their  own transport networks, used with  the aim of connecting different ele- ments within their networks. The  transport section of the operators’  network (the backbone) is based on  SDH, DWDM and MPLS technologi- es and transport systems, which are  realized through fiber optic cables  and radio relay links as physical me- diums for signal transport. For the  realization of the transfer system,  mobile operators partly use the fi- ber optic cables leased from the in- frastructure operators.  The access section of the fixed net- work in Montenegro is still predomi- nantly based on telecommunication  cables with copper wires and coaxi- al cables. The largest operators have  implemented IMS (IP Multimedia     STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  Subsystem) platform and have ca- rried out the full migration of their  users to this platform.  Fixed connections based on tele- communication cables with copper  wires are available in all of the Mon- tenegrin municipalities, in all urban,  suburban and in some rural areas.  70% of households in Montenegro  have this kind of connection. 93.000  ADSL connections are active. 64.400  ADSL connections are used for Inter- net access.  Cable distribution system – the KDS,  through the implementation of DO- CSIS 3.O standard, along with the di- stribution of the AVM content, also  enables both the Internet access  services and telephony. In the past  period, the standard KDS with the  coaxial cables has been replaced  with HFC networks. The KDS con- nections are available in 13 munici- palities, in urban areas where 59%  of the population resides. 31.400  connections via KDS networks are  active. 19.800 connections via KDS  networks are in actual use for Inter- net access.  The development of access net- works based on fiber optic cables  (FTTH/B) has intensified in the  past years. Fiber optic connections  are available to the end-users in 10  municipalities, in urban areas whe- re 54% of the total Montenegrin po- pulation resides. 51.000 FTTH con-  nections have been installed, which  means that 26% of households in  Montenegro have the possibility for  access via FTTH connection. 13.700  FTTH connections are active. 10.600  FTTH connections are in actual use  for Internet access.  The total number of active fixed bro- adband connections, independent  of the type of the service provided,  is 147.800. The penetration of fixed  broadband connections compared  to the number of households is 77%.  102.400 broadband connections are  used for Internet access. The pene- tration of broadband Internet access  (ADSL, FTTH/B, KDS-HFC, WiMAX et  al) is 16.5% in relation to the popu- lation number, and 53.3% in relation  to the number of households. Along  with the increased number of users  of the fixed broadband Internet  access, there have also been changes  in the structure of the users, related  to the access technologies. The grea- test change happened with the share  of KDS, ADSL and FTTH connections.  In the past five years, the KDS share  grew from 4% to 19.3%, the ADSL  share fell from 78% to 62.9%, whi- le the FTTH share grew from 1% to  10.3%.   With the development of the fiber  optic networks, the preconditions  for the access with greater capaci- ties have been created. Therefore,  in the operators’ offer now we have  fiber optic connection packages with     21 the Internet access speed between  20 Mb/s and 100 Mb/s, but these  packages are still not being used to  the full extent. The analysis of the  fixed connection on the basis of the  Internet access speed points to the  following:  •  23,6% of the users use pac- kages  with Internet speed  less than 2Mb/s,    •  62,7% of the users use pac- kages with Internet spe- ed ≥2Mb/s, but less than  10Mb/s,    •  10,1% of the users use pac- kages with Internet spe- ed ≥10Mb/s, but less than  30Mb/s,     •  3,6 %  of the users use pac- kages with Internet speed  ≥30Mb/s.  Mobile electronic communication  network infrastructure  The mobile electronic communi- cation services in Montenegro are  provided by the three terrestrial  mobile communication networks.  All three networks are based on har- monized standards of the second  generation (GSM, including its up- grades GPRS and EDGE), the third  generation (UMTS, including HSDPA  and HSPA+) and the fourth generati- on (4G, i.e. LTE technologies – Long  Term Evolution).  The transport segment of the net- works is still largely based on the  microwave radio-relay links, and to a  lesser extent on the fiber optic trans- fer. All three mobile operators have  carried out the migration of transfer  networks towards IP transfer.  The radio access section GSM/ DCS1800 is realized within the 900  MHz and 1800 MHz frequency band,  while the access section of the UMTS  networks is realized within 900 MHz  and 2 GHz. The unconditional refar- ming of the spectrum led to the im- plementation of the UMTS techno- logy within the 900 MHz frequency  band and the LTE technology within  the 1800 MHz. The coverage of the  population with the GSM signal is  around 99%. The coverage of the  territory with the GSM signal invol- ves all the inhabited areas, the main  roads and the tourist centers, which  represents around 90% of the total  territory of Montenegro. All urban  areas, as well as the significant part  of the suburban and rural areas, are  covered with the UMTS network si- gnal. The UMTS signal, depending  on the operator, covers 90% - 97%  of the population. The LTE signal is  available in the urban areas, via two  operators’ networks. The level of the  coverage of the population with the  LTE network is from 45% to 65%,  depending on the operator.    STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  The number of the mobile service  users that have accessed the Internet  is 326.006, which means that the pe- netration of the broadband Internet  access via mobile network amounts  to 52.6% in Montenegro. The users  don’t consider the Internet access  via mobile network as a substitute  for the access via fixed network yet,  but this will change along with the  technological progress and the avai- lability of the LTE technology.  international internet link  Six operators have established a di- rect link with international provi- ders of the Internet access abroad.  The total capacity of the internatio- nal Internet link at the end of 2015.  was 41 Gb/s. Compared to the last  year, the total capacity of the inter- national Internet links have increa- sed by 43%.  Montenegro internet exchange   point (Mixp)  The Montenegro Internet Exchan- ge Point is established in 2015. It  is expected that the establishment  of MXIP would enhance the develo- pment of the Internet in Montene- gro, lower the prices of the Internet  access service, unburden the inter- national Internet links, improve the  quality of the Internet access service  and the communication safety.  transfer to the internet protocol  version 6 (ipv6)  The Internet protocol of the new ge- neration, known as IPv6, has been  developed in order to overcome the  lack of Internet addresses. The bene- fits of the new protocol, along with  the widening of the address space,  are:  improved efficiency, safety and  the possibility of the implementa- tion of modern IoT solutions. This  protocol is a prerequisite for the  development of future Internet ser- vices and a basis for inclusion in the  global electronic market.  Having in mind the increase in num- ber of the users of electronic com- munication services, and the fact  that the operators base the electro- nic communication services almost  exclusively on IP platforms, the next  logical step in the development of  electronic communication networks  and services is the implementation  of IPv6 protocol. This is precisely  why it is necessary to prepare a plan  of a migration on protocol IPv6, in  accordance with the standards, deci- sions and suggestions of the Europe- an and international authorities in  the field.  radio-frequency spectrum  Through the radio-frequency spec- trum use plan in Montenegro for the  implementation of the radio access  section of public mobile electronic     23 communication networks, a number  of radio frequency bands is alloca- ted, but the number of the reque- sts for additional radio-frequency  resources, coming from the opera- tors who provide mobile electronic  communication services, is constan- tly increasing. The necessary radio- frequency resources for the develo- pment of the wireless networks are  provided through valorization of the  free frequency bands, as well as the  release of additional frequency ban- ds.  After completion of the switchover  from analogue to digital terrestrial  broadcasting systems in Montenegro  (June 2015), the 800 MHz frequency  band became free for the implemen- tation of TRA-ECS system, as is the  case with the 2.6 GHz frequency band.  It is necessary to finish the allocation  of the 800 MHz frequency band as  soon as possible, with the increase  of the availability of the broadband  access as the overriding goal of the  allocation of this frequency band for  the purpose of the implementation of  the LTE mobile networks.  Currently, a number of radio- frequency bands is not appropriate- ly appraised, and they could be used  for further increase of the availabili- ty of the broadband access.  strategic deVelopMent tools  For the purposes of this Strategy,  the speed of data transfer which is   to be considered as the basic bro- adband access is defined depending  on the type of access network as fol- lows:  •  The fixed broadband Inter- net access includes access at  a minimum of 2 Mb/s for do- wnload  •  The mobile broadband  access includes access achi- eved at a minimum through  3G technology, or the UMTS.  •  The speed of data transfer  that will be considered fast  broadband is defined as the  broadband speed of 30 Mb/s  or more.  •  The speed of data transfer  that will be considered ultra- fast broadband access is defi- ned as the speed of 100 Mb/s  or more.  As one of the main prerequisites for  further development of Montenegro,  both social and economic, and its  transition towards digital society, it  is necessary to provide the availabi- lity of broadband, through several  steps:  •  basic broadband access ⇒  coverage: 100% population  by 2018,  •  fast broadband access (30  Mbit/s or more) ⇒ coverage:  100% population by 2020,    STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  •  Ultra-fast broadband access  (100 Mbit/s or more) ⇒ usa- ge: 50% households by 2020.   It is necessary to construct electro- nic communication networks that  will enable broadband access at high  speed. The transport section of the- se networks should be implemented  through fiber optic cables, to the  greatest extent possible. All the avai- lable technologies should be used  to ensure the broadband access,  bearing in mind that no technology  alone can provide the accessibility  of the broadband services for all the  citizens. In order to ensure the bro- adband coverage at the reasonable  financial expenses, it is necessary to  implement the optimal combination  of the technologies for different geo- demographic conditions, and parti- cularly encourage the construction  of the NGA networks (FTTx, DOCSIC  3.x) and the development of the mo- bile networks of the fourth generati- on (LTE).  In order to make a significant step  forward regarding the availability  of the broadband Internet at high  speed, it is necessary to increase  the investment in the NGA networks  and expand the NGA networks to su- burban and some rural areas. In this  context, the development of NGA  cable networks based on FTTx and  DOCSIS 3.x is of particular signifi- cance. Also, by implementing new  methods/technologies targeted at   the increase in access speed, due to  its wide presence in the access infra- structure, copper wires may remain  an important medium for the delive- ry od the broadband services for a  long time.  It is necessary to create the con- ditions for the unhampered con- struction of the modern electronic  communication networks, by way  of enhancing investition, adequate  planning, simplifying administrative  procedures for issuing of the neces- sary permits and consents for the  construction of electronic communi- cation networks. It is also important  to secure necessary radio-frequency  resources for the development of  the electronic communication ne- tworks. Also, it is important to cre- ate the conditions for the expenses  reduction for the construction of the  NGA networks, by way of ensuring  the common use of the existing elec- tronic communication infrastructu- re, the availability of the electronic  communication infrastructure in- formation (the registry of the lines,  the base of the electronic communi- cation infrastructure, the mapping  of the broadband availability and  the broadband speed) and the pu- blic construction works (the single  information point on public works),  the coordination of the operations  and the construction of the facilities  for the fast and ultra-fast Internet  access.    25 The principle of the technological  neutrality and the creation of possi- bilities to implement all the available  technologies of the Next-generation  access networks (NGA), as well as  the emerging NGA technologies, is a  path that should be followed, whilst  using the benefits of both fixed and  mobile electronic communication  networks.  The construction of the NGA net- works, due to the geo-demographic  characterics of Montenegro, deman- ds significant investition. This is  why the construction of the NGA ne- tworks outside of the city centers is  not feasible for the operators at the  common market conditions. The- refore, the construction of the NGA  networks in the suburban and par- ticularly in the rural areas requires  special incentive.  However, despite the encourage- ment of the investment and the in- centives in this direction, the fixed  cable networks connection will ne- ver be implemented in certain rural  and distant areas. With this in mind,  the further development of the ra- dio-communication infrastructure  is extremely important. The deve- lopment of the wireless access net- works (either fixed or mobile) based  on the modern, spectrum-efficient  technologies, can enable the bro- adband access relatively fast and  with significantly less investment,  compared to the construction of the   cable/ fiber optics infrastructure.  This is particularly important for the  rural and sparsely populated areas,  with the traditionally low level of the  development of the cable/fiber op- tics infrastructure. Further on, it is  necessary to incite the development  of the mobile networks of the fourth  generation (LTE).  To this end, it is necessary to exa- mine the possibilities of the use of  the radio-frequencies from 694-790  MHz, 1452-1492 MHz, 2300-2400  MHz, 3400-3600 MHz and 3600- 3800 MHz frequency bands for the  IMT systems. Also, taking into ac- count the decisions of the World  Radiocommunication Conference  (WRC-15) and the CEPT, as well as  the determination of Montenegro  regarding the harmonization of the  radio-frequency use with the Euro- pean Union countries, it is important  to release 700 MHz frequency band  freeing it up for the mobile network  needs, and take measures to allocate  it to the mobile electronic communi- cation services operators.  Also, it is necessary to take all acti- ons, revision of the regulations in- cluded, to facilitate the investment  in broadband. In this regard, it is  necessary: to take particular care  to make sure that the construction  works include all potential investors  in a systematic way; to clarify the is- sue regarding the right of passage; to  construct the maps of the available     STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  passive infrastructure suitable for  the cables installation and the up- grade of household installations.  In addition to providing the infra- structure and geographic availabi- lity of the broadband access, it is  necessary to ensure its economic  availability, by way of price regula- tion for the independent broadband  access and the broadband access in  the related offers, according to the  Law, as well as take measures to inc- rease the Internet use.   Specifically, in the case if the com- petition in this market proves to be  inefficient, the Agency for Electronic  Communications and Postal Servi- ces, after the implementation of the  legally defined procedures, may im- pose a regulatory measure of price  control on the operator with signi- ficant power in the relevant market.    27 strategic indicators  Indicator Current  state 2018 2020  The availability of the NGA broadband access  The percentage of the households in the area of the  availability of the NGA (³30 Mbit/s)  26,5% 60% 100%  The penetration of the broadband connections (house- holds)  The share of the households which use, at least, the  broadband access (³2 Mbit/s)  53,3% 80% 100%  The availability of the broadband connections at high  speed  The share of the broadband access connections via fixed  network at high speed (³30 Mbit/s) in a total number of  the fixed broadband connections  3,6% 30% 70%  The penetration of the ultra-fast broadband connec- tions (households)  The share of the households that use ultra-fast broad- band access (³ 100 Mbit/s)   0% 20% 50%    STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  CYBER   SECURITY 4    29 Nowadays, the Internet, supported  with the information and commu- nication technologies, represents  a vital national resource of a co- untry and has become one of the  main drivers of its socio-economic  development. The information and  communication infrastructure faci- litates daily operations, and citizens  are increasingly dependent on the  opportunities that it provides in  the scope of cyberspace. In such cir- cumstances, its proper protection  has become a challenge of national,  regional and international impor- tance.  The integration of the ICT in daily ac- tivities and operations has become  more intense. Accordingly, threats to  the information and communication  infrastructure, that can endanger its  availability, privacy and integrity,  can also affect the functioning of a  society as a whole.   As countries and organizations are  developing and implementing new  security mechanisms, a parallel  process is taking place - cybercri- minals find new techniques to over- come these mechanisms. In order  to find an adequate and timely re- sponse to modern threats to infor- mation security, it is necessary to  expand the focus, framework of ac- tion and the flexibility to cope with  often unexpected high-risk security  events.  This strategic program is therefore  aimed at identifying and setting the  key strategic development courses  to raise the overall level of informati- on security, especially at the national  level, without neglecting the need  for the regional and international  cooperation.  european   context  The European Union Cyber Security  Strategy and the European Agenda  on Security provide a general stra- tegic framework for the EU initiati- ves in the field of cyber security and  cybercrime. The EU Cyber Security  Strategy aims towards open, safe  and secure cyberspace.  In addition, trust and security in the  ICT are the key pillars of the Digital  Single Market Strategy. One of the 16  initiatives identified in the strategy  is a public-private partnership that  aims to strengthen the EU’s cyber  security industry and provide the  customers with innovative and safe  solutions.  The European Cyber Security Stra- tegy, which was adopted in 2013,  states that cyberspace must rema- in open and free and that the same  norms, principles and values that  the EU supports offline should be  applied online. The fundamental ri- ghts, democracy and law must be  protected in cyberspace. Therefore,  cyberspace must be protected from     STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  incident, malicious activities and  abuse.   To achieve this, the role of gover- nment should be of great importan- ce, as well as the role of private sec- tor which owns a large part of the  critical information infrastructure.   Therefore, the cooperation between  the public and private sectors is cru- cial.  The EU’s vision, outlined in the Cy- ber Security Strategy, is defined  through five strategic priorities:  • Raising cyber resistance;  •  Drastic reduction of cybercri- me;  •  Developing policy on cyber  defense and capacity in com- pliance with Common    Se- curity and Defence Policy -  CSPD;  •  Development of the industri- al and technological resour- ces for cyber security;  •  Establishment of a coherent  international policy of the  European Union cyberspace  and promotion of the funda- mental values of the EU.  In order to accomplish this, it is ne- cessary to have a) a completed legi- slation and specified criminal norms,  b) the established and functional  national teams for prevention and   response to cyber incidents with the  adequate technical, financial and hu- man resources, c) the qualified pri- vate sector to invest the necessary  financial resources, d) complemen- tarity of the EU and NATO standards  and procedures.  Considering the crossborder nature  of cyber attacks, the aspect of the in- ternational cooperation in the field  of cyber security is also emphasized.  The establishment of coordinated  mechanisms of prevention, detecti- on, mitigation and response, enables  the exchange of information and  mutual assistance between the nati- onal authorities.  In addition to the abovementioned  activities, the emphasis is also pla- ced on raising level of awareness  among the end-users and the whole  society, as well as the protection of  children on the Internet.  national   context  In the previous period, through the  legislation and policy documents,  Montenegro followed the main stan- dards, guidelines and recommen- dations of the EU and NATO in the  field of building cyber security and  adequate protection of the critical  infrastructure.  Montenegro’s strategic goal is to  build an integrated, functional and  efficient cyber space, in accordance     31 with the international standards and  principles. The strategic directions  in this area are outlined in the Cyber  Security Strategy 2013-2017.  In accordance with the task to facili- tate early detection of cyber threats  and incidents and adequately react  and respond to them, the Main of- fice for the computer and security  incidents protection on the Internet  (CIRT) is established as an organi- zational unit within the Ministry for  Information Society and Telecom- munications. CIRT is a central body  for coordination of prevention and  protection against the computer se- curity incidents on the Internet and  other information systems security  risks for Montenegro.  CIRT, in line with its responsibilities,  acts:  •  Preventive - providing useful  information and advice on  Internet safety.  •  Reactive – analyzing and per- forming detailed investigati- ons in the case of Internet in- cidents at the national level.  In accordance with the recommen- dations of the EU, national CIRT has  the function of the national contact  address in the field of cyber security,  and also acts as a coordinating body  at the national level.  In addition, Montenegrin national  CIRT conducts activities aimed at  establishing and enhancing partner- ships both at the national and at the  international level, for the purpose  of better and more efficient fight aga- inst cybercrime and cyber threats.  The computer systems and users in  Montenegro are exposed to the most  of the cyber threats and attacks that  affect the rest of the world.  In 2015, there was an increase in  the number of applications to 132,  which was tripled compared to  2014. The attacks on the informa- tion infrastructure were registered,  as well as the attacks on the Internet  provider services, taking control of  several websites of the Montenegrin  institutions, as well as the banking  sector. Also, it was noted that the  attackers took control of the user  profiles of the Montenegrin citizens  on social networks and wrote ina- ppropriate content on behalf of tho- se users.  National CIRT currently employs 4  people. In accordance with the Cy- ber Security Strategy of Montenegro  2013-2017, 29 local CIRTs were for- med.   strategic deVelopMent tools  After its formation, the National Co- uncil on Cyber Security will have the  authority to discuss relevant issues  concerning cyber security. The coor- dination in this sense will contribute     STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  to the improvement of cyber secu- rity measures, through active coo- peration and proposing activities to  CIRT in the establishment of the sy- stem of protection of computer and  security incidents on the Internet, as  well as assisting in identifying the ti- mely response to possible threats to  the information infrastructure.  Due to the constant growth in the  number of services that the state  authorities and the private sector  provide over the Internet, both to  the citizens and legal entities, it is  necessary to define the critical in- formation infrastructure in Monte- negro and develop the protection  procedures. The critical information  infrastructure (CII) is the kind of the  infrastructure that its compromising  would, among other things, result in  the loss of life, tremendous financi- al damage (expressed as a certain  percentage of GDP), or have a very  negative effect on the environment.  In many developed countries, regu- latory role in protecting the critical  information infrastructure, because  of its exceptional importance, is per- formed by a separate organization  as its only function. In Montenegro,  the national CIRT is determined to  perform this function, and in order  to perform it effectively CIRT will  need to have adequate human reso- urces at its disposal.  The authority of CIRT, as the su- preme organization in the field of   cyber security at the national level,  as well as a range of services and  capabilities it should possess, in  accomplishing foreign policy goals  of Montenegro - membership in the  EU and NATO, will continually inc- rease. Among other things, it will  include the protection and determi- nation of the critical infrastructure,  as well as other activities related  to it, operations on 24/7 basis, ac- tivities for reducing the number of  incidents, the training of civil ser- vants and citizens. As recommen- ded by the international partners,  CIRT team must have a minimum of  20 officers.  It is necessary to strengthen the ca- pacities to modernize the Group for  High Technology Crime, consisting  of the representatives of the Mini- stry for Information Society and  Telecommunications, the Police Ad- ministration, the National Security  Agency. The improvement of the te- chnical and human capacities of the  Forensic Center is also a task for the  future period.  Given that a large part of the critical  information technology infrastruc- ture belongs to the private sector, it  is necessary to strengthen public- private partnerships in this field  especially in terms of defining the  procedure of information exchange.  Cooperation will be improved throu- gh the formation of local CIRTs with  the legal entities or individuals who     33 access or handle the data. These te- ams will deal with the protection  from the computer and security in- cidents on the Internet and other se- curity risks of these systems. These  teams will work with CIRT in the ap- plication of cyber security measures.  Currently, the cyber security pro- gram is studied through thirteen su- bjects at three universities in Monte- negro as part of bachelor, specialist  and master studies. In cooperation  with the Ministry of Education and  Universities in Montenegro, the im- portance of this topic should be hi- ghlighted and it should be studied  through more subjects in the field  of cyber security, for the purpose  of providing workforce with highly  specialized knowledge in this field.  This is also necessary due to the fact  that cyber security is increasingly  becoming a part of the general secu- rity of a country.  In order to ensure a safer Internet  environment for the Montenegrin  citizens, it is necessary to work on  education about the importance of  cyber security, with a focus on chil- dren protection on the Internet,  because of the fact that the statisti- cs show that over 95% of children  under the age of 15 use computers  and the Internet, and over 60% use  the Internet every day or almost  every day. Considering the fact that  one child out of five has a negative  experience when using the Internet,   and that currently about 12% of the  students from the sixth to the ninth  grade of the elementary schools are  educated on safe use of the Inter- net, we must work on increasing the  number of children educated about  the safe Internet use. Also, given the  fact that in the secondary schools  there is no subject that deals with  cyber security, it is necessary to  take measures to introduce at least  one subject that will encompass this  area.  In addition, it  is necessary to work  on improving the hotlines for re- porting illegal content, as well as to  work on establishing a Safe Internet  Center, in cooperation with CIRT  nad international networks INSAFE  and INHOPE. The abovementioned  includes the hotline for reporting il- legal Internet content, center for the  promotion activites and the Internet  safety awareness-raising center, as  well as support hotlines.  The aim of this project is the centra- lization of the activites in the field of  Internet safety, with particular focus  on children safety. In this sense, the  existing infrastructure functioning  within CIRT will be upgraded, thro- ugh the hotline for reporting the  illegal Internet content. The most  important segment of this project is  the establishment of the web portal  that will encompass all the functi- ons mentioned above. Long-term  plan is for the Safe Internet Center     STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  to bring together a significant num- ber of partners, particularly the  NGOs, which will further ensure its  sustainability.  Also, it is necessary to strengthen the  national capacities for an adequate  response to cyber threats and at- tacks by way of organizing  one-year  simulation of large-scale attacks.    35 strategic indicators  INDICATOR Current state 2018. 2020  Strengthening admini- strative capacities of CIRT 4 10 20  Local CIRTs in state bodi- es and local governments 29 45 60  Local CIRTs with legal en- tities 0 20 40  Educating children on  safe Internet use  12% of students  from the sixth to  the ninth grade  of the primary  school educated  25% of students  from the  sixth to  the ninth grade  of the primary  school educated  40% of students  from the sixth to  the ninth grade  of the primary  school educated    STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  HUMAN   CAPITAL 5    1   DESI-digital economy and society indeks is a composite index that represents the sum of the  relevant indicators of the digital progress in Europe, which evaluates the evolution of the EU  Member States in the field of the digital competitiveness  37 Information and communication  technologies are advancing at a tre- mendous speed and introducing te- chnological changes that create con- ditions for a future in which routine  work tasks will be done by machi- nes. Experts in the areas of human  capital and markets seriously count  on these predictions.  This fact implies a necessity for a va- riety of skills which will follow the  automation process in the future,  taking the place of those skills that  will become superfluous. Until now,  educational systems were quite slow  in responding to these changes. Sin- ce the changes are quite rapid, the  required skills also change rapidly.  According to the World Bank and  their development report for 2016,  this means that the workforce will  have to complement their skills  more and more often throughout  their career. This dynamic is already  present in many advanced and tran- sition countries, but it is also signi- ficant for the developing countries,  which must be prepared for new cir- cumstances.  european   context  According to the DESI1 indicator,  “Human capital” dimension includes  two sub-dimensions: the basic skills  and use, as well as the advanced  skills and development. The “basic  skills and use” dimension encom- passes indicators of the Internet use  by the individuals, as well as their di- gital skills. The “advanced skills and  development” dimension includes  indicators of the employment of the  ICT professionals and graduates in  science, technology and mathema- tics.  Concerning the Internet use, accor- ding to the European Commission,  75% of the EU population uses the  Internet at least once a week, while  the majority of the citizens (65%)  use the Internet on a daily basis. The  number of the Internet users is inc- reasing. The objectives of the Digital  Agenda on the Internet use are the- refore achieved ahead of the schedu- le, i.e. in 2015. If this trend continu- es, we can expect that by 2024. 90%  of the EU population will become  regular Internet users.  However, differences between the  European countries in this sense re- main significant - the highest rate of  the Internet use on a weekly basis is     STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  in Luxembourg, the Nordic countri- es, the Netherlands and the United  Kingdom, where this percentage is  around 90% and more. On the other  hand, the countries with the lowest  rate of the Internet use during the  week (Romania, Bulgaria) are facing  the fact that about half of their popu- lation does not use the Internet du- ring the week. The percentage of the  citizens who do not use the Internet  at the EU level is around 18%. The  greatest progress in reducing this  number was recorded in Estonia,  Bulgaria, Poland, Cyprus and Lithu- ania.  The greatest obstacles to the Inter- net access are the lack of need, the  insufficient level of the digital skills  and costs. In the recent years, a lack  of digital skills has been noted as a  factor that affects the Internet use to  a large extent. In 2014, 40% of the  EU population did not have a suffi- cient level of the digital skills, while  22% of the population did not have  the digital skills at all. The last figure  varies - from 5% in Luxembourg to  45% in Bulgaria and 46% and Ro- mania. In eight countries (Portugal,  Poland, Croatia, Cyprus, Italy, Spain,  Bulgaria, Romania) about 30% and  more of the population does not  have the digital skills at all. In Italy,  even 18 million people do not have  digital skills.  In 2014, 32% of the EU workforce  did not have a sufficient level of the   digital skills, while 13% did not have  the digital skills at all. While in some  countries, such as Poland, Italy,  Cyprus, the rates of the workforce  having digital skills are around 20%  and more, in Romania and Bulgaria  more than a third of the workforce  does not have the digital skills. If  this percentage is added to the per- cent of the workforce who has only a  low level of digital skills, we come to  an average of 32% of the workforce  that can be considered insufficiently  digitally literate, at the EU level. In  Bulgaria and Romania, this percen- tage is 61% and 77%, accounting for  the majority of the workforce.  As for the employment of the ICT  experts, this percentage is increased  by 4% over the last decade in the  EU. The largest increase occurred  in Germany, the United Kingdom,  France. However, it was significant  in smaller countries also.  Despite this, the EU is faced with  the problem of the growing deficit  of the ICT experts, which is projec- ted to be as high as 825,000 vacant  jobs by 2020. Currently the largest  gap between supply and demand of  the ICT experts in the labor market  was noted in Germany. However, it is  anticipated that this gap will be gro- wing in the United Kingdom and in  Italy, largely due to the inadequate  number of the ICT graduates.    39 national   context  According to the Monstat survey  from October 2015, the percenta- ge of the persons who have used a  computer in the last three months is  67.2%, while the percentage of tho- se who have never used a computer  is 26.1%. Regarding the Internet use,  68.1% of the people said they have  used the Internet in the last three  months, 79.9% of which used the In- ternet every day or almost every day,  and 17.1% used the Internet at least  once a week.  Among the citizens who have used  the Internet in this period, 90.6% of  persons aged 16-24 use the Inter- net every day or almost every day.  Among the reasons for not using the  Internet, most of the people inter- viewed said that they did not need  to use the Internet (45%), while for  the 27% the lack of the skills was the  reason for not using the Internet, for  the 24.7% it was the cost of the In- ternet and for the 27.3% the cost of  the equipment was the main reason.  Regarding the basic and advanced  digital skills, by the end of Mar- ch 2016 a total of 8,290 citizens of  Montenegro has begun certification  of their computer knowledge and  skills according to the ECDL stan- dard, while 7,721 citizens gained the  ECDL certificate. Through the pro- ject “Implementing ECDL standards   in the education system”, which was  completed in June 2014, the autho- rized ECDL test centers in the Exa- mination Center of Montenegro and  the Human Resources Administrati- on of Montenegro were established  to assume the role of centers for the  ECDL training and certification in  the educational system and in the  state administration of Montenegro.  According to the survey on the use  of ICT in enterprises conducted by  Monstat in 2015, 38.5% of the com- panies (out of a total number of com- panies that use computers in their  business) reported to employ ICT/ IT experts who have the ability to  develop, maintain and manage ICT  or IT systems and applications, whi- ch represents an increase by 0.8%  compared to 2014.   According to the objectives of the  Information Society Development  Strategy 2012-2016, the number of  the ICT graduates was to increase  to 25% of the total number of the  graduates by 2014, and to 30% by  2016. This task has not been accom- plished since during the 2011-2015  period there were 14,490 graduated  students at the Montenegrin uni- versities, 1,208 of which graduated  from the study programs related to  the ICT, which amounts to 8.3% on  average for this period.    STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  The abovementioned facts confirm  that, as is the case in the EU, a huge  deficit of the ICT skills, both the ba- sic and the advanced, is evident in  Montenegro. What is also emerging  as a conclusion is that the existing  education system and programs  (formal and informal) will not miti- gate this deficit in the coming years.  strategic deVelopMent tools  The technological revolution turned  the concept of non-formal education  and lifelong learning into an urgent  human need. The result of the dyna- mic development of the technology  is that the knowledge becomes ob- solete very fast. Moreover, as a result  of the rapid changes in the techno- logy, labor mobility and market de- mands of each individual’s career  will be transformed up to five times  during their lifetime. In this context,  we come to the conclusion that the  professional development is requi- red because of the retention of the  existing positions as well as due to  the increase in the competitive po- sition of the individuals in the labor  market. Thus, the traditional con- cept of a career is becoming history  in the digital age. According to a re- search, the competencies that a wor- ker acquires during the seven year  period of work get outdated and are  of no use in the business operati- ons anymore, so the worker has to  acquire completely new competen- cies after that time.  Starting with abovementioned cir- cumstances, one of the strategic tools  of the development must be encou- raging the greater use of the Internet  by all structures of society, as well as  the acquisition of digital competen- ces. The second main action must  be focused on creating a greater  number of the ICT experts. Also, the  efforts should be focused on elimi- nating the digital gap between gene- rations, while bearing in mind that a  significant percent of the workforce  in Montenegro use the modern tech- nology insufficiently. The emphasis  should be on encouraging women  towards the education and career  in the ICT, because women compri- se less than 30% of the workforce  in the ICT, and only 19% of them are  ICT managers, according to the Eu- ropean Commission surveys. When  it comes to local circumstances, the  finds from the MONSTAT survey on  the use of information-communica- tion technologies in Montenegro po- int to the fact that 30.7% of women  have never used the computer, whi- ch is one of the reasons to organize a  targeted campaign on raising aware- ness of women on the importance of  the digital competencies.   Strengthening human resources for  the development and application  of the ICT is a challenge for all se- gments of the society, particularly  for the educational system, which  must generate the knowledge and  the skills that can, as a direct invest-    41 ment into enhancing the country’s  competitiveness and higher econo- mic growth in the digital economy,  support the creation of digital Mon- tenegro.  Global IT labor market has shown  stability in the times of the crisis, as  evidenced by the fact that the ICT  personnel is in deficit, confirmed  by the fact that the ICT jobs are the  most wanted at the global level.  In order to monitor level of the di- gital literacy adequately, it is neces- sary to develop the indicators of the  digital literacy in the country, in line  with the EU standards.  1  http://work.chron.com/top-ten-professional-careers-13333.html, http://www.businessinsider. com/best-jobs-of-the-future-2014-1?op=1  strategic indicators   Indicator Current state      2018 2020 The percentage of the ICT ex- perts in relation to the total  number of employees in enter- prises  n/a 2 % 4 %  The percentage of the ICT grad- uates in a total number of the  graduates at all univeristies  8,3 % 9 % 10 %  The number of the ECDL certifi- cates issued 7.721 10.000 15.000    STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  DIGITAL BUSINESS  6    43 Internet and information and com- munication technologies incite the  inclusion of the companies in the  global economy through the expan- sion of trade , increased productivity  of capital, intensifying competition  in the market, which in turn boosts  innovation, making the ICT and bu- siness mutually inseparable in the  modern economy. Their intercon- nectedness bears immediate be- nefits for households too, not only  business and technology per se. On  the other hand, creation of new jobs,  better exploitation of human reso- urces, the production of consumer  surplus, represent immediate bene- fits provided to the citizens by the  digital economy itself.  The share of the ICT sector in GDP  is around 6% in the OECD countri- es, whereas in the developing world  this share is significantly lower. As  estimated by the World Bank, the  greatest contribution of the digital  technologies to the economic grow- th occurs in those cases when tradi- tional sectors of the economy exploit  ICT to modernize their activity.  european   context  Recent studies estimate that the di- gitalization of products and services  can bring more than 110 billion in  annual revenues to the European  economy over the next five years.  In April 2016, the European Com- mission launched the first initiative  of the Digital Single Market package  related to the industry. The aim of  this initiative is to prepare Europe  for the upcoming challenges of the  digital products and services. This  will require coordinated investment  from both the private and the public  sector.  In that sense, the following areas are  of particular importance:  •  “Startup Europe” aims to  strengthen the business en- vironment for web and ICT  entrepreneurs so their ideas  and businesses can develop  without restraints  •  The Future of the Internet - a  stronger, more connected In- ternet, which corresponds to  the needs of citizens both at  work and at home  •  Data – referring to the need  to exploit the benefits of the  access to the important data,  in order to create solutions  designed for the health care  system and the challenges in  the field of transport  •  Cloud computing - better  standards, more secure con- tracts and greater use of clo- ud in private and public sec- tor are the issues that need to  be worked on in the future    STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  •  Digitalization of the Europe- an industry in the direction  of maximizing the benefits  of digital technology in every  industrial sector in Europe  •  Regular meetings with web  entrepreneurs and expert  groups in order to discuss  new ways to promote a more  inclusive digital society.  Standardization represents a very  specific problem, and the European  Commission suggests particular set  of measures regarding this issue:  •  Five priority areas of focus:  5G, cloud computing, Inter- net of Things, data technolo- gies and cyber security.  •  Co-financing the tests and  experiments in order to acce- lerate the setting of the stan- dards, which further contri- butes to innovation and busi- ness growth.  national   context  Digitalization of the business and  the online business concept repre- sent enormous economic potential  for the development of small and  medium enterprises.   Research on the factors that crea- te obstacles to the introduction of  the ICT in Montenegro has not been  conducted so far, but judging by the  other available studies, the price   of introducing the ICT in business  appears to be important factor influ- encing this decision.  Despite the fact that products and  services from the ICT sector increa- sed its share in the GDP up to 16.5  % in many countries in recent years,  and more than a third of the econo- mic growth occurred due to the ac- tivities that were developed on the  basis of the ICT technologies, there  is no significant entrepreneurial nor  company activities that rely on onli- ne business in Montenegro.  According to the available data, the- re is a small number of companies  registered for conducting online  business in Montenegro. Collecting  data on companies engaged in the  information society services is com- plicated due to the fact that the in- formation society services and elec- tronic commerce are not specifically  classified in the process of business  registration.  As stated in the last Monstat (Sta- tistical Office of Montenegro) re- port, despite the significant growth  of 9.6% in 2014, we can say that a  small number of companies use on- line business concepts. There are  numerous reasons for such state of  affairs: many companies are inert in  this sense, and being satisfied with  the common channels of sale and  service delivery they do not want to  change the sales platform; the com-    45 panies are insensible to the new te- chnologies, and so on.  According to a survey conducted by  Monstat in 2015, the percentage of  the enterprises that have received  orders via Internet is 24.3%, whi- le the percentage of the companies  that have placed orders via Inter- net is 24.1%. When it comes to the  exchange of electronic information  in procurement management, 31.3%  of the companies regularly exchange  information in procurement mana- gement with their suppliers or cu- stomers.  Analysis of the products and servi- ces that the Montenegrin IT sector  offers at the market shows that the  majority of the companies base their  portfolio on hardware. The software  development and IT services are at  the second place. The fact that com- panies that mainly deal with hard- ware employ almost twice as many  people as those engaged in services  or software is particularly intere- sting.  According to the “IT Industry Ba- rometer” for Southeast Europe for  2016. (SEE ITIB 2016), total of 219  companies are active on Montene- grin market (although there is a  number of 560 companies officially  registered) and majority of them ba- ses their portfolio on hardware. The  software development and services  are at the second place. Software   products and hardware services are  at the third place, and this is a trend  in past three years.  Montenegrin IT sector is largely lo- cally owned (84%), while there is  14% of foreign companies and 2%  of the local representatives of the  foreign companies. About 70% of  domestic companies work with the  international companies at the lo- cal market, and only 22% are in the  export business.  According to the survey, in 2016, the  smallest percent of the companies is  involved in procuring the services  for the hardware products (38%),  while the largest percent of the com- panies deals with hardware produc- ts as such (72%). There is an evident  growth comparing to 2014. 88%  companies are not members of the  ICT associations, while 8% compani- es are members of the Montenegrin  IT cluster. 65.2% have cooperated  with the international clients, which  is 8.8% decline comparing to 2015.  Although import has grown for 8.1%  comparing to 2015, only 26.1% of  these companies export their ser- vices, which is the smallest percent  among the countries involved in the  survey. Besides, the survey has fo- und that the majority of the compa- nies in Montenegro are oriented to- wards the region, when it comes to  developing the export potential.    STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  Montenegrin companies recognize  the lack of support by the gover- nment institutions, lack of suitable  brending of the domestic IT indust- ry abroad, lack of information about  the foreign markets, lack of adequate  business contacts abroad, as well as  lack of training and consulting servi- ces, as the main export obstacles.  Montenegro has the lowest average  number of the employees in the ICT  companies, on a regional level – 46%  of the companies have up to 5 emplo- yees. Also, the survey found that the  ICT companies in all of the countries,  except for Montenegro, plan to raise  the number of the employees.  However, greater use of the ICT by  SMEs, which is at a relatively low le- vel at present, directly contributes to  the digital business in general.  Small number of innovative start- up and spin-off companies, which  intensive participation at the mar- ket should be provided through the  necessary administrative and mar- ket conditions, represents another  weak point regarding Montenegrin  IT market.  strategic deVelopMent tools  Although the number of the com- panies that use the Internet is con- tinuously growing, low percentage  of companies that trade or operate  online represents a limiting fac- tor in the development of not only   business itself but also the digital  economy of the country as a whole.  Delay in use of new business models  in the sector of small and medium- sized enterprises affects equally the  competitiveness of the Montene- grin economy and the growth of the  companies. In this context, strategic  development tools point to encoura- gement of transformation of the tra- ditional to digital business models  through e-commerce, e-banking, the  use of e-invoices and e-public procu- rement.  Towards building a digital economy,  it is necessary to raise awareness on  the importance of the ICT for busi- ness profitability through targeted  campaigns in cooperation with all  stakeholders. From the standpoint  of the digitalization of a business, it  is particularly important to create  conditions for electronic business  concept, which is why the focus sho- uld be on creating conditions for  the use of e-segments of business.  It is particularly important to crea- te a legislative framework for equal  treatment of e-invoices and paper  invoices, even more so because, in  comparison with the paper invoices,  e-invoice processing is easier, it is  faster in reaching the user and it is  easier to store.  Hierarchical organization of the  companies that prevailed in the  20th century is already past and it  cannot function in the framework of     47 the global, ever growing digital eco- nomy. Montenegrin companies must  base their business models on the  users’ excpectations, product im- provement, cooperation in innova- tion and organizational leadership,  which more and more involves data  experts in decision-making process  and organizational learning. These  are only some of the activites to- wards digitalization of the Monte- negrin economy, which needs to be  oriented towards maximizing the  benefits of the digital technologies.  Creating the conditions for the de- velopment and optimizing the use  of cloud computing, by businesses  and public sector equally, can also  contribute to the growth of the digi- tal economy. This constatation deri- ves from the statistic data available,  which confirm the multiple benefits  of cloud computing. In 2011, Micro- soft conducted a survey, which fo- und that transfer to cloud services  has made a contribution of 40%  rise in income for small and medi- um enterprises, comparing to those  that haven’t transferred to cloud. In  2012, the EU study found that, for  over 80% of the surveyed compani- es, transfer to cloud computing me- ans decrease in expenses up to 20%.  Also, the study found that producti- vity rises up to 40%.  Since changes in the education sy- stem can deliver results in approxi- mately 10 year time and not before,   the activities should be focused on  “import” of the ICT experts and wor- kforce. There are examples of some  developed countries which create  the conditions for young educated  people to recognize their chance of  success in working within an envi- ronment that has its own advanta- ges, and this is something we can  create in Montenegro. Production of  organic (green) software should be  in focus, because it requires a rela- tively small investment and produ- ces enormous economic growth and  thus has had its “explosion” in the  market. The creation of the necessa- ry environment includes: adopting  simple procedures to open ICT com- panies like these, with certain bene- fits and incentives in the domain of  tax legislation regarding these com- panies, the provision of sufficient  infrastructure resources (commu- nication and power) and provision  of premises with the necessary faci- lities. These measures are aimed at  the development of the ICT market  and encouragement of the economic  development of Montenegro in ge- neral.  Stimulating environment for the  start-up companies, along with en- hancing the development of elec- tronic public procurement, would  create a much favorable business  environment. The start-up compa- nies enhance innovation, as they  are the present and the future of the  digital economy. Their development     STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  has retroactive effect both on the  economy as a whole and on the la- bor market, particularly on youth  employment.     E-procurement, as well as compre- hensive e-infrastructure for G2B and  B2B services, in addition to simple  procedures, offers significant time  savings in public procurement pro- cedures, and, through the reduction  of discretionary rights, directly con- tributes to reducing corruption, whi- ch is why it is identified as one of the  strategic development tools.    49 strategic indicators   INdICATor Current state 2018 2020  The percentage of the companies that  use ERP systems for the internal commu- nication  43,8 % 51% 60 %  The percentage of the companies that  use RFID technologies n/a 3 % 6 %  The percentage of the companies that  use social networks in business 43,2 % 51% 60%  The percentage of the companies that  use e-invoices n/a 0,5% 1,5 %  The percentage of SMEs that sell prod- ucts or services online 24,1 % 30 % 40 %  The share of e-commerce in total com- merce (on the national level) n/a 0,5 % 1,5 %  The share of the ICT-a in GDP 4,2 % 5 %  6%    STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  E-EDUCATION  7    51 Modern labor markets are largely  fluid by nature, and require creativi- ty, teamwork, problem solving, criti- cal thinking, in an ever-changing en- vironment - these are the skills that  the traditional education systems do  not offer, and they are, on the other  hand, very difficult to measure.  As more and more aspects of the  modern economy become enormo- usly reliant on the Internet and te- chnology, the demand for advanced  ICT skills is also rising. Although,  compared to total numbers, propor- tionally small fraction of the labor  force of the future will be directly  involved in, for example, software  development or system design, it is  still important to introduce children  in classrooms with programming  and basic concepts of ICT, because it  can and should influence their futu- re career choice.  Nowadays, we can witness how di- gital technologies can help both te- achers and students – enabling tea- mwork in classrooms via Internet,  through applications that stimulate  creativity and problem solving, all  the way to the educational video  games. The development of skills  starts at the very birth and lasts  throughout the whole life, and the- refore technologies must find their  place in the system of education.  european   context  The Digital Agenda for Europe calls  for the introduction of e-education in  the national policies and programs,  in order to modernize education and  training, including the curriculum,  the evaluation of knowledge acqui- red, as well as the professional de- velopment of the teachers and edu- cators.  The European Commission estima- tes that e-education is not suffici- ently represented in education and  educational policies of the Member  States. Although education and lear- ning represent segments of the nati- onal policies that are the responsibi- lity of the Member States, the Euro- pean Union is authorized to support  the States in their efforts to moder- nize education and training systems,  particularly through the promotion  of exchange of good practice, as well  as through the support for research  and studies that deal with the effici- ent use of the ICT in teaching.   There are many benefits of e-educa- tion: acquiring new skills, adopting  new teaching methods, the individu- alization of learning and teaching ac- cording to the needs of the students  and teachers, the diversity and rich- ness of teaching and learning styles,  the innovative teaching practices  that encourage cooperation, effecti- ve training of the workforce, but also     STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  the lowering of the training price  and time saving .  The new risk of the digital age is in  focus - the emergence of the digital  divide between those students who  have access to the innovative educa- tion based on the use of the advan- ced technologies and those students  who are, in this sense, digitally mar- ginalized.  According to the European  Commission’s position in this mat- ter, open technologies, which pro- vide access to the education for  everyone, represent the solution to  the problem. Owing to the techno- logies, students can build-up their  knowledge out of the open and free  resources, create the educational  communities both within the school  and classrooms and outside of them,  learning becomes personalized ac- tivity, customized for the individual  student, teachers create a communi- ty where they can share experience  and teaching materials, access to a  wider range of the educational reso- urces is provided.  Problem of greater inclusion of the  ICT in education concerns mainly  the fact that the European Union,  due to the lack of the ICT professio- nals, can expect the number of up to  825.000 vacant jobs by 2020.  A total of 9 EU countries have inte- grated or will integrate the program-  ming at the elementary school level  in the curriculum.  At this level, pro- gramming is part of the curriculum  in Estonia, France, Spain, Slovakia,  United Kingdom, and will become  part of the curriculum in Belgium,  Finland, Poland and Portugal.  A total of 12 EU countries have alre- ady integrated or will integrate the  programming at the upper seconda- ry education level - Austria, Bulgaria,  Denmark, Estonia, France, Hungary,  Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia,  Spain and the United Kingdom.  national   context  All of the main units of the educati- onal institutions, up to the universi- ty level, have access to the Internet  connection (ADSL - 4Mbps or satel- lite internet - 8Mbps). The regional  units of the educational institutions  are not covered by the Internet con- nection. In all educational institu- tions up to the university level the  minimum amount of the computer  equipment is provided. The compu- ter - student proportion in primary  schools is 1:16, and 1:14 in the se- condary schools.  When it comes to the basic level of  the IT skills, a series of the trainin- gs for the teaching staff have been  conducted, in order to provide them  with the basic knowledge in this fi- eld. Through the project “ECDL for  digital Montenegro” around 20% of     53 the teachers and the administrative  staff in the educational institutions  have been trained. In addition, 150  teachers attended training on the  IT security (1.5 %). The level of the  development of the digital materials  for teaching and learning is insuffici- ent (didactic software, e-books, e-le- arning, etc.).   There is an evident deficiency of the  primary and secondary education,  which, either due to the late intro- duction of the information technolo- gy subjects, or the content of the su- bjects per se, pays little attention to  the importance of the digital compe- tences in the information society, de- spite the fact that 90% of job positi- ons require workforce with acquired  digital skills. This situation is further  complicated by the fact that the edu- cational system lacks educated staff  for teaching IT-related courses.  Number of the graduates in ICT-re- lated study programs is at the low  level.  strategic deVelopMent tools  Starting from the national context  and conditions in e-education, it is  necessary to work intensively on the  Internet signal coverage of the regi- onal units of the primary schools, as  well as to increase the Internet spe- ed in the main units of the educati- onal institutions which are covered  with the Internet. Providing educati- onal institutions with the computer   equipment must be a continuous  process in order to provide enough  equipment for the teaching perfor- mance and improve the computer- student proportion.   In addition to training teachers to  use the information technology at  a basic level, it is of particular im- portance to train them to apply the  ICT in the teaching process itself, so  the students can benefit more from  the Internet and the technologies as  such. Consequently, it is necessary to  further promote the web portal for  teachers. It is also necessary to pro- vide didactic software that will ena- ble better and more effective appli- cation of the ICT in the teaching pro- cess. However, the e-education pro- cess must take into account students  as well, so it is necessary to establish  a suitable portal for students, which  would accompany the curriculum,  enable some kind of knowledge eva- luation and offer extra curricular  activites aimed at general education  such as culture, sport, music, film  and such.  It is important to establish a system  of distance learning and upgrade  the curriculum with the aim of in- troducing larger number of the IT  subjects, due to the current state of  late introduction of the information  technology in the primary education  and substantial lack of a mid-level  education, which can, with a change  in the concept, create useful experts     STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  at the level of the technicians and  contribute to eliminating the bottle- neck between the education system  and the labor market needs.  It is  necessary to evaluate the distributi- on of the IT subjects in the primary  and secondary schools, as well as  the profile of the teaching staff that  conducts the IT courses, and, on the  basis of these results, to take the  appropriate measures to improve  the teaching process of the IT su- bjects and to improve the applicati- on of the optional IT subjects in the  educational institutions at all levels  of education.   This is all the more important bea- cuse the skills acquired by the young  are not necessarily helpful in maxi- mizing the benefits.    55 strategic indicators  INdICATor Current state 2018 2020  Student - computer proportion 1:16 (elementary schools) 1:14 (secondary schools) 1:12 1:10  Internet coverage in regional  school units 0% 50% 100%  Internet speed in main units 4 mbps fixed 8 mbps satellite  8 mbps  fixed  20 mbps  fixed  Percentage of teachers trained  (basic IT skills) 20% 25% 30%  Percentage of teachers trained in  IT security 1,50% 10% 20%  Percentage of use of teachers’  web portal 1% 10% 20%    STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  E-HEALTH  8    57 One of the basic tools which, toge- ther with organizational changes  and the development of new medical  skills, can significantly contribute to  the development and advancement  of the healthcare system, impro- ving the availability and quality of  the healthcare services, as well as  their higher efficiency and produc- tivity, is a set of systems and servi- ces which is known as e-health. E- health encompasses a broad scope  of application of information and  communication technologies in the  healthcare system and it is designed  for all the system participants: the  citizen (for receiving the right infor- mation in a customized form), the  patient (e-prescription, e-referral, e- identification), healthcare workers  (integrated approach to electronic  patient records concerning the time  and level of healthcare), and system  administrators at various levels  (providing organizational and ope- rational information), as well as the  healthcare system as a whole (the  exchange of the information among  the various entities of the healthcare  system).  european   context  Starting with the presupposition that  technology development for e-he- alth can enhance health care quality  and reduce health service expanses,  the European Commission has adop- ted a whole set of documents (action  plans, recommendations, directives)   for the purpose of furthering stan- dardization and interoperability as  well as certification of electronic he- alth records and equipment. Also, a  Directive aimed at establishing rules  for simplifying the approach to se- cure and quality crossborder healt- hcare in the EU and ensuring patient  mobility, as well as improving coo- peration in the field of health care  between the Member States, while  recognizing the responsibility of re- spective Member States for determi- ning health-related social insurance  eligibility.  Traditionally, the standard of invest- ment for the EU is that 2-4% of the  total health budged is allotted for di- gitalization of health care.  The chan- ges to health systems, the volume  of work and other factors affecting  their performance, make health care  information system and information  and communication technologies  application a priority for the deve- lopment of total health care systems  and strategic planning in health in  general.  national   context  The process of planned informati- zation of the health system began in  2000 with the development of infor- matic support to operational proces- ses of the Health Insurance Fund.  In  this phase, basic common resources  (technical-technological) which lay  the foundation for all further infor-    STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  matization of the health care system,  in accordance with the project of he- alth care system improvement and  all related reform processes.  The informatization of the different  levels of the health care system star- ted in 2004 with the informational  support of reforms of primary health  care, and continued  with the infor- mational support of secondary health  care, statistical reporting, production  and distribution control of drugs in  Montenegro. The informatization of  primary health care was focused on  supporting implementation of new  methods of financing the work in the  beginning, later moving on to support  of medical processes themselves.  The informational health care sy- stem was implemented in the follo- wing institutions:  •  at the primary level (all com- munity health centers, priva- te dental offices under con- tract with the Fund, Emer- gency Department),  •  at the secondary level (all  general hospitals), blood  transfusion medical services  (Blood Transfusion Institute  of Montenegro), health insu- rance services (Health Insu- rance Fund),  •  health-statistics reporting  system (public health) and  microbiological diagnostics  (Public Health Institute)  •  Pharmaceutics (ZU Pharma- cies of Montenegro “Monte- farm“), control of drug pro- duction and distribution in  Montenegro (Drug and Medi- cal Resources Agency).  All users of the health insurence sy- stem in Montenegro have an electro- nic health record (EZK) in the form  of a centralized electronic document  available to the health care employe- es, and the institutions connected to  the integral health care information  system (IZIS).  Each patient’s EZK  contains data structured according  to the specifications and contents of  the electronic record.  Records of around 80% of the health  care serices in the existing IZIS (not  including labs, radiology and similar  services) are kept by way of the ICT.  The Clinical Center of Montenegro  (KCCG), which keeps its own inter- nal records and procedures,  is not  connected to IZIS. Thereby, the ove- rall percentage of the records in IZIS  is reduced significantly.  Special attention is paid to the sy- stem security and data protection,  considering that medical and health  data require particular care in the  sense of general human rights, as  well as the international and natio- nal legal norms and ethical princi- ples of data protection and their use  within the health care system.    59 Institutional inter-connectedness  and linkage to the data center of the  Fund is realised as part of the pro- cedures of connecting state institu- tions to the network of state organs  and state administration bodies. The  type of links are dominantly MPLS  networks and VPN public network  communications. The speed and  range are not adapted to the advan- ced and demanding services. Such is  the case of radiological information  system which involves the transfer  of images of great resolution and ca- pacity.  On the health system level,  there is yet to be introduced a stan- dardized document management sy- stem.  strategic deVelopMent tools  Strategic planning of the develo- pment of the health care informati- on system and e-health services, asi- de from the direct national benefits,  enables better regional cooperation.  This can be seen in the efforts of the  EU countries to improve e-health to  the mutual benefit of the citizens  and the health care system.  Seen as a use of the Internet and  the related technologies in the he- alth care system, e-health improves  access, efficacy, efficiency, and quali- ty of medical and operational proces- ses. Its overall purpose is to enhance  the health care system as a whole.  The concept of e-health represents  the most complex application of the   information and communication  technologies in the social realm. It  ensures the availability of patient- related information via Internet and  related technologies, regardless of  where that information is needed, so  that particular segments of e-health,  such as the e-record, e-prescription,  e-referral, e-identification, diagno- stics information system, m-health,  and telemedicine can be realised  for the data significant for the direct  segment of healthcare rights, while  medical data of the patients are avai- lable within IZIS. The abovementio- ned is the focus of this chapter.   In this sense, a modern, up-to-date,  and integrated health care system,  supported by the ICT, is the cen- tral goal of e-health. Aside from the  functional support, the informati- on health system must support the  health care system reforms. Activi- ties should focus on digitalization  of operational processes, reducing  the costs, simplifying administrative  procedures and health care system  processes. The focus should be on  quality, secure, and fast information  exchange between all health care sy- stem users, with due respect to the  privacy rights of citizens and the  safety of the information regarding  their health.  The development and enhancement  of integral healthcare information     STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  system and e-health is one of the  priority strategic areas regarding  functioning and organization of he- alth care system at the national level  (Healthcare Master Development  Plan 2015-2020). Therefore, the  adoption of the Strategy of the deve- lopment of health care information  system and e-health, while adapting  to the EU standards, represents pre- requisite for achieving accessible,  quality and efficient healthcare and  better management of the whole  healthcare system. It is necessary  to connect functionally all the se- gments of the health care protection  into integral health care information  system.  Due to the terrain configuration and  barriers to health care in certain  parts of Montenegro, the tertiary le- vel doctors can deliver their services  via telemedicine, in radiology, cardi- ology, emergency medical help etc,  and this very interconnectedness  among doctors would be of great  importance for the Montenegrin po- pulation. Also, the tertiary level doc- tors can receive services from the  doctors from other clinics in Europe  and beyond, for certain methods of  the health care, via telemedicine.    61 strategic indicators  INdICATor Current state 2018 2020  The percentage of the registered electron- ic health care services 0% 30% 50%  Access to the data of the user of the com- pulsory health insurance by the electroni- cally identified users  0% 30% 50%  The registration and deregistration of the  user of the compulsory health insurance   (e-service)  0% 50% 70%  The percentage of e-referrals issued 0% 30% 60%  The percentage of e-prescriptions issued 0% 30% 60% The percentage of online appointments 0% 40% 70%    STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  9  E-INCLUSION    63 The aim of this chapter is focused  on inclusion of all social groups into  the process of increasing the level  of digital literacy, taking into acco- unt that the advanced digital society  requires equality and inclusion at all  levels.  According to the last OECD study, as  income inequality rises, the level of  economic growth falls. Therefore,  measures taken against all forms of  inequality contribute to the building  of a just society, but they also affect  the economy, making it more stable  and stronger. The most common  reasons for “digital exclusion” are  low income and insufficient level of  education of population, geographic  location, culture and various forms  of disability, as reported by the Eu- ropean Commission.  european   context  Improving the digital literacy, skills  and inclusion represents one of the  priority areas of the Digital Agenda  for Europe and a key initiative of the  Strategy Europe 2020, which is di- rected towards creating sustainable  European economy and technologi- es accessible to all.  As reported in 2010, 30% of Euro- peans have never used the Internet,  which explains why this issue beca- me one of the priority areas of acti- on. This situation came as a result of  general lack of skills and insufficient   level of awareness of the need for  the Internet use among population  aged 65 – 74. At the same time, for  the population with low income, the  unemployed or less educated, the  main obstacle to Internet access is  the price – for them, Internet is too  expensive.  The accessibility and usability re- present a problem for the Europe- ans with disability. Therefore, Digi- tal Agenda for Europe points to the  need to adjust the new electronic  content in such a way so it is accessi- ble to the persons with disability.  In addition to the legal obligations,  there are also strong economic argu- ments that affect the area of e-inclu- sion. Improving e-inclusion is feasi- ble, because it enables better access  to the services for marginalized so- cial groups, as well as meeting the  requirements of inclusive digital so- ciety. Improving access to services,  both private and public, opens new  market possibilities for a significant  part of the population, and can also  help the sector of public services to  play its part in a cost-effective way.  Meeting the EU directives and rec- commendations will help along the  way, in order to bring South-Eastern  European countries closer to the EU  Member States regarding this mat- ter.  Electronic content should be com- pletely accessible to the persons     STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  with disability. It is also of great si- gnificance to harmonize the public  web pages and the Internet services  with the international accessibility  standards. The agreements such as  Strategy of the Council of Europe  and UN convention on the rights of  persons with disabilities, in the field  of information accessibility, commu- nication and ICT technologies, pose  a demanding program of require- ments in the coming years.  national   context  In order to build an inclusive, digital  society in a proper way in Montene- gro, there is a need to provide equal  conditions for all citizens on the way  towards developed knowledge so- ciety and bridge the digital divide  completely. In this sense, particular  attention was paid to the universal  access to the Internet and techno- logies in the recent years, through  overcoming digital divide regarding  sex and differences among demo- graphical groups.  As reported by the Monstat, out of  68.1% of individuals aged 65-74,  who have used the Internet in Mon- tenegro, 65.9% use the Internet on  a daily basis. The survey found that  there are no Internet users of this  age who access Internet less than  once a week.  According to the MONSTAT report,  issued on October 30th 2015, the   computer presence in Montenegrin  households differs on regional level,  as well as depending on the settle- ment type (urban/rural).  The percent of the computer pre- sence in the northern region is the  smallest and amounts to 49.7%,  while this percent is the largest in  Podgorica, and amounts to 60.4%.  The computer presence is larger  in urban areas – 60.8% of the ho- useholds in urban settlements said  to have computer access, while  46.7% of the households in non- urban areas declared to posses a  computer.  Internet access in non-urban areas  is 52.7%, while this percent is larger  in urban areas – 75.3%.  Internet access in households also  differs on the basis of income. Out  of the households with the income  up to 300 EUR, 44.1% have the In- ternet access at home. Out of the ho- useholds with the income between  300 EUR and 600 EUR, 76% have  Internet access at home, while this  percent is significantly larger for the  households with the income over  600 EUR – 92.2%.  There are also differences on the ba- sis of the age and sex. According to  MONSTAT, the percent of the Inter- net usage is larger for men (80.7%),  while for the women this percent is  78.1% (the percents are measured     65 among the individuals that use the  Internet almost every day).  In order to overcome social and eco- nomic exclusion, the Ministry for In- formation Society and Telecommu- nications has realized a whole range  of projects which involved different  population categories. The program  of education and evaluation of di- gital skills according to the ECDL  standard included various social  groups, such as Roma population,  persons with disability, primary and  secondary school students, the reti- red. The computer equipment was  provided through donations to the  best students-users of social welfa- re who live in rural areas, as well as  associations which gather persons  with disability and other vulnerable  groups.   Ministry for Information Society and  Telecommunications in cooperation  with the Association of Youth with  Disabilities and the Association of  the Blind of Montenegro, created  the e-accessibility guidelines, which  outline the forms of e-accessibility  as well as the methods to eliminate  the obstacles in the process of the  web pages design. The guidelines  are made for everyone involved in  web pages creation, with the aim to  point to the importance of Internet  content accessibility for the persons  with disabilities.  strategic deVelopMent tools  The modern digital society must be  built upon the principles of equality,  inclusion, openness, equal opportu- nities. This means that every indi- vidual must be equal member and  user of the digital environment, but  at the same time the individual must  also take part of the responsibility  towards development of the society,  being one of the users of the benefits  the society provides. Therefore, it is  necessary to integrate all the activi- ties that reduce digital exclusion into  every social care program, as well as  employment programs, programs  of care for the elderly, persons with  disability programs, or any other  program that concerns vulnerable  groups.  Although enabling access to the in- formation and communication te- chnologies and services can provide  all citizens with equal opportuniti- es, this is not the only guarantee of  maximizing the benefits of technolo- gies that an individual or a society as  a whole can achieve. Therefore, it is  necessary to focus on raising general  awareness on possibilities that tech- nologies can open to each aspect of  everyday life. On the other hand, cre- ating electronic services that reco- gnize the contribution of these gro- ups to the society in general can help  to overcome the social and economic  exclusion of the vulnerable groups.    STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  Having in mind the abovementio- ned, strategic tools for inclusion of  the vulnerable and marginalized so- cial groups need to be taken indivi- dually. When it comes to the rights of  the persons with disabilities, there is  a growing focus on their integration  into information society. Therefore,  it is necessary to work on applicati- on and enhancement of the existing  regulation in this area, in order to  adhere to the e-inclusion standards,  primarily on the regulatory level. On  the other hand, public institutions’  web portals and e-services targeted  at this population must develop in  accordance with the technologies  and methods that ensure the appli- cation of WAI standards. The elderly  need particular support towards the  improvement of their quality of life,  through simplifying their access to  information and communication te- chnologies. The establishment of the  volunteer education network could  increase the number of the elderly  who are ready to enjoy the benefits  of the ICT technologies.  Various models of the Internet servi- ces should be used towards inclusi- on of the minority social groups and  promotion of their rights. Namely, it  is necessary to improve the quality  of Internet content targeted at these  groups. Taking into account the pro- blem of inclusion of the young peo- ple from the rural and poor areas, it  is important to use the potential of  the distance learning concept (the   development of e-learning platform)  for the purpose of enhancing possi- bilities of their education. The sur- veys show how the insufficient level  of the digital literacy of the female  population represents a barrier to  the e-inclusion of this segment of  the population. Therefore, it is ne- cessary to make additional efforts  towards the creation of educatio- nal workshops and campaigns for  women in rural areas, who use tech- nologies at a rather insufficient level.  The accessibility to public service  terminals (cash machines, tourism  information offices, payment machi- nes etc) is one of the prerequisites  for participation in society and indu- stry). The large number of technolo- gical solutions exists at the market  in order to simplify further the use  of the services for the customers.  When it comes to e-accessbility of  these terminals, together with the  physical accessibility, it is necessa- ry to provide the possibility of voice  output of the machines, as well as  tactile boards and buttons in Braille  letters, so the customers with hea- ring disabilities can also use them.  The growing phenomenon of the “di- gital exclusion” needs to be viewed  from both social and economic stan- dpoints in order to determine the ef- fects of the activities realized in the  field of e-inclusion, with the aim to  eliminate the “digital gap”, the one     67 based on urban-rural division, as  well as the one based on income and  various social and demographic fea- tures of the population.    strategic indicators   INdICATor Current state 2018 2020  The percentage of the persons with  disability who use the Internet at  least on a weekly basis out of the to- tal number of persons with disability  n/a 35 % 60 %  The number of accessible web sites  of the state institutions out of the  total number of the web sites of the  state institutions   n/a 30 % 50 %  The percentage of persons who have  never used the Internet 26,4 % 18 % 13 %    STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  E-GOVERNMENT  10    69 The modern environment and smart  devices, social networks, the signifi- cant increase in information availa- bility, new social and media culture  and customs, represent a basis for  the new business operations in the  digitalized public administration.  The public administration should  build operational models that will  remove the traditional and outdated  process barriers, as well as informa- tion systems and data redundance  and promote so called “lean” servi- ces, according to the principle of the  single contact point and single ser- vices point (e-services) of the public  administration.  The main goal of the e-government  is establishing simple electronic ser- vices, horizontally and vertically in- tegrated into national and local ad- ministration, and above all oriented  towards the users, available through  various channels 24/7, and customi- zed for users’ needs both regarding  quality and speed.  european   context  European directives and recommen- dations in this field are outlined in  the Digital Agenda for Europe 2020,  the Digital Single Market Strategy  and the EU eGovernment Action  Plan 2016-2020.  The Digital Agenda for Europe calls  for the maximum support to the  innovative, crossborder e-gover-  nment solutions, and it specifically  points to the necessity to ensure  the full interoperability of the e-go- vernment services, bridging legal,  organizational, technical and se- mantic barriers. Towards this goal,  it is important to pay care to the  European Interoperability Frame- work EIF 2.0, and its basic princi- ples: subsidiarity and proportiona- lity, user orientation, inclusion and  access, security and privacy, multi- lingualism, administrative simplifi- cation, transparency, data protecti- on, openness, possibility of re-use,  technological neutrality and adap- tability, efficiency and efficacy.  The European eGovernment Action  Plan 2016-2020 encompasses ne- eds, requirements and expectations  of all stakeholders, both the citizens  and business, as well as the public  administration.  The further development and wide- ning of the Interoperability Soluti- ons for European Public Administra- tions ISA, which particularly tackles  the interoperability, but also some  other e-government areas, such as  electronic identification (eID), re- presents one of the main activities  prescribed by this Action plan. In  that sense, project STORK (Secure  idenTity acrOss boRders linKed) is  particularly prominent. Its purpo- se is the creation of the interopera- ble-crossborder system at the EU  level, targeted at the verification of     STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  the electronic identity in such a way  that the national electronic identity  systems can be used in all Member  States. The development and imple- mentation of the large, multi-scale  projects like this one enables the  creation of the innovative crossbor- der solutions.  The Services Directive binds the  Member States to eastablish the  single contact point, through which  the states could provide crossbor- der service delivery. In addition to  the single contact point, the Member  States are directly bound to connect  to the EU information system IMI (In- ternal Market Information System)  which will enable business and citi- zens to communicate and exchange  the information with public admini- strations of other Member States. It  is the responsibility of the Member  States to ensure full implementation  of this system at the internal level in  each Member State.  The Digital Single Market Strategy  goal is to alleviate crossborder com- munication via Internet, enhance  electronic service delivery and elec- tronic commerce, regardless of the  location of business or citizen, with  the purpose to:  •  Alleviate access to online go- ods and services for the citi- zens and the business  •  Improve the conditions whi- ch boost the development of   the digital networks and ser- vices  •  Enhance the digital economy  growth.  national   context  In the recent period, the focus was  on establishment of a new method  of public administration operations  – electronic operations, that is its  direct application in projects that  improve the information exchange  in electronic form within state admi- nistration (G2G) as well as between  individuals or legal entities and sta- te administration (G2C and G2B). In  this context, the two basic factors  are recognized to develop and im- prove e-government: the technical- technological and the legal and orga- nizational factors or preconditions.  Through the implementation of two  important projects: the e-gover- nment portal (web-services of the  the state administration) and eDMS  (the electronic document manage- ment system within the state admi- nistration), technical-technological  preconditions for the establishment  of e-government were created.  Putting into power the Law on e-go- vernment (Official Gazette of Mon- tenegro, no 32/14) the formal le- gal conditions were created for the  transfer from traditional, paper-ba- sed documentation procedures to  electronic document procedures.     71 The e-government web portal, esta- blished in 2011, as a central online  point of access to the public admini- stration services at the national and  local level, enables administration  to modernize and broaden its servi- ces by way of implementation of the  electronic services. This is how the  availability of the services increases,  overcoming the barriers of working  hours or location. At the end of 2015,  129 services, within the authority of  27 institutions, were available at the  e-government portal. The basic divi- sion of all the e-services available at  the e-government portal is the follo- wing:  •  Informative e-services (le- vel 1 and 2) – the e-services  which provide only the infor- mation to the end-user or the  possibility to retrieve certain  forms and save them on their  computer;  •  Electronic e-services (level  3, 4 and 5) – the e-services  that enable the end-user to  start and complete the whole  service, from completing and  sending the electronic form  to receiving the information  or the document wanted.  At the end of 2015, at the e-gover- nment portal there were 35 infor- mative e-services and 94 electronic  e-services, divided according to the  users:  •  Individuals (citizens and en- trepreneurs) – 77 e-services  •  Legal entities (businesses  and other legal entities) – 44  e-services  •  Public administration – 12  e-services  One of the methods to measure the  level of the e-services use is also a  number of the registered or electro- nically identified users. For electro- nic services, there are various ways  (types) of the electronic identifica- tion, from the lowest level, where  no identification is required – so  called anonymous login, up to the  highest level of identification, whe- re the identification with the qua- lified digital certificate and digital  signature of e-form is required. The  number of the users registered in  2015. with e-mail account is 6505,  while the number of the registered  users witg the qualified digital cer- tificate (individuals and legal entiti- es) is 58.  strategic deVelopMent tools  The goal of the Strategy is to en- sure further development of e-go- vernment by way of increasing the  number of user-oriented and busi- ness-oriented e-services developed  on unique state information systems  and solutions, acknowledging the  fundamental principle “only once”  (the citizen submits particular data     STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  only once, and further on the data is  only transferred).  Starting with the main goal of the  public administration, that is its role  as public service for the citizens and  business, the strategic goals must  be focused on electronic public ser- vices, as well as requirements that  must be met by 2020, in relation to  the development of the modern, di- gital society which uses the potential  of all the information available to the  public sector at a maximum level.  The interoperability system in Mon- tenegro is still developing. It should  ensure the link between the infor- mation systems formerly developed  according to the system of “silos”  into a unique system which will en- sure overcoming the legal and orga- nizational as well as the technical-te- chnological barriers and differencies  on the state administration level and  enhance e-government. This system  also, as a central interoperability sy- stem, enables public administration  to exchange the information through  secure channels with high level of  protection and encryption which fol- low security conditions for system  connection, particularly system of  authorization with related safety  certificates.  The creation of public registry sho- uld be of particular importance –  Metaregistry, which functions as col- laborative tool for the development   of the system of connecting public  registries. Aside from all the existing  methods and options of connection  being inserted, Metaregistry needs  to ensure the coordination in chan- ges of the registry system and create  so called “referential integrity”. Stra- tegic development tools encompass  several components:  •  e-services – improve the exi- sting and develop new elec- tronic public services, inclu- ding crossborder electronic  services  •  interoperability – establish a  unique system for electronic  data exchange (interoperabi- lity) at the state level  •  eID – adapt the existing and  develop new eID systems and  mechanisms with the purpo- se of meeting the require- ments by the service provi- der  •  Open Data – enable availabi- lity of the public administra- tion data in open formats for  further use and processing  •  Digital Single Market (DSM)  – provide business and citi- zens with the opportunity to  realize their requests to the  public administration, via  Internet, in accordance with  “once and only” principle.    73 e-services  Improving the existing and creating  and developing new electronic pu- blic services as well as evaluation  and enhancement of their quality,  while at the same time taking into  account new possibilities that emer- ge in the context of the dynamic de- velopment of the digital technologi- es, and the availability of the digital  content, is crucial goal of this part of  the Strategy. Reaching this goal is ai- med at creation of the conditions for  citizens and legal entities, but also  the public administration, to access  the useful, available, secure, mana- geable (user-friendly) tools which  are adapted to various technologies.  E-services provide the citizens with  the possibility to use the public ad- ministration services regardless of  their location and technology they  use to access the Internet (hardwa- re, software) or electronic communi- cation channel chosen.  Particular attention needs to be paid  to the crossborder aspect of certain  electronic services. Namely, the EU  integration process takes place in  the digital world too, and therefore it  is necessary to create, both legal and  technological, the conditions for the  implementation of the crossborder  electronic services.  In the context of preparation for the  delivery of modern e-services that  will enable better quality of life and   put a friendly face on public admini- stration, it is necessary to perform  rationalization of the administrative  procedures and connect and optimi- ze processes in various administrati- ve institutions. This is possible only  through consistent implementation  and control of legal obligations re- garding single access to e-services  via e-government portal, along with  ensuring the quality of these servi- ces expected by the user.  The main concern is users’ satisfac- tion, taking into account availability  and high level of accessibility to the  different social groups. According to  the Law on e-government, all state  bodies are bound to prepare adequa- te applications for reception of all  kinds of forms that can be submitted  to that organ in an electronic format,  with the purpose of creating conditi- ons to file the citizens’ requests via  e-government portal. It is necessa- ry to implement as many e-services  from level 4 and level 5 as possible  and secure full implementation of  the Law on e-government in the pe- riod from 2016 to 2020.  interoperability  At the state level, the interoperabi- lity must be based on the following  presumptions: logical and purpose- ful circulation and use of the infor- mation, with the focus on processes  and services of the public admini- stration, open administration (tran-    STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  sparency, participation and coopera- tion), the technological neutrality.  Introduction of the unique interope- rability system at the national level  creates opportunities to transform  e-services of public administration  into fully interoperable ones, while  overcoming organizational, techni- cal and semantic barriers. Reaching  this goal will help avoid all the use- less technical conditions such as ap- plications that are operable only in  certain technical environment, with  special devices or on special digital  platforms. In this manner, joint use  of data will be alleviated, and the  interaction between state organs  will be simplified, at the same time  providing users with more options,  increasing efficacy, efficiency and  transparency of the public admini- stration.   The unique system for electronical  exchange of information at the sta- te level will ensure interoperability  between the existing and the new  information systems in public admi- nistration, at the same time elimina- ting duplication of their functions.  According to the Law on e-gover- nment, all state bodies and public  administration organs are bound to  exchange data via this information  system, and it that sense its imple- mentation is absolutely necessary.   e-identification  Electronic identification (eID) re- presents the foundation for the le- gal performance of e-services. eID  mechanisms exist on different le- vels, both internal and public. eID  technologies and authentification  services are of crucial importance  for transactions via Internet, both in  private and public sector. The most  common authentification method  today is password. For many appli- cations this may be enough, but the- re is a growing need for more secure  solutions and solutions secured by  the high level of authentification.  The need for different mechanisms  and eID solutions is particularly evi- dent in e-government services, de- pending on different requirements  and needs of the service provider.  Therefore, it is necessary to provi- de different solutions that satisfy  the basic standards and the develo- pment platforms based on interope- rability requirements. The improve- ment and adaptation of the existing  and the development of the new eID  systems and mechanisms represents  a necessity, particularly in terms of  meeting the requirements by the  service provider, i.e. type and level  of e-service.  Particular care should be paid to  the systems that operate on mobile  platform, smart phones and other  mobile, personalized devices. In this  context, electronic identification sy-    75 stem needs to be improved through  the use of the mobile technology.  open data  Open data promote multilateral co- operation, support and enhance the  development of the open, transpa- rent and responsible state admini- stration, binding the state instituti- ons to promote fight against corrup- tion and take active participation.  This concept also encourages citi- zens and civil sector to participate  actively in improving public services  that the state provides. The need for  the open data comes from its featu- res. The main features of the data  are: accessibility in machine-reada- ble format, access to data as a whole,  at a reasonable price which ranges  within litims of the reproduction  costs, the possibility to download  the data, the possibility to re-use the  data and redistribute it, the concept  of universal participation in its use  – anyone should be able to use and  distribute the data etc.  Open Data concept enables the pu- blic to access integral data without  obstacles and to use it in such a man- ner as it finds convenient, with the  obligation to cite the source. In this  manner, the data that is produced  once gains in value by the possibi- lity to be re-used or integrated with  other data, thus becoming useful  again, to the new user.  EU supports Open Data for the fol- lowing reasons, recognized also in  Montenegro for the purpose of im- proving the policy in this field:  •  Open Data has a significant  potential to be re-used in  new products and services;  •  Determinating/finding a so- lution for social challenges  – having access to as much  data as possible significan- tly influences the process of  finding new and innovative  solutions;  •  Reaching higher level of effi- ciency through data exchan- ge within public administra- tion and among its various  institutions;  •  Enabling citizens’ participati- on in civil and social life and  increasing administration  transparency.  •  For all the reasons mentio- ned above, the standards for  the Open Data will be defined  and the concept and its im- plementation will be promo- ted accordingly.  digital single Market  The Services Directive and the Di- gital Single Market Strategy aim to  enable business and citizens to rea- lize their requests to public admini- stration, through full implementati- on of the interoperability, via Inter-    STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  net, according to the “once and only“  principle, regardless of their locati- on within EU. Digital single market  is one of the the most promising  areas of development which opens  possibilities to boost economy by  means of e-commerce, by simpli- fying administrative procedures and  strengthenning e-government users.  Public services developed within the  digital single market are transferred  from fixed to mobile platforms and  they are increasingly present today,  allowing the access to information  and content at any time, any place  and any device.  This progress demands a regulatory  framework that is favorable for the  development of cloud computing,  connectability of mobile data regar- dless of state borders and simple  access to information and content,  followed with full protection of per- sonal data and total implementation  of cyber security tools.  The process of EU accession poses  demands such as the establishment  of single contact point, as well as  connecting to IMI – Internal Market  Information System, which will ena- ble crossborder service provision as  well as information exchange with  public administration in other sta- tes.    77 strategic indicators  INdICATor Current state 2018 2020  The number of e-services available at the  e-government portal, out of the 20 priority  services as listed and defined by the EU  6 15 20  The number of e-services at minimum of  level 5 15 30  The percentage of the citizens that have  used e-services in past 12 months n/a 20% 50%  The percentage of legal entities that have  used e-services n/a 15 30%  The number of the electronic certificates of  all types issued for the purpose of eID to ac- cess the e-government portal services  7,000 10,000 20.000    STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  RESEARCH,   INNOVATION AND   DEVELOPMENT 11    79 Smart growth, with research and  innovation at its core, in addition to  improving the quality of education,  demands strengthening of the rese- arch capacities, enhancement of in- novation and transfer of knowledge,  as well as the use of ICT at a maxi- mum level.  The development supported by in- novation is not the prerogative of  high-income countries anymore.  Montenegro has started with the im- plementation of whole range of re- forms with the purpose of creating a  favorable environment for research  and innovation. Increased regional  cooperation in the field of research,  increased possibilities for coopera- tion between research centers and  private sector, as well as continuous  work on legal framework, represent  only some of the strategic tools tar- geted at advancing the state of ICT  area of research and innovation.  european   context  European framework for research,  development and innovation is de- fined by the “Europe 2020”, strategy  that combines research, education,  financial support and intellectual  property as the basic components  of the EU development plan. The  key initiative of this Strategy is the  “Innovation Union”, targeted at en- hancement of the general conditions  and financial support for research  and innovation, in order to enable   transformation of the innovative  ideas into products and services,  which will create economic growth  and new jobs.   The “Innovation Union” is imple- mented through various structures  and programs, and Montenegro is  an active participant in majority of  them. The European Research Area  – ERA, represents a unique coopera- tion framework in the field of rese- arch, development and innovation in  Europe.   “Horizon 2020” is the most signifi- cant EU program for research and  innovation, with 78 billion euro fun- ds at its disposal. These funds are  available for the period between  2014. and 2020. The ICT is one of the  priority areas financed through this  program. The most significant ICT  infrastructure project within H2020  program is a pan-European acade- mic and research network (GEANT),  with a whole decade of experience  in providing European academic and  research institutions (and not only  European) with the necessary infra- structure services that enable rese- arch, development and cooperation  at all levels of science and research.  national   context  The scientific and research activity  in Montenegro is realized in a total  of 58 licensed scientific and resear- ch institutions in 2016. (universities,     STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  institutes, faculties and companies).  Research and development activiti- es in Montenegro are performed by  a total of 1.395 researchers. Within  the total number of licensed institu- tions, 8 of them (13.8%) deal with  the ICT as the core activity.  National science and research system  is implemented dominantly through  the scientific projects. During the re- search cycle 2012-2016, 104 projec- ts were financed with 5 million euro  within the priority areas of science,  and 17 of them (14.8%) were related  to the ICT scientific field.  The  “Higher Education and Research  for Innovation and Competitiveness”  (HERIC) project finances 8 major re- search grants, with 2.54 million euro  in the period 2015-2017, which con- tributes to improving the quality  of of science and research system.  Three projects among them (37.5%)  are from the ICT scientific field.  Draft Strategy for Innovation (2016- 2020), prepared by the Ministry of  Science, defines the following the- matic priorities in the field of innova- tion for the period to 2020: Energy;  Agriculture and Food; Sustainable  Development and Tourism; Informa- tion and Communication Technolo- gies; Medicine and Health; New Ma- terials, Products and Services.  The first Center of Excellence in Bi- oinformatics “BIO-ICT” is establis-  hed at the University of Montenegro  - Faculty of Electrical Engineering in  Podgorica, which is funded with 3.4  million euro for the period of 3 years.  The Center is financed by the project  HERIC. The Center of Excellence is  made of a consortium of 8 partners,  and the research is conducted  in 6  laboratories (2 of them are the new  ones). 82 researchers work at the  Center, and they come from different  fields of science. 15 of them are yo- ung researchers - doctoral students  and 5 of them are postdoctoral fel- lows. The Center of Excellence re- presents the interdisciplinary rese- arch center in the following resear- ch areas: ICT, agriculture and food,  medicine and health and sustainable  development and tourism. The main  research objective of the Center is  to increase the application and use  of the modern ICT technologies in  the areas of sustainable agricultu- re, crop monitoring, water/sea and  forests ecosystems, development of  techniques to control and reduce air  pollution, analysis and standardiza- tion of food products, quality control  of land and improvement of public  health system.  Montenegro will soon put into ope- ration the object is intended for  science and innovation activity,  “Technopolis” in Nikšić, which will  contribute to: connecting science  and business sector; improving the  competitiveness of small and me- dium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and     81 promotion of entrepreneurship;  support for new companies. All the  abovementioned components en- hance technological development of  Montenegro.  Montenegrin Academic Network  (MREN) is part of the GEANT H2020  project and the pan-European rese- arch network. This is an infrastruc- ture prerequisite for the realization  of activities aimed at the inclusion  of the national scientific community  in international projects in the field.  28 (48.3%) of the licensed scientific  and research institutions are con- nected to MREN.  International scientific and techno- logical cooperation is realized thro- ugh Montenegrin participation in  multilateral programs and projects:  “Horizon 2020”; COST; EUREKA;  NATO SpS; IAEA; ICGEB; CERN and  IPA.  During the period between 2011  and 2016, bilateral scientific and  technological cooperation was rea- lized through 182 projects with 15  countries.  strategic deVelopMent tools  Regarding the European and natio- nal context and the fact that the ICT  is one of the strongest drivers of the  scientific research development in  this century, it is clear the ICT should  be one of the preferential strategic  directions of scientific research and   innovation activity in Montenegro by  2020. This can be done through the  support by a number of strategic di- rections and activities that will make  synergetic contribution to improving  the overall scientific research and in- novation activities, inclusion in the  European Research Area - ERA, as  well as the achievement of the ove- rall objectives of this Strategy.  The support for increasing the num- ber of research and innovation in- stitutions in the field of ICT will be  implemented through the provision  of infrastructural conditions in “Teh- nopolis” in Nikšić, the establishment  of the first Science and Technology  Park (NTP) in Podgorica, impulse  centers in Pljevlja and Bar, and other  programs and projects. This will  contribute to strengthening the link  between science, research, innovati- on and business. It will also enable  connecting scientific research insti- tutions and higher education insti- tutions with the existing compani- es, the foundation of new small and  medium enterprises, “start-up” and  “spin-off” innovative ICT subjects  and the creation of synergy in the sy- stem of science, research and inno- vation, in order to create new values  that will have a direct impact on eco- nomic growth and the achievement  of the projected goals.  There are ongoing preparations for  the establishment of another Center  of Excellence that will contribute to     STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  improving the quality of the resear- ch and innovation, by connecting se- veral scientific institutions and com- panies in Montenegro and abroad.  These institutions and companies  will be connected by the realization  of the interdisciplinary research in  priority areas of science, important  for Montenegro.  Financing and enhancement of the  national and international projec- ts that are related to the ICT, or the  projects supported by the ICT, is  one of the important tools that will  contribute to the necessary develo- pment of the scientific research and  innovation activity in this field. Also,  the fields of the science and the eco- nomy, in the form of the body organs  involved in the development of the  innovative activities in Montenegro,  are of particular importance for the  improvement of the use of funding  instruments for innovation and the  strengthening of innovation activiti- es by foreign programs and projects  as well as credit support.  The development of the Montene- grin Research and Education Net- work (MREN), enhancement and  support to the scientific and resear- ch institutions to connect to this ne- twork and use the available services,  is one of the tools that will contribu- te, above all, to the inclusion of the  national institutions in the Europe- an research area (ERA) in terms of  infrastructure. It will also enable lo- cal connection and, overall, give im- petus to the development of the ICT  in Montenegro. Connecting educati- onal institutions to the MREN would  contribute to the further increasing  of scientific, research and innovati- on base of the ICT.  Finally, this will  enable the synergy and contribution  in terms of the resources neecessary  for the achievement of the mission  of this Strategy.    83 strategic indicators    INdICATor Current state 2018 2020  The share of the ICT in the activities of the  research institutions and innovative organi- zations  13,8% 20% 30%  The share of the ICT in the national scientific  and innovative programs and projects 14,8 % 20% 30%  The share of the ICT in the international sci- entific and innovative programs and projects 20 % 25% 30%  The percentage of the scientific and re- search institutions connected to the MREN 48,3% 60% 80%    STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.  METHODOLOGY   OF THE STRATEGY   IMPLEMENTATION 12    85 The implementation of the Strategy  is a complex process, with its reali- zation further complicated by the  complexity of the reality itself and  the problems which couldn’t be ar- ticulated at the time the strategic  goals were outlined. In that sense,  clear methodological plan of the  Strategy implementation is the only  guarantee of the achievement of the  strategic goals.   In order to avoid the risks that fol- low the long term plans, which are  often also too abstract, and with  the purpose to define the necessary  tools for the realization of strategic  development plans in the best way  possible, yearly action plans for the  implementation of the Strategy for  Information Society Development  2020 are to be implemented. Activi- ties which are to be part of these ac- tion plans will be defined according  to the identified development goals,  with the aim of reaching the strate- gic indicators.   Also, bearing in mind that the indica- tors are targeted to 2018. and 2020,  there will be a two-year overview of  the efficacy of the indicators defined.   Efficient coordination, which falls  with the Ministry for Information  Society and Telecommunications,  according to its authority, is necessa- ry for the successful implementation  of the Strategy. The Agency for Ee- lectronic Communications and Po- stal Services, the Ministry of Educa- tion and the Ministry of Health, the  NGOs, civil sector, as well as other  governmental and local institutions  who will be recognized as the carri- ers of the particular activities iden- tified to reach strategy goals. In this  contect, coordination body will be  formed, comprised of the subjects  mentioned above, with the aim to  monitor the Strategy implementati- on through the yearly action plans.  Coordination body will define imple- mentation monitoring and evaluati- on mechanisms.    STRATEGY FOR THE INFORMATION SOCIETY DEVELOPMENT 2020.

The following bodies participated in the process: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, European Union and Cooperation; the Ministry of Justice; the Ministry of Defence; the Ministry of the Treasury; the Ministry of Home Affairs; the Ministry of Public Works; the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training; the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism; the Ministry of the Presidency, Parliamentary Relations and Equality; the Ministry of Territorial Policy and Public Function; the Ministry of the Economy and Business; the Ministry of Health, Consumption and Social Well-being; the Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities; the National Intelligence Centre; the National Security Department and a Committee of Experts from professional associations, companies and the academia. THE PRESIDENT OF THE GOVERNMENT The fourth industrial revolution—the digital revolution—has, for years, coexisted with times of economic crises and social and political after-effects from which we are still recovering. Therefore, despite the undeniable opportunities and advances the digital world has to offer, many of our citizens are apprehensive and uncertain about all things related to the digital technological disruption. And it is here, in the fight to change that perception, that we in the public administrations must focus our priority efforts. What is at stake is society’s trust in democratic institutions and in our own capacity to face the future in the certainty that we are making progress. In the midst of an era of transformations and of uncertainties, we must offer a solid moral and material horizon, and to this end, it is increasingly essential to have cybersecurity that is equipped for the new times and the new threats. Cybersecurity that is capable of addressing the different challenges, and of doing so with public- private cooperation and with the support of a citizenry that is aware of the changing reality and committed to the solutions to these challenges. This National Cybersecurity Strategy, in line with the 2017 National Security Strategy, seeks to contribute to this. And it seeks to do so with a clear goal as its guide: ensuring that these times of changes are not a source of cultural discontent and of economic and labour regression, but, rather, an opportunity to increase Spain’s competitiveness and the well-being of Spaniards, as well as that of our European partners. This work has also taken into account our current geopolitical situation, which makes it more urgent and necessary to build and strengthen the European Union’s strategic autonomy. In all of this, Spain has a lot to say and to contribute. After all, ours is one of the most interconnected countries in the world. It only takes a glance at the daily news to realize how common and how dangerous the cyber threats we are facing really are. From fake news on social networks, to cyber espionage or the funding of terrorism— the digital realm is increasingly influencing and shaping reality. Moreover, other new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, big and smart data, and blockchain are already part of the daily activity of citizens, companies and public administrations. These new technologies have paved the way for ground-breaking instruments to obtain information, generate knowledge, and share data. This influence will grow even further with the current implementation of what is known as 5G for the new connectivity of the internet of things. Being more interconnected and more dependent on said infrastructures will allow us to advance in many important fields, from achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, to combating the effects of climate change. THE PRESIDENT OF THE GOVERNMENT But it also makes us more vulnerable to hostile actions against—and coming from—said new infrastructures. Threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, and cyberspace is a weakly regulated area with no clear borders or jurisdictional demarcations, where the traceability of criminal actions, and the identification of state or non-state perpetrators, is difficult. The challenge is enormous and multidisciplinary. Our professionals in the diverse areas involved in cybersecurity have well-deserved prestige and will be able to rise to the challenge. But cybersecurity requires commitment from us all. It is our responsibility, at the public administrations, to lead this commitment and to offer a framework of certainty to companies and citizens, who must also share this commitment. Once again, this is not only to avert the dangers and threats, but to make the most of the many opportunities to the benefit of all. Cybersecurity protects assets, but it also protects essential values for a free society such as ours. We are not going to relinquish these principles in this era of global transformation. The technical challenges involved in cybersecurity are varied and complex, but something else is at stake. Something that refers to moral and cultural values related to our way of seeing and understanding the world, to what best defines us. Our freedom, well-being and democracy ultimately depend upon our success in designing an effective Cybersecurity Strategy. I am convinced that, with this document, we have taken a key step towards successfully addressing uncertain, but at the same time fascinating, years.

The document is divided into five chapters. The first, entitled “Cyberspace, beyond a common global space”, provides an overall understanding of the cybersecurity field, progress made in it since approving the Strategy in 2013, reasons behind drawing up the 2019 National Cybersecurity Strategy, plus the main features of its development. Activities in cyberspace are fundamental for current society. Cyberspace technology and infrastructures are strategic elements, running across all fields of activity, making cyberspace vulnerability a major risk for our development as a nation. For this reason, cyberspace security is a priority goal on government agendas to guarantee National Security and a State competence to create a trust-based digital society. 10 National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Prime Minister’s Office Helping promote secure and reliable cyberspace, from a multidisciplinary focus, moving beyond purely technical aspects, is a task that should stem from knowing about and understanding any threats we might face, including new and emerging threats. The second chapter, entitled “Threats and challenges in cyberspace” determines the main threats to cyberspace stemming from its definition as a common global space, highly technified and widely connected, that amplifies the impact of any attack. It classifies these threats and challenges in two categories: on the one hand, threats to cyberspace assets; and on the other, threats that use cyberspace to carry out all types of malicious and illicit activities. The third chapter, entitled “Proposal, principles and goals for cybersecurity” applies the governing principles of the 2017 National Security Strategy (Action unit, Anticipation, Efficiency and Resilience) to five specific goals. Its development is mentioned in the fourth chapter, entitled “Lines of action and measures”, setting seven lines of action and identifying measures to develop each one. These lines of action aim to: strengthen skills to fight threats from cyberspace; guarantee strategic asset security and resilience for Spain; boost cybersecurity for citizens and companies; strengthen skills to investigate and prosecute cybercrimes, guarantee citizen security and protect rights and freedoms in cyberspace; boost cybersecurity for citizens and companies; bolster the Spanish cybersecurity industry and encourage and retain talent, strengthen digital autonomy; contribute to international cyberspace security, promoting open, plural, secure and reliable cyberspace supporting national interests and developing a cybersecurity culture to contribute to the Comprehensive National Security Culture Plan. The fifth chapter, entitled “Cybersecurity in the National Security System” defines cybersecurity’s organic architecture. Led by Spain’s Prime Minister, the structure is divided into three authorities: the National Security Council, as the Government’s Delegate Commission for National Security; the National Cybersecurity Council, that supports the National Security Council and helps the Prime Minister manage and coordinate National Security policy on cybersecurity, and promotes coordination, collaboration and cooperation among Public Administrations and between these and 11Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 the private sector, and the Specialised Situation Committee that, with support from the National Security Department, will support crisis situation management in any field that, because it crosses disciplines or due to its sheer size, might overwhelm the response capabilities of the usual mechanisms. This system is completed by the Standing Committee on Cybersecurity, that eases inter-ministerial coordination at an operational level in the field of cybersecurity, as the authority assisting the National Cybersecurity Council on aspects relating to technical and operational evaluation of risks and threats to cybersecurity; the competent public authorities and the national CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team) and it includes setting up a new public-private joint-project, the National Cybersecurity Forum. In addition, this last chapter makes some final conclusions and outlines mechanisms to update and assess the Strategy. 12 National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Prime Minister’s Office Introduction 13Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Introduction The 2019 National Cybersecurity Strategy establishes Spain’s position in the light of a new understanding of cybersecurity within the framework of the National Security Policy. Spain’s first National Cybersecurity Strategy was approved in 2013. The document set directives and general lines of action to tackle the challenge that cyberspace vulnerability represented for the country. Furthermore, the strategy designed the governance model for national cybersecurity. In the intervening period, Spain has also continued moving forward in a bid to contribute to secure, reliable cyberspace. One of its mainstays, dating back to 2014, is the National Cybersecurity Council, an authority supporting the National Security Council. Since its first meeting, the National Cybersecurity Council has assumed the task of coordinating nationally- competent organisations plus developing the National Cybersecurity Plan and its 14 National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Prime Minister’s Office offshoots. Consequently, Spain today can boast specialist cybersecurity organisations and an outstanding position not only in Europe but throughout the world. The legal framework has also been considerably adapted. To keep on top of its evolution and use experience accumulated over these last few years, the National Security Framework modification was published in 2015 to guarantee security for Public Sector systems. On the other hand, bringing into force the Royal Decree-law 12/2018 of 7 September, on information network and system security, that transposes Directive (EU) 2016/1148 (known as the NIS Directive) to Spanish legal order, represented an important milestone in our country’s cybersecurity improvements, extending the scope of this Directive in an attempt to improve cybersecurity among all strategic sectors. Law 36/2015, of 28 September, on National Security was extended to boost a project representing one of the government’s greatest responsibilities, National Security. The National Security Law considers cybersecurity as a special interest field. Without the shadow of a doubt, cybersecurity has modernised National Security, as this field has made the greatest progress to date. This dynamic should stay on the same track. The 2017 National Security Strategy was a turning point in national strategic thinking, giving cybersecurity its own differential space. One of the global trends identified in the Strategy, digitalisation, is shown to drive change with implications for security. The Strategy sets a new framework, with five general goals running across all fields. Crisis management, National Security Culture, global common spaces, technological development and international projection for Spain shape a strategic grid where cybersecurity is used to open up new paths leading to Spain’s present and future security model. 15Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 New cybersecurity spreads beyond the mere sphere of protecting technological patrimony and delves into political, economic and social fields. In addition to actions that affect digital systems, cyberspace should be considered as a strategic communication vector that can be used to influence public opinion and how people think by manipulating information, disinformation campaigns or hybrid actions. Its potential application in a very wide range of situations, including electoral processes, makes it extremely complex. This renewed outlook in a field that is understood to have spread functionally, and where public-private collaboration is key, calls for a new approach in the form of a new national cybersecurity strategy. Cyberspace: beyond a global common space Chapter 1 17Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Cyberspace: beyond a global common space This chapter presents the opportunities and challenges of cyberspace and digital infrastructure, outlines the inherently international aspect of its security approach and describes the broad strokes of Spain’s new understanding of cyberspace. Cyberspace: opportunities and challenges Cyberspace is a global common space characterised by its functionality and dynamism. Lack of sovereignty, its weak jurisdiction, ease of access and difficulty to attribute actions within it define a scenario with a wide range of future opportunities while also posing some serious 18 National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Prime Minister’s Office security challenges. On the one hand, cyberspace makes universal connectivity possible and eases free flow of information, services and ideas. It is thereby a field that stimulates entrepreneurship, strengthens socio-economic progress and creates new opportunities every day in all business sectors. The change caused by digital transformation of production processes is demonstrated globally at an unprecedented rate. Artificial intelligence, robotics, big data, blockchain and the Internet of Things are already with us, although the real transforming power is still to be unleashed. Its implications go beyond technology, extending to new social models and delving into personal relations and ethics. On the other hand, digitalisation transforms security and lays down some serious challenges. Cyberspace is structured as a battleground where information and data privacy are high-value assets in an environment with greater geopolitical competition, reorganisation of power and individual empowerment. Consequently, booming connectivity and greater dependence on networks and systems, not to mention digital components, objects and devices, create vulnerabilities and make it hard to protect information properly. 19Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Digital infrastructure Cyberspace is not only virtual, but also sustained by physical and logical elements. Devices, components and systems within information and communication networks and systems can be exposed to malfunctions that stop them working correctly and deliberate actions with malicious intentions that jeopardise correct operation of critical infrastructures and essential services that depend on the associated digital systems and networks. This risk is amplified by the importance of commercial criteria over security criteria in hardware and software product design, not to mention systems and services, which complicate certification processes and might compromise the supply chain. All these aspects, along with mounting interconnectivity between systems, can bring about cascade effects with unpredictable results. International plan: security in cyberspace Security in cyberspace has become a top priority on government agendas to guarantee national security and create a trust-based digital society. In this context, Spain defends it outlook and interests as a nation and works with the international community by backing open, plural and secure cyberspace. Spain maintains its active role in all institutions where cybersecurity takes centre-stage, particularly within the European Union, the Atlantic Alliance and the United Nations, thereby proving its commitment to partners and allies. Ties are also maintained with third-party States through bilateral cooperation mechanisms that ease understanding and mutual trust based on fluid relationships in the field of cybersecurity, in an attempt to build on our skills. 20 National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Prime Minister’s Office Aware of the importance of a multilateral approach, in addition to International Law and non-binding standards for responsible behaviour among States, we might highlight the role of the United Nations Charter as the reference principle for conflict prevention, cooperation and stability in cyberspace. Forging agreements and trust- building measures are the basis for its application and implementation, as well as International Treaties and Agreements that Spain has joined. A new conception of cyberspace A fundamental dimension of stability involves continued defence of constitutional and democratic values and principles plus citizens’ fundamental rights in cyberspace, particularly in terms of protecting their personal data, privacy, freedom of expression and access to truthful, good quality information. Good understanding of this approach requires a multidisciplinary focus, moving beyond purely technical aspects, using centralised management principles and coordinating its performance, assigning cybersecurity to National Security as a State competence. Firstly, the private sector plays a relevant role as administrator and owner of Spain’s digital assets, meaning that the country’s cybersecurity skills largely lie in its companies. This thereby means that cybersecurity needs support, promotion and investment to become more competitive and boost economic growth, whilst providing a secure and reliable digital environment. On the other hand, we should aspire to increasing technological autonomy by encouraging a national industrial base for cybersecurity, R+D+i and technological talent management. Human resources remain a critical factor. A gaping chasm has opened up between the number of highly specialised jobs in information technologies, 21Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 particularly cybersecurity, and availability of workers with the required level of knowledge or training. Secondly, transition from a preventive and defensive cybersecurity model to a more dissuasive framework falls into line with a global context demonstrating greater geopolitical competence. Use of cyberspace as a field of confrontation, independently or as part of a hybrid action, is widely recognised. Dissuasion in cybersecurity requires obtaining and strengthening cyberdefence skills, as a fundamental element of the State’s action. Thirdly, fast evolving cyberthreats require a more proactive approach from cyberintelligence. Its integration in the overall cybersecurity framework is key to provide knowledge of the situation and the necessary early warning that can anticipate actions from potential opponents through knowledge of their skills, techniques, tactics and intentions. In addition, it is necessary to encourage the use of mechanisms and means that allow appropriate investigation and prosecution of perpetrators to increase possibilities of attribution. All the above can be added to the need for greater implication from all society by encouraging a cybersecurity culture, to evolve from awareness of the commitment, in the understanding that citizens have joint-responsibility for national cybersecurity. Threats and challenges in cyberspace Chapter 2 23Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Threats and challenges in cyberspace This chapter examines the main threats and challenges that Spain faces in cyberspace. Promoting a secure, reliable environment is a task that should work from knowledge and understanding of the challenges and threats, including new and emerging aspects, that affect cyberspace. The 2017 National Security Strategy differentiates between cyberthreats and actions that use cyberspace as a medium for malicious or illicit activities. Cyberthreats Cyberthreats are malicious disruptions or manipulations that affect technological elements. They encompass a wide range of actions. Cyberthreats are characterised by their diversity in terms of both capacity and motivation. They affect practically all fields of National Security, such as National Defence, economic 24 National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Prime Minister’s Office security or protection of critical infrastructures, among others, and they do not respect borders. This transverse nature means that cybersecurity covers a comprehensive perspective that includes Public Administrations, the public and private sector and society as a whole, so there might be simultaneous implications on a wide range of aspects such as sovereignty, fundamental rights, defence, the economy and technological development. In this scenario, defences can evolve continually to adapt to a dominating threat that is multiplied by the pull effect caused by its high degree of impunity. At the same time, the defence ground is expanding and becoming more complicated every day. In this respect, providing security in information networks and systems requires improving prevention, detection and response measures, encouraging security through design and by default. It should be incorporated both into developing technological products and services and their updates or how they are used. Actions that use cyberspace for malicious purposes Digital technologies open up new activities and ways of doing business that have to be duly regulated as they might affect stability and our rights and freedoms, presenting substantial threats and challenges for National Security. In the same way, the same qualities that help cyberspace drive progress can be exploited for harmful purposes when combined with how exceptionally easy it is to remain anonymous, steal identities and amplify effects. Thanks to the Internet revolution, States, organised groups, collectives and even isolated individuals can attain a so-far unprecedented level of power and capability to influence. Digital connectivity means that 25Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 global social movements take on strategic importance that has been underestimated until now. The actions that cyberspace uses to carry out malicious or illicit activities include cyberespionage and cybercrime. Cyberespionage is a relatively cheap, fast method with fewer risks than traditional espionage, given the difficulty of attributing authorship. The greatest capabilities are mainly held by State players (intelligence or military organisations), that fundamentally operate via what are known as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). This type of threat means that the opponent has sophisticated knowledge levels plus resources and infrastructures so that, by deploying multiple types of attacks, they can interact on their targets over a long period of time, adapt to defence strategies, and maintain the interaction level to meet its end. In addition, a growing trend is now seen in what are known as hybrid threats, coordinated and synchronised actions aiming to deliberately attack systemic vulnerabilities in democratic states and institutions, through a wide range of media, such as traditional military actions, cyberattacks, information manipulation operations or elements of economic pressure. State and non- state players, either directly or through intermediaries, exploit the Internet’s propensity for disinformation and propaganda and a generalised interest in obtaining and developing military capabilities to operate in cyberspace, including offensive capacities in many cases. Cybercrime, in turn, is a top-level citizen security issue, representing one of the widest-spread and generalised threats, continuously arising and increasingly victimising thousands of institutions, companies and citizens. The term Cybercrime refers to illicit activities in cyberspace, targeting elements, computer systems or any other legal property, whenever its planning, development and performance is determined by use of technological tools; depending on the nature of the actual punishable act, authorship, 26 National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Prime Minister’s Office motivation, or damage inflicted, this might refer to cyberterrorism, cybercrimes or, when appropriate, hacktivism. Use of new financial and economic transaction methods, such as cryptocurrency, for illicit trafficking and trading of goods and providing services or extortion, fraud and forgery of non-monetary means of payment, poses a serious security challenge because they are both sophisticated and complex. They can be used for money laundering and tax evasion and they represent a source of income for organised crime; therefore, they facilitate other activities such as financing terrorism, making the most of how difficult it is to monitor these new techniques. Cybercriminals operate under organised-crime frameworks and incessantly explore techniques for building low-risk lucrative business models, sheltered by the fact their actions are difficult to trace. Terrorist groups attempt to make the most of cyberspace vulnerabilities to launch cyberattacks or activities to radicalise individuals and collectives, for financing, disseminating techniques and tools to commit a terrorist attack, and for recruitment, training or propaganda. Intimately linked to this, there is the threat against critical infrastructures, with the clear chance of using networks to bring about a collapse as essential services fall like dominoes. Hacktivist groups carry out cyberattacks for ideological reasons and sometimes, making the most of products, services and tools available in cyberspace, they seek to develop attacks with a major media or social impact. Nor can we ignore threats from the continuous surge of organisations contracting cybercriminal services to damage their competitors and their in-house technological and human resources that might be detrimental for the organisation, without forgetting all emerging threats and actions resulting from lack of cybersecurity culture. 27Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 On the other hand, digital information has become an asset with high added value. Analysis of personal data on the Net is used for a wide range of purposes from sociological studies to advertising campaigns. Malicious use of personal data and disinformation campaigns have high potential to destabilise society. Furthermore, exploiting personal data breaches represents infringement of this data’s security, affecting people’s privacy and their data’s integrity and confidentiality. As far as disinformation campaigns are concerned, they use elements such as fake news to influence public opinion. Internet and social media amplify the effect and scope of the information being sent out, with potential application against targets such as international organisations, States, political initiatives or public personalities or even democratic electoral processes. Proposal, principles and goals for cybersecurity Chapter 3 29Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Proposal, principles and goals for cybersecurity This chapter outlines the proposal and principles governing the Strategy, plus one general and five specific goals. Proposal As the 2017 National Security Strategy established, Spain must guarantee secure, responsible use of information and communications networks and systems by strengthening capabilities for prevention, detection and response to cyber- attacks, developing and adopting specific measures to promote secure and reliable cyberspace Therefore, the 2019 National Cybersecurity Strategy proposes to outline general directives for the cybersecurity field so as to meet 2017 National Security Strategy goals. To do this, Spain must continue strengthening skills to tackle cyberthreats and malicious use of cyberspace. Consequently, measures will be sought that help guarantee our nation’s 30 National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Prime Minister’s Office security, paying particular attention to the public sector and essential services, in a more coordinated framework featuring improved cooperation structures. On the other hand, promoting cybersecurity culture should be one of the central themes being developed to make society aware of these threats and challenges. The right to secure, reliable use of cyberspace and contributing to this situation are shared responsibilities. In addition, cybersecurity means progress, so singular support and encouragement are required for the Spanish cybersecurity industry, promoting an environment that nurtures research, development and innovation, plus participation from the academic world. On the other hand, our society prioritises attaining and maintaining knowledge, skills, experience and technological and professional capabilities because they are essential to tackle major cybersecurity challenges. Cyberspace’s transverse and global nature also demands cooperation and compliance from International Law, as well as utmost respect for the principles of the Constitution and the United Nations Charter; in coherence with the National Security Strategy and initiatives developed within European, regional and international frameworks, where national interests prevail at all times. Governing Principles The National Cybersecurity Strategy is upheld and inspired by the governing principles of National Security: action unit, anticipation, efficiency and resilience. 1. Action Unit: Any response to an incident in the cybersecurity field that might implicate different State agents will be strengthened if it is coherent, coordinated and resolved quickly and effectively. These qualities can be attained through careful preparation and appropriate organisation of the State’s action unit. 31Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Centralised management of cyberspace-related crises helps maintain full understanding of the threat situation and frees up available resources more quickly, efficiently, coherently and completely. 2. Anticipation: The specific nature of cyberspace and the players involved requires anticipation mechanisms in specialised organisations to guide State Action in crisis situations, where the private sector should also get involved. Anticipation prioritises preventive actions over reactions. Effective systems, with shared information as close as possible to real time, grant appropriate knowledge of the situation. This factor is essential to minimise response times which can be critical to reduce the effects of threats 3. Eficiency: Cybersecurity requires the use of high-value, multi-offer systems featuring a high level of technology, that are associated with very demanding needs and high costs derived from their development, purchase and operation, plus the need for advance planning and the high complexity of sustaining it. Furthermore, current and future scenarios are affected by economic austerity that, along with social responsibility to squeeze maximum performance from available resources, means that Spain should focus on optimisation and efficiency of resources devoted to cybersecurity, increasing the importance of the action unit, sharing information and integrating these resources for maximum efficiency. 4. Resilience: Resilience is a fundamental feature for systems and critical infrastructures. The State must ensure availability of elements considered to be essential for the nation, improving their protection against cyberthreats. A special mention should be given to the reinforcement required for information and communication networks against cyberthreat activities or illicit use of cyberspace. 32 National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Prime Minister’s Office 34 National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Prime Minister’s Office General Goal New cybersecurity challenges have meant adapting the general goal to become more integrating, inclusive and less technified. In line with the 2017 National Security Strategy and broadening the cybersecurity goal mentioned in it, Spain will guarantee secure, reliable use of cyberspace, protecting citizens’ rights and freedoms and promoting socio-economic progress. Based on this general goal, a series of specific goals are explained below to guide the State’s action in this field. Goal I Security and resilience of information and communication networks and systems for the public sector and essential services. A coherent, integrated national framework should be consolidated to help guarantee protection of information handled by the public sector and essential services, their systems and services, as well as the networks that support them. This framework will make it possible to develop and implant increasingly secure and efficient services. To do so, security measures should be implemented, focussing on improving capabilities for prevention, detection and response to incidents, developing new solutions, reinforcing coordination and adapting the legal system accordingly. Actions against cyberespionage particularly deserve a special mention as this ensures protection of Spain’s Technological Patrimony, understood as the material or immaterial 35Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 assets that uphold the current business sector’s intellectual and industrial property and condition future development. The public sector and essential service operators should get actively involved in a continuous improvement process to protect their Information and Communication Technology systems based on constantly monitoring their threat exposure. These agents should act as a model for cybersecurity management best practices. Applying the principle of shared responsibility, the public sector should work closely with companies that manage the relevant Information and Communication Technology Systems for national interests, exchanging knowledge that encourages appropriate coordination between the two and effective cooperation within the cybersecurity environment. Strengthening cybersecurity requires systematic knowledge of the impact of potential interruption or destruction of the networks and systems that provide essential services, as well as security level metrics for these systems that help make the right decisions according to exposure levels. 36 National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Prime Minister’s Office Goal II Secure and reliable use of cyberspace to ward off illicit or malicious use. Cyberspace plays an increasingly important role in committing illicit or malicious acts and investigating them to encourage citizen trust. It is necessary to guarantee suitable prosecution of criminal phenomena that are taking place in it. Fighting cybercrime can be divided into three fields: (i) cyberspace as the direct target of criminal acts, or the threat; (ii) cyberspace as the key medium for committing the crime; and (iii) cyberspace as the medium or direct investigation target for any type of illicit behaviour. Based on solid and effective regulation that reinforces and guarantees fighting cybercrime, it is necessary to strengthen legal and police cooperation, both nationally and internationally, and assign sufficient resources to competent bodies on this matter and skills training for professionals working in this area. In the same way, citizen collaboration and participation must be encouraged, facilitating procedures to access and transmit information that might be of legal or police interest and identifying aspects that require improving capabilities among police institutions and competent legal organisations 37Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Goal III Protecting the business and social ecosystem and citizens. All persons and organisations have the right to use cyberspace securely. It is therefore the State’s responsibility to promote and encourage measures to attain and maintain sufficient cybersecurity, particularly protecting the most vulnerable sectors of society and allowing proper socio-economic development for Spain. Cybersecurity is a responsibility shared with private players that can affect them by action or omission; cybersecurity is not possible without their participation. Therefore, measures to be promoted should encourage cooperation to ensure common security. Defending citizens, self-employed people and companies should reach beyond self-protection measures, so it is advisable to implement measures for their active cyberdefence. At the same time, all cyberspace users should demonstrate responsible use of the technology available to them. Society’s accelerated enthusiasm for emerging technologies makes risks evolve. Consequently, constant knowledge exchange with all players and monitoring mechanisms to protect the business and social ecosystem will be instruments to keep the Government informed and help it make the right decisions to update and adapt the actions taken as a result of this strategy. 38 National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Prime Minister’s Office Goal IV Culture and commitment to cybersecurity and strengthening human and technological skills. To tackle cybersecurity challenges, Spain should have technical and human resources to give it the necessary technological autonomy and appropriate skills training for secure use of cyberspace, making cybersecurity the key enabler for an entrepreneurial nation. To do this, it must improve collective cybersecurity, diffusing cybersecurity culture with the help of public and private organisations and the media, strengthening information mechanisms and help for citizens and promoting spaces for encounters between civil society, administrations and companies. It should also contribute to secure and responsible use of Information and Communication Technologies by promoting appropriate skills training on cybersecurity for professionals according to job market demands, stimulating professionals’ development with their own skills, boosting specialised training and qualification, plus skills to generate knowledge, develop R+D+i activities in cybersecurity and encourage use of certified products and services. In addition, special attention should be paid to protecting technological patrimony and industrial and intellectual property. To promote technological sovereignty and make the most of digital transformation opportunities, the Spanish cybersecurity industry should be encouraged and boosted hand-in-hand with good practice on development and implementation of information and communication systems. 39Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Goal V International cyberspace security. Spain will promote open, plural, secure and trustworthy cyberspace both in its bilateral relations and in multilateral, regional and international organisations, and in forums and conferences, where cyberspace plays a leading role. It will advocate setting up an international framework for conflict prevention, cooperation and stability in cyberspace, applying principles from the whole United Nations Charter, International Law, Human Rights and Humanitarian Rights in War, as well as non-binding standards on responsible behaviour for States. Aware of the importance of multilateralism, the United Nations’ role is considered relevant to move forward building consensus that, along with adopting and setting in motion measures to promote trust, collaboration and participation from all players involved (States, private sector, civil society, users and academia), constitutes the groundwork to achieve security and stability in cyberspace and work towards regulation. In line with our European partners, this goal will strengthen trust in the internet, digital transformation and development of new technologies, helping to consolidate a secure European cybernetic ecosystem that boosts progress towards the single digital market. To do this, it will defend an interoperative, neutral, open and diverse internet, a reflection of international cultural and linguistic plurality, based on a system of democratic, representative and inclusive governance resulting from agreement and consensus. In addition, it will provide access to global and generalised internet, thereby helping meet Sustainable Development Goals. In this way, belonging to the European Union (EU) means that we have to strengthen security and European strategic autonomy by seeking synergy, technical, operative, strategic and political cooperation; to strengthen our resilience, our capacity to respond 40 National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Prime Minister’s Office to a crisis and the complementary nature of civil and military fields as EU partners and allies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). Based on the above, Spain will continue to take an active role in the EU and NATO; in the United Nations and in its offshoot forums such as the Internet Governance Forum (IGF); the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), development and implementation of Confidence-Building Measures; the Organisation of American States (OAS). As well as the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise (GFCE) and the Freedom Online Coalition FOC, without forgetting our presence in the European Centre of Excellence to counter-attack Hybrid Threats (Hybrid CoE) plus the NATO Cooperative Cyberdefence Centre of Excellence (CCD CoE). In addition, it will reinforce international bilateral cooperation on cybersecurity, promote fluid and trustworthy relations in this field, work jointly on building skills in third-party countries, paying particular attention to women and young people and promoting setting up information channels and experience exchange, boosting bilateral and multilateral agreements in this field. 41Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Lines of action and measures Chapter 4 43Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Lines of action and measures This chapter sets the lines of action to achieve the goals. 44 National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Prime Minister’s Office LINE OF ACTION 1 Strengthen capabilities to deal with threats from cyberspace.

The 2013 National Cybersecurity Strategy and subsequent approval of the National Security Law in 2015, created a specific organic structure for cybersecurity. This 2019 Strategy boosts initiatives that complement further progress in the national governance model with European policies Within the National Security System, the cybersecurity structure comprises the following components: 62 National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Prime Minister’s Office 1. The National Security Council. 2. A single Specialised Situation Committee for the whole National Security System in crisis situations. 3. The National Cybersecurity Council 4. The Cybersecurity Standing Committee. 5. The National Cybersecurity Forum. 6. Competent public authorities and the national CSIRT. The National Security Council The National Security Council, as the Government’s Delegate Commission for National Security, is the body which helps the Spanish Prime Minister to manage National Security Policy. The National Security Council acts through the National Security Department as a single point of contact, as a link, and guarantees cross-border cooperation with other countries in the European Union The Situation Committee There is just one Situation Committee for the whole National Security Council and, supported by the National Security Department, it acts according to political-strategic guidelines dictated by the National Security Council on crisis management. The National Cybersecurity Council The National Cybersecurity Council helps the National Security Council meet its functions, particularly helping the Spanish Prime Minister manage and coordinate National Security Policy in the field of cybersecurity. 63Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Its functions include reinforcing coordination, collaboration and cooperation between Public Administrations with competences in cybersecurity, and between public and private sectors, and easing decision-making for the actual Council by analysing, studying and suggesting initiatives and evaluating risks and threats, analysing possible crisis scenarios, studying how they might evolve, drafting and updating response plans and formulating directives for crisis management exercises in the field of cybersecurity and assessing their performance results, all in coordination with directly competent bodies and authorities. The Cybersecurity Standing Committee The Cybersecurity Standing Committee is set up to ease inter-ministerial coordination on an operational level in the field of cybersecurity. Presided over by the National Security Department, it comprises the bodies and organisations represented within the National Cybersecurity Council with operational responsibilities. This body helps the National Cybersecurity Council on aspects relating to technical and operative assessment of cybersecurity risks and threats. The Commission’s operation falls within the crisis management procedure in the field of cybersecurity. This procedure establishes its functions aimed at detecting and assessing risks and threats; eases the decision-making process and ensures an optimum, coordinated response from the State. Furthermore, it includes the National Security System’s different activation levels plus instructions to manage public communication. To provide a relevant response, in proportion to situations of special relevance in its functions, it will improve the definition of its skills and responsibilities. National Cybersecurity Forum It will act on strengthening and creating public-private synergies, particularly generating knowledge on opportunities, challenges and threats to security in cyberspace. Setting up the National Cybersecurity Forum, and harmonising its operation with existing bodies, will require approval of the necessary standard-based provisions, 64 National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Prime Minister’s Office so that these components might be coordinated and run efficiently in the National Security System. Competent public authorities and the national reference CSIRT Cybersecurity’s strategic, institutional framework is complemented by the competent public authorities on security in information networks and systems and the national CSIRTs that are compiled in the national legal framework. In addition, CSIRTs from the Autonomous Regions and Autonomous Cities, from Local Entities and their affiliated or dependent bodies, from private entities, the CSIRT. es network and other relevant cybersecurity services should be coordinated with the above, depending on each one’s competences. In the same way, working with regional and private CSIRTs, national CSIRTs will encourage initiatives that help meet national strategy goals 65Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 66 National Cybersecurity Strategy 2019 Prime Minister’s Office Final considerations and evaluation Thanks to experience from the 2013 National Cybersecurity Strategy, this document can express and update the ever-changing threats and challenges that we are facing. To adapt to this new, shifting scenario, Lines of Action are proposed plus more dynamic measures that, when necessary, allow the national cybersecurity ecosystem to adapt quickly, based on a considerably mature governance model, which should include active participation from the private sector and the rest of civil society. In this respect, the Strategy is conceived as a living document that has to be adapted to gradual changes in cybersecurity, so it should be continuously revised, along with specific, sector-based plans derived from it. An annual assessment report will be drafted on the Strategy that will show how much it has been followed and if its goals have been met. On the other hand, in the light of increasing cybersecurity threats and challenges as faced by countries around us, it is increasingly urgent to equip ourselves with economic, human and material resources to tackle them. One particularly relevant action here is to make sure that the Spanish Central Administration Cybersecurity Operations Centre is properly equipped.

THE PRESIDENT OF THE GOVERNMENT  The fourth industrial revolution—the digital revolution—has, for years, coexisted with  times of economic crises and social and political after-effects from which we are still  recovering. Therefore, despite the undeniable opportunities and advances the digital  world has to offer, many of our citizens are apprehensive and uncertain about all things  related to the digital technological disruption. And it is here, in the fight to change that  perception, that we in the public administrations must focus our priority efforts. What  is at stake is society’s trust in democratic institutions and in our own capacity to face  the future in the certainty that we are making progress.  In the midst of an era of transformations and of uncertainties, we must offer a solid  moral and material horizon, and to this end, it is increasingly essential to have  cybersecurity that is equipped for the new times and the new threats. Cybersecurity  that is capable of addressing the different challenges, and of doing so with public- private cooperation and with the support of a citizenry that is aware of the changing  reality and committed to the solutions to these challenges.  This National Cybersecurity Strategy, in line with the 2017 National Security Strategy,  seeks to contribute to this. And it seeks to do so with a clear goal as its guide: ensuring  that these times of changes are not a source of cultural discontent and of economic and  labour regression, but, rather, an opportunity to increase Spain’s competitiveness and  the well-being of Spaniards, as well as that of our European partners. This work has  also taken into account our current geopolitical situation, which makes it more urgent  and necessary to build and strengthen the European Union’s strategic autonomy.  In all of this, Spain has a lot to say and to contribute. After all, ours is one of the  most interconnected countries in the world. It only takes a glance at the daily news to  realize how common and how dangerous the cyber threats we are facing really are.  From fake news on social networks, to cyber espionage or the funding of terrorism— the digital realm is increasingly influencing and shaping reality. Moreover, other  new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, big and smart data, and  blockchain are already part of the daily activity of citizens, companies and public  administrations. These new technologies have paved the way for ground-breaking  instruments to obtain information, generate knowledge, and share data.  This influence will grow even further with the current implementation of what is known  as 5G for the new connectivity of the internet of things. Being more interconnected  and more dependent on said infrastructures will allow us to advance in many  important fields, from achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals,  to combating the effects of climate change.    THE PRESIDENT OF THE GOVERNMENT  But it also makes us more vulnerable to hostile actions against—and coming  from—said new infrastructures. Threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated  and complex, and cyberspace is a weakly regulated area with no clear borders  or jurisdictional demarcations, where the traceability of criminal actions, and the  identification of state or non-state perpetrators, is difficult.  The challenge is enormous and multidisciplinary. Our professionals in the diverse areas  involved in cybersecurity have well-deserved prestige and will be able to rise to the  challenge. But cybersecurity requires commitment from us all. It is our responsibility,  at the public administrations, to lead this commitment and to offer a framework of  certainty to companies and citizens, who must also share this commitment. Once  again, this is not only to avert the dangers and threats, but to make the most of the  many opportunities to the benefit of all.  Cybersecurity protects assets, but it also protects essential values for a free society  such as ours. We are not going to relinquish these principles in this era of global  transformation. The technical challenges involved in cybersecurity are varied and  complex, but something else is at stake. Something that refers to moral and cultural  values related to our way of seeing and understanding the world, to what best defines  us. Our freedom, well-being and democracy ultimately depend upon our success  in designing an effective Cybersecurity Strategy. I am convinced that, with this  document, we have taken a key step towards successfully addressing uncertain, but  at the same time fascinating, years.

              9Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019  Executive Summary  The National Cybersecurity Strategy works with forecasts from the 2017 Na- tional Security Strategy in the cybersecurity field, considering general goals, the  field’s specific goal and lines of action laid down to achieve them.   The document is divided into five chapters. The first, entitled “Cyberspace, beyond a  common global space”, provides an overall understanding of the cybersecurity field,  progress made in it since approving the Strategy in 2013, reasons behind drawing up  the 2019 National Cybersecurity Strategy, plus the main features of its development.  Activities in cyberspace are fundamental for current society. Cyberspace technology  and infrastructures are strategic elements, running across all fields of activity, making  cyberspace vulnerability a major risk for our development as a nation.  For this reason, cyberspace security is a priority goal on government agendas to  guarantee National Security and a State competence to create a trust-based digital  society.                  10 National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019 Prime Minister’s Office  Helping promote secure and reliable cyberspace, from a multidisciplinary focus, moving  beyond purely technical aspects, is a task that should stem from knowing about and  understanding any threats we might face, including new and emerging threats.   The second chapter, entitled “Threats and challenges in cyberspace” determines  the main threats to cyberspace stemming from its definition as a common global  space, highly technified and widely connected, that amplifies the impact of any attack.  It classifies these threats and challenges in two categories: on the one hand, threats to  cyberspace assets; and on the other, threats that use cyberspace to carry out all types  of malicious and illicit activities.   The third chapter, entitled “Proposal, principles and goals for cybersecurity”  applies the governing principles of the 2017 National Security Strategy (Action  unit, Anticipation, Efficiency and Resilience) to five specific goals. Its development is  mentioned in the fourth chapter, entitled “Lines of action and measures”, setting  seven lines of action and identifying measures to develop each one.  These lines of action aim to: strengthen skills to fight threats from cyberspace; guarantee  strategic asset security and resilience for Spain; boost cybersecurity for citizens and  companies; strengthen skills to investigate and prosecute cybercrimes, guarantee  citizen security and protect rights and freedoms in cyberspace; boost cybersecurity  for citizens and companies; bolster the Spanish cybersecurity industry and encourage  and retain talent, strengthen digital autonomy; contribute to international cyberspace  security, promoting open, plural, secure and reliable cyberspace supporting national  interests and developing a cybersecurity culture to contribute to the Comprehensive  National Security Culture Plan.  The fifth chapter, entitled “Cybersecurity in the National Security System” defines  cybersecurity’s organic architecture. Led by Spain’s Prime Minister, the structure is  divided into three authorities: the National Security Council, as the Government’s  Delegate Commission for National Security; the National Cybersecurity Council,  that supports the National Security Council and helps the Prime Minister manage  and coordinate National Security policy on cybersecurity, and promotes coordination,  collaboration and cooperation among Public Administrations and between these and     11Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019  the private sector, and the Specialised Situation Committee that, with support from  the National Security Department, will support crisis situation management in any  field that, because it crosses disciplines or due to its sheer size, might overwhelm the  response capabilities of the usual mechanisms.  This system is completed by the Standing Committee on Cybersecurity, that eases  inter-ministerial coordination at an operational level in the field of cybersecurity, as the  authority assisting the National Cybersecurity Council on aspects relating to technical  and operational evaluation of risks and threats to cybersecurity; the competent public  authorities and the national CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team) and  it includes setting up a new public-private joint-project, the National Cybersecurity  Forum.  In addition, this last chapter makes some final conclusions and outlines mechanisms to  update and assess the Strategy.                 12 National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019 Prime Minister’s Office  Introduction    13Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019  Introduction  The 2019 National Cybersecurity Strategy establishes Spain’s position in the  light of a new understanding of cybersecurity within the framework of the  National Security Policy.  Spain’s first National Cybersecurity Strategy was approved in 2013. The document  set directives and general lines of action to tackle the challenge that cyberspace  vulnerability represented for the country. Furthermore, the strategy designed the  governance model for national cybersecurity. In the intervening period, Spain has also  continued moving forward in a bid to contribute to secure, reliable cyberspace.  One of its mainstays, dating back to 2014, is the National Cybersecurity Council,  an authority supporting the National Security Council. Since its first meeting, the  National Cybersecurity Council has assumed the task of coordinating nationally- competent organisations plus developing the National Cybersecurity Plan and its                  14 National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019 Prime Minister’s Office  offshoots. Consequently, Spain today can boast specialist cybersecurity organisations  and an outstanding position not only in Europe but throughout the world.   The legal framework has also been considerably adapted. To keep on top of its  evolution and use experience accumulated over these last few years, the National  Security Framework modification was published in 2015 to guarantee security for  Public Sector systems. On the other hand, bringing into force the Royal Decree-law  12/2018 of 7 September, on information network and system security, that transposes  Directive (EU) 2016/1148 (known as the NIS Directive) to Spanish legal order,  represented an important milestone in our country’s cybersecurity improvements,  extending the scope of this Directive in an attempt to improve cybersecurity among  all strategic sectors.  Law 36/2015, of 28 September, on National Security was extended to boost a project  representing one of the government’s greatest responsibilities, National Security. The  National Security Law considers cybersecurity as a special interest field.  Without the shadow of a doubt, cybersecurity has modernised National Security, as  this field has made the greatest progress to date. This dynamic should stay on the  same track.   The 2017 National Security Strategy was a turning point in national strategic thinking,  giving cybersecurity its own differential space.   One of the global trends identified in the Strategy, digitalisation, is shown  to drive change with implications for security. The Strategy sets a new  framework, with five general goals running across all fields. Crisis  management, National Security Culture, global common spaces,  technological development and international projection for Spain  shape a strategic grid where cybersecurity is used to open up new  paths leading to Spain’s present and future security model.    15Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019  New cybersecurity spreads beyond the mere sphere of protecting technological  patrimony and delves into political, economic and social fields.   In addition to actions that affect digital systems, cyberspace should be considered as  a strategic communication vector that can be used to influence public opinion and  how people think by manipulating information, disinformation campaigns or hybrid  actions. Its potential application in a very wide range of situations, including electoral  processes, makes it extremely complex.  This renewed outlook in a field that is understood to have spread functionally, and  where public-private collaboration is key, calls for a new approach in the form of a  new national cybersecurity strategy.    Cyberspace: beyond a  global common space  Chapter 1                 17Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019  Cyberspace: beyond a global common  space  This chapter presents the opportunities and challenges of cyberspace  and digital infrastructure, outlines the inherently international aspect of  its security approach and describes the broad strokes of Spain’s new  understanding of cyberspace.  Cyberspace: opportunities and challenges  Cyberspace is a global common space characterised  by its functionality and dynamism. Lack of sovereignty,  its weak jurisdiction, ease of access and difficulty   to attribute actions within it define a scenario with a wide  range of future opportunities while also posing some serious                  18 National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019 Prime Minister’s Office  security challenges.  On the one hand, cyberspace makes universal connectivity possible and eases free flow  of information, services and ideas. It is thereby a field that stimulates entrepreneurship,  strengthens socio-economic progress and creates new opportunities every day in all  business sectors. The change caused by digital transformation of production processes  is demonstrated globally at an unprecedented rate. Artificial intelligence, robotics,  big data, blockchain and the Internet of Things are already with us, although the real  transforming power is still to be unleashed. Its implications go beyond technology,  extending to new social models and delving into personal relations and ethics.  On the other hand, digitalisation transforms security and lays down some serious  challenges. Cyberspace is structured as a battleground where information and data  privacy are high-value assets in an environment with greater geopolitical competition,  reorganisation of power and individual empowerment. Consequently, booming  connectivity and greater dependence on networks and systems, not to mention digital  components, objects and devices, create vulnerabilities and make it hard to protect  information properly.    19Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019  Digital infrastructure  Cyberspace is not only virtual, but also sustained by physical and logical elements.  Devices, components and systems within information and communication networks  and systems can be exposed to malfunctions that stop them working correctly and  deliberate actions with malicious intentions that jeopardise correct operation of  critical infrastructures and essential services that depend on the associated digital  systems and networks.  This risk is amplified by the importance of commercial criteria over security criteria in  hardware and software product design, not to mention systems and services, which  complicate certification processes and might compromise the supply chain.   All these aspects, along with mounting interconnectivity between systems, can bring  about cascade effects with unpredictable results.   International plan: security in cyberspace  Security in cyberspace has become a top priority on government agendas to  guarantee national security and create a trust-based digital society. In  this context, Spain defends it outlook and interests as a nation  and works with the international community by backing open,  plural and secure cyberspace.   Spain maintains its active role in all institutions where  cybersecurity takes centre-stage, particularly within the  European Union, the Atlantic Alliance and the United  Nations, thereby proving its commitment to partners and  allies. Ties are also maintained with third-party States through  bilateral cooperation mechanisms that ease understanding and  mutual trust based on fluid relationships in the field of cybersecurity,  in an attempt to build on our skills.                  20 National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019 Prime Minister’s Office  Aware of the importance of a multilateral approach, in addition to International  Law and non-binding standards for responsible behaviour among States, we might  highlight the role of the United Nations Charter as the reference principle for conflict  prevention, cooperation and stability in cyberspace. Forging agreements and trust- building measures are the basis for its application and implementation, as well as  International Treaties and Agreements that Spain has joined.  A new conception of cyberspace  A fundamental dimension of stability involves continued defence of constitutional  and democratic values and principles plus citizens’ fundamental rights  in cyberspace, particularly in terms of protecting their personal  data, privacy, freedom of expression and access to truthful, good  quality information.  Good understanding of this approach requires a  multidisciplinary focus, moving beyond purely technical aspects,  using centralised management principles and coordinating its  performance, assigning cybersecurity to National Security as a  State competence.   Firstly, the private sector plays a relevant role as administrator and  owner of Spain’s digital assets, meaning that the country’s cybersecurity skills largely  lie in its companies. This thereby means that cybersecurity needs support, promotion  and investment to become more competitive and boost economic growth, whilst  providing a secure and reliable digital environment.   On the other hand, we should aspire to increasing technological autonomy by  encouraging a national industrial base for cybersecurity, R+D+i and technological  talent management. Human resources remain a critical factor. A gaping chasm has  opened up between the number of highly specialised jobs in information technologies,     21Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019  particularly cybersecurity, and availability of workers with the required level of  knowledge or training.   Secondly, transition from a preventive and defensive cybersecurity model to a more  dissuasive framework falls into line with a global context demonstrating  greater geopolitical competence. Use of cyberspace as a field of  confrontation, independently or as part of a hybrid action, is widely  recognised. Dissuasion in cybersecurity requires obtaining and  strengthening cyberdefence skills, as a fundamental element of  the State’s action.    Thirdly, fast evolving cyberthreats require a more proactive  approach from cyberintelligence. Its integration in the overall  cybersecurity framework is key to provide knowledge of the  situation and the necessary early warning that can anticipate  actions from potential opponents through knowledge of their skills,  techniques, tactics and intentions. In addition, it is necessary to encourage  the use of mechanisms and means that allow appropriate investigation and prosecution  of perpetrators to increase possibilities of attribution.   All the above can be added to the need for greater implication from all society by  encouraging a cybersecurity culture, to evolve from awareness of the commitment,  in the understanding that citizens have joint-responsibility for national cybersecurity.    Threats and challenges in  cyberspace  Chapter 2                 23Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019  Threats and challenges in cyberspace  This chapter examines the main threats and challenges that Spain faces  in cyberspace.  Promoting a secure, reliable environment is a task that should work from knowledge  and understanding of the challenges and threats, including new and emerging aspects,  that affect cyberspace. The 2017 National Security Strategy differentiates between  cyberthreats and actions that use cyberspace as a medium for malicious or illicit  activities.  Cyberthreats   Cyberthreats are malicious disruptions or manipulations that affect technological  elements. They encompass a wide range of actions. Cyberthreats are  characterised by their diversity in terms of both capacity and motivation. They   affect practically all fields of National Security, such as National Defence, economic                  24 National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019 Prime Minister’s Office  security or protection of critical infrastructures, among others, and they do not  respect borders.   This transverse nature means that cybersecurity covers a comprehensive  perspective that includes Public Administrations, the public and private  sector and society as a whole, so there might be simultaneous  implications on a wide range of aspects such as sovereignty,  fundamental rights, defence, the economy and technological  development.  In this scenario, defences can evolve continually to adapt to a  dominating threat that is multiplied by the pull effect caused by its high  degree of impunity. At the same time, the defence ground is expanding and  becoming more complicated every day.  In this respect, providing security in information networks and systems requires  improving prevention, detection and response measures, encouraging security through  design and by default. It should be incorporated both into developing technological  products and services and their updates or how they are used.  Actions that use cyberspace for malicious purposes  Digital technologies open up new activities and ways of doing business that  have to be duly regulated as they might affect stability and our rights and  freedoms, presenting substantial threats and challenges for National  Security. In the same way, the same qualities that help cyberspace  drive progress can be exploited for harmful purposes when  combined with how exceptionally easy it is to remain anonymous,  steal identities and amplify effects.  Thanks to the Internet revolution, States, organised groups, collectives  and even isolated individuals can attain a so-far unprecedented level  of power and capability to influence. Digital connectivity means that     25Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019  global social movements take on strategic importance that has been underestimated  until now.  The actions that cyberspace uses to carry out malicious or illicit activities include  cyberespionage and cybercrime.  Cyberespionage is a relatively cheap, fast method with fewer risks than traditional  espionage, given the difficulty of attributing authorship. The greatest capabilities are  mainly held by State players (intelligence or military organisations), that fundamentally  operate via what are known as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). This type of  threat means that the opponent has sophisticated knowledge levels plus resources  and infrastructures so that, by deploying multiple types of attacks, they can interact on  their targets over a long period of time, adapt to defence strategies, and maintain the  interaction level to meet its end.  In addition, a growing trend is now seen in what are known as  hybrid threats, coordinated and synchronised actions aiming to  deliberately attack systemic vulnerabilities in democratic states  and institutions, through a wide range of media, such as traditional  military actions, cyberattacks, information manipulation  operations or elements of economic pressure. State and non- state players, either directly or through intermediaries, exploit  the Internet’s propensity for disinformation and propaganda  and a generalised interest in obtaining and developing military  capabilities to operate in cyberspace, including offensive capacities in  many cases.   Cybercrime, in turn, is a top-level citizen security issue, representing one of the  widest-spread and generalised threats, continuously arising and increasingly victimising  thousands of institutions, companies and citizens. The term Cybercrime refers to  illicit activities in cyberspace, targeting elements, computer systems or any other legal  property, whenever its planning, development and performance is determined by use  of technological tools; depending on the nature of the actual punishable act, authorship,                  26 National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019 Prime Minister’s Office  motivation, or damage inflicted, this might refer to cyberterrorism, cybercrimes or, when  appropriate, hacktivism.  Use of new financial and economic transaction methods, such as cryptocurrency, for  illicit trafficking and trading of goods and providing services or extortion,  fraud and forgery of non-monetary means of payment, poses a serious  security challenge because they are both sophisticated and complex.  They can be used for money laundering and tax evasion and they  represent a source of income for organised crime; therefore, they  facilitate other activities such as financing terrorism, making the  most of how difficult it is to monitor these new techniques.   Cybercriminals operate under organised-crime frameworks and  incessantly explore techniques for building low-risk lucrative business  models, sheltered by the fact their actions are difficult to trace.   Terrorist groups attempt to make the most of cyberspace vulnerabilities to  launch cyberattacks or activities to radicalise individuals and collectives, for financing,  disseminating techniques and tools to commit a terrorist attack, and for recruitment,  training or propaganda. Intimately linked to this, there is the threat against critical  infrastructures, with the clear chance of using networks to bring about a collapse as  essential services fall like dominoes.   Hacktivist groups carry out cyberattacks for ideological reasons and  sometimes, making the most of products, services and tools available  in cyberspace, they seek to develop attacks with a major media or  social impact.  Nor can we ignore threats from the continuous surge of  organisations contracting cybercriminal services to damage their  competitors and their in-house technological and human resources  that might be detrimental for the organisation, without forgetting  all emerging threats and actions resulting from lack of cybersecurity  culture.    27Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019  On the other hand, digital information has become an asset with high added value. Analysis  of personal data on the Net is used for a wide range of purposes from sociological  studies to advertising campaigns. Malicious use of personal data and disinformation  campaigns have high potential to destabilise society. Furthermore, exploiting personal  data breaches represents infringement of this data’s security, affecting people’s privacy  and their data’s integrity and confidentiality.  As far as disinformation campaigns are concerned, they use elements such as fake news  to influence public opinion. Internet and social media amplify the effect and scope  of the information being sent out, with potential application against targets such as  international organisations, States, political initiatives or public personalities or even  democratic electoral processes.    Proposal, principles and  goals for cybersecurity  Chapter 3                 29Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019  Proposal, principles and goals for  cybersecurity  This chapter outlines the proposal and principles governing the Strategy,  plus one general and five specific goals.  Proposal  As the 2017 National Security Strategy established, Spain must guarantee secure,  responsible use of information and communications networks and systems  by strengthening capabilities for prevention, detection and response to cyber-  attacks, developing and adopting specific measures to promote secure and reliable  cyberspace  Therefore, the 2019 National Cybersecurity Strategy proposes to outline general  directives for the cybersecurity field so as to meet 2017 National Security Strategy goals.   To do this, Spain must continue strengthening skills to tackle cyberthreats and malicious  use of cyberspace. Consequently, measures will be sought that help guarantee our nation’s                  30 National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019 Prime Minister’s Office  security, paying particular attention to the public sector and essential  services, in a more coordinated framework featuring improved  cooperation structures.   On the other hand, promoting cybersecurity culture should  be one of the central themes being developed to make society  aware of these threats and challenges. The right to secure, reliable  use of cyberspace and contributing to this situation are shared  responsibilities.  In addition, cybersecurity means progress, so singular support and  encouragement are required for the Spanish cybersecurity industry,  promoting an environment that nurtures research, development and innovation, plus  participation from the academic world. On the other hand, our society prioritises  attaining and maintaining knowledge, skills, experience and technological and professional  capabilities because they are essential to tackle major cybersecurity challenges.   Cyberspace’s transverse and global nature also demands cooperation and compliance  from International Law, as well as utmost respect for the principles of the Constitution  and the United Nations Charter; in coherence with the National Security Strategy and  initiatives developed within European, regional and international frameworks, where  national interests prevail at all times.  Governing Principles  The National Cybersecurity Strategy is upheld and inspired by the governing principles  of National Security: action unit, anticipation, efficiency and resilience.  1. Action Unit:  Any response to an incident in the cybersecurity field that might  implicate different State agents will be strengthened if it is coherent, coordinated  and resolved quickly and effectively. These qualities can be attained through careful  preparation and appropriate organisation of the State’s action unit.    31Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019  Centralised management of cyberspace-related crises helps maintain full  understanding of the threat situation and frees up available resources more quickly,  efficiently, coherently and completely.       2. Anticipation: The specific nature of cyberspace and the players involved requires  anticipation mechanisms in specialised organisations to guide State Action in crisis  situations, where the private sector should also get involved.   Anticipation prioritises preventive actions over reactions. Effective systems, with  shared information as close as possible to real time, grant appropriate knowledge  of the situation. This factor is essential to minimise response times which can be  critical to reduce the effects of threats   3. Eficiency: Cybersecurity requires the use of high-value, multi-offer systems featuring  a high level of technology, that are associated with very demanding needs and high  costs derived from their development, purchase and operation, plus the need for  advance planning and the high complexity of sustaining it.   Furthermore, current and future scenarios are affected by economic  austerity that, along with social responsibility to squeeze maximum  performance from available resources, means that Spain should  focus on optimisation and efficiency of resources devoted to  cybersecurity, increasing the importance of the action unit,  sharing information and integrating these resources for  maximum efficiency.  4. Resilience: Resilience is a fundamental feature for systems  and critical infrastructures. The State must ensure availability of  elements considered to be essential for the nation, improving  their protection against cyberthreats. A special mention should be  given to the reinforcement required for information and communication  networks against cyberthreat activities or illicit use of cyberspace.                 32 National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019 Prime Minister’s Office                   34 National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019 Prime Minister’s Office  General Goal  New cybersecurity challenges have meant adapting the general goal to become more  integrating, inclusive and less technified.  In line with the 2017 National Security Strategy and broadening  the cybersecurity goal mentioned in it, Spain will guarantee secure,  reliable use of cyberspace, protecting citizens’ rights and freedoms  and promoting socio-economic progress.  Based on this general goal, a series of specific goals are explained below to guide the  State’s action in this field.  Goal I  Security and resilience of information and communication networks  and systems for the public sector and essential services.  A coherent, integrated national framework should be consolidated to help guarantee  protection of information handled by the public sector and essential services, their  systems and services, as well as the networks that support them. This framework will  make it possible to develop and implant increasingly secure and efficient services.    To do so, security measures should be implemented, focussing on improving capabilities  for prevention, detection and response to incidents, developing new solutions,  reinforcing coordination and adapting the legal system accordingly.   Actions against cyberespionage particularly deserve a special mention as this ensures  protection of Spain’s Technological Patrimony, understood as the material or immaterial     35Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019  assets that uphold the current business sector’s intellectual and industrial property  and condition future development.   The public sector and essential service operators should get actively involved in a  continuous improvement process to protect their Information and Communication  Technology systems based on constantly monitoring their threat exposure. These  agents should act as a model for cybersecurity management best practices.  Applying the principle of shared responsibility, the public sector  should work closely with companies that manage the relevant  Information and Communication Technology Systems for national  interests, exchanging knowledge that encourages appropriate  coordination between the two and effective cooperation within  the cybersecurity environment.   Strengthening cybersecurity requires systematic knowledge of the  impact of potential interruption or destruction of the networks  and systems that provide essential services, as well as security level  metrics for these systems that help make the right decisions according  to exposure levels.                   36 National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019 Prime Minister’s Office  Goal II   Secure and reliable use of cyberspace to ward off illicit or malicious  use.  Cyberspace plays an increasingly important role in committing illicit or malicious acts  and investigating them to encourage citizen trust. It is necessary to guarantee suitable  prosecution of criminal phenomena that are taking place in it.   Fighting cybercrime can be divided into three fields: (i) cyberspace as the direct target  of criminal acts, or the threat; (ii) cyberspace as the key medium for committing the  crime; and (iii) cyberspace as the medium or direct investigation target for any type  of illicit behaviour.  Based on solid and effective regulation that reinforces and guarantees fighting  cybercrime, it is necessary to strengthen legal and police cooperation, both nationally  and internationally, and assign sufficient resources to competent bodies  on this matter and skills training for professionals working in this  area.  In the same way, citizen collaboration and participation must  be encouraged, facilitating procedures to access and transmit  information that might be of legal or police interest and  identifying aspects that require improving capabilities among  police institutions and competent legal organisations    37Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019  Goal III  Protecting the business and social ecosystem and citizens.  All persons and organisations have the right to use cyberspace securely. It is therefore  the State’s responsibility to promote and encourage measures to attain and maintain  sufficient cybersecurity, particularly protecting the most vulnerable sectors of society  and allowing proper socio-economic development for Spain.   Cybersecurity is a responsibility shared with private players that can affect them by  action or omission; cybersecurity is not possible without their participation. Therefore,  measures to be promoted should encourage cooperation to ensure common security.  Defending citizens, self-employed people and companies should reach  beyond self-protection measures, so it is advisable to implement  measures for their active cyberdefence. At the same time, all  cyberspace users should demonstrate responsible use of the  technology available to them.  Society’s accelerated enthusiasm for emerging technologies  makes risks evolve. Consequently, constant knowledge exchange  with all players and monitoring mechanisms to protect the  business and social ecosystem will be instruments to keep the  Government informed and help it make the right decisions to update  and adapt the actions taken as a result of this strategy.                 38 National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019 Prime Minister’s Office  Goal IV  Culture and commitment to cybersecurity and strengthening human  and technological skills.  To tackle cybersecurity challenges, Spain should have technical and human resources  to give it the necessary technological autonomy and appropriate skills training for  secure use of cyberspace, making cybersecurity the key enabler for an entrepreneurial  nation.  To do this, it must improve collective cybersecurity, diffusing cybersecurity culture with  the help of public and private organisations and the media, strengthening  information mechanisms and help for citizens and promoting spaces for  encounters between civil society, administrations and companies.  It should also contribute to secure and responsible use of Information  and Communication Technologies by promoting appropriate skills  training on cybersecurity for professionals according to job market  demands, stimulating professionals’ development with their own  skills, boosting specialised training and qualification, plus skills to  generate knowledge, develop R+D+i activities in cybersecurity and  encourage use of certified products and services.  In addition, special attention should be paid to protecting technological  patrimony and industrial and intellectual property. To promote technological  sovereignty and make the most of digital transformation opportunities, the Spanish  cybersecurity industry should be encouraged and boosted hand-in-hand with good  practice on development and implementation of information and communication  systems.    39Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019  Goal  V  International cyberspace security.  Spain will promote open, plural, secure and trustworthy cyberspace both in its bilateral  relations and in multilateral, regional and international organisations, and in forums  and conferences, where cyberspace plays a leading role.    It will advocate setting up an international framework for conflict prevention,  cooperation and stability in cyberspace, applying principles from the whole United  Nations Charter, International Law, Human Rights and Humanitarian Rights in War, as  well as non-binding standards on responsible behaviour for States.   Aware of the importance of multilateralism, the United Nations’ role is considered  relevant to move forward building consensus that, along with adopting and setting  in motion measures to promote trust, collaboration and participation from all  players involved (States, private sector, civil society, users and academia), constitutes  the groundwork to achieve security and stability in cyberspace and work towards  regulation.   In line with our European partners, this goal will strengthen trust in the internet,  digital transformation and development of new technologies, helping to consolidate  a secure European cybernetic ecosystem that boosts progress towards the single  digital market. To do this, it will defend an interoperative, neutral, open and diverse  internet, a reflection of international cultural and linguistic plurality, based on a system  of democratic, representative and inclusive governance resulting from agreement and  consensus. In addition, it will provide access to global and generalised internet, thereby  helping meet Sustainable Development Goals.   In this way, belonging to the European Union (EU) means that we have to strengthen  security and European strategic autonomy by seeking synergy, technical, operative,  strategic and political cooperation; to strengthen our resilience, our capacity to respond                  40 National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019 Prime Minister’s Office  to a crisis and the complementary nature of civil and military fields as EU  partners and allies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).   Based on the above, Spain will continue to take an active role in the  EU and NATO; in the United Nations and in its offshoot forums  such as the Internet Governance Forum (IGF); the Organisation  for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), development and  implementation of Confidence-Building Measures; the Organisation  of American States (OAS). As well as the Global Forum on Cyber  Expertise (GFCE) and the Freedom Online Coalition FOC, without  forgetting our presence in the European Centre of Excellence to  counter-attack Hybrid Threats (Hybrid CoE) plus the NATO Cooperative  Cyberdefence Centre of Excellence (CCD CoE).  In addition, it will reinforce international bilateral cooperation on cybersecurity,  promote fluid and trustworthy relations in this field, work jointly on building skills  in third-party countries, paying particular attention to women and young people  and promoting setting up information channels and experience exchange, boosting  bilateral and multilateral agreements in this field.     41Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019    Lines of action and  measures  Chapter 4                 43Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019  Lines of action and measures  This chapter sets the lines of action to achieve the goals.                  44 National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019 Prime Minister’s Office   LINE OF ACTION  1  Strengthen capabilities to deal with threats from cyberspace.

The 2013 National Cybersecurity Strategy and subsequent approval of  the National Security Law in 2015, created a specific organic structure for  cybersecurity. This 2019 Strategy boosts initiatives that complement further   progress in the national governance model with European policies  Within the National Security System, the cybersecurity structure comprises the  following components:                  62 National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019 Prime Minister’s Office  1. The National Security Council.  2. A single Specialised Situation Committee for the whole National Security System  in crisis situations.  3. The National Cybersecurity Council  4. The Cybersecurity Standing Committee.  5. The National Cybersecurity Forum.  6. Competent public authorities and the national CSIRT.   The National Security Council  The National Security Council, as the Government’s Delegate Commission for  National Security, is the body which helps the Spanish Prime Minister to manage  National Security Policy.  The National Security Council acts through the National Security Department as a  single point of contact, as a link, and guarantees cross-border cooperation with other  countries in the European Union  The Situation Committee  There is just one Situation Committee for the whole National Security Council and,  supported by the National Security Department, it acts according to political-strategic  guidelines dictated by the National Security Council on crisis management.   The National Cybersecurity Council  The National Cybersecurity Council helps the National Security Council meet its  functions, particularly helping the Spanish Prime Minister manage and coordinate  National Security Policy in the field of cybersecurity.     63Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019  Its functions include reinforcing coordination, collaboration and cooperation between  Public Administrations with competences in cybersecurity, and between public  and private sectors, and easing decision-making for the actual Council by analysing,  studying and suggesting initiatives and evaluating risks and threats, analysing possible  crisis scenarios, studying how they might evolve, drafting and updating response plans  and formulating directives for crisis management exercises in the field of cybersecurity  and assessing their performance results, all in coordination with directly competent  bodies and authorities.  The Cybersecurity Standing Committee  The Cybersecurity Standing Committee is set up to ease inter-ministerial coordination  on an operational level in the field of cybersecurity. Presided over by the National  Security Department, it comprises the bodies and organisations represented within  the National Cybersecurity Council with operational responsibilities. This body helps  the National Cybersecurity Council on aspects relating to technical and operative  assessment of cybersecurity risks and threats.  The Commission’s operation falls within the crisis management procedure in the  field of cybersecurity. This procedure establishes its functions aimed at detecting and  assessing risks and threats; eases the decision-making process and ensures an optimum,  coordinated response from the State. Furthermore, it includes the National Security  System’s different activation levels plus instructions to manage public communication.   To provide a relevant response, in proportion to situations of special relevance in its  functions, it will improve the definition of its skills and responsibilities.  National Cybersecurity Forum  It will act on strengthening and creating public-private synergies, particularly generating  knowledge on opportunities, challenges and threats to security in cyberspace.  Setting up the National Cybersecurity Forum, and harmonising its operation with  existing bodies, will require approval of the necessary standard-based provisions,                  64 National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019 Prime Minister’s Office  so that these components might be coordinated and run efficiently in the National  Security System.  Competent public authorities and the national  reference CSIRT  Cybersecurity’s strategic, institutional framework is complemented by the competent  public authorities on security in information networks and systems and the national  CSIRTs that are compiled in the national legal framework.  In addition, CSIRTs from the Autonomous Regions and Autonomous Cities, from  Local Entities and their affiliated or dependent bodies, from private entities, the CSIRT. es network and other relevant cybersecurity services should be coordinated with the  above, depending on each one’s competences. In the same way, working with regional  and private CSIRTs, national CSIRTs will encourage initiatives that help meet national  strategy goals    65Prime Minister’s Office National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019                 66 National Cybersecurity Strategy  2019 Prime Minister’s Office  Final considerations and evaluation  Thanks to experience from the 2013 National Cybersecurity Strategy, this document  can express and update the ever-changing threats and challenges that we are facing. To  adapt to this new, shifting scenario, Lines of Action are proposed plus more dynamic  measures that, when necessary, allow the national cybersecurity ecosystem to adapt  quickly, based on a considerably mature governance model, which should include  active participation from the private sector and the rest of civil society.  In this respect, the Strategy is conceived as a living document that has to be adapted  to gradual changes in cybersecurity, so it should be continuously revised, along with  specific, sector-based plans derived from it. An annual assessment report will be  drafted on the Strategy that will show how much it has been followed and if its goals  have been met.  On the other hand, in the light of increasing cybersecurity threats and challenges  as faced by countries around us, it is increasingly urgent to equip ourselves with  economic, human and material resources to tackle them. One particularly relevant  action here is to make sure that the Spanish Central Administration Cybersecurity  Operations Centre is properly equipped.      www.dsn.gob.es    Executive Summary  Introduction  Chapter 1  Cyberspace: beyond a global common space  Cyberspace: opportunities and challenges  Digital infrastructure  International plan: security in cyberspace  A new conception of cyberspace   Chapter 2  Threats and challenges in cyberspace  Cyberthreats   Actions that use cyberspace for malicious purposes   Chapter 3   Proposal, principles and goals for cybersecurity  Proposal  Governing Principles  General Goal  Goal I  Goal II   Goal III  Goal IV  Goal  V   Chapter 4  Lines of action and measures  MEASURES  LINE OF ACTION  2  LINE OF ACTION  3  LINE OF ACTION  4  LINE OF ACTION  5  LINE OF ACTION  6  LINE OF ACTION 7   Chapter 5  Cybersecurity in the National Security System  The National Security Council  The Situation Committee  The National Cybersecurity Council  The Cybersecurity Standing Committee  National Cybersecurity Forum  Competent public authorities and the national reference CSIRT  Final considerations and evaluation",

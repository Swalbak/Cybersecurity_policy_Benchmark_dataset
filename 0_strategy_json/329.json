Cybersecurity risks1 in this regard, should therefore be analyzed within a broader context that also encompasses legal, economic and social factors, contributing to a better management of cybersecurity threats and decision-making. Technology is changing exponentially every day, and the threats surrounding these technologies are becoming increasingly sophisticated. As our connectivity and dependence on Internet-based platforms and services increase, so do our vulnerabilities and exposure to cyber threats. While this growth has brought numerous opportunities for many nations, cyber threats have equally evolved in recent years. This reality, therefore, requires the development of public policies that seek to ensure an open and safe Internet for all. Developed through a multi-stakeholder approach, through the establishment of an Inter-institutional Cybersecurity Task Force, the National Cybersecurity Strategy of Belize seeks to establish a vision to enhance the cybersecurity posture of Belize. Considering existing national plans and the level of connectivity of the nation, a tiered approach was used to develop concrete and measurable actions that can be taken to advance the capability of the nation to address cyber threats. As such, in the development of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, the level of connectivity to the Internet, as well as, the volume of cybercrimes that are committed in Belize were considered. These variables were also used to determine the scope of the problem, existing cybersecurity gaps, capacities and opportunities for public-private synergies in Belize. In terms of connectivity, there has been a steady growth in the level of Internet penetration and connectivity .2 The more connected people become the more avenues are open for cyberattacks. As of 2018, the Internet penetration rate of Belize was recorded as being over 50% of the population, an increase of over 40% since 2000. With respect to cybercrime, the Police Information Technology and Cyber Unit (PITCU) the Belize Police Department (BPD) manages the investigations of cyber-related crimes, as well as, those felonies that involve electronic evidence. The PITCU has investigated cases of phishing, credit card and ATM fraud, as well as, other crimes that involve electronic evidence, including drug trafficking. They have also received reports of cyberbullying, revenge porn and identity theft. The PITCU holds a partnership with the Internet Watch Foundation, which facilitates the international reporting and investigation of cases of child pornography3. 8 National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 Acknowledging the evolving dynamics of the cybersecurity landscape in Belize, the strategy addresses three priorities pillars and includes actionable objectives to be realized over a period of three (3) years: It is essential to consider who or what entity will manage the inter-institutional relationships of Belize’s cybersecurity landscape, act as a national and international point of contact to facilitate cooperation, provide an advisory role in the development of programmatic interventions, and perhaps most importantly, coordinate the execution, evaluation and reporting of the strategy’s action plan. As such, this Strategy recommends, that a National Cybersecurity Coordinator, under the auspices of the Ministry of National Security be appointed for the coordination of the implementation of actions identified in this Strategy. Finally, the Strategy recognizes the need to undertake a review of its achievements within eighteen (18) months of its approval. Figure 1-Areas of Priority Develop a National Legal Framework to address Cybersecurity Threats Implement measures to support Education, Awareness and Workforce Policy Development in Cybersecurity Develop Capacity for Incident Response and Critical Infrastructure Protection Areas of Priorities 9National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 FOREWORD lt is without a doubt that the fourth industrial revolution is here. In the words of Professor Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum: \"This Fourth Industrial Revolution is, however, fundamentally different. lt is characterised by a range of new technologies that are fusing the physical, digital and biological worlds, impacting all disciplines, economies and industries, and even challenging ideas about what it means to be human. The resulting shifts and disruptions mean that we live in a time of great promise and great peril.\" The Internet as a shared global resource encapsulates unimaginable possibilities. As we seek to improve the standard of living of our people, we must harness the potential of this tool to capitalize on the opportunities in the digital economy. However, this cannot be pursued in a vacuum, as securing our engagement online from the onset is a critical first step in ensuring we retain value in whatever digital investments are made. Why would I say this? Cyberspace has also become the fifth domain, along with air, sea, land and space, requiring defence. With the increased frequency and sophistication of malicious cyber activities, as a developing nation we cannot afford to be complacent. In today’s digital age, everyone should care about cybersecurity. With the advancement in mobile technology for example, many Belizeans are engaged online. Personal information on social media sites such as phone number, email address, home address, and credit/debit card numbers and other information like photos and opinions, etc. are being shared. Aside from social media sites, people share their details for business reasons, and many have no idea how their information would be used. Further, another challenge in this area is the global shortage of cybersecurity experts, and Belize is no exception. With the above in mind, the strategic lines of action articulated in this document demonstrate, among other things, two main concepts: 1. We as a Government recognize our cybersecurity gaps and challenges BUT at the same time, we recognize that everything cannot be all fixed with a stroke of a pen and the articulation of this document, therefore, we have identified three (3) key priority areas to start our journey of building resiliency and protecting the Belizean people. 10 National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 2. We also recognize that ‘no man is an island’ and this must be a national effort. Relying on, while cultivating our own homegrown talent, we will face this challenge recognizing the need to institutionalize processes that will improve our overall cyber hygiene. I must conclude by stating that this National Cybersecurity Strategy demonstrates a commitment to strengthening Belize’s capabilities and national coordination to mitigate the impact of cyber threats. lt also recognizes the importance of having a strategic vision to address Cybersecurity. I implore all Belizeans to embrace this new digital era with a consciousness that the protection of the Internet is a shared resource. On behalf of the Government and people of Belize, I take this opportunity to thank everyone that was engaged in the development process and contributed their time, knowledge and talent to make this national cybersecurity framework possible. Hon. Michael Peyrefitte Minister of National Security 11National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 GLOSSARY OF TERMS Critical infrastructure: Includes those sectors whose assets, systems, and networks, whether physical or virtual, are considered so vital that their incapacitation or destruction would have a debilitating effect on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination thereof. Digital Assets: Is content that is stored digitally and has value. Cyber Education: Includes technical and non- technical content at all levels to provide the knowledge and skills necessary to perform cybersecurity functions Cyber Awareness: Involves providing information about existing threats and takes into account knowledge combined with attitudes and behaviors that serve to protect digital assets and citizens online. Cybersecurity: Takes into account the continuous and planned activities at the political, legal, economic, educational, awareness raising and technical levels to manage risks in cyberspace to ensure the ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of digital assets Cybercrime: Is a crime that either uses services or applications in cyberspace are to carry out a crime or are themselves the targets of crime Cyber Incidents: An event or activity that is observable occurrence in a system and/or network that usually indicates some form of interference from an unauthorized source. Cyber Attack: Is a malicious and deliberate attempt by an individual or organization to breach the information system of another individual or organization4. Electronic Evidence: Is the information and data of investigative value that is stored on or transmitted by an electronic device. Cyber bullying: Is harassment carried out on the Internet, via social networks, video game chat, or instant messaging. This can include direct verbal or emotional abuse, exclusion from social groups, or spreading gossip and rumors, making public content that was intended to be private, embarrassing the victim by impersonating them on social media, Posting embarassing pictures, revenge porn. Identity theft: is the use of someone’s personal information without permission for financial gain. They may get loans, mortgages, or credit cards in the victim’s name, or they may make use of the victim’s health insurance. Or they may assume the victim’s identity in order to avoid arrest. Phishing: is the use of emails that appear to originate from a trusted source, in order to trick a user into entering valid credentials at a fake website. Typically the email and the web site looks like they are part of a bank the user is doing business with. Revenge porn: is a form of cyber bullying where nude or sexual photos or videos of someone are publically posted. Often, sexual images exchanged during a relationship are posted by an angry ex when the relationship ends. Other times, accounts of celebrities are hacked and sexual images found there are posted. In a recent case, revenge porn was combined with politics, when the ex of a female politician gave sexual images to the organization of a political rival. The images were published, causing her to resign, which allowed the rival to run in the election to take her place. Another name for revenge porn is Non-Consensual Pornography (NCP). For the purposes of this document: 12 National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 STRATEGIC VISION PRINCIPLES Recognizing the benefits that technologies in this new digital age can bring, the people of Belize will work together to create a safe and trusted digital environment that will promote economic growth and social inclusion for all. A comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity is paramount to keep pace with emerging technologies and more sophisticated threats. Cybersecurity capacity should not only include the protection of networks and systems, but also take into account the people that rely more and more on Internet-enabled devices to conduct basic tasks. In that regard the following principles have guided the development of the Strategy and will further guide its implementation. Respect for and the promotion of fundamental rights Government Led This Strategy recognizes that human rights apply online, as well as offline, and that cybersecurity and human rights are mutually reinforcing. Thus this Strategy protects and promotes fundamental rights and freedoms such as the right to privacy, freedom of expression, freedom of association, freedom of assembly among others, in addition to being in line with Part II of the Constitution of Belize and the international instruments to which Belize is party to. Recognizing that the Government is one of the largest consumers of information technology services, it commits to driving the objectives of this Strategy by adopting best practices in its operations and lead by example in the implementation of the Strategy’s objectives.

The need for comprehensive stakeholder cooperation has never been greater than it is today. This Strategy focuses on the need to leverage international partnerships to investigate criminal activities, build capacity and protect Belize’s cyberspace. Recognizing the importance of innovation and business development to our national economy, a cyber-environment that is safe and conducive to such development will be fostered. With the understanding of the importance of Critical Infrastructure to the welfare of Belize, the Strategy seeks to mitigate cybersecurity risks to acceptable levels by encouraging the combination of cost benefit, acceptable risk and other qualitative and quantitative approaches with the desired end result of the protection of Belizean people and economy. Cybersecurity affects everyone and as a result it is a shared responsibility for all to exercise cybersecurity best practices. Targeted awareness raising initiatives will be implemented through the mobilization and partnership with civil society, academia and other interest groups across Belize, to enable and empower end-users to keep themselves and their organizations safer online. 14 National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 INTRODUCTION This Strategy was developed in collaboration with the Government and stakeholders, to address cybersecurity threats facing Belize, so as to provide guidance on key actions to be taken to improve Belize’s overall preparedness and responsiveness to these threats. This Strategy outlines the principles and long-term goals that will form the basis and overall direction for the planning and development of the national cybersecurity posture, including a plan of action outlining various roles and responsibilities for implementation. Cybersecurity impacts many actors such as, policy-makers, private sector, law enforcement, academia, and civil society, therefore a multi-stakeholder approach was used in the development of this Strategy. Cybersecurity risks5 in this regard, should therefore be analyzed within a broader context that also encompasses legal, economic and social factors, contributing to a better management of cybersecurity threats and decision-making. Technology is changing exponentially every day, and the threats surrounding these technologies are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Our growing connectivity and dependence on Internet-based platforms and services has significantly increased our exposure to cyber threats. While this growth has brought numerous opportunities for many nations, cyber threats have equally evolved in recent years. This therefore, requires the development of public policies that seek to ensure an open and safe Internet for all. In order to mitigate the impact of these threats, a structural change around cybersecurity is imperative. However, this structural change is only possible with national coordination and international cooperation, as well as with the active participation of different actors of society working in tandem. Globally, there is no one fix for these ever-evolving cyber threats, and governments recognize the need for collaboration and cooperation among states, as well as all national cyber actors including the private sector, NGOs, academia, and citizens as a part of the solution. To compound these issues, the trans-border nature of the Internet requires strategic thinking, not only in how we adopt technological solutions for the creation of more efficient services, but also in how we protect them. 15National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 National Context Horizon 2030: The National Development Framework for Belize Similarly, the implementation of cybersecurity measures takes into account many other aspects of a nation’s economic and developmental goals and plans. Therefore, in the development of the Strategy, there was a recognition that cybersecurity considerations cannot be taken in isolation but must be considered in the wider context of other policy decisions and national initiatives such as the National Sustainable Tourism Master Plan 20306, the National Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy 2016-20197, among others. The graphic below illustrates some of considerations and policies that were taken into account during the development of this Strategy: The Horizon 20308 vision, goals and strategies arose out of an analysis of the current socio- economic situation of Belize, informed by a broad consultation process and review of existing technical and policy studies. The framework included specific vision statements from stakeholders including ‘Belizeans are capable of using state of the art technology which they incorporate into productive enterprise[s].’ Listed among five important cross cutting issues was a need to invest in education and a review of the education system to assess its strength and weaknesses and the development of a long term investment plan. This review, as stated in Horizon 2030, would define the human resources that are critical to closing the resource gaps identified. This approach is critical especially in the field of cybersecurity as it has been reported in several fora that there is a global cybersecurity skills gap, of which Belize is no exception. The gap in Cybersecurity jobs are expected to reach 1.8 million by 2022, up 20% from 1.5 million in 2015, according to the Center for Cyber Safety and Education9. National Policies (National Security and Defence Strategy, Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy) Relevant Stakeholders (Government, Private Sector, Civil Society, Executive Branch, Academia) Legislative Framework (Mutual Legal Assistance, Cybercrime, Intellectual Property Rights) Critical [Information] Infrastructure Protection National Coordination (Inter-governmental information sharing, national Incident response capability) Cybersecurity Figure 2 - Cybersecurity 16 National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 The vision of the NSDS is for a Belize “of peace and tranquility, where citizens live in harmony with the natural environment and enjoy a high quality of life. Belizeans are an energetic, resourceful and independent people looking after their own development in a sustainable way”. Having established itself on three main pillars, namely: 1. Maintain the Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity of Belize; 2. Reduce Local and Transnational Crimes; 3. Provide the necessary environment for a prosperous and stable Belize, the NSDS encompasses all factors identified to be essential to the security, stability and prosperity of Belize and the protection of the geopolitical space of Belize as defined by the Belize Constitution. As a part of the strategic objectives the NSDS states that as an effort to reduce such occurrences and the resulting harm to Belize’s sustainable development aspirations, there will be a provision of basic equipment and capacity to effectively manage and control Belize’s land, sea, air, and cyber space (emphasis added). As a nation we recognize cyberspace as a territory for protection. The NSDS further states that ‘in order to build public consensus, multilateral cooperation, and public-private partnerships to defeat transnational organized crime and local gangs, we aim to build new partnerships with industry, private sector, academia, civil society and non-governmental organizations to combat these networks that operate in the illicit and licit worlds[as well as] further international norms against tolerating or sponsoring crime in all its forms, including in cyberspace especially as it relates to prostitution and sexual abuse’(emphasis added). This is position is not a unique approach as many nations have recognized cyberspace as the fifth domain, and as a nation we will continue to extend our resources to protecting the all the borders of Belize, which is among the reasons for the development of strategic approach to cybersecurity efforts. National Security and Defence Strategy 2017-202010 Flowing from Horizon 2030, the GSDS is a strategic plan that places sustainable development as a priority while striving to bring economic, social and environmental policies into balance. The GSDS is based on the principles of sustainable development, and on three notable drivers that are common to successful developing countries: a proactive role for the state, tapping into global markets, and innovative social policy11. Among the Critical Success Factors for the GSDS, they identified CSF1, “Optimal National Income and Investment,” and included as an action to ‘Build institutional capacity to encourage technological adaptation and innovation while also taking into account climate change resilience considerations’. This line of action encourages the adoption of technology to improve efficiency, productivity and competitiveness. As stated in the GSDS, Capacity development processes will target the technical skills needed to facilitate government’s efforts to encourage innovation and imitation. Notably, while technology will continue to revolutionize the way we do business, broader and wider-spread use of technology will also bring its vulnerabilities. Therefore the National Cybersecurity Strategy is designed to guide our nation to think of cybersecurity as an automatic consideration for any investment that involves technology. Belize’s Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy (GSDS) 2016-2019 17National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 It is imperative when designing a strategy at the national level that an assessment is undertaken to ensure, not only that the right areas of focus are identified, but also to determine what is being done well and where the deficiencies lie. As such, in the development of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, the level of connectivity to the Internet was consider to determine the scope of the problem, cybersecurity capacities that exists was measured and finally, the volume of cybercrimes that are committed in Belize was taken into account. In terms of connectivity, there has been a steady growth in the level of Internet penetration and connectivity12. The more connected people become the more avenues that open for opportunities for cyberattacks. As of 2018, the Internet penetration rate of Belize was recorded as being over 50% of the population, an increase of over 40% since 2000 (See Table). Baseline Assessment Year Population Users % Penetration 2000 245,800 15,000 6.10% 2005 291,904 35,000 12.00% 2008 301,270 32,000 10.60% 2012 327,719 74,700 22.80% 2013 340,844 108,048 31.70% 2018 382,444 200,020 52.30% Source: World Bank and ITU The primary goal of information such as this is to implement measures to reduce risk. Ensuring an understanding of ‘what is at risk’ helps to shape prioritization and resourcing for implementation. Additionally, to measure existing capabilities to address the threats, in 2018, the Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM)13 assessment was undertaken, and the results indicated that Belize, since it was last applied in 2016, was still between a start-up and a formative level of maturity in regards to cybersecurity along the five dimensions of capacities that were assessed. Thus, indicating the need for the development of this comprehensive framework. Table 1 18 National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 CURRENT STATUS OF CYBERSECURITY: AN OVERVIEW With the ever increasing growth in connectivity, the dependence on Internet-based platforms has grown simultaneously, along with increased exposure to cyber related crimes. Despite the development and deployment of sophisticated cyber security solutions, patches, and updates, there has been a continuous increase in the number of cyber-attacks globally. For example, in 2018, a series of attacks from a group called ‘Magecart’ took place. This group was responsible for publicized breaches, including Ticketmaster and Feedify. With this, in addition to the recent spate of ransomware attacks on other targets such as FedEx, San Francisco’s light-rail network, and Britain’s National Health Service, it is clear that the frequency and complexity of attacks have increased. An undeniable fact, is that many nations and organizations are struggling to keep pace with cybercriminal activities. The costs of cybercrime have been estimated to have quadrupled since 2015, reaching $2.1 trillion by the end of 2019 and outpacing spending on cybersecurity by over 16 times14. Gartner forecasts that industry spend in 2018 will reach $93 billion, as traditional security measures such as firewalls and anti-virus software prove to be inadequate15. Cybersecurity has now become an increasing part of the national dialogue in Belize, with discussions to address this issue being staged among different sectors of the country. Over the past few years, several government agencies have also been working in order to address cybersecurity. Since 2014, the Ministry of National Security has been working on coordinating this at the national level and had organized a Cybersecurity Ad Hoc Committee, made up of multiple stakeholders, including academia and the private sector, to work together on building awareness about cybersecurity and cybercrime in Belize. Since then an inter-institutional cybersecurity task force, led by the PUC, NSCS, CITO and comprising a cross section of national stakeholders (both public and private sector, academia and civil society groups) was established in 2018 and was instrumental to the development of this Strategy. 19National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 The Police Information Technology and Cyber Unit (PITCU) of Belize Police Department (BPD) manages the investigations of cyber-related crimes, as well as those felonies that involve electronic evidence. The PITCU has investigated cases of phishing, credit card and ATM fraud, as well as other crimes that involve electronic evidence, including drug trafficking. The PITCU have also reported that they have received reports of cyberbullying, revenge porn and identity theft. In terms of some international collaboration to counter cybercriminal activities, the PITCU holds a partnership with the Internet Watch Foundation in order to report cases of child pornography16. Below is a summary of cybercrimes recorded over the last five years. * For example cellphones, computers, note books, theft, damage, virus etc. ** For example, social engineering, phishing, texts, emails, etc. Cybercrime CyberCrimes 2013 to 2018 % per annum Crimes targeting technology, etc.* Crimes committed through technology** Growth Year Incidents Incidents Total # Incidents 2013 521 80 601 2014 663 116 779 29.62% 2015 713 166 879 12.84% 2016 818 145 963 9.56% 2017 773 118 891 -7.48% 2018 768 136 904 1.46% Figure 4 - Growth of Cybercrime - 5 year period Table 2 2020 2015 2010 2005 1995 1990 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 0 CyberCrimes 2013 to 2018 20 National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 Given that there is no comprehensive criminal legislation that strictly address cybercrime, the prosecution of these crimes have been difficult. Currently, Belize has several legislations that relate to cybercrime18: the Telecommunications Act-CAP. 229 and 229S19, the Electronic Evidence Act-CAP. 95:0120, the Electronic Transactions Act-CAP. 29:0121, the Intellectual Property Act, the Interception of Communications Act CAP. 229:0122 and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act- CAP. 103:0123. With this legislative gap, there is a great need for the development of a comprehensive cybercrime bill that is tailored to the reality of Belize. Cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure are a reality. These threats goes well beyond the risk of an information breach or an unavailable information system, but potentially impacts the lives of our citizens should critical infrastructure be impacted. There is a need to begin the dialogue among key stakeholders, which may include but not limited to ministries and other entities with responsibility for energy, food security, banking and finance, communication, transportation, health and security. For instance, the protection of our democracy as a nation is paramount and in this digital age, the digital assets supporting our democratic processes could be considered a critical infrastructure, given the destabilizing impact on society that could occur if they are rendered inoperable or unreliable. This is critical as Latin American and Caribbean region is not insusceptible to cyber-attacks. In 2015, the OAS and Trend Micro released a report24 which highlighted the reality regarding attacks that negatively impact the critical infrastructure of the region. According to the Report, 44 percent of respondents reported being aware of different types of destructive attacks, while 40 percent said they had experienced attempts to shutdown cybernetic systems. In 2018, an updated report25 was released in collaboration with Microsoft, which indicated that 69 percent of respondents indicated they have noticed an increase in the number of attacks to their computer systems and/ or networks over the last 12 months, and 57 percent of the respondents indicated they did not have a dedicated budget for cybersecurity measures, even though in 59 percent of those respondents with a dedicated budget, indicated that their budgets have increased within the last year. This kind of data emphasizes the need to ensure that Critical Infrastructure is addressed directly because of the risk if left unattended. As recent as August 2018, it was reported that there were phishing scams targeting the Belizean Public17. Given the prevalence of theft of mobile devices in Belize, PITCU has been paying close attention because many cyber-related crimes are being executed through stolen devices. Legislative Framework Critical Infrastructure 21National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 PRIORITY AREAS Taking into account the state of cybersecurity readiness of Belize and the developmental goals for the coming years, this Strategy has identified three areas of priority which will be focused on for the next four years. The aim of these priority areas is to build the capacity of Belize to better address cybersecurity threats. Each area identified will include specific activities that address gaps such as the capability to identify and respond to cyber incidents. The other aim is to increase the overall awareness of not only government personnel on threats and tools needed to counter them but the general citizenry. Additionally, recognizing the need to have a comprehensive legislative framework in place, the Strategy outlines critical steps that can be taken to better enable the legislative posture of Belize to address cybercrime as a security risk. National Cybersecurity Strategy Multi-stakeholder Partnership Legal Framework (development of legislation and human resources to detect, investigate and prosecute) Develop a national capacity for incident response and critical information infrastructure protection (establishment of National Incident Reponse capabilities and sectoral CIRTs) Workforce Development, Education and awareness in cybersecurity (development of courses relevant to digital economy and society awareness of threats) The following diagram summarizes the areas identified as priority for the Strategy. 22 National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 IMPLEMENTATION Effective implementation can only be achieved if a governance and monitoring process that takes into account all stakeholders, their competencies and contributions is implemented. This collaboration between and sense of ownership by stakeholders, can take into account all the various areas that impact the successful implementation of the Strategy, this includes sourcing technical capability, budget, talent recruitment, international cooperation. Collaboration and information sharing should be mutually beneficial for all and take into account the objectives the Strategy is aiming to achieve. The diagram below outlines all the various factors that should be taken into account for the implementation and monitoring of the Strategy. Technical Capability Risk-Based Budget Allocation International Assistance National Coordination and Cooperation Human Resources SMART objectives Figure 5 - Inter-related considerations for implementing a NCS 23National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 The incredibly complex challenges inherent to cybersecurity require a whole- of-nation approach guided by multiple agencies, partners and stakeholders . A Governance structure, therefore, is needed for the identification of roles and responsibilities and overall responsibility for the implementation of the areas of priorities identified in this document, as well as related national cybersecurity initiatives. This Strategy recognizes the need to take into account existing governance frameworks, for example, in relation to the areas identified that may require legislative changes, the responsible institutional actors will prepare and submit accordingly (i.e. the Office of the Attorney General and Office of the Solicitor General respectively). It is essential in this regard to consider who will manage inter-institutional relationships, act as a national and international point of contact, communicate and provide an advisory role in general regulations, follow-up and evaluation of measures. As such this Strategy recommends, that a National Cybersecurity Coordinator, under the auspices of the Ministry of National Security be appointed for the coordination of the implementation of actions identified in this Strategy. As a consultative body, the Inter-institutional Cybersecurity Task Force that was established for the development of the Strategy, should also be called upon on a periodic basis to provide advice on the areas of priorities identified in relation to their primary areas of responsibilities. Finally, metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the objectives and activities articulated in this Strategy are needed and as such an evaluation of the Strategy will be undertaken eighteen (18) months after its approval. Governance Structure Evaluation and Review 24 National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 The realization of the strategic vision of this Strategy will be based on the strategic objectives below. These objectives and activities have been developed by identifying the most important focal points and articulating a timeline within which they should be completed, broken down as follows: • Short-Term: 6 months • Medium-Term: 1 year • Long-Term: 2 years Area of Priority 1: Develop the National Legal Framework to adequately address cybersecurity threats This component contemplates the review of the existing legal framework that impacts cybersecurity initiatives including legislation related to digital evidence, data protection, etc., with the goal of providing procedural tools for investigators and prosecutors of digital related crimes. Additionally, this priority recognizes the need to provide tools to end-users. Based on the interaction of all relevant stakeholders, minimum security standards must be defined to ensure effective prevention and to achieve a common understanding of current requirements.

Therefore, they need to be informed about the severe consequences that may arise from just one mistake. Additionally, the cybersecurity workforce is a diverse group of practitioners who govern, design, defend, analyze, administer, operate, and maintain the data, systems, and networks, therefore building a pool of talent in Belize, will serve to benefit the country as technology advances. This component seeks to raise the level of national awareness as well, on key cybersecurity issues and focuses on specific messaging for targeted audiences. The importance of security awareness training in government cannot be overemphasized. Just as awareness training in the health sector can help improve the standard of living and avoid certain diseases, so security awareness mitigate consequences of cyber incidents. By promoting an awareness of digital rights, recognizing that this issue, if treated as a human right is a concern for everyone, efforts will be made to build campaigns to help the public understand that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. 30 National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 Objectives: Mapping of key stakeholders developed and targeted awareness campaigns implemented Activities: 2.1 Undertake consultation with all relevant stakeholders including NGOs, educational institutions, etc. to determine needs of the various target groups for cybersecurity awareness (e.g. indigenous communities, parents, teachers, vulnerable groups, women, etc.) 2.2 Map various initiatives that exists that can be utilized for incorporating or delivering Cybersecurity awareness messaging 2.3 Implement awareness campaigns at the District and Village level taking into account cooperation with town councils, village councils and community councils.availability of the reporting tool Coordinating Institutions: Lead: Ministry with responsibility for Education and Technology Partners: Belize Network of Non-Government Oraganizaitons, AdamsCon, Ministry with responsibility for Education, Ministry with responsibility for National Security Timeline: Medium Term Objectives: The general public is sensitized, educated and empowered on relevant cybersecurity topics Activities: 3.1 Prepare a Cyber Security Communication Strategy, with a view to improve communication to stakehold-ers on cyber threats and available tools. 3.2 Develop television ads, jingles and news clips on key cybersecurity messages (Phishing, Grooming, sextortion, Cyberbullying, Privacy, sexting) 3.3 Issue public facing messages through mediums such as text blasts, with key cybersecurity messages 3.4 Organize competitions among youth, in areas such as visual art, digital, written focused on cybersecurity 3.5 Adopt international cybersecurity awareness mes-saging services such as Get Safe Online website or STOPTHINKCONNECT 3.6 Collaborate with Internet service providers, such as, Digi and Speednet at Expos for distribution of printed cyber awareness information and train-the- trainer initiatives focused on messaging developed. 3.7 Put out information on Large LED TVS and Bill- boards with Cyber Awareness info and catchy lines such as #beInternet awesome Coordinating Institutions: Lead: Ministry with responsibility for Education and Technology Partners: ADAMScon Speednet Ministry with responsibility for Education, Ministry with responsibility for National Security Digi, Speed net and CITO Timeline: Short Term Short Term Short Term Medium Term Short Term Long Term 2 3 31National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 Objectives: Youth educated on cybersecurity threats and tips to stay safe online Activities: 4.1 National campaign that goes from the bottom up: include different languages target youths and issues facing them 4.2 Include cyber component to existing forums (e.g. ICT for girls) Coordinating Institutions: Lead: Ministry with responsibility for Education Partners: Local universities High Schools NGOs PUC Timeline: Medium Term Short-Medium Term Objectives: International Cooperation and new partnerships established Activities: 5.1 Develop a survey on level of awareness nationally to develop a baseline of the target group 5.2 Develop survey to measure the impact of the various awareness campaigns Coordinating Institutions: Lead: NSCS Partners: Ministry with responsibility for Education Timeline: Long term 4 5 32 National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 ANNEX 2 In that regard the Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM)26 was implemented in 2016 and again in 2018 for Belize. The assessment tool is used to measure the level of maturity of a nation in regards to cybersecurity across five different dimensions (see sidebar “Dimensions of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model”.) Each dimension provides several indicators of cyber capacity (an average of 10 indicators per dimension) in order for a nation to understand the stage of maturity in each specific consideration. These indicators are measured across five levels of maturity: Start-up, Formative, Established, Strategic and Dynamic. The stages of maturity vary from an initial stage of maturity where a nation may have just begun to consider cybersecurity, through to a dynamic stage where a nation is able to quickly adapt to changes in the cybersecurity landscape, by balancing threat, vulnerability, risk, economic strategy or changing international needs, while at the same time improving its posture and readiness to face new threats. Dimensions of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy Identifying whether countries have comprehensive national cybersecurity policies that identify stakeholders’ roles, responsibilities in order to ensure a coordinate and cohesive cybersecurity framework including their cyber defense outlook. Cyber Culture and Society Understanding the different mind-sets in terms of cybersecurity (government, private sector and society), identifying national cybersecurity awareness campaigns and privacy policies, as well as how is the level of trust in the use of online services (e-government and e-commerce). Cybersecurity Education, Training, and Skills Identifying the availability of training and education in cybersecurity and the availability of skilled labor force in this field. Legal and Regulatory Frameworks Legislation related to information and communications technologies (ICT), privacy, human rights, data protection, as well as substantive and procedural cybercrime law. Standards, Organizations and Technologies The adoption of standards, the presence of incident response teams and command and control centers, national infrastructure resilience, critical national infrastructure protection, crisis management, cybersecurity insurance, and digital redundancy.

Cybersecurity risks1 in this regard, should therefore  be analyzed within a broader context that also encompasses legal, economic and social factors,  contributing to a better management of cybersecurity threats and decision-making.  Technology  is changing exponentially every day, and the threats surrounding these technologies are becoming  increasingly sophisticated. As our connectivity and dependence on Internet-based platforms and  services increase, so do our vulnerabilities and exposure to cyber threats. While this growth has  brought numerous opportunities for many nations, cyber threats have equally evolved in recent  years.  This reality, therefore, requires the development of public policies that seek to ensure an  open and safe Internet for all.  Developed through a multi-stakeholder approach, through the establishment of an Inter-institutional  Cybersecurity Task Force, the National Cybersecurity Strategy of Belize seeks to establish a vision  to enhance the cybersecurity posture of Belize.  Considering existing national plans and the level  of connectivity of the nation, a tiered approach was used to develop concrete and measurable  actions that can be taken to advance the capability of the nation to address cyber threats. As such,  in the development of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, the level of connectivity to the Internet,  as well as, the volume of cybercrimes that are committed in Belize were considered. These variables  were also used to determine the scope of the problem, existing cybersecurity gaps, capacities and  opportunities for public-private synergies in Belize.  In terms of connectivity, there has been a steady growth in the level of Internet penetration and  connectivity .2 The more connected people become the more avenues are open for cyberattacks.   As  of 2018, the Internet penetration rate of Belize was recorded as being over 50% of the population, an  increase of over 40% since 2000. With respect to cybercrime, the Police Information Technology and  Cyber Unit (PITCU) the Belize Police Department (BPD) manages the investigations of cyber-related  crimes, as well as, those felonies that involve electronic evidence. The PITCU has investigated cases  of phishing, credit card and ATM fraud, as well as, other crimes that involve electronic evidence,  including drug trafficking. They have also received reports of cyberbullying, revenge porn and  identity theft. The PITCU holds a partnership with the Internet Watch Foundation, which facilitates  the international reporting  and investigation of cases of child pornography3.     8 National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023  Acknowledging the evolving dynamics of the cybersecurity landscape in Belize, the strategy  addresses three priorities pillars and includes actionable objectives to be realized over a period of  three (3) years:  It is essential to consider who or what entity will manage the inter-institutional relationships of  Belize’s cybersecurity landscape, act as a national and international point of contact to facilitate  cooperation, provide an advisory role in the development of programmatic interventions, and  perhaps most importantly, coordinate the execution, evaluation and reporting of the strategy’s  action plan. As such, this Strategy recommends, that a National Cybersecurity Coordinator,  under the auspices of the Ministry of National Security be appointed for the coordination of the  implementation of actions identified in this Strategy.  Finally, the Strategy recognizes the need to undertake a review of its achievements within eighteen  (18) months of its approval.   Figure 1-Areas of Priority  Develop a National Legal Framework to  address Cybersecurity Threats  Implement measures to support Education, Awareness and Workforce Policy Development in Cybersecurity   Develop Capacity for  Incident Response  and Critical  Infrastructure Protection  Areas of Priorities    9National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023  FOREWORD  lt is without a doubt that the fourth industrial revolution is here. In the words of Professor Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum:  \"This Fourth Industrial Revolution is, however, fundamentally different. lt is characterised by a range  of new technologies that are fusing the physical, digital and biological worlds, impacting all disciplines,  economies and industries, and even challenging ideas about what it means to be human. The resulting  shifts and disruptions mean that we live in a time of great promise and great peril.\"  The Internet as a shared global resource encapsulates unimaginable possibilities. As we seek to  improve the standard of living of our people, we must harness the potential of this tool to capitalize  on the opportunities in the digital economy. However, this cannot be pursued in a vacuum, as  securing our engagement online from the onset is a critical first step in ensuring we retain value in  whatever digital investments are made.  Why would I say this? Cyberspace has also become the fifth domain, along with air, sea, land and space, requiring defence. With the increased frequency and sophistication of malicious cyber  activities, as a developing nation we cannot afford to be complacent. In today’s digital age, everyone  should care about cybersecurity. With the advancement in mobile technology for example, many  Belizeans are engaged online.   Personal information on social media sites such as phone number,  email address, home address, and credit/debit card numbers and other information like photos  and opinions, etc. are being shared. Aside from social media sites, people share their details for  business reasons, and many have no idea how their information would be used. Further, another  challenge in this area is the global shortage of cybersecurity experts, and Belize is no exception.  With the above in mind, the strategic lines of action articulated in this document demonstrate, among other things, two main concepts:  1. We as a Government recognize our cybersecurity gaps and challenges BUT at the same time, we recognize that everything cannot be all fixed with a stroke of a pen and the  articulation of this document, therefore, we have identified three (3) key priority areas to  start our journey of building resiliency and protecting the Belizean people.     10 National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023  2. We also recognize that ‘no man is an island’ and this must be a national effort. Relying  on, while cultivating our own homegrown talent, we will face this challenge recognizing the need to institutionalize processes that will improve our overall cyber hygiene.  I must conclude by stating that this National Cybersecurity Strategy demonstrates a commitment to strengthening Belize’s capabilities and national coordination to mitigate the impact of cyber  threats. lt also recognizes the importance of having a strategic vision to address Cybersecurity.  I implore all Belizeans to embrace this new digital era with a consciousness that the protection  of the Internet is a shared resource. On behalf of the Government and people of Belize, I take this  opportunity to thank everyone that was engaged in the development process and contributed their  time, knowledge and talent to make this national cybersecurity framework possible.  Hon. Michael Peyrefitte Minister of National Security     11National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023  GLOSSARY OF TERMS Critical infrastructure: Includes those sectors  whose assets, systems, and networks, whether  physical or virtual, are considered so vital  that their incapacitation or destruction would  have a debilitating effect on security, national  economic security, national public health or  safety, or any combination thereof.  Digital Assets: Is content that is stored digitally  and has value.  Cyber Education: Includes technical and non- technical content at all levels to provide the  knowledge and skills necessary to perform  cybersecurity functions   Cyber Awareness: Involves providing  information about existing threats and takes  into account knowledge combined with  attitudes and behaviors that serve to protect  digital assets and citizens online.  Cybersecurity: Takes into account the  continuous and planned activities at the  political, legal, economic, educational,  awareness raising and technical levels to  manage risks in cyberspace to ensure the  ensure the confidentiality, integrity and  availability of digital assets  Cybercrime: Is a crime that either uses services  or applications in cyberspace are to carry out  a crime or are themselves the targets of crime  Cyber Incidents: An event or activity that is  observable occurrence in a system and/or  network that usually indicates some form of  interference from an unauthorized source.   Cyber Attack: Is a malicious and deliberate  attempt by an individual or organization to  breach the information system of another  individual or organization4.   Electronic Evidence: Is the information and  data of investigative value that is stored on or  transmitted by an electronic device.  Cyber bullying: Is harassment carried out on  the Internet, via social networks, video game  chat, or instant messaging. This can include  direct verbal or emotional abuse, exclusion from  social groups, or spreading gossip and rumors,  making public content that was intended  to be private, embarrassing the victim by  impersonating them on social media, Posting  embarassing pictures, revenge porn.  Identity theft: is the use of someone’s personal  information without permission for financial  gain.

Phishing: is the use of emails that appear  to originate from a trusted source, in order to  trick a user into entering valid credentials at a  fake website. Typically the email and the web  site looks like they are part of a bank the user is  doing business with.  Revenge porn: is a form of cyber bullying where  nude or sexual photos or videos of someone  are publically posted. Often, sexual images  exchanged during a relationship are posted by  an angry ex when the relationship ends. Other  times, accounts of celebrities are hacked and  sexual images found there are posted. In a recent  case, revenge porn was combined with politics,  when the ex of a female politician gave sexual  images to the organization of a political rival. The  images were published, causing her to resign,  which allowed the rival to run in the election to  take her place. Another name for revenge porn  is Non-Consensual Pornography (NCP).  For the purposes of this document:     12 National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023  STRATEGIC VISION  PRINCIPLES  Recognizing the benefits that technologies in this new digital age can bring, the people of Belize  will work together to create a safe and trusted digital environment that will promote economic  growth and social inclusion for all.  A comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity is paramount to keep pace with emerging  technologies and more sophisticated threats.  Cybersecurity capacity should not only include the  protection of networks and systems, but also take into account the people that rely more and more  on Internet-enabled devices to conduct basic tasks. In that regard the following principles have  guided the development of the Strategy and will further guide its implementation.   Respect for and the promotion of fundamental rights  Government Led    This Strategy recognizes that human rights apply online, as well as offline, and that cybersecurity  and human rights are mutually reinforcing. Thus this Strategy protects and promotes fundamental  rights and freedoms such as the right to privacy, freedom of expression, freedom of association,  freedom of assembly among others, in addition to being in line with Part II of the Constitution of  Belize and the international instruments to which Belize is party to.  Recognizing that the Government is one of the largest consumers of information technology  services, it commits to driving the objectives of this Strategy by adopting best practices in its  operations and lead by example in the implementation of the Strategy’s objectives.

The need for comprehensive stakeholder cooperation has never been greater than it is today.  This Strategy focuses on the need to leverage international partnerships to investigate criminal  activities, build capacity and protect Belize’s cyberspace.  Recognizing the importance of innovation and business development to our national economy, a  cyber-environment that is safe and conducive to such development will be fostered.  With the understanding of the importance of Critical Infrastructure to the welfare of Belize,  the Strategy seeks to mitigate cybersecurity risks to acceptable levels by encouraging the  combination of cost benefit, acceptable risk and other qualitative and quantitative approaches  with the desired end result of the protection of Belizean people and economy.  Cybersecurity affects everyone and as a result it is a shared responsibility for all to exercise  cybersecurity best practices. Targeted awareness raising initiatives will be implemented through  the mobilization and partnership with civil society, academia and other interest groups across  Belize, to enable and empower end-users to keep themselves and their organizations safer online.     14 National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023  INTRODUCTION  This Strategy was developed in collaboration with the Government and stakeholders, to address  cybersecurity threats facing Belize, so as to provide guidance on key actions to be taken to improve  Belize’s overall preparedness and responsiveness to these threats. This Strategy outlines the  principles and long-term goals that will form the basis and overall direction for the planning and  development of the national cybersecurity posture, including a plan of action outlining various  roles and responsibilities for implementation.   Cybersecurity impacts many actors such as, policy-makers, private sector, law enforcement,  academia, and civil society, therefore a multi-stakeholder approach was used in the development  of this Strategy.  Cybersecurity risks5 in this regard, should therefore be analyzed within a  broader context that also encompasses legal, economic and social factors, contributing to a  better management of cybersecurity threats and decision-making.  Technology is changing  exponentially every day, and the threats surrounding these technologies are becoming  increasingly sophisticated. Our growing connectivity and dependence on Internet-based  platforms and services has significantly increased our exposure to cyber threats. While this growth  has brought numerous opportunities for many nations, cyber threats have equally evolved in  recent years.  This therefore, requires the development of public policies that seek to ensure an  open and safe Internet for all.  In order to mitigate the impact of these threats, a structural change  around cybersecurity is imperative. However, this structural change is only possible with national  coordination and international cooperation, as well as with the active participation of different  actors of society working in tandem. Globally, there is no one fix for these ever-evolving cyber  threats, and governments recognize the need for collaboration and cooperation among states,  as well as all national cyber actors including the private sector, NGOs, academia, and citizens as  a part of the solution. To compound these issues, the trans-border nature of the Internet requires  strategic thinking, not only in how we adopt technological solutions for the creation of more  efficient services, but also in how we protect them.      15National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023  National Context  Horizon 2030: The National Development Framework for Belize  Similarly, the implementation of cybersecurity measures takes into account many other aspects  of a nation’s economic and developmental goals and plans.  Therefore, in the development of the  Strategy, there was a recognition that cybersecurity considerations cannot be taken in isolation but  must be considered in the wider context of other policy decisions and national initiatives such as the  National Sustainable Tourism Master Plan 20306, the National Growth and Sustainable Development  Strategy 2016-20197, among others.  The graphic below illustrates some of considerations and  policies that were taken into account during the development of this Strategy:   The Horizon 20308 vision, goals and strategies arose out of an analysis of the current socio- economic situation of Belize, informed by a broad consultation process and review of existing  technical and policy studies. The framework included specific vision statements from  stakeholders including ‘Belizeans are capable of using state of the art technology which they  incorporate into productive enterprise[s].’ Listed among five important cross cutting issues  was a need to invest in education and a review of the education system to assess its strength  and weaknesses and the development of a long term investment plan.  This review, as stated  in Horizon 2030, would define the human resources that are critical to closing the resource  gaps identified. This approach is critical especially in the field of cybersecurity as it has been  reported in several fora that there is a global cybersecurity skills gap, of which Belize is no  exception.  The gap in Cybersecurity jobs are expected to reach 1.8 million by 2022, up 20%  from 1.5 million in 2015, according to the Center for Cyber Safety and Education9.   National Policies (National Security and  Defence Strategy, Growth and  Sustainable Development Strategy)  Relevant Stakeholders (Government, Private Sector, Civil Society, Executive Branch, Academia)  Legislative Framework  (Mutual Legal Assistance, Cybercrime, Intellectual Property Rights)  Critical [Information] Infrastructure Protection  National Coordination (Inter-governmental information sharing,  national Incident response capability)  Cybersecurity  Figure 2 - Cybersecurity     16 National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023  The vision of the NSDS is for a Belize “of peace and tranquility, where citizens live in harmony with  the natural environment and enjoy a high quality of life. Belizeans are an energetic, resourceful  and independent people looking after their own development in a sustainable way”. Having  established itself on three main pillars, namely: 1. Maintain the Sovereignty and Territorial  Integrity of Belize; 2. Reduce Local and Transnational Crimes; 3. Provide the necessary  environment for a prosperous and stable Belize, the NSDS encompasses all factors identified  to be essential to the security, stability and prosperity of Belize and the protection of the  geopolitical space of Belize as defined by the Belize Constitution. As a part of the strategic  objectives the NSDS states that as an effort to reduce such occurrences and the resulting  harm to Belize’s sustainable development aspirations, there will be a provision of basic  equipment and capacity to effectively manage and control Belize’s land, sea, air, and cyber  space (emphasis added). As a nation we recognize cyberspace as a territory for protection.  The NSDS further states that ‘in order to build public consensus, multilateral cooperation,  and public-private partnerships to defeat transnational organized crime and local gangs,  we aim to build new partnerships with industry, private sector, academia, civil society and  non-governmental organizations to combat these networks that operate in the illicit and  licit worlds...[as well as] ..further international norms against tolerating or sponsoring crime  in all its forms, including in cyberspace especially as it relates to prostitution and sexual  abuse’(emphasis added). This is position is not a unique approach as many nations have  recognized cyberspace as the fifth domain, and as a nation we will continue to extend our  resources to protecting the all the borders of Belize, which is among the reasons for the  development of strategic approach to cybersecurity efforts.  National Security and Defence Strategy 2017-202010  Flowing from Horizon 2030, the GSDS is a strategic plan that places sustainable development  as a priority while striving to bring economic, social and environmental policies into balance.  The GSDS is based on the principles of sustainable development, and on three notable  drivers that are common to successful developing countries: a proactive role for the state,  tapping into global markets, and innovative social policy11. Among the Critical Success  Factors for the GSDS, they identified CSF1, “Optimal National Income and Investment,” and  included as an action to ‘Build institutional capacity to encourage technological adaptation  and innovation while also taking into account climate change resilience considerations’.  This line of action encourages the adoption of technology to improve efficiency, productivity  and competitiveness. As stated in the GSDS, Capacity development processes will target  the technical skills needed to facilitate government’s efforts to encourage innovation and  imitation. Notably, while technology will continue to revolutionize the way we do business,  broader and wider-spread use of technology will also bring its vulnerabilities. Therefore the  National Cybersecurity Strategy is designed to guide our nation to think of cybersecurity as  an automatic consideration for any investment that involves technology.  Belize’s Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy (GSDS) 2016-2019     17National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023  It is imperative when designing a strategy at the national level that an assessment is undertaken  to ensure, not only that the right areas of focus are identified, but also to determine what is being  done well and where the deficiencies lie. As such, in the development of the National Cybersecurity  Strategy, the level of connectivity to the Internet was consider to determine the scope of the problem,  cybersecurity capacities that exists was measured and finally, the volume of cybercrimes that are  committed in Belize was taken into account.  In terms of connectivity, there has been a steady growth in the level of Internet penetration and  connectivity12. The more connected people become the more avenues that open for opportunities  for cyberattacks. As of 2018, the Internet penetration rate of Belize was recorded as being over 50%  of the population, an increase of over 40% since 2000 (See Table).  Baseline Assessment  Year Population Users % Penetration  2000 245,800 15,000 6.10% 2005 291,904 35,000 12.00% 2008 301,270 32,000 10.60% 2012 327,719 74,700 22.80% 2013 340,844 108,048 31.70% 2018 382,444 200,020 52.30%  Source: World Bank and ITU   The primary goal of information such as this is to implement measures to reduce risk. Ensuring an  understanding of ‘what is at risk’ helps to shape prioritization and resourcing for implementation.  Additionally, to measure existing capabilities to address the threats, in 2018, the Cybersecurity  Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM)13 assessment was undertaken, and the results  indicated that Belize, since it was last applied in 2016, was still between a start-up and a formative  level of maturity in regards to cybersecurity along the five dimensions of capacities that were  assessed.   Thus, indicating the need for the development of this comprehensive framework.  Table 1     18 National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023  CURRENT STATUS  OF CYBERSECURITY:  AN OVERVIEW  With the ever increasing growth in connectivity, the dependence on Internet-based platforms  has grown simultaneously, along with increased exposure to cyber related crimes.  Despite the  development and deployment of sophisticated cyber security solutions, patches, and updates,  there has been a continuous increase in the number of cyber-attacks globally. For example, in  2018, a series of attacks from a group called ‘Magecart’ took place. This group was responsible  for publicized breaches, including Ticketmaster and Feedify. With this, in addition to the recent  spate of ransomware attacks on other targets such as FedEx, San Francisco’s light-rail network,  and Britain’s National Health Service, it is clear that the frequency and complexity of attacks  have increased.   An undeniable fact, is that many nations and organizations are struggling to keep pace with  cybercriminal activities.  The costs of cybercrime have been estimated to have quadrupled since  2015, reaching $2.1 trillion by the end of 2019 and outpacing spending on cybersecurity by over 16  times14. Gartner forecasts that industry spend in 2018 will reach $93 billion, as traditional security  measures such as firewalls and anti-virus software prove to be inadequate15.  Cybersecurity has now become an increasing part of the national dialogue in Belize, with discussions  to address this issue being staged among different sectors of the country. Over the past few years,  several government agencies have also been working in order to address cybersecurity. Since 2014,  the Ministry of National Security has been working on coordinating this at the national level and  had organized a Cybersecurity Ad Hoc Committee, made up of multiple stakeholders, including  academia and the private sector, to work together on building awareness about cybersecurity  and cybercrime in Belize. Since then an inter-institutional cybersecurity task force, led by the PUC,  NSCS, CITO and comprising a cross section of national stakeholders (both public and private  sector, academia and civil society groups) was established in 2018 and was instrumental to the  development of this Strategy.     19National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023  The Police Information Technology and Cyber Unit (PITCU) of Belize Police Department (BPD)  manages the investigations of cyber-related crimes, as well as those felonies that involve electronic  evidence. The PITCU has investigated cases of phishing, credit card and ATM fraud, as well as other  crimes that involve electronic evidence, including drug trafficking. The PITCU have also reported  that they have received reports of cyberbullying, revenge porn and identity theft.  In terms of some  international collaboration to counter cybercriminal activities, the PITCU holds a partnership with  the Internet Watch Foundation in order to report cases of child pornography16. Below is a summary  of cybercrimes recorded over the last five years.  * For example cellphones, computers, note books, theft, damage, virus etc. ** For example, social engineering, phishing, texts, emails, etc.  Cybercrime  CyberCrimes 2013 to 2018 % per  annum  Crimes targeting  technology, etc.*  Crimes committed  through   technology** Growth  Year Incidents Incidents Total #  Incidents  2013 521 80 601   2014 663 116 779 29.62% 2015 713 166 879 12.84% 2016 818 145 963 9.56%  2017 773 118 891 -7.48%  2018 768 136 904 1.46%  Figure 4 - Growth of Cybercrime - 5 year period  Table 2  2020  2015  2010  2005  1995  1990  2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 0  CyberCrimes 2013 to 2018     20 National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023  Given that there is no comprehensive criminal legislation that strictly address cybercrime, the  prosecution of these crimes have been difficult. Currently, Belize has several legislations that relate  to cybercrime18: the Telecommunications Act-CAP. 229 and 229S19, the Electronic Evidence Act-CAP.  95:0120, the Electronic Transactions Act-CAP. 29:0121, the Intellectual Property Act, the Interception of  Communications Act CAP. 229:0122 and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act- CAP.  103:0123. With this legislative gap, there is a great need for the development of a comprehensive  cybercrime bill that is tailored to the reality of Belize.   Cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure are a reality. These threats goes well beyond the risk  of an information breach or an unavailable information system, but potentially impacts the lives  of our citizens should critical infrastructure be impacted. There is a need to begin the dialogue  among key stakeholders, which may include but not limited to ministries and other entities with  responsibility for energy, food security, banking and finance, communication, transportation,  health and security.  For instance, the protection of our democracy as a nation is paramount and  in this digital age, the digital assets supporting our democratic processes could be considered  a critical infrastructure, given the destabilizing impact on society that could occur if they are  rendered inoperable or unreliable.   This is critical as Latin American and Caribbean region is not insusceptible to cyber-attacks.  In  2015, the OAS and Trend Micro released a report24 which highlighted the reality regarding attacks  that negatively impact the critical infrastructure of the region.   According to the Report, 44 percent  of respondents reported being aware of different types of destructive attacks, while 40 percent  said they had experienced attempts to shutdown cybernetic systems. In 2018, an updated report25   was released in collaboration with Microsoft, which indicated that 69 percent of respondents  indicated they have noticed an increase in the number of attacks to their computer systems and/ or networks over the last 12 months, and 57 percent of the respondents indicated they did not have  a dedicated budget for cybersecurity measures, even though in 59 percent of those respondents  with a dedicated budget, indicated that their budgets have increased within the last year.  This kind  of data emphasizes the need to ensure that Critical Infrastructure is addressed directly because of  the risk if left unattended.  As recent as August 2018, it was reported that there were phishing scams targeting the Belizean  Public17. Given the prevalence of theft of mobile devices in Belize, PITCU has been paying close  attention because many cyber-related crimes are being executed through stolen devices.   Legislative Framework  Critical Infrastructure      21National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023  PRIORITY AREAS  Taking into account the state of cybersecurity readiness of Belize and the developmental goals for  the coming years, this Strategy has identified three areas of priority which will be focused on for the  next four years. The aim of these priority areas is to build the capacity of Belize to better address  cybersecurity threats.  Each area identified will include specific activities that address gaps such  as the capability to identify and respond to cyber incidents. The other aim is to increase the overall  awareness of not only government personnel on threats and tools needed to counter them but  the general citizenry. Additionally, recognizing the need to have a comprehensive legislative  framework in place, the Strategy outlines critical steps that can be taken to better enable the  legislative posture of Belize to address cybercrime as a security risk.  National Cybersecurity  Strategy  Multi-stakeholder Partnership  Legal Framework  (development of   legislation and human  resources to detect,   investigate and  prosecute)  Develop a  national capacity   for incident response  and critical information  infrastructure protection   (establishment of  National Incident   Reponse capabilities  and sectoral   CIRTs)  Workforce  Development,  Education and  awareness in   cybersecurity    (development of courses  relevant to digital   economy and society  awareness of   threats)  The following diagram summarizes the areas identified as priority for the Strategy.     22 National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023  IMPLEMENTATION  Effective implementation can only be achieved if a governance and monitoring process that  takes into account all stakeholders, their competencies and contributions is implemented. This  collaboration between and sense of ownership by stakeholders, can take into account all the  various areas that impact the successful implementation of the Strategy, this includes sourcing  technical capability, budget, talent recruitment, international cooperation. Collaboration and  information sharing should be mutually beneficial for all and take into account the objectives the  Strategy is aiming to achieve.  The diagram below outlines all the various factors that should be  taken into account for the implementation and monitoring of the Strategy.   Technical Capability  Risk-Based  Budget Allocation  International Assistance  National Coordination   and Cooperation  Human  Resources  SMART objectives  Figure 5 - Inter-related considerations for implementing a NCS     23National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023  The incredibly complex challenges inherent to cybersecurity require a whole- of-nation  approach guided by multiple agencies, partners and stakeholders .  A Governance structure,  therefore, is needed for the identification of roles and responsibilities and overall responsibility  for the implementation of the areas of priorities identified in this document, as well as related  national cybersecurity initiatives.  This Strategy recognizes the need to take into account existing  governance frameworks, for example, in relation to the areas identified that may require legislative  changes, the responsible institutional actors will prepare and submit accordingly (i.e. the Office of  the Attorney General and Office of the Solicitor General respectively).  It is essential in this regard to consider who will manage inter-institutional relationships, act as a  national and international point of contact, communicate and provide an advisory role in general  regulations, follow-up and evaluation of measures.  As such this Strategy recommends, that a  National Cybersecurity Coordinator, under the auspices of the Ministry of National Security be  appointed for the coordination of the implementation of actions identified in this Strategy.  As  a consultative body, the Inter-institutional Cybersecurity Task Force that was established for the  development of the Strategy, should also be called upon on a periodic basis to provide advice on  the areas of priorities identified in relation to their primary areas of responsibilities.    Finally, metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the objectives and activities articulated in this  Strategy are needed and as such an evaluation of the Strategy will be undertaken eighteen (18)  months after its approval.  Governance Structure  Evaluation and Review     24 National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023  The realization of the strategic vision of this Strategy will be based on the strategic objectives  below. These objectives and activities have been developed by identifying the most important  focal points and articulating a timeline within which they should be completed, broken down as  follows:  • Short-Term: 6 months • Medium-Term: 1 year • Long-Term: 2 years  Area of Priority 1:  Develop the National Legal Framework to adequately address cybersecurity threats  This component contemplates the review of the existing legal framework that impacts  cybersecurity initiatives including legislation related to digital evidence, data protection, etc.,  with the goal of providing procedural tools for investigators and prosecutors of digital related  crimes.  Additionally, this priority recognizes the need to provide tools to end-users. Based on  the interaction of all relevant stakeholders, minimum security standards must be defined to  ensure effective prevention and to achieve a common understanding of current requirements.

Therefore,  they need to be informed about the severe consequences that may arise from just one mistake.   Additionally, the cybersecurity workforce is a diverse group of practitioners who govern, design,  defend, analyze, administer, operate, and maintain the data, systems, and networks, therefore  building a pool of talent in Belize, will serve to benefit the country as technology advances. This  component seeks to raise the level of national awareness as well, on key cybersecurity issues and  focuses on specific messaging for targeted audiences.  The importance of security awareness  training in government cannot be overemphasized. Just as awareness training in the health sector  can help improve the standard of living and avoid certain diseases, so security awareness mitigate  consequences of cyber incidents.  By promoting an awareness of digital rights, recognizing that this  issue, if treated as a human right is a concern for everyone, efforts will be made to build campaigns  to help the public understand that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility.       30 National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023  Objectives:   Mapping of key stakeholders developed and  targeted awareness campaigns implemented  Activities:  2.1  Undertake consultation with all relevant  stakeholders including NGOs, educational  institutions, etc. to determine needs of the various  target groups for cybersecurity awareness (e.g.  indigenous communities, parents, teachers,  vulnerable groups, women, etc.) 2.2 Map various initiatives that exists that  can be utilized for incorporating or delivering  Cybersecurity awareness messaging 2.3 Implement awareness campaigns at the  District and Village level taking into account  cooperation with town councils, village councils  and community councils.availability of the  reporting tool  Coordinating Institutions:   Lead: Ministry with responsibility for Education and  Technology Partners: Belize Network of  Non-Government Oraganizaitons, AdamsCon, Ministry with responsibility for  Education, Ministry  with responsibility for National Security  Timeline: Medium Term  Objectives:   The general public is sensitized, educated and  empowered on relevant cybersecurity topics  Activities:   3.1 Prepare a Cyber Security Communication  Strategy, with a view to improve communication to  stakehold-ers on cyber threats and available tools. 3.2 Develop television ads, jingles and news clips on  key cybersecurity messages (Phishing, Grooming,  sextortion, Cyberbullying, Privacy, sexting) 3.3 Issue public facing messages through mediums  such as text blasts, with key cybersecurity  messages  3.4 Organize competitions among youth, in areas  such as visual art, digital, written focused on  cybersecurity  3.5 Adopt international cybersecurity awareness  mes-saging services such as Get Safe Online  website or STOPTHINKCONNECT 3.6 Collaborate with Internet service providers, such  as,  Digi and Speednet at Expos for distribution of  printed cyber awareness information and train-the- trainer initiatives focused on messaging developed. 3.7 Put out information on Large LED TVS and Bill- boards with Cyber Awareness info and catchy lines  such as #beInternet awesome   Coordinating Institutions:   Lead: Ministry with responsibility for Education and  Technology     Partners:  ADAMScon Speednet Ministry with responsibility for  Education, Ministry  with responsibility for National Security  Digi, Speed net and  CITO  Timeline: Short Term Short Term Short Term Medium Term Short Term Long Term  2  3    31National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023  Objectives:  Youth educated on cybersecurity threats and tips  to stay safe online  Activities:  4.1 National campaign that goes from the bottom  up: include different languages target youths and  issues facing them 4.2 Include cyber component to existing forums  (e.g. ICT for girls)  Coordinating Institutions:  Lead: Ministry with responsibility for Education Partners: Local universities High Schools NGOs  PUC  Timeline: Medium Term Short-Medium Term  Objectives:  International Cooperation and new partnerships  established  Activities:  5.1 Develop a survey on level of awareness  nationally to develop a baseline of the target  group 5.2 Develop survey to measure the impact of the  various awareness campaigns  Coordinating Institutions:  Lead: NSCS Partners:  Ministry with responsibility for Education  Timeline: Long term  4  5     32 National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023  ANNEX 2  In that regard the Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM)26 was implemented in  2016 and again in 2018 for Belize.  The assessment tool is used to measure the level of maturity of a  nation in regards to cybersecurity across five different dimensions (see sidebar “Dimensions of the  Cybersecurity Maturity Model”.) Each dimension provides several indicators of cyber capacity (an  average of 10 indicators per dimension) in order for a nation to understand the stage of maturity in  each specific consideration. These indicators are measured across five levels of maturity: Start-up,  Formative, Established, Strategic and Dynamic. The stages of maturity vary from an initial stage of  maturity where a nation may have just begun to consider cybersecurity, through to a dynamic stage  where a nation is able to quickly adapt to changes in the cybersecurity landscape, by balancing  threat, vulnerability, risk, economic strategy or changing international needs, while at the same time  improving its posture and readiness to face new threats.   Dimensions of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy Identifying whether countries have comprehensive national  cybersecurity policies that identify stakeholders’ roles, responsibilities in order to ensure a coordinate  and cohesive cybersecurity framework including their cyber defense outlook.  Cyber Culture and Society Understanding the different mind-sets in terms of cybersecurity  (government, private sector and society), identifying national cybersecurity awareness campaigns  and privacy policies, as well as how is the level of trust in the use of online services (e-government and  e-commerce).  Cybersecurity Education, Training, and Skills Identifying the availability of training and education in  cybersecurity and the availability of skilled labor force in this field.  Legal and Regulatory Frameworks Legislation related to information and communications technologies  (ICT), privacy, human rights, data protection, as well as substantive and procedural cybercrime law.  Standards, Organizations and Technologies The adoption of standards, the presence of incident  response teams and command and control centers, national infrastructure resilience, critical national  infrastructure protection, crisis management, cybersecurity insurance, and digital redundancy.

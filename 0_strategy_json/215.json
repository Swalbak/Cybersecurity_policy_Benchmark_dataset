Today, however, we are still counting our first steps towards the digital revolution that will bring profound transformation to the way we work, produce, live, receive services and acquire knowledge. The range and consequences of these expected changes are considered worldwide to be the second most important revolution, following the industrial one that marked the nineteenth century, improving dramatically the life of a significant part of the world population. Establishing a never-existed-before global social context, it has made knowledge accessible for everyone at a low cost, merely that of Internet access. Albania, like Europe and the world, is embracing this digital revolution by creating new opportunities for citizens and business to benefit. In this context, the Government of Albanian has taken a strong commitment towards supporting and promoting digital initiatives as a powerful tool that leads to modernized governance, increased know-how for a society that is more open, and a sustainable economic development for its citizens. Our efforts in this regard intended to foster regional cooperation and are coordinated with the European legal and institutional framework in the process of Albania’s integration into the European Union. Albania has adapted its legal framework on information society to comply with the EU Acquis Communautaire, while being constantly in touch with the dynamic developments of the Digital Single Market. Albania already possesses powerful instruments to develop the digital market and e-services, including full coverage of the population with mobile phones and secure identity cards, as well as a state consolidated and interactive digital infrastructure. Young in age, our population makes intensive use of mobile phones on the basis of a solid 3G-infrastructure, with the 4G service coverage having just started to spread. The secure identity cards provided to the Albanian citizens enable electronic identification and qualified electronic signatures that will help both the public and private sector develop reduced in time and cost-effective, services and processes. Our government systems are interconnected through an up-to-date infrastructure designed with the support of the European Union and other donors, and further 7 boosted also by the Albanian government investments. The Government Data Centre, established in line with international standards, serves local and central institutions. The unique public service portal, on the other hand, is offering a growing number of e-services. We are investing in the digital education, both for equipment and curricula, as well as are encouraging youth initiatives towards innovation through incentivising programs. Technology is the future of world economic development. Our mission is to use it as a tool to ensure good governance and create development opportunities for the next generation. By the Digital Agenda Strategy 2015-2020, we define our vision and will to become a member of the European Union. Finally, while thanking all those who contributed to the development of this document, the donors who support our good-governance initiatives, I would like to invite everyone to work harder together for a successful delivery of the goals set in this document. Dr. MILENA HARITO Minister of Innovation and Public Administration 8 INTRODUCTION Information and Communication Techno- logies (ICT) play a specific role in the deve- lopment of a competitive economy based on knowledge and innovation. This technology allows for a higher life quality for the citi- zens, assists in facilitation and efficiency of business processes, as well as the increase of effectiveness and governance transfor- mation. Development of the ICT sector is considered a horizontal policy since the effects and influence of its implementa- tion is extended on all social and economic sectors of the country. Priorities of ICT on a European level are contained in Europe 20201 - a strategy for a sustainable and comprehensive growth, which aims at the preparation of the EU economy for the challenges of the next dec- ade. The Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE)2, is directly related to the field of Information and Communication Technology. To draw an analogy with the European Union policies and priorities, the develo- pment of ICT and the digital agenda are part of the programme of the Albanian Gove- rnment for 2013-2017. The programme views the ICT and e-services development as closely related to the economic and so- cial development of the country. The gove- rnment programme has determined that the government will work on three main dire- ctions by setting out measurable objectives: - First, in adding and promoting electro- nic services for citizens, businesses and administration. Increase of transpare- ncy and improvement of public admi- nistration services according to the Open Government Partnership initiative will remain a priority. - Second, in using the ICT for the purposes of education in order to transcend the digital gap and to empower the youth. Policies will be oriented toward the improvement and expansion of human capacities in order to increase the nu- mber of consumers and to promote the development of e-service providers. Thus, the creation of youth jobs who can be employed in the Albanian and re- gional market and beyond that, will be encouraged. - Third, in consolidating the digital infra- structure in the whole territory of the Republic of Albania, by strictly respe- cting the European principles of free and honest competition. Currently, the ICT are one of the major mo- ving forces of economy. A quarter of GDP’s growth in the EU comes from the ICT sector. Investments in ICT and innovation until 2020 are expected to contribute in the producti- 1 2 A Digital Agenda for Europe, COM(2010)245, approved on 19.05.2010, EC, DesktopModules/Bring2mind/DMX/Download.aspx?Command=Core_Download&entryID=157&PortalId=0&Ta- bId=353 9 vity growth in the EU at a rate of 45%. In Albania, the electronic communication sector alone as part of ICT contributes in the GDP at a calculated rate of 5-6%. ICT and digitalization processes support modernization as follows: - Economic processes: through the improvement of production capacities based on the ICT, knowledge economy and establishments of start-ups, deve- lopment of innovative and intelligent activities in cities and communities, production growth in agriculture, social enterprises, etc. - Social processes: through the improve- ment of services provided to the co- mmunity and that of the joint goods production, stimulation and facilitation of social innovation, joint establishment and utilization of resources and fina- ncing3, etc. - Institutional and administrative pro- cesses: through the e-government services, digital identity, facilitation of inter-institutional interaction, simplifica- tion of institutional and administrative procedures, delivery of online auxiliary assistance, participation of citizens and businesses in the decision making pro- cess, etc. ICT are seen as a tool that changes the every- day life, transforms the work organization, changes the existing markets by creating new opportunities and businesses, changes participation, cooperation and interaction models with the Public Administration, for an open and transparent governance. In this respect, the objectives are as follows: - stimulation of the digitalization process in a systematic and sustainable manner in every field of life and economy; - establishment of favorable conditions for the fruition of suitable infrastru- ctures, such as, broadband networks, data center, in order to guarantee high security levels for the information networks, integrate and computerize Public Administration and private sector services. ICT and information society developments in Albania were based on the European model, just like the “eEurope”, “i2010” plans, etc. They are also compatible with the regional developments, as well as with the integra- tion perspective of the European Union. The main objective of the Digital Agenda for Europe is the establishment of sustainable economic and social benefits deriving from the development of a single digital market based on the utilization of the fast and ultra fast internet, and of the interacting appli- cations. The Digital Agenda for Europe has identified seven priority dimensions (pillars) closely interrelated to each-other: ► A single digital market; ► Standards and interaction; ► Faith and Security; ► Access to Fast and Ultra Fast Internet; ► Research and Innovation; ► Improvement of Knowledge, Skills and Digital Inclussion; ► ICT benefits for the whole society; In November 2013, the Southeastern Euro- pean countries adopted the Regional Strate- gy for Southeastern Europe, SEE-20204. The objectives for the development of the digital agenda under the chapter of the Digital So- ciety, header “For a Smart Growth” have an important place in this strategic document. Albania’s Digital Agenda for 2015-2020, which is presented in this document, takes into consideration the objectives of the re- gional development specified in the Strategy SEE-2020 and supports the EU Digital Age- nda. After an analysis of the current situation and developments, the document sets out the vision and development objectives for the period 2015-2020, as well as the main directions of policies that will be followed to fulfill these objectives. 3 Known as “crowdsourcing” and “crowdfounding” 4 CH AP TE R I 1 11 The Cross-cutting Strategy for the Informa- tion Society 2008-2013, adopted through Decision No. 59 of the Council of Ministers, dated 21.01.2009, set out the main develo- pment directions and objectives in the field of information society during this period of time. This document replaced the first do- cument of the ICT strategy adopted in 2003, whilst it also ammended the main objectives for the ICT as specified in the document for the National Strategy for Development and Integration 2007-2013. The Cross-cutting Strategy for the Informa- tion Society (ISSIS) was built in five main components. This was based on the ICT co- nditions and information society develo- pment in 2008, where a very low scale of internet, PC in the family and fixed telepho- ny were identified, with the scale of mobile telephony at the level of 70%, a few deve- lopments of the electronic services main- ly related to business, and an incomplete institutional and legal framework for the information society. These components are as follows: ► Development of legal and institutional framework; ► Development of ICT infrastructure and the facilitation of cheap and fast internet; ► Development of e-governance; ► Education related to ICT knowledge; ► Promotion of e-business. ISSIS was also accompanied by an action plan which was reviwed in 2011. The action plan for the period 2011-2013 included activities related to the development of ICT, e-governance and the information society in general. Part of the activities of this plan were fulfilled, whilst the rest of them are still ongoing. A number of activities have to be readdressed and focused toward the frui- tion of the government programme for the consolidated development of the ICT infra- structure, increase of electronic services as well as the increase of utilization of these services by the citizens, business as well as the public administration itself. DEVELOPmENT OF THE LEgAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAmEwORk During the period of 2008-2013, a series of laws were drafted and adopted in compli- ance with the European Union standards. The efforts of the Albanian institutions du- ring this period were focused into the develo- pment of the necessary legal and institutio- nal framework in order to secure an efficient environment for communicating with the business, establishment and maintanance of the advanced electronic communication for the needs of the public administration and electronic governance, legal ammendmends for the management of the spectrum on the CURRENT CONDITIONS 12 basis of the principle of technological neu- trality in order to promote the development of the broadband infrastructure, develo- pment and delivery of electronic services for businesses as well as individuals within the scope of electronic governance. The Albanin legislation in force related to the electronic communications, information so- ciety and press, intends to: - Eliminate the obstacles for the efficient functioning of the internal market in the networks and services of electronic communications; - Promote competition in the internal market; - Protect the consumer, etc. The Stabilization Agreement, in its Articles 102-104, foresees the obligation of appro- ximation of internal legislation with that of the acquis of the EU, as well as the appro- ximation with the EU policies. Also, the SAA requires a special attention in relation to re- specting the rights of intellectual property in programme transmission through the land- line, satelite and cable networks, etc. A number of important laws have been drafted and adopted in line with the SAA engagements, such as: - Law No. 9918, dated 19.05.2008, “On the Electronic Communications in the Republic of Albania”, as ammended by Law No. 102/2012 in compliance with the latest developments of the acquis of the EU; - Law No. 9880, dated 25.2.2008, “On the Electronic Signature”; - Law No. 10273, dated 29.4.2010, “On the Electronic Document”; - Law No. 10128, dated 11.5.2009, “On the Electronic Trade”, as ammended by Law No. 135/2013; - Law No. 9887, dated 10.3.2010, “On the Protection of Personal Data”, as am- mended byLaw No. 48/2012 and Law No. 120/2014; - Law No. 10325, dated 23.9.2010, “On the Basis of State Data”; - Law No. 9380, dated 28.4.2005, “On the Copyright and other Related Rights”; - Law No. 72, dated 28.6.2012, “On the Organisation and Functioning of the Na- tional Geospatial Infrastructure in the Republic of Albania”; - Law No. 146/2014 “On the Public Notifi- cation and Consultation”; - Law No. 119/2014 “On the Right of Information”; Albania has harmonized the legislation on the cyber crime with the European Concil Convention on Cyber Crime (ETS No. 185). In 2004, Albania ratified “The Additional Protocol of the Cyber Crime Convention, for the penalization of racial and xenopho- bic natured acts carried out via computer systems” (ETS No. 189) and in 2008 there were ammendments of the Criminal Code to also include provisions of cyber crime. The transposition of Directive 2001/29/EC related to the Intellectual Property in the information society is still ongoing. A number of sub-legal acts mainly related to e-governance have also been adopted, such as: - DCM No. 248, dated 27.4.20075, as ammended, for the establishment and functioning of NAIS; - DCM No. 945, dated 2.11.2012, “On the Adoption of Regulation “Administration of the Basis System of State Data”; - DCM No. 961, dated 24.11.2010, “On the Establishment of the Regulatory Co- ordination Authority of the basis of state data”; - DCM No. 357, dated 24.2.2013, “On the Adoption of Regulation for the Manage- ment of Electronic Document in the Re- public of Albania”; - DCM No. 303, dated 31.3.2011, “On the Establishment of Information and 5DCM No. 703, dated 29.10.2014 has superceeded DCM No. 248, dated 27.4.2007 13 Communication Technological Units at the line ministry and subordinate insti- tutions”; - DCM No. 778, dated 7.11.2012, “On the Approval of General, Minimal Standards of the ICTU Personnel for the Structural Organization of ICT”; - DCM No. 710, dated 21.8.2013, “On the Estabishment and Functioning of Systems for the Safeguarding of Info- rmation, Continuity of Work and Service Level Agreements”; - DCM No. 734, dated 28.8.2013, “On the Establishment of the Unique System of Registration, Authentication and Ide- ntification of Users in Retriving Public Services from Electronic Systems”. - Directive No. 1, dated 31.12.2012, “On the verification of the copy letter of the electronic document in public institu- tions”; - Directive No. 2, dated 2.9.2013, “On Standartization of Drafting the TORs for the ICT projects in public administra- tion”. Currently, there is a rich legal framework that directly and indirectly regulates ICT and information society. However, the ammendment and improvement of ICT, e-governance and information society le- gislation is necessary in order to respond to the dynamic development of this field and the establishment of a single digital market integrated with that of the EU and beyond; DEVELOPmENT OF ICT INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE INTERNET With the liberalization of the telecommu- nications market and after the privatization of the state owned companies, the deve- lopment of ICT infrastructure was seen as closely related to private investments and stimulation of policies for private inve- stments. The adoption of Law No. 9918, da- ted 19.05.2008, “On the Electronic Commu- nications in the Republic of Albania”, marked an important step toward the full liberaliza- tion of telecommunications market. The law specifically eliminated the entry barriers in the market for the entrepreneurs, as well as it facilitated: - the right of each entrepreneur to deliv- er electronic communication networks and services, on the basis of a general authorization as well as individual ones in the case of utilization of limited re- sources (frequences and numbers); - a suitable regulatory environment, which respects the principle of techno- logical impartiality; - transferral of rights to utilize the limited resources through transparent, non-dis- criminatory and proportional proce- dures. Competition in the electronic communi- cations market has increased and in 2014 there were four mobile telephony operators in the electronic communications market, 79 alternative fixed telephony operators and 131 providers of internet services, ISP. Three operators of the mobile telephony provided broadband mobile services based on the 3G technology. In the first half of 2014, published data by AEPC related to the market indicated the following figures: 3,473,361 active users of mobile telephony; 1,058,354 users of broad- band internet from the mobile phones, while the number of fixed telephony cu- stomers decreased by reaching 255,358 from 281200 at the end of 2013. The number of fixed broadband services was 188,668. The scale uf utilization of electronic co- mmunications, such as the mobile telepho- ny, internet, etc has increased annually. Di- fferent observations indicate that utilization of the smart, tablets and other equipment has increased. Utilization of the social ne- tworks in the country is wider. There is also an increasing trend in relation to the traffic of data communications and a decrease of the telephone traffic (voice). This is a global tendency which is also reflected in our cou- ntry. Internet penetration according to the pub- 14 lished data by the ITU for Albania is evalu- ated as over 60%, broadband penetration has increased, especially in the broadband mobile segment. At the end of 2013, mobile broadband penetration based on all kinds of equipment, including the smartphone and tablet reached 37%. Also, the tariffs for accessing the Internet have decreased sev- eral times by making this service more affordable. The speed for providing the internet service has increased. The most utilized speed increased from 256kbit/s in 2008-2009 to 2-4Mbit/s. Based on LSMS6 data for 2012 and LSMS data for 2008, the number of families owning a PC increased by 4-5 times. A more general overview on the progress of the main indicators of the ele- ctronic communications sector is provided in Appendix 2. Despite the progress in the ICT field, Albania is still far away from the average level of not just the EU countries, but the regional ones as well in relation to the access to the infra- structure and the broadband services. NATIONAL PLAN FOR THE DEVELOPmENT OF BROADBAND The National Plan for the development of broadband is a strategic document for the development of the broadband infrastruc- ture and services, adopted by way of DCM No. 468, dated 30.5.2013. Broadband Na- tional Plan is an important development because it provides a clear direction of what the government, public administration and the regulator such as AEPC are going to do for the period of 2013-2020. This plan offers a vision of how access to the internet will develop by being utilized to the maximum by the Albanian families, even in the most remore areas. The Action Plan for the Broadband Deve- lopment determines as a vision the develo- pment of broadband infrastructure and se- rvices in the whole country in order to gain access to the electronic services in different fields, such as, health (e-health), education (e-education), commerce (e-commerce), government services (e-government), by stimulating the economic and social deve- lopment of the country. Broadband services facilitate fast and co- mplete information for the individuals and businesses, support a better governance, and according to the ITU7 data, the increase of broadband penetration level by 10% brings in an economic growth of the GDP by 1.38% in countries with a low and average economic level. In the framework of the implementation of the Broadband National Plan 2013-2020, a few activities intending to fulfill the set obje- ctives related to the regulatory and technical issues have been undertaken. These activi- ties include the public consultations by AEPC related to the spectrum issue, the national conference on the broadband development by emphasizing the close public-private co- operation and the need for investments, the establishment of the Regional Development Fund to support the projects of rural and regional infrastructure development, ICT, e-governance, e-learning, etc. Transferral of rights of frequence utilization, which represent a limited national resource of a considerable value in the economy of a country, is based on the principle of te- chnological neutrality, by giving the ne- cessary space to the more advanced broad- band mobile communications technologies LTE/4G to be applied in their best para- meters. An important role in this respect is played by the release of the spectrum called the Digi- tal Divident, currently used for audio-visual broadcasting. The digital divident will be placed at the disposal of the broadband services of the mobile communications, thus directly influencing the increase of the broadband access. Government efforts are 6 Observation for the Subsistence Level carried out by INSTAT 7 15 focused into the timely implementation of the “Strategy on the transferral of the analogue broadcasts into numerical ones”. Based on Law No. 97/2013, ”On the Audio-Visual Media”, the Authority of the Audio-Visual Media played an important role in the release of the Digital Divident and its utilization for the purposses of the broad- band services. ICT infrastructure development for fast and super fast broadband requires the esta- blishment of the neccessary resources for the radio spectrum, as a limited natural re- source. Thus, there is a need to draft a clear spectrum policy to stimulate the longterm investments in the NGN networks. The perspective for development of the ele- ctronic communications sector, the deve- lopments of the broadband mobile networks of 4G generation, require a ha- rmonized integrated development of the ele- ctronic communications infrastructure. Joint investments, joint utilizations and addressing the right of transferral for the electronic communications networks re- main issues that require a speedy solution. The wide development of electronic servi- ces in general and the increase of demand for them, also require the development of optic fibre cable infrastructure in the whole of the country. DEVELOPmENT OF e-governance and INFORmATION SOCIETy E-governance developments for the period of 2008-2013, were focused into the central level and mainly in the government-busi- ness public service (G2B) and G2G. The esta- blishment of the National Licensing Center, National Registration Center, the expansion of GovNET (G2G) infrastructure, the esta- blishment of infrastructure for interaction, e-tax, e-procurement, e-customs, e-patents, e-fines services, Civil State National Regi- ster, issuance of biometric document, etc are some of the main developments. The National Agency for the Information Society (NAIS) was established in 2007, as a specialized agency for the e-governance and information society. During the peri- od of 2008-2014 work was carried out to expand the coverage of GovNET, to increase the number of institutions connected to the GovNET (from 18 institutions in 2008 to 211 by the end of 2014), to create the e-Albania. al portal, to develop the implementation of e-acts system, to establish the governmental data center, to establish the infrastructure for interaction of systems (ESB), to create the infrastructure for PKI and to deliver se- cure services, to develop the “cloud compu- ting” infrastructure, etc. Through the governmental data centre, NAIS offers a series of services concentrated in the 211 public institutions. This center was established near the NAIS, according to the contemporary standards and facilitates the centralization and integration of all of the government online services. 15 instituions were connected to the government gateway during 2014. In the health system: There have been a series of important interventions and inve- stments in the field of Communication and Information Technology, such as, “The Pro- ject of Albanian Telemedicine”, impleme- nted since 2012; The Informative Inocu- lation System, The Electronic System for Reimbursed Prescriptions, The Electronic System of Hospital Costs, The Electronic Re- gister of Pharmaceutical Warehouses and The Electronic Screening System. In the field of public finances: The System of Debt Management and Financial Analy- sis, The Midterm Budgetary Programme and the Government Financial Computer System are functioning at the Ministry of Finance. Within the development of infrastructure improvement systems, the Ministry of Finance has also facilitated, among other things, the investment for “Improving the Central infrastructure of the Treasury Sys- tem”. The tax direcorate has established the In- tegrated Tax System, the Electronic Decla- ration Database and the Database for the 16 System of Fiscal Equipment. E-tax services initially introduced in 2008 are improving and being enriched with new services. The Automated System of Customs Data, as well as the ASYCUDA System are functioning in the cutoms offices. In the justice field: A few important projects were carried out, such as, the establishment of the Albanian Notary Register, The Ele- ctronic Case Management System for Judi- cial Execution - ALBIS, The Electronic Court Cases Registration System - ICMIS, The Online Court Status Certificate System. The Office for Registration of Immovable Pro- perty has established a computerized system for the registration of immovable property. In the business field: The establishment of the National Registration Center and that of the National Licensing Center were amongst the initial experiences toward delivering services to businesses through the one stop shop centers. The Electronic Business Register was created and published at Registration of a business went through an easier and time reducing procedure. However, business registration and application at the National Licensing Center still cannot be fully completed online. The Project of Online Tracking was imple- mented during 2013-2014 at the NRC and NLC. The fruition of this project provided the opportunity for the different subjects who apply for permitts/licences at the NLC or NRC tills to follow the progress of the application online during all of the stages at the respective NRC ( and NLC ( websites. These developments have had their impact in improving the general index of readiness for the electronic governance8. In 2014, Albania was ranked in the 84rth place out of 190 countries worldwide according to the Index of Electronic Governance in compari- son with the 85th place out of 182 countries back in 2008. In the mean time the index for offering online services (an integral part of the Index for Electronic Governance) for Albania grew from 0.3913 in 2008, to 0.4488 in 2014. A detailed information on the pro- gress of indicators for the ICT Development Index, related to ICT development according to the ITU publications, e-governance and e-participation indicator according to the UN reports, is provided in Appendix 3. Albania falls into the average level world- wide in relation to e-governance, but the situation in Albania according to the UNPAN9reports, remains on lower levels in the regional ranking: Greece is ranked on the 34rth place; Croatia is ranked on the 47th place, Bulgaria is ranked on the 73rd place, Serbia is ranked on the 69th place, etc. ICT IN EDUCATION ICT in education constituted one of the main directions set out in ISSIS 2008-2013. There have been a few developments in this field, but a lot more remains to be done. Curre- ntly, there are 1496 computer laboratories in the pre-univerity education. The internet network has been installed in schools by allowing students and teachers to utilize different information sources, as well as specifically to assist in their work of cu- rricular projects. Each school has a dedica- ted broadband connection, but this remains confined only in the computer laboratories. In 2006, the ICT as a study subject was taught only in the high school level, whilst in 2014 this was also dissaminated in the basic education level. It continues on Grade 7 and is taught until Grade 12. Schools of basic public education report 15731 PC, out of which only 11331 are functional, with 4400 PC being non- functional. Schools report 1631 laptops, out of which 432 are non-functional. Pre-University Information Management System, which would contain the basis of 8The e-Government is based on three main dimensios: (i) availability of online services, (ii) telecommunications infrastructure, and (iii) human capacity 9 17 the student data together with their identi- fication numbers and grades on the school certificates, as well as the basis of tea- cher data containing information pertaining to their skills and knowledge, is currently non-functional. The Electronic Higher Education Database, which includes the National Register of Students, albeit existing, presents many issues. The Financial Module which manages the finances and budget of the educational institutions in the central and local level, funcions only partially in a few Regional Educational Directorates. Investments in the direction of development of human resources in utilization of these systems have been extremely reduced and this has resulted in a very limited utilization of them. In 2012, the piloting scheme of the applica- tion for the Online System of the State Ma- tura Test using form A2, distribution of the winners as per the Merit-Preference princi- ple, as well as the online registration of stu- dents at the universities in both stages of the first round were completed successfully. The limit values of students for the distri- bution of computer laboratories, respe- ctively 5 desktops/students and one for the teacher; 10 desktops/students and one for the teacher; as well as 15 desktops/stu- dents and one for the teacher have been up to 300 students, from 300 to 600 students and over 600 students. The equipment acco- rding to the above configurations is con- nected through internal cable networks with Switch, without any management pro- gramme, or application for subject content. Amongst the ICT issues in education, it is worth mentioning the following: - the ratio of computer use per student, varies from school to school; appro- ximately, this ratio is 1:27 and in some cases even lower; - students may obtain information only in the computer laboratories, but not in the other school locations, i.e. the li- brary; - in more than 1/3 of schools, students have limited opportunity in obtaining information online; - there is a complete lack of digital co- ntent in the mother-tongue; only inter- net content that varies from the used source is used; - there is a risk of exposure towards in- napropriate content; - there is no awareness for children in in- ternet utilization for phenomenon, such as, mocking, cyberbullying or grooming. Despite the investments already carried out, utilization of ICT in the education insti- tutions is limited. There is a need for more investments and attention for the ICT in ed- ucation in order to provide a society based on knowledge and to widely increase the skills of ICT utilization. SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND INNOVATION Policies undertaken in the field of scientific research during the period of 2009-2013, intended reforming of this important se- ctor for the economy and development of the country. Implementation of this reform in the science system, as noted, resulted in a few modest achievements with the main aim to integrate higher education with science. The Agency of Research, Technology and innovation (ARTI) was established during this period. The agency made a few efforts to increase participation in scientific re- search projects in the EU and international programmes. The Albanian Government set up funds from the state budget for 550 new vacancies and supported the best PHD stu- dents through the Brain Gain and the Exce- llency Fund Programmes. One of the main indicators of the lack of progress in the field of scientific research is the extreme low number of inclussion of the Albanian research institutions in the inter- national scientific research programmes and benefits from them. This comes as a result of the lack of the necessary institutional and 18 human capacities. There were 245 applications with 34 won projects for the Seven Framework Pro- gramme FP7, which expreesed in percentage is a total of 13.87%. This is a very low result in comparison with the regional countries. The above situation highlights the need for further efforts in stimulating applications by Albanian researchers in the EU scientific re- search programmes. An agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Albania on the participa- tion in the Horizon Framework 2020 – Pro- gramme for Research and Innovation was signed in July 2014. Future challenges are related to the new re- forms that the government is undertaking in the higher education and scientific research and innovation field, intending to: (i) expand and increase the quality of the scientific re- search and innovation in Albania based on the OECD indicators; (ii) actively increase the inclussion of the scientific research institu- tions in the European Research Area (ERA), (iii) improve the quality and orientation of the scientific research toward the market needs through the strengthening of ties of national and international programmes with the business. SECURE INFORmATION SOCIETy SECURE COmmUNICATIONS, ELECTRONIC CERTIFICATION The National Authority on Electronic Certifi- cation has been functioning since 2009. This institution is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the law, other sub-legal acts as well as standards and technical re- quirements that must be met by the Provi- der of the Certification Service, which issues electronic qualified certificates. Currently, there are two CSPs registered at the ANEC: -The National Agency for Information Soci- ety (NAIS), which offers its service for the employees of the public administration. This service is free of charge for these employ- ees. - ALEAT SHPK, which offers its service for the state and private sectors, pursuant to the concenssion contract this institution has with the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Based on the digitalization of services provided to the citizens, efforts are being made for the electronic services, such as, the electronic authentication and signature, which allows for the user’s identity verification and that of the signed document, in order to facili- tate their utilization in distance and to gua- rantee the safety in relation to the required standards in the field. A new law on the Electronic Signature and Identification is on its way. This new law intends to transpose the European Regula- tion No. 910/2014 of the European Parlia- ment and Council, dated 23 June 2014, “On the Electronic Identification and the Credibi- lity Services related to Electronic Transa- ctions in the Internal Market” and repeal Di- rective 1999/93/EC. ON COmPUTER SECURITy Apart from the ammendments of the Crimi- nal Code in 2008 and the inclussion of provi- ssions for the cyber crime pursuant to the European Council Convention (CoE 185), the sector for the cyber crime was established within the State Police and ALCIRT (National Agency for Computer Security) in 2011. Currently, the website of the State Police offers the service of online reporting of co- mputer crime by reporting the types of vio- lations or cyber crime in gov.al/denonco_kk/raportim.php. It is ne- cessary to have more information and awareness by the users of this website and the cyber crime. A draft of the document related to computer security expected to be adopted soon, is in process. The increase of using ICTs technology pre- sents the need for strengthening the ca- 19 pacities of inter-institutional cooperation in pursuing and preventing the dangers deriv- ing from cyber crime. Closer cooperation on the regional and global levels as well as the improvement of legislation for the security of networks and information in line with the EU practices is necessary. SAFER INTERNET PRACTICES Albania has adopted an action plan for the protection of children’s rights (DCM No. 182/2012). This document also foresees a few activities for the online protection of children. Pursuant to this plan, in February 2013 the largest electronic communications companies in Albania and the IT association company, AITA signed the Code of Conduct, as a self-regulatory practise. Upon the sign- ing of this code the companies engaged in delivering technical filtration techniques and parental advice for the protection of chi- ldren and young people from the illegal and harmful electronic communications. In the last few years Albania has periodically carried out awareness activities for a safer internet, as well as activities on the interna- tional day of Safer Internet. Raising the awareness for parental control, protection of children from the illegal and harmful internet and online media content requires more attention and the engage- ment of different institutions and actors, such as, the private sector, NGOs, media, schools and parent community. Albania is part of the Global Alliance against the Sexual Exploitation of Children in the Internet, established on December 5, 2012. The alliance countries have agreed to work in achieving four objectives: - Increase the efforts for the identification of victims and ensuring that they will re- ceive the necessary assistance, support and protection; - Increase the efforts in investigating the sexual exploitation cases against children on the internet and identify and prosecute persons violating the law; - Increase the awareness of children, parents, educators and the community in general in relation to the dangers; - Reduce the availability of child porno- graphy on the internet and ri-victimiza- tion of children. OPEN gOVERNANCE THROUgH ICT The Open Governance Partnership (PQH- OGP) is one of the most important instru- ments to stimulate government transpa- rency at the global level, to increase civic participation in public life and to use the new technologies for the improvement of admi- nistrative efficiency and fighting corruption. The first OGP Action Plan for 2011-2013 was mainly focused in the increase of efficiency for the management of public resource se- rvices, by implementing measures in the field of fiscal transparency, access to info- rmation, utilization of information techno- logy (IT) and participation of citizens in the process of development of public policies. Work was carried out during 2014 to draft a second OGP action plan. The drafting of this plan was carried out through a long consu- ltation process with a wide participation of the interest groups. The second action plan entered into force in July 2014. Pursuing the government programme and the OGP plan, the document of the policy for the im- plementation of the open data was drafted and adopted by way of the Decision of the Council of Ministers No. 147, dated 18.2.2015. The portal for the transparency of budgetary expenses as a special feature in the website of the Ministry of Finance10 was established pursuant to the engagements for an open governance. 10 financiare; 20 All of the official ministerial websites, as well as the website of the Prime Minister’s Office contain a feature on reporting corruption and receiving civic oppinion related to diffe- rent issues. The government plan for 2013 – 2017, fore- sees the “Fulfillment of a wide consultation process with the civil society regarding the new legal initiatives, as well as their moni- toring and evaluation”. Pursuant to this pro- gramme and engagements in the OGP, two laws were adopted, the “Law for Public No- tification and Consultation” and the “Law on the Right of Information”. INFRASTRUCTURE FOR gEOSPATIAL INFORmATION The Geographical Information (GI) and the geo spatial data service are a neces- sary part of the information society and e-Government. ASIG was established pursu- ant to Law No. 72/2012. The basis for the esta- blishment of the national geo-portal, were laid during 2014. The establishment of the National Geo-Portal is e new innovation of specific importance in respect of the online service, cartography information and geo- information together with the database. The establishment of this service for the very first time in Albania, makes the unification of information possible based on the ‘INSPIRE”- standards, avoids the overlapping related to property relations, eliminates communica- tion bureaucracy and facilitates utilization of cartography information. PREPARATION OF LOCAL gOVERNANCE FOR e–government ISSIS strategy for 2008-2013, was focused in the development of e-governnance at the central level. This strategy related a few general objectives for the e-governance at the local level accompanied by some acti- vities in the action plan intending to raise the awareness regarding the e-governance. Periodical observations on the e-governance at the local government carried out by NAIS indicate that there are town halls (like Tira- na, Durres, Korca, Elbasan, Shkodra, Lezha, etc.) and a few municipalities (like the mu- nicipalities of Shkodra and Lezha districts) that have developed e-governance practi- ces, such as providing information related to services, e-participation, etc. The use of ICT by these Local Units improved the administrative processes, facilitated access to information as well as improved the quality of services in a number of fields of the local government activities, such as, taxes, budgets, territory planning and management, inspection, emergencies, inclussion of citizens and business in deci- sion-making and the more advanced models of establishing the one-stop-shops, etc. In the mean time there are a large number of municipalities and city halls that are still far away from the ICT e-government utili- zation. Despite the efforts, only in very few cases the LG strategic documents cite obje- ctives, programmes and projects related to e-local governance (i.e. Lezha11), which indi- cates lack of a long-term vision in the field of e-governance of the local government. The limited presence of the LGUs in the web, according to the approved standards, is a sign of a low scale development of the sector. The unified and harmonized e-governance development, both on the central and local level, as well as the support for the deve- lopment of the LG e-governance is nece- ssary to expand the benefits of ICT utiliza- tion in all layers and levels. 11 Strategic Plan of Lezha City Hall, 2013-2030 21 CHALLENgES FOR THE DIgITAL agenda 2015-2020 Conclussions based on the current situation indicate that there is still a need for the fo- llowing: - Legal and regulatory ammendments and improvements that would respond to the dynamic development of this field and the establishment of the single di- gital market ready to become part of the regional and global developments; - ICT infrastructure developments which should be oriented toward the growth and expansion of the fast and super fast broadband in the whole territory of the country; - Increase of Internet penetration in the family and business in the framework of reducing the digital gap; - Increase of numbers of online services that facilitate their utilization partially or fully in electronic ways ranging from information to a complete online tra- nsaction; - Development of the proper ways of providing public services through the on- line contact points and one-stop-shops; - Implementation of the interaction framework of systems and services; - Standartization of ICT as a guarantee for an integrated and sustainable develo- pment of information society extended in all sectors; - Stimulation of the private sector in rela- tion to development of applications in the interest and response to the needs of citizens and businesses; - Development of supporting infrastru- cture in the public administration, both at the central and local level, intending to advance both systems and services; - Increase of knowledge capacities of ICT for the administration and other users, i.e. citizens and businesses; - Inter-institutional cooperation even at the regional and global level for a safer Internet and information society; CH AP TE R I I 2 23 VISION The Cross-cutting “Digital Agenda of Albania 2015-2020” aims toward the more coordi- nated and efficient direction of investments in the sector of Informatin Technologies and Communications, with the emphasis of pro- viding quality services for the citizens and the improvement of livelihood. These poli- cies are harmonized with the sectorial stra- tegy and they are also approximated with European Agenda 2020, as well as with the Regional Strategy SEE-2020. Vision A society based in knowledge and info- rmation, through the consolidation of di- gital infrastructure in the whole territory of the Republic of Albania; improvement of the quality of online public services and increase of governance transparency The major priorities of this strategy are: the improvement of national infrastructure of information and communication techno- logy; the development of electronic gove- rnance and the establishment of a mu- lti-purpose Cadaster. These are long-term priorities foreseen in the NSDI and extended in time for the 2015-2020 period. 1. Improvement of national infrastructure of the information and communication technologies, as the main pillar of a fast development of the information society and the growth of electronic readiness. - Increase of access with a high transmi- ssion speed, of at least 100 Mbps in 50% of families, and at least, 30 Mbps for the whole population; - Growth of population percentage that utilizes the Internet from 50 % at the end of 2013 to 90% by the end of 2020; - Number of businesses using ICT for e-commerce purposes should be at the rate of 50%; - All schools with access to broadband Internet; 2.

(Growth of the electronic governance readiness index according to UNPAN12, from 0. 5046 at the end of 2013 to 0.7 by the end of 2017); VISION, POLICIES AND STRATEgIC PRIORITIES 16 United Nations Public Administration Network. 24 - Simplification of administrative proce- dures and riorganization of processes; - Establishment of a services model that puts the citizen at the centre through the creation of a unique till for public services, as well as the improvement of access to services for the citizens and the increase of transparency for the se- rvices of each public institution, mainly through the utilization of information and communication technology; - Basic systems interrelated at the rate of 100%; - Basic vital services for citizens and bussinesses provided electronically, both at the central and local level; - 30-50% growth of the scale of users of electronic services and e-governance; 3. Implementation of the national po- licy for the Establishment of National Geospatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) and that of the Multi-Purpose Cadaster Office through the following: - Creation of the Gravimetric geo-portal and network; - Establishment of a Multi-Purpose Cada- ster Office; - Functioning and certification of the active network ALBPOS, as well as that of the passive network ALBPOS; - Establishment of the levelling network, Class I and II, and acquisition of Europe- an certifications; - Maintanance and update of networks pursuant to the European standards; mAIN PRINCIPLES FOR THE DEVELOPmENT OF THE DIgITAL AgENDA Delivering Services to the Citizens and Busi- nesses will be the main engine of this stra- tegy. Amongst other things, this strategy will be based on the following principles, which determine the process of development for the information society in Albania: ► People come first. Each programme, project and activity must respect the ci- tizens’ rights, by also including the pri- vacy right. ► Individual empowerment. Indivi- dual empowerment as a result of the transforming power of the digital te- chnologies in all our economy and so- ciety. The growth of utilization of di- gital technologies will also result in the growth of individual empowerment. ► access to services delivered by the go- vernment. The Government will invest in systems, infrastructure and servic- es that intend to reduce corruption, increase transparency and increase interaction with citizens and businesses. ► Full compliance with the european Union Policies. The establishment of the information society in Albania should be in compliance with the aquis of the Euro- pean Union. It should also be in compli- ance with the International Telecommu- nications Union (ITU) policies, Council of Europe policies and other international and regional organisations policies while taking into account the level of national development and country’s situation. ► national integration of Ict resources. Improvement of efficiency of ICT public investments based on the integration of data for complete suitability between systems. Compliance with the EU sta- ndards for a single digital market. ► transborder and regional cooperation and beyond. This cooperation will be fo- cused in a few fields, such as, research and innovation, information and co- mmunication technologies competitive- ness of small and average enterprises, social inclusion, harmonization of the online digital protection, etc, pursuant to Pillar 1 of the European Digital Age- nda 2020 - Single Digital Market13. 13 25 ► cg-Lg cooperation. The Government will draft supporting and regulatory po- licies for the digitalization of local gove- rnance services, as well as will coordi- nate the inter-operability for the joint and delegated e-services. ► trust and security of information ne- tworks. The Government will imple- ment a system of norms, sanctions and resources in order to guarantee the data and ICT systems security. All the efforts undertaken in the field of information society must follow the agreed princi- ples and security standards in order not to create additional conditions that may compromise or violate the personal data or those of a third party. These efforts include the identification and authenti- cation, data protection, protection from cyber crime, protection of intellectual data, consumer protection, etc. ► effectiveness and efficiency. Develo- pment of the information society should be implemented through projects that support the goals and priorities of state policies, as determined by the strategy at the national, regional and local level through the more efficient and effective use of limited resources. ► Quality of digital content. Each activi- ty, project or initiative that leads to the establishment of the digital content, especially those that are of a national character, will be supported and stru- ctured as part of the national digital inheritance. ► Private-Public cooperation – Partne- rship (PPP). In its activities, the Government will cooperate, based on the knowledge, skills and flexibility, with businesses, universities, non-profitable organizations and NGOs in Albania, for an efficient development of the informa- tion society in the country. ► technological neutrality. The principle of technological neutrality in the regu- latory activities related to the develo- pment of electronic communications will be applied in order to protect the interest of citizens and consumers, as well as to ensure an open Internet. The Digital Agenda 2015-2020 expands its effects in all of the economic and social sectors of the country. This is based on the nature of ICT, as a technology of a general interest and also because of the increased influence of its utilization. Development of information society in Albania constitutes a joint objective of all actors, such as, the public sector, the aca- demic world, NOGs, civil society and private organizations. The successful completion of this objective is related to the proper coordi- nation and harmonization of developments among all sectors and actors. CH AP TE R I II 3 27 ISSDA strategy 2015-2020, is part of the strategic framework drafted by the Alba- nian Government that covers all the deve- lopment fields of society and governance. In order to have a society based on knowledge and information, a sustainable economic and social development, a consolidation of the digital infrastructure in the whole terri- tory of the Republic of Albania, is needed in order to develop these fields. At the same time, the strategy will strictly respect the European principles of a free and honest co- mpetition, by improving the quality of pu- blic services and increasing governance tra- nsparency. The objectives and foreseen activities to be carried out according to the determined fields have been specified as follows: STRATEgIC PRIORITy 1: POLICIES FOR THE DEVELOPmENT OF ELECTRONIC gOVERNANCE AND DELIVERy OF INTERACTIVE PUBLIC SERVICES FOR CITIzENS AND BUSINESSES Policies of developing electronic governance aim at providing digital quality services for citizens. This new approach will increase the opportunity for a better performance in the work of CG and LG institutions as a result of the joint efforts for more sustainable, long- term and safer solutions. The final goal is work coordination and cooperation among the actors in the ICT field in the delivery of digital services. objective 1 Increase and promote the electronic services and e-services by 30% for citizens and businesses. Increase of transparency and improvement of public administration se- rvices according to the Open Government Partnership initiative will remain a priority. Taking into consideration the above objective all the decisions for ICT budgetary investments should be in line with the mid- term government budgetary programmes which serve also as a tool for the application of priorities of the Albanian Government. Achievement of this objective will be aimed through the following activities:  Improvement of public services; Improvement of public services includes the establishment of front and back-office sys- tems, receipt of documents issued by the Albanian state in the central and local level, applications and claims, financial actions, etc intending the delivery of these services through unique centers for the integrated services, like the one stop shops.  Improvement of government efficie- ncy in the administration of income and expenses; POLICy OBJECTIVES AND mAJOR PRODUCTS 28 This section intends to improve the existing systems and establish new ICT systems that include the following ones, such as, taxation, customs, contract and concession manage- ment, social assistance and disabled persons programmes, administration and manage- ment of state properties, administration of agricultural, health, education, justice, LG expenses, etc.  Assistance of ICT systems in the success- ful application of the administrative, ter- ritorial and justice reforms; Implementation of the large reforms undertaken by the Albanian Government, such as, the territorial, administrative and justice reforms, clearly require the support of the ICT systems, as auxiliary elements of their fruition. Taking into consideration this goal the objective aims at the establi- shment and operation of the following: the Address System and its connection with the National Population Register, ICT systems that assist in increasing the performance of LG, improvement of ICT systems serving the courts, public notary and bailiffs offices, property registration, efficient management of correctional services, increase the levels of central and local administration, etc.  Increase of efficiency in the production, agriculture, tourism and industry sectors through the ICT systems; This section intends to modernize the pro- duction sectors in the country through the ICT utilization, in order to facilitate the fulfill- ment of standards and the quality of prod- ucts and services in line with the directives of European Community, aiming at the in- crease of exports for agricultural, farming, food and mineral products, as well as for the transfer of technologies.  Administration and standardization of state data, as an auxiliary tool in the well-functioning and administration of information serving the growth of ser- vices for citizens and businesses, public safety and fight against crime; This activity will aim at the consolidation of current databasis as well as the establi- shment of new state databasis, their intera- ction and intervention with the online data and application systems. We need to bear in mind that the basis for the establishment and consolidation of these databasis will be the unique identification number for indivi- duals and businesses.  Increase of human capacities by starting to utilize new technologies from the pre- school systems to the public administra- tion and high ranking officials; Albanian society needs to be prepared for the new challenges which emphasize the acquisiton of new information technologies. On the other hand, each current or new ICT system cannot be operational without the assistance of human resources who need to be prepared for their utilization. Thus, it is necessary to apply ICT education systems, starting from the pre-school, elementary, high school, university, professional edu- cation up to the enhancement of ICT kno- wledge for the civil servants of central and local administration, in all levels.  Ehancement of performance and effi- ciency of LG throguh the utilization on the new ICT systems and methodologies; The goal of the Albanian Government is to establish a relationship of quality service be- tween central and local administration and the public by treating each citizen according to the customer care principle in regard to governmental services. Thus, the enhance- ment and consolidation of ICT utilization in the central administration cannot be sepa- rated by their utilization in the local admini- stration, which is responsible for a large number of public services.  Increase transparency for the public. This serves the interest of communica- tion with the public and the fight against corruption; This activity aims at increasing the pu- 29 blic credibility towards the Government, enhancing information related to gove- rnmental income and expenditure, for the recruitment process and operation of state administration, for governmental obliga- tions and engagements, current legislation and legal initiaties, decisions and orders, international engagements, etc This part of the programme also included the obliga- tions deriving from the initiative for an open partnership (OGP).  Integration of all IT systems and ele- ctronic services through the practical implementation of interaction of connected IT systems and “e-Services”; This activity intends to: - Increase the number of complete ele- ctronic services accessed from every equipment connected to the Internet, such as, computer, mobile telephone, iPad, etc; - Facilitate access and improve electro- nic services for the citizens and busine- sses through their online option in the unique governmental portal e-albania. - Fighting against corruption by reducing bureaucracy in the public administra- tion; - Increase efficiency, effectiveness and governmental transparency based on the principles of the initiative for an open governance; - Enhance citizens participation in gove- rnance and decision making, etc. objective 2 Innovation against corruption – One Stop Shops. For the first time ever, the Albanian Govern- ment has undertaken the reform for deliver- ing integrated public services. These services will be provided by the public administration in the One-Stop-Shops. The ‘Innovation against Corruption” pro- gramme aims at reforming the concept of public service by contributing to the mo- dernization of public services, by simplifying, integrating and unifying the service delivery in a single center (The Public Service Center). The programme will also provide its contri- bution to one of the government priorities – the fight against corruption. This dual mission (improvement of public services and the fight against corruption) will be achieved by implementing a series of reforms: innovation of administrative proce- dure, as well as the necessary ICT tools and instruments for the distribution of services in a PSM format. Enhancement of benefits, improvement of service delivery and redu- ction of corruption leads to the following: • Reduction of time and expenses for citi- zens in obtaining public services; • Obtaining of services from one single window; • Improvement of quality services by uti- lizing new innovative solutions; • Increase the credibility and enjoyment by the citizens in relation to the ma- nner the services are delivered from the administration; In order to achieve this major objective, a few steps which consist of the following will be carried out: • Improvement of the regulatory envi- ronment and riconstruction of the new engineering structure by also bulding up the institutional coordination; • Establishment of the necessary infra- structure (Digitalization and Moderniza- tion + Establishment); • Putting in place of an internal monito- ring system; • Centralized model of service delivery; • Increase the accountability by publi- shing performance results; • Improvement and consolidation of ICT infrastructure development. objective 3 Ammendment and improvement of the legal and regulatory framework for the e-gove- 30 rnance and information society. The mid-term plan foresees the following: - Drafting and adoption of the law on electronic governance with its sub-legal acts to be used for its implementation; - Drafting and adoption of the sub-legal act for the implementation of the law “On Public Notification and Consulta- tion”; - Draft decision “Establishment and rules for the administration of Electronic Re- gister for public notifications and consu- ltations”; - Drafting and adoption of the law for the electronic identification in line with the EU acquis. objective 4 Development of Electronic Governance (e-Governance), intending to improve the e-goevrnance index by 5 points (places). Developments related to e-Governance will be led by the principles of good and tra- nsparent governance by stimulating a coo- peration culture and aiming towards an open, flexible and cooperating administra- tion with citizens and businesses. As a ca- ndidate country, Albania will pursue the EU practises related to the e-Governance and will aim toward the implementation of the EU ministers declaration for the e-Gove- rnance. Implementation of Objective 3 will be fulfilled through the following activities: - Implementation of the National Inter- action Framework, based on the Euro- pean Interaction Network in order to complete the interaction of electronic systems; - Promotion of electronic services for cit- izens and businesses provided through the Governmental Interaction Platform, as well as the increase of new services in the governmental portal e-Albania.al, and the increase of online payment se- rvices, etc; - Implementation of the electronic exchange documents system, ERDMS in all the line ministries and the central administration and impovement of the e-cabinet service; - Establishment of the open data portal, as part of the unique services portal - Establishment, implementation of the tracking system for the requests addressed to the line ministries; - Implementation of the electronic signature whilst delivering official servi- ces and communications; - Further development of the foreign fi- nances management system, EAMIS; - Increase of security of the physical and logistical infrastructure of the gove- rnmental network, GovNET ; - Continuous improvement of capacities of the Center for Governmental Data; - Development of e-governance in the Local Government Units (LGUs) through the following: o Implementation of the unified info- rmative portal and electronic services for the Local Government Units (LGUs); o Fruition of interaction between the Governmental Platform of System Interaction of the LGUs with the central systems, starting with ZRPP, NRC, RKGJC; o Integration of services related to LGUs in the service portal e-Albania, starting with the display of information related to the local tax obligations for the citi- zens; o Establishment of IT platforms for the administration of documents and track- ing of service dissemination in the LGUs; - Awareness against the danger from cy- ber crime. Different activities will take place in this regard in order to enhance the inter-institutional cooperation be- tween the different structures of info- rmation technology for the awareness of the different interest groups and pre- vention of these dangers as well as the development of safer internet practices;  Close cooperation with the national and 31 international research and development centers in order to support the exchange of geo-information between authorities (techniques) and to improve geo-info- rmation technologies;  Establishment of the National Electronic Cadaster of Water Resources;  The establishment of the National Ele- ctronic Cadaster for the underground and surface drinking waters, highli- ghted as a national priority, will require the carrying out of the following acti- vities: Establishment of the infrastructure for the management of water resources from the qualitative and quantitative perspective at the level of the national basin through the GIS system. Integrated management through the GIS system of water resources thanks to the re- alization of balance between water resou- rces, analysis of water resources users, co- ntrol of the quantity and quality of utiliza- tion of water resources.  Electronic access to the Protected Areas This is related to the security of transparency with the public and other interested actors during the decision-taking process and legal initiatives in the nature field. The planned activities consist on the establishment of an online portal with access by the public and actors to legally drafted documents which are in process. Expected results consist of the following:  Implementation of international access standards on the online official ministe- rial websites for disabled persons (e-ac- cesibility Wacg/Web 2.0). STRATEgIC PRIORITy 2: POLICy FOR THE DEVELOPmENT OF ELECTRONIC COmmUNICATIONS IN ALL sectors (heaLth, edUcatIon, ENVIRONmENT, AgRICULTURE, TOURISm, CULTURE, ENERgy, transPort, etc) Development of the advanced electronic communications infrastructe together with the fast and super fast broadband constitues one of the main directions of the Digital Agenda. This will facilitate the completion of requests for access in the fast and super fast networks for all economic sectors, for citi- zens, businesses and the government itself, as a large consumer of ICT. objective 1 Advanced infrastructure of electronic co- mmunications and delivery of the sufficient spectrum for Broadband (NGN/LTE/5G) in- frastructure development aiming at the co- verage with service in the whole territory and 90% of population until 2020; Achievements of this objective will be carried out through the following activities:  Drafting of spectrum policy in order to facilitate the necessary resources for the frequence spectrum for the future net- work generation, such as, NGN, 4G/5G in compliance with the EU practices and the SAA engagements;  Improving the legal and regulatory framework for the efficient administra- tion of the spectrum under the condi- tions of technological convergence and implementation of the principles of te- chnological neutrality to provide for an open Internet;  Undertaking of the necessary steps to simplify the procedures for the establi- shment of the infrastructure of electro- nic communications which responds to 32 future requirements;  Stimulating joint investments and utili- zation of the broadband infrastructure all over the country.  Promoting and protecting of personal data for the online services, mobile ap- plications, cloud services, big data and the Internet of Things, as well as the pro- tection of intellectual property rights in the internet field. objective 2 Improvement of ICT infrastructure in the public administration for harmonized and integrated developments according to the international standards and e-governance in all sectors (health, education, environment, agriculture, tourism, culture, energy, tra- nsport, etc) aiming at 100% connectivity of all systems by the end of 2020.

In the mean time, for the same period there was a reduction in relation to the fixed telephony segment. These tendencies are similar to the tendencies of the recent years, whereupon the utilization of fixed telephony was decreasing and was being replaced by the mobile telephony. Also, the access to the broadband segment has sustained growth on both of its segments: from the fixed networks as well as from the mobile networks. The number of active mobile phone users (subscribers who have utilized mobile services in the last 3 months) by the end of 2013 reached 3.7 million, compared to 3.5 million at the end of 2012. This consists of an annual growth of 4% for the four operators, whilst the number of users of the mobile telephony according to the active SIM cards, sustained a decrease by 6%, by reaching 5.3 million compared to 5.6 million by the end of 2012. The penetration rate (number of users per 100 inhabitants) in 2013 was 130% according to the active users and 187% according to the SIM card users. The number of fixed telephony subscribers by the end of 2013, reached approximately 281 thousand compared to 311 thousand by the end of 2012, thus consisting in a reduction by 10%. The reduction of the number of subscribers for the fixed telephony was following the reduction trend started in 2010 (with the exception of 2011 where a growth was sustained). This reduction came as a result of the continuous decrease of the Albtelecom subscribers by 9%, as well as the decrease by 13% of subscribers of the alternative operators. The penetration rate of the fixed telephony by the end of 2013 was about 10%. The number of subscribers with fixed and mobile broadband access (3G USB/ modem cards) by the end of 2013 reached approximately 294 thousand, consisting in a 36% growth in comparison with 2012. In 2013, both broadband access segments, fixed and 3G (with USB/modem cards), sustained a growth of respectively 14% and 101%. The penetration rate for both types of access together is 10.4% per population and 37% per family. Below is an overview of the development of the number of subscribers for the mobile telephony (active users) and that of the fixed telephony in relation to the broadband access of mobile and fixed networks. The figures indicate clearly that the rates of growth for the broadband access in both networks are higher than those of the telephony. The fixed networks are even noticing opposite trends: growth of the broadband access and reduction of fixed telephony. In 2013, only 33% of active mobile users utilized the 3G broadband access and OVERVIEw OF THE ELECTRONIC COmmUNICATIONS mARkET APPENDIX 2 59 the number of subscribers with broadband access in the fi xed networks consists of 65% of subscribers of the fi xed telephony. mOBILE TELEPHONy The number of acti ve mobile users by the end of 2013 reached in 3.7 million, compared to 3.5 million at the end of 2012. This consists of an annual growth of 4% for all four operators. In the mean ti me, the growth rate diff ers according to the operatots: Operators Plus and Vodafone have sustained a growth of respecti vely 9% and 11%, while operators Albtelecom (EM) and AMC have sustained a reducti on of respecti vely 2% and 3%. Table 2 presents the development of the number of acti ve mobile users for the period of 2010- 2013. FIXED TELEPHONy Even during 2013 the fi xed telephony conti nued the decreasing trend of the recent years. Despite the fact that this trend is in line with the EU countries, the penetrati on rate of 10% is lower than that of the EU countries. The number of fi xed telephony subscribers reached approximately 281 thousand by the end of 2013, compared to 311 thousand at the end of 2012, thus a reducti on by 10%. The reducti on came as a result of the conti nuous decrease by 9% of the number of Albtelecom subscribers and the reducti on by 13% of the number of subscribers of the alternati ve operators.

The total number of users with 3G broadband access (mobile phones and USB cards) in 2013 reached 1.2 million compared to 694 thousand in 2012. admInIstratIon oF the cc.tLd.aL DOmAIN, UNDER ITS DOmAINS, AS wELL AS ENUm: Domain.al is one of the measuring instru- ments for the Internet vitality in Albania. The transfer from the system Register- Recorder took place in 20131. These changes liberalized the recording market of the domain under.al by transferring from the Registry-Registrar system, only in AEPC in the Registry AEPC system and the liberalized registrar, by giving the right of registration to other certified subjects by AEPC based on the criteria determined in this regulatory document. This process was completed through the public consultation with the entrepreneurs. In 2013 the number of registered domains was 3320 by reaching a total number of the registered domains to12888.

The calculati on methodology is provided in the ITU “Informa- ti on Society Measurement” Report. The table below presents the development of this indicator in Albania for the period of 2002-2012 in comparison with the regional and world average. As seen, the IDI index for Albania remains under the world average and the last one in Europe, despite the annual growth. Worldwide, Albania is ranked in the group of countries with average results of this index and is closer to the upper limit to move into the group of countrues with above average results.

However, the reports for Albania in the recent years indicate that our country is one of countries with the largest growth of the access sand utilization sub-indexes (The latter is presented in the ITU Report, MIS/2013). In order to understand what the important factors that influence the IDI level are, the following table carries out a comparison of the IDI sub-indexes: - The access sub-index includes: o Penetration of the fixed and mobile telephony, the international bandwith (connectivity) for Internet users - The utilization index includes: - % of families with PCs, % of families with Internet, Internet Users, penetration of fixed broadband subscribers, penetra- tion of broadband wireless subscribers - The proficiency sub-index includes: o % of individuals registered in high school, % of individuals registered in university, educated individuals The study of the subsequent reports indicates that the ITU calculated results are not consistent and that they have differences. The table below presents the standard of each of the 11 indicators used to calculate the IDI index together with the maximum result marked as the target for the indicator (the maximum indicator changes, i.e. the bandwidth for the international internet has grown several times during the period of 2010-2013). It is clear that: - the standard sub-index for the pene- tration of the fixed telephony remains almost at the same level for the period of 2002-2012. - the standard sub-index for the % of families connected with PCs and the internet remains low - the standard sub-index for the broad- band fixed connections remains extremely low (this depends on the low penetration of the fixed telephony). It can also be said that last year’s ITU Report contained a wrong finding in relation to the market of the mobile telephony in Albania (the market has not reached maturity yet) – and this is also reflected in the following table. In fact, the penetration of the mobile telephony is on the upper limit used as the maximal indicator for the standard of this sub-index (190%). IPB (Ict PrIce BasKet) IndeX The IPB index is also a composite indicator, based on the calculation of three sub-baskets: - fixed telephony sub-basket - mobile telephony sub-basket - Internet sub-basket 2002 2007 2008 2012 World av albania World av albania World av albania World av albania IDI 2.48 1.92/93 3.40 2.73/85 3.6 3.12/84 4.35 4.11 access sub index 2.68 1.87/ 78 3.91 2.83/96 3.27/88 4.74 3.73/96 Utilization sub index 0.54 0.01/ 130 1.43 0.63/78 0.91/84 2.85 2.71/65 Proficiency sub index 5.95 5.82/92 6.31 6.69/ 78 7.25/64 6.59 7.65/57 Table 6: IDI sub-indexes for the period of 2002-2012 Source: ITU, “Information Society measurement” Reports for the period of 2010-2013 65 According to the ITU Report for 2013, the IPB index for Albania shows the following results: - Albania is ranked on the 100th place with an IPB value of 4.5% against the GD- P/p.c. with a slights improvement from 4.6% of the GDP/p.c in 2011. - The fixed telephony sub-basket is valued at 2.2 % against the GDP/p.c in compa- rison with 2.3% of the GDP/p.c in 2011, - The mobile telephony sub-basket is valued at 7.8% against the GDP/p.c i comparison with 7.9% of the GDP/p.c in 2011. - The fixed broadband sub-basket is valued at 3.6% of the GDP/p.c. mOBILE BROADBAND PRICES It is for the first time in 2012 that the ITU collected data on the mobile broadband prices through the IPB index questionnaire. • Albania is on the 34th place with a value of 1.5 % of the GDP/p.c, for the pre- paid services and on the 46th place with a value of 1.5 % of the GDP/p.c for the post-paid services/500MB from the mobile phone. • Albania is on the 28th place with a value of 1.6% of the GDP/p.c in relation to the delivery of mobile broadband internet from the computer or the pre-paid services and on the 85th place with 5.1% of the GDP/p.c for the delivery of the 1GB internet from the computer (postpaid services). In general, the mobile broadband prices per 500 MB for both the pre-paid and post- paid packages in comparison with other regional and world countries are in low levels (affordable) almost at the level of the developed countries. The mobile broadband service for 1 GB is at an average level in comparison with other countries. e-governance and e-PartIcIPatIon IndeXes UPAN periodical reports (UN Public Admi- nistration Network)1 carry out an evaluation of the e-governance and e-participation readiness indexes. Even these indicators are composite ones and take into account the infrastructure and web observations. The results for the web access and online services are issued based on the independent observation of official internet sites. The following tables show the development of these indicators for Albania. year 2003 2004 2005 2008 2010 2012 2014 e-government Index 0.311 0.340 0.3732 0.4670 0.4519 0.5161 0.5046 Web measurement Subindex/ online services 0.083 0.162 0.1615 0.3913 na 0.425 0.4488 Telecommunication Subindex/ infrastructure 0.049 0.058 0.068 0.1251 na 0.337 0.3548 Human Capital Sub index 0.80 0.80 0.89 0.8869 na 0.7863 0.7100 Table 7: e-government index for Albania for the period of 2003-20121 Source: UN reports 2014 2012 2010 albania 0.5046 0.5161 0.4519 european average 0.6936 0.6574 0.5566 World average 0.4712 0.4882 0.4406 1 Table 8: Comparison with the region and the world average to be used for the e-gov index Comparison with the region and the world average to be used for the e-gov index: 66 This indicator shows that Albania is above the world average indicator, but below the European average index. year 2003 2004 2005 2008 2010 2012 2014 e-participation Index 0.017 0.0328 0.0317 0.0227 0.1286 0.105 0.5294 UN peridocal reports indicate a change in the methodology used, which may have influenced the result with lowering of the e-participation indicator. There is a growth in relation to the e-participation indicator (change of methodology). Albania is ranked on the 59th place according the UNPAN 2014.

Today, however, we are still counting our first  steps towards the digital revolution that will bring profound  transformation to the way we work, produce, live, receive  services and acquire knowledge. The range and consequences  of these expected changes are considered worldwide to be the  second most important revolution, following the industrial one  that marked the nineteenth century, improving dramatically the  life of a significant part of the world population. Establishing a  never-existed-before global social context, it has made knowledge   accessible for everyone at a low cost, merely that of Internet access. Albania, like Europe and the world, is embracing this digital revolution by creating   new opportunities for citizens and business to benefit. In this context, the Government  of Albanian has taken a strong commitment towards supporting and promoting digital  initiatives as a powerful tool that leads to modernized governance, increased know-how  for a society that is more open, and a sustainable economic development for its citizens.  Our efforts in this regard intended to foster regional cooperation and are coordinated with  the European legal and institutional framework in the process of Albania’s integration  into the European Union. Albania has adapted its legal framework on information  society to comply with the EU Acquis Communautaire, while being constantly in touch  with the dynamic developments of the Digital Single Market.   Albania already possesses powerful instruments to develop the digital market and  e-services, including full coverage of the population with mobile phones and secure  identity cards, as well as a state consolidated and interactive digital infrastructure.  Young in age, our population makes intensive use of mobile phones on the basis of  a solid 3G-infrastructure, with the 4G service coverage having just started to spread. The  secure identity cards provided to the Albanian citizens enable electronic identification  and qualified electronic signatures that will help both the public and private sector  develop reduced in time and cost-effective, services and processes.  Our government systems are interconnected through an up-to-date infrastructure  designed with the support of the European Union and other donors, and further     7  boosted also by the Albanian government investments. The Government Data Centre,  established in line with international standards, serves local and central institutions.  The unique public service portal, on the other hand, is offering a growing number of  e-services. We are investing in the digital education, both for equipment and curricula,  as well as are encouraging youth initiatives towards innovation through incentivising  programs.  Technology is the future of world economic development. Our mission is to use it  as a tool to ensure good governance and create development opportunities for the next  generation. By the Digital Agenda Strategy 2015-2020, we define our vision and will to  become a member of the European Union.  Finally, while thanking all those who contributed to the development of this document,  the donors who support our good-governance initiatives, I would like to invite everyone  to work harder together for a successful delivery of the goals set in this document.         Dr. MILENA HARITO          Minister of Innovation and Public Administration    8  INTRODUCTION   Information and Communication Techno-  logies (ICT) play a specific role in the deve-  lopment of a competitive economy based on  knowledge and innovation. This technology  allows for a higher life quality for the citi- zens, assists in facilitation and efficiency of  business processes, as well as the increase  of effectiveness and governance transfor- mation. Development of the ICT sector is  considered a horizontal policy since the   effects and influence of its implementa- tion is extended on all social and economic   sectors of the country.  Priorities of ICT on a European level are   contained in Europe 20201 - a strategy for  a sustainable and comprehensive growth,  which aims at the preparation of the EU  economy for the challenges of the next dec- ade. The Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE)2,  is directly related to the field of Information  and Communication Technology. To draw an analogy with the European   Union policies and priorities, the develo-  pment of ICT and the digital agenda are part  of the programme of the Albanian Gove-  rnment for 2013-2017. The programme  views the ICT and e-services development  as closely related to the economic and so- cial development of the country. The gove-  rnment programme has determined that the  government will work on three main dire-   ctions by setting out measurable objectives:   - First, in adding and promoting electro-  nic services for citizens, businesses and  administration. Increase of transpare-  ncy and improvement of public admi-  nistration services according to the  Open Government Partnership initiative  will remain a priority.  - Second, in using the ICT for the purposes  of education in order to transcend the  digital gap and to empower the youth.  Policies will be oriented toward the   improvement and expansion of human  capacities in order to increase the nu-  mber of consumers and to promote the  development of e-service providers.  Thus, the creation of youth jobs who  can be employed in the Albanian and re- gional market and beyond that, will be  encouraged.    - Third, in consolidating the digital infra- structure in the whole territory of the  Republic of Albania, by strictly respe-  cting the European principles of free and  honest competition.  Currently, the ICT are one of the major mo-  ving forces of economy. A quarter of GDP’s  growth in the EU comes from the ICT sector.  Investments in ICT and innovation until 2020  are expected to contribute in the producti-   1 http://eur-lex.Evropa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2010:2020:FIN:EN:PDF 2 A Digital Agenda for Europe, COM(2010)245, approved on 19.05.2010, EC, http://www.digitalEvrope.org/ DesktopModules/Bring2mind/DMX/Download.aspx?Command=Core_Download&entryID=157&PortalId=0&Ta- bId=353    9  vity growth in the EU at a rate of 45%. In   Albania, the electronic communication   sector alone as part of ICT contributes in the  GDP at a calculated rate of 5-6%.  ICT and digitalization processes support  modernization as follows:  - Economic processes: through the   improvement of production capacities  based on the ICT, knowledge economy  and establishments of start-ups, deve-  lopment of innovative and intelligent  activities in cities and communities,  production growth in agriculture, social   enterprises, etc.  - Social processes: through the improve- ment of services provided to the co-  mmunity and that of the joint goods  production, stimulation and facilitation  of social innovation, joint establishment  and utilization of resources and fina-  ncing3, etc.  - Institutional and administrative pro- cesses: through the e-government  services, digital identity, facilitation of  inter-institutional interaction, simplifica- tion of institutional and administrative  procedures, delivery of online auxiliary  assistance, participation of citizens and  businesses in the decision making pro- cess, etc.    ICT are seen as a tool that changes the every- day life, transforms the work organization,  changes the existing markets by creating  new opportunities and businesses, changes  participation, cooperation and interaction  models with the Public Administration, for  an open and transparent governance. In this  respect, the objectives are as follows:   - stimulation of the digitalization process  in a systematic and sustainable manner  in every field of life and economy;  - establishment of favorable conditions  for the fruition of suitable infrastru-  ctures, such as, broadband networks,  data center, in order to guarantee high   security levels for the information   networks, integrate and computerize  Public Administration and private sector  services.  ICT and information society developments in  Albania were based on the European model,  just like the “eEurope”, “i2010” plans, etc. They are also compatible with the regional  developments, as well as with the integra- tion perspective of the European Union.  The main objective of the Digital Agenda for  Europe is the establishment of sustainable  economic and social benefits deriving from  the development of a single digital market  based on the utilization of the fast and ultra  fast internet, and of the interacting appli- cations. The Digital Agenda for Europe has  identified seven priority dimensions (pillars)  closely interrelated to each-other:   ► A single digital market;  ► Standards and interaction;  ► Faith and Security;  ► Access to Fast and Ultra Fast Internet;  ► Research and Innovation;  ► Improvement of Knowledge, Skills and   Digital Inclussion;  ► ICT benefits for the whole society;  In November 2013, the Southeastern Euro- pean countries adopted the Regional Strate- gy for Southeastern Europe, SEE-20204. The  objectives for the development of the digital  agenda under the chapter of the Digital So- ciety, header “For a Smart Growth” have an  important place in this strategic document.   Albania’s Digital Agenda for 2015-2020,  which is presented in this document, takes  into consideration the objectives of the re- gional development specified in the Strategy  SEE-2020 and supports the EU Digital Age-  nda. After an analysis of the current situation  and developments, the document sets out  the vision and development objectives for  the period 2015-2020, as well as the main  directions of policies that will be followed to  fulfill these objectives.   3 Known as “crowdsourcing” and “crowdfounding”  4 http://www.rcc.int/files/user/docs/SEE%202020%20Strategy%20Document%20-%20Draft%201.pdf    CH AP  TE R     I 1    11     The Cross-cutting Strategy for the Informa- tion Society 2008-2013, adopted through  Decision No. 59 of the Council of Ministers,  dated 21.01.2009, set out the main develo-  pment directions and objectives in the field  of information society during this period of  time. This document replaced the first do-  cument of the ICT strategy adopted in 2003,  whilst it also ammended the main objectives  for the ICT as specified in the document for  the National Strategy for Development and  Integration 2007-2013.   The Cross-cutting Strategy for the Informa- tion Society (ISSIS) was built in five main  components. This was based on the ICT co-  nditions and information society develo-  pment in 2008, where a very low scale of  internet, PC in the family and fixed telepho- ny were identified, with the scale of mobile  telephony at the level of 70%, a few deve-  lopments of the electronic services main- ly related to business, and an incomplete   institutional and legal framework for the   information society. These components are  as follows:    ► Development of legal and institutional  framework;   ► Development of ICT infrastructure  and the facilitation of cheap and fast   internet;   ► Development of e-governance;  ► Education related to ICT knowledge;  ► Promotion of e-business.  ISSIS was also accompanied by an   action plan which was reviwed in 2011. The   action plan for the period 2011-2013 included   activities related to the development of ICT,  e-governance and the information society  in general. Part of the activities of this plan  were fulfilled, whilst the rest of them are still  ongoing. A number of activities have to be  readdressed and focused toward the frui- tion of the government programme for the  consolidated development of the ICT infra- structure, increase of electronic services as  well as the increase of utilization of these  services by the citizens, business as well as  the public administration itself.   DEVELOPmENT OF THE  LEgAL AND INSTITUTIONAL  FRAmEwORk  During the period of 2008-2013, a series of  laws were drafted and adopted in compli- ance with the European Union standards.  The efforts of the Albanian institutions du-  ring this period were focused into the develo-  pment of the necessary legal and institutio-  nal framework in order to secure an efficient  environment for communicating with the  business, establishment and  maintanance of  the advanced electronic communication for  the needs of the public administration and  electronic governance, legal ammendmends  for the management of the spectrum on the    CURRENT CONDITIONS    12  basis of the principle of technological neu- trality in order to promote the development  of the broadband infrastructure, develo-  pment and delivery of electronic services for  businesses as well as individuals within the  scope of electronic governance.         The Albanin legislation in force related to the  electronic communications, information so- ciety and press, intends to:  - Eliminate the obstacles for the efficient  functioning of the internal market in  the networks and services of electronic  communications;  - Promote competition in the internal  market;  - Protect the consumer, etc.  The Stabilization Agreement, in its Articles  102-104, foresees the obligation of appro-  ximation of internal legislation with that of  the acquis of the EU, as well as the appro-  ximation with the EU policies. Also, the SAA  requires a special attention in relation to re- specting the rights of intellectual property in  programme transmission through the land- line, satelite and cable networks, etc. A number of important laws have been  drafted and adopted in line with the SAA   engagements, such as:  - Law No. 9918, dated 19.05.2008, “On  the Electronic Communications in the  Republic of Albania”, as ammended by  Law No. 102/2012 in compliance with  the latest developments of the acquis of  the EU;  - Law No. 9880, dated 25.2.2008, “On the  Electronic Signature”;  - Law No. 10273, dated 29.4.2010, “On  the Electronic Document”;  - Law No. 10128, dated 11.5.2009, “On  the Electronic Trade”, as ammended by  Law No. 135/2013;  - Law No. 9887, dated 10.3.2010, “On  the Protection of Personal Data”, as am- mended byLaw No. 48/2012 and Law  No. 120/2014;  - Law No. 10325, dated 23.9.2010, “On  the Basis of State Data”;  - Law No. 9380, dated 28.4.2005, “On the  Copyright and other Related Rights”;  - Law No. 72, dated 28.6.2012, “On the  Organisation and Functioning of the Na- tional Geospatial Infrastructure in the  Republic of Albania”;  - Law No. 146/2014 “On the Public Notifi- cation and Consultation”;  - Law No. 119/2014 “On the Right of   Information”;  Albania has harmonized the legislation on  the cyber crime with the European Concil  Convention on Cyber Crime (ETS No. 185).  In 2004, Albania ratified “The Additional  Protocol of the Cyber Crime Convention,  for the penalization of racial and xenopho- bic natured acts carried out via computer   systems” (ETS No. 189) and in 2008 there  were ammendments of the Criminal Code to  also include provisions of cyber crime.   The transposition of Directive 2001/29/EC  related to the Intellectual Property in the   information society is still ongoing.    A number of sub-legal acts mainly related to  e-governance have also been adopted, such  as:  - DCM No. 248, dated 27.4.20075, as  ammended, for the establishment and  functioning of NAIS;  - DCM No. 945, dated 2.11.2012, “On the  Adoption of Regulation “Administration  of the Basis System of State Data”;  - DCM No. 961, dated 24.11.2010, “On  the Establishment of the Regulatory Co- ordination Authority of the basis of state  data”;  - DCM No. 357, dated 24.2.2013, “On the  Adoption of Regulation for the Manage- ment of Electronic Document in the Re- public of Albania”;  - DCM No. 303, dated 31.3.2011, “On  the Establishment of Information and    5DCM No. 703, dated 29.10.2014 has superceeded DCM No. 248, dated 27.4.2007    13  Communication Technological Units at  the line ministry and subordinate insti- tutions”;  - DCM No. 778, dated 7.11.2012, “On the  Approval of General, Minimal Standards  of the ICTU Personnel for the Structural  Organization of ICT”;  - DCM No. 710, dated 21.8.2013, “On  the Estabishment and Functioning of  Systems for the Safeguarding of Info-  rmation, Continuity of Work and Service  Level Agreements”;  - DCM No. 734, dated 28.8.2013, “On the  Establishment of the Unique System of  Registration, Authentication and Ide-  ntification of Users in Retriving Public   Services from Electronic Systems”.  - Directive No. 1, dated 31.12.2012, “On  the verification of the copy letter of the  electronic document in public institu- tions”;  - Directive No. 2, dated 2.9.2013, “On  Standartization of Drafting the TORs for  the ICT projects in public administra- tion”.  Currently, there is a rich legal framework  that directly and indirectly regulates ICT  and information society. However, the  ammendment and improvement of ICT,   e-governance and information society le-  gislation is necessary in order to respond to  the dynamic development of this field and  the establishment of a single digital market  integrated with that of the EU and beyond;  DEVELOPmENT OF ICT  INFRASTRUCTURE  AND THE INTERNET  With the liberalization of the telecommu- nications market and after the privatization  of the state owned companies, the deve-  lopment of ICT infrastructure was seen as  closely related to private investments and  stimulation of policies for private inve-  stments. The adoption of Law No. 9918, da- ted 19.05.2008, “On the Electronic Commu- nications in the Republic of Albania”, marked   an important step toward the full liberaliza- tion of telecommunications market. The law  specifically eliminated the entry barriers in  the market for the entrepreneurs, as well as  it facilitated:   - the right of each entrepreneur to deliv- er electronic communication networks  and services, on the basis of a general   authorization as well as individual ones  in the case of utilization of limited re- sources (frequences and numbers);   - a suitable regulatory environment,  which respects the principle of techno- logical impartiality;  - transferral of rights to utilize the limited  resources through transparent, non-dis- criminatory and proportional proce- dures.  Competition in the electronic communi- cations market has increased and in 2014  there were four mobile telephony operators  in the electronic communications market,  79 alternative fixed telephony operators and  131 providers of internet services, ISP. Three  operators of the mobile telephony provided  broadband mobile services based on the 3G  technology.  In the first half of 2014, published data by  AEPC related to the market indicated the  following figures: 3,473,361 active users of  mobile telephony; 1,058,354 users of broad- band internet from the mobile phones,  while the number of fixed telephony cu-  stomers decreased by reaching 255,358 from  281200 at the end of 2013. The number of  fixed broadband services was 188,668. The scale uf utilization of electronic co-  mmunications, such as the mobile telepho- ny, internet, etc has increased annually. Di-  fferent observations indicate that utilization  of the smart, tablets and other equipment  has increased. Utilization of the social ne-  tworks in the country is wider. There is also  an increasing trend in relation to the traffic  of data communications and a decrease of  the telephone traffic (voice). This is a global  tendency which is also reflected in our cou-  ntry.  Internet penetration according to the pub-    14  lished data by the ITU for Albania is evalu- ated as over 60%, broadband penetration  has increased, especially in the broadband  mobile segment. At the end of 2013, mobile  broadband penetration based on all kinds  of equipment, including the smartphone  and tablet reached 37%. Also, the tariffs for   accessing the Internet have decreased sev- eral times by making this service more   affordable. The speed for providing the   internet service has increased. The most  utilized speed increased from 256kbit/s in  2008-2009 to 2-4Mbit/s. Based on LSMS6  data for 2012 and LSMS data for 2008, the  number of families owning a PC increased by  4-5 times. A more general overview on the  progress of the main indicators of the ele-  ctronic communications sector is provided in  Appendix 2. Despite the progress in the ICT field, Albania  is still far away from the average level of not  just the EU countries, but the regional ones  as well in relation to the access to the infra- structure and the broadband services.   NATIONAL PLAN FOR  THE DEVELOPmENT  OF BROADBAND  The National Plan for the development of  broadband is a strategic document for the  development of the broadband infrastruc- ture and services, adopted by way of DCM  No. 468, dated 30.5.2013. Broadband Na- tional Plan is an important development  because it provides a clear direction of what  the government, public administration and  the regulator such as AEPC are going to do  for the period of 2013-2020. This plan offers  a vision of how access to the internet will  develop by being utilized to the maximum  by the Albanian families, even in the most  remore areas.  The Action Plan for the Broadband Deve-  lopment determines as a vision the develo-   pment of broadband infrastructure and se-  rvices in the whole country in order to gain  access to the electronic services in different  fields, such as, health (e-health), education  (e-education), commerce (e-commerce),  government services (e-government), by  stimulating the economic and social deve-  lopment of the country.  Broadband services facilitate fast and co-  mplete information for the individuals and  businesses, support a better governance,  and according to the ITU7 data, the increase  of broadband penetration level by 10%  brings in an economic growth of the GDP by  1.38% in countries with a low and average  economic level.   In the framework of the implementation of  the Broadband National Plan 2013-2020, a  few activities intending to fulfill the set obje-  ctives related to the regulatory and technical  issues have been undertaken. These activi- ties include the public consultations by AEPC  related to the spectrum issue, the national  conference on the broadband development  by emphasizing the close public-private co- operation and the need for investments, the  establishment of the Regional Development  Fund to support the projects of rural and  regional infrastructure development, ICT,  e-governance, e-learning, etc. Transferral of rights of frequence utilization,  which represent a limited national resource  of a considerable value in the economy of  a country, is based on the principle of te-  chnological neutrality, by giving the ne-  cessary space to the more advanced broad- band mobile communications technologies  LTE/4G  to be applied in their best para-  meters.  An important role in this respect is played by  the release of the spectrum called the Digi- tal Divident, currently used for audio-visual  broadcasting. The digital divident will be  placed at the disposal of the broadband  services of the mobile communications,  thus directly influencing the increase of the  broadband access. Government efforts are   6 Observation for the Subsistence Level carried out by INSTAT 7 http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/treg/broadband/ITU-BB-Reports_Impact-of-Broadband-on-the-Economy.pdf    15  focused into the timely implementation  of the “Strategy on the transferral of the   analogue broadcasts into numerical  ones”. Based on Law No. 97/2013, ”On the   Audio-Visual Media”,  the Authority of the  Audio-Visual Media played an important  role in the release of the Digital Divident and  its utilization for the purposses of the broad- band services.   ICT infrastructure development for fast and  super fast broadband requires the esta-  blishment of the neccessary resources for  the radio spectrum, as a limited natural re- source. Thus, there is a need to draft a clear  spectrum policy to stimulate the longterm  investments in the NGN networks. The   perspective for development of the ele-  ctronic communications sector, the deve-  lopments of the broadband mobile   networks of 4G generation, require a ha-  rmonized integrated development of the ele-  ctronic communications infrastructure.  Joint investments, joint utilizations and  addressing the right of transferral for the  electronic communications networks re- main issues that require a speedy solution.  The wide development of electronic servi-  ces in general and the increase of demand  for them, also require the development of  optic fibre cable infrastructure in the whole  of the country.    DEVELOPmENT OF  e-governance and  INFORmATION SOCIETy   E-governance developments for the period  of 2008-2013, were focused into the central  level and mainly in the government-busi- ness public service (G2B) and G2G. The esta-  blishment of the National Licensing Center,  National Registration Center, the expansion  of GovNET (G2G) infrastructure, the esta-  blishment of infrastructure for interaction,  e-tax, e-procurement, e-customs, e-patents,  e-fines services, Civil State National Regi-  ster, issuance of biometric document, etc  are some of the main developments.     The National Agency for the Information  Society (NAIS) was established in 2007, as  a specialized agency for the e-governance  and information society. During the peri- od of 2008-2014 work was carried out to   expand the coverage of GovNET, to increase  the number of institutions connected to the  GovNET (from 18 institutions in 2008 to 211  by the end of 2014), to create the e-Albania. al portal, to develop the implementation of  e-acts system, to establish the governmental  data center, to establish the infrastructure  for interaction of systems (ESB), to create  the infrastructure for PKI and to deliver se- cure services, to develop the “cloud compu-  ting” infrastructure, etc. Through the governmental data centre, NAIS  offers a series of services concentrated in  the 211 public institutions. This center was  established near the NAIS, according to the  contemporary standards and facilitates the  centralization and integration of all of the  government online services. 15 instituions  were connected to the government gateway  during 2014.   In the health system: There have been a  series of important interventions and inve-  stments in the field of Communication and  Information Technology, such as, “The Pro- ject of Albanian Telemedicine”, impleme-  nted since 2012; The Informative Inocu- lation System, The Electronic System for   Reimbursed Prescriptions, The Electronic  System of Hospital Costs, The Electronic Re-  gister of Pharmaceutical Warehouses and  The Electronic Screening System.  In the field of public finances: The System  of Debt Management and Financial Analy- sis, The Midterm Budgetary Programme and  the Government Financial Computer System  are functioning at the Ministry of Finance.   Within the development of infrastructure   improvement systems, the Ministry of   Finance has also facilitated, among other  things, the investment for “Improving the  Central infrastructure of the Treasury Sys- tem”.  The tax direcorate has established the In- tegrated Tax System, the Electronic Decla- ration Database and the Database for the     16  System of Fiscal Equipment. E-tax services  initially introduced in 2008 are improving  and being enriched with new services. The  Automated System of Customs Data, as well  as the ASYCUDA System are functioning in  the cutoms offices.    In the justice field: A few important projects  were carried out, such as, the establishment  of the Albanian Notary Register, The Ele-  ctronic Case Management System for Judi- cial Execution - ALBIS, The Electronic Court  Cases Registration System - ICMIS, The   Online Court Status Certificate System. The  Office for Registration of Immovable Pro-  perty has established a computerized system  for the registration of immovable property.   In the business field: The establishment of  the National Registration Center and that of  the National Licensing Center were amongst  the initial experiences toward delivering  services to businesses through the one  stop shop centers. The Electronic Business   Register was created and published at   www.qkr.gov.al. Registration of a business  went through an easier and time reducing  procedure. However, business registration  and application at the National Licensing  Center still cannot be fully completed online.  The Project of Online Tracking was imple- mented during 2013-2014 at the NRC and  NLC. The fruition of this project provided  the opportunity for the different subjects  who apply for permitts/licences at the NLC  or NRC tills to follow the progress of the   application online during all of the stages  at the respective NRC (www.qkr.gov.al) and  NLC (www.qkl.gov.al) websites. These developments have had their impact  in improving the general index of readiness  for the electronic governance8. In 2014,   Albania was ranked in the 84rth place out of  190 countries worldwide according to the  Index of Electronic Governance in compari- son with the 85th place out of 182 countries  back in 2008. In the mean time the index  for offering online services (an integral part   of the Index for Electronic Governance) for   Albania grew from 0.3913 in 2008, to 0.4488  in 2014. A detailed information on the pro- gress of indicators for the ICT Development  Index, related to ICT development according  to the ITU publications, e-governance and  e-participation indicator according to the UN  reports, is provided in Appendix 3.   Albania falls into the average level world- wide in relation to e-governance, but  the situation in Albania according to the   UNPAN9reports, remains on lower levels in  the regional ranking: Greece is ranked on  the 34rth place; Croatia is ranked on the  47th place, Bulgaria is ranked on the 73rd  place, Serbia is ranked on the 69th place,  etc.  ICT IN EDUCATION   ICT in education constituted one of the main  directions set out in ISSIS 2008-2013. There  have been a few developments in this field,  but a lot more remains to be done. Curre-  ntly, there are 1496 computer laboratories  in the pre-univerity education. The internet  network has been installed in schools by   allowing students and teachers to utilize   different information sources, as well as   specifically to assist in their work of cu-  rricular projects. Each school has a dedica-  ted broadband connection, but this remains  confined only in the computer laboratories. In 2006, the ICT as a study subject was  taught only in the high school level, whilst in  2014 this was also dissaminated in the basic  education level. It continues on Grade 7 and  is taught until Grade 12.   Schools of basic public education report  15731 PC, out of which only 11331 are   functional, with 4400 PC being non-  functional. Schools report 1631 laptops, out  of which 432 are non-functional.   Pre-University Information Management  System, which would contain the basis of    8The e-Government is based on three main dimensios: (i) availability of online services, (ii) telecommunications  infrastructure, and (iii) human capacity 9 http://unpan3.un.org/egovkb/Portals/egovkb/Documents/un/2014-Survey/E-Gov_Complete_Survey-2014.pdf    17  the student data together with their identi- fication numbers and grades on the school  certificates, as well as the basis of tea-  cher data containing information pertaining  to their skills and knowledge, is currently  non-functional.  The Electronic Higher Education Database,  which includes the National Register of   Students, albeit existing, presents many   issues. The Financial Module which manages  the finances and budget of the educational  institutions in the central and local level,  funcions only partially in a few Regional   Educational Directorates.  Investments in the direction of development  of human resources in utilization of these  systems have been extremely reduced and  this has resulted in a very limited utilization  of them.  In 2012, the piloting scheme of the applica- tion for the Online System of the State Ma-  tura Test using form A2, distribution of the  winners as per the Merit-Preference princi- ple, as well as the online registration of stu- dents at the universities in both stages of the  first round were completed successfully.  The limit values of students for the distri- bution of computer laboratories, respe-  ctively 5 desktops/students and one for the  teacher; 10 desktops/students and one for  the teacher; as well as 15 desktops/stu- dents and one for the teacher have been up  to 300 students, from 300 to 600 students  and over 600 students. The equipment acco-  rding to the above configurations is con- nected through internal cable networks  with Switch, without any management pro- gramme, or application for subject content.  Amongst the ICT issues in education, it is  worth mentioning the following:  - the ratio of computer use per student,  varies from school to school; appro-  ximately, this ratio is 1:27 and in some  cases even lower;  - students may obtain information only  in the computer laboratories, but not  in the other school locations, i.e. the li- brary;  - in more than 1/3 of schools, students   have limited opportunity in obtaining   information online;   - there is a complete lack of digital co-  ntent in the mother-tongue; only inter- net content that varies from the used  source is used;   - there is a risk of exposure towards in- napropriate content;  - there is no awareness for children in in- ternet utilization for phenomenon, such  as, mocking, cyberbullying or grooming.  Despite the investments already carried  out, utilization of ICT in the education insti- tutions is limited. There is a need for more  investments and attention for the ICT in ed- ucation in order to provide a society based  on knowledge and to widely increase the  skills of ICT utilization.   SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH  AND INNOVATION  Policies undertaken in the field of scientific  research during the period of 2009-2013,  intended reforming of this important se-  ctor for the economy and development of  the country. Implementation of this reform  in the science system, as noted, resulted in  a few modest achievements with the main  aim to integrate higher education with  science.   The Agency of Research, Technology and   innovation (ARTI) was established during  this period. The agency made a few efforts  to increase participation in scientific re- search projects in the EU and international  programmes. The Albanian Government set  up funds from the state budget for 550 new  vacancies and supported the best PHD stu- dents through the Brain Gain and the Exce-  llency Fund Programmes.  One of the main indicators of the lack of  progress in the field of scientific research is  the extreme low number of inclussion of the  Albanian research institutions in the inter- national scientific research programmes and  benefits from them. This comes as a result  of the lack of the necessary institutional and     18  human capacities.   There were 245 applications with 34 won  projects for the Seven Framework Pro- gramme FP7, which expreesed in percentage  is a total of 13.87%. This is a very low result  in comparison with the regional countries.  The above situation highlights the need for  further efforts in stimulating applications by  Albanian researchers in the EU scientific re- search programmes.  An agreement between the European Union  and the Republic of Albania on the participa- tion in the Horizon Framework 2020 – Pro- gramme for Research and Innovation was  signed in July 2014.   Future challenges are related to the new re- forms that the government is undertaking in  the higher education and scientific research  and innovation field, intending to: (i) expand  and increase the quality of the scientific re- search and innovation in Albania based on  the OECD indicators; (ii) actively increase the  inclussion of the scientific research institu- tions in the European Research Area (ERA),  (iii) improve the quality and orientation of  the scientific research toward the market  needs through the strengthening of ties of  national and international programmes with  the business.   SECURE INFORmATION SOCIETy   SECURE COmmUNICATIONS,  ELECTRONIC CERTIFICATION   The National Authority on Electronic Certifi- cation has been functioning since 2009. This  institution is responsible for overseeing the  implementation of the law, other sub-legal  acts as well as standards and technical re- quirements that must be met by the Provi-  der of the Certification Service, which issues  electronic qualified certificates.   Currently, there are two CSPs registered at  the ANEC: -The National Agency for Information Soci- ety (NAIS), which offers its service for the   employees of the public administration. This  service is free of charge for these employ- ees.  - ALEAT SHPK, which offers its service for  the state and private sectors, pursuant to  the concenssion contract this institution has  with the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Based  on the digitalization of services provided to  the citizens, efforts are being made for the  electronic services, such as, the electronic  authentication and signature, which allows  for the user’s identity verification and that  of the signed document, in order to facili- tate their utilization in distance and to gua-  rantee the safety in relation to the required   standards in the field.  A new law on the Electronic Signature and  Identification is on its way. This new law   intends to transpose the European Regula- tion No. 910/2014 of the European Parlia- ment and Council, dated 23 June 2014, “On  the Electronic Identification and the Credibi-  lity Services related to Electronic Transa-  ctions in the Internal Market” and repeal Di- rective 1999/93/EC.   ON COmPUTER SECURITy  Apart from the ammendments of the Crimi- nal Code in 2008 and the inclussion of provi-  ssions for the cyber crime pursuant to the  European Council Convention (CoE 185), the  sector for the cyber crime was established  within the State Police and ALCIRT (National  Agency for Computer Security) in 2011.  Currently, the website of the State Police  offers the service of online reporting of co-  mputer crime by reporting the types of vio- lations or cyber crime   in http://www.asp. gov.al/denonco_kk/raportim.php. It is ne-  cessary to have more information and  awareness by the users of this website and  the cyber crime.  A draft of the document related to computer  security expected to be adopted soon, is in  process.   The increase of using ICTs technology pre- sents the need for strengthening the ca-    19  pacities of inter-institutional cooperation in  pursuing and preventing the dangers deriv- ing from cyber crime. Closer cooperation on  the regional and global levels as well as the  improvement of legislation for the security  of networks and information in line with  the EU practices is necessary.   SAFER INTERNET PRACTICES  Albania has adopted an action plan for the  protection of children’s rights (DCM No.  182/2012). This document also foresees a  few activities for the online protection of  children. Pursuant to this plan, in February  2013 the largest electronic communications  companies in Albania and the IT association  company, AITA signed the Code of Conduct,  as a self-regulatory practise. Upon the sign- ing of this code the companies engaged in  delivering technical filtration techniques and  parental advice for the protection of chi-  ldren and young people from the illegal and  harmful electronic communications.  In the last few years Albania has periodically  carried out awareness activities for a safer  internet, as well as activities on the interna- tional day of Safer Internet.  Raising the awareness for parental control,  protection of children from the illegal and  harmful internet and online media content  requires more attention and the engage- ment of different institutions and actors,  such as, the private sector, NGOs, media,  schools and parent community.  Albania is part of the Global Alliance against  the Sexual Exploitation of Children in the  Internet, established on December 5, 2012.  The alliance countries have agreed to work  in achieving four objectives:  - Increase the efforts for the identification  of victims and ensuring that they will re- ceive the necessary assistance, support  and protection;  - Increase the efforts in investigating   the sexual exploitation cases against   children on the internet and identify and  prosecute persons violating the law;  - Increase the awareness of children,   parents, educators and the community  in general in relation to the dangers;  - Reduce the availability of child porno-  graphy on the internet and ri-victimiza- tion of children.   OPEN gOVERNANCE  THROUgH ICT  The Open Governance Partnership (PQH- OGP) is one of the most important instru- ments to stimulate government transpa-  rency at the global level, to increase civic  participation in public life and to use the new  technologies for the improvement of admi-  nistrative efficiency and fighting corruption.  The first OGP Action Plan for 2011-2013 was  mainly focused in the increase of efficiency  for the management of public resource se-  rvices, by implementing measures in the  field of fiscal transparency, access to info-  rmation, utilization of information techno-  logy (IT) and participation of citizens in the  process of development of public policies.  Work was carried out during 2014 to draft a  second OGP action plan. The drafting of this  plan was carried out through a long consu-  ltation process with a wide participation of  the interest groups. The second action plan  entered into force in July 2014. Pursuing  the government programme and the OGP  plan, the document of the policy for the im- plementation of the open data was drafted  and adopted by way of the Decision of the  Council of Ministers No. 147, dated  18.2.2015. The portal for the transparency of budgetary  expenses as a special feature in the website  of the Ministry of Finance10 was established  pursuant to the engagements for an open  governance.  10 http://www.financa.gov.al/al/raportime/thesari/pagesa-te-kryera-nga-drejtoria-e-pergjithshme-e-sherbimeve- financiare;    20  All of the official ministerial websites, as well  as the website of the Prime Minister’s Office  contain a feature on reporting corruption  and receiving civic oppinion related to diffe-  rent issues.   The government plan for 2013 – 2017, fore- sees the “Fulfillment of a wide consultation  process with the civil society regarding the  new legal initiatives, as well as their moni- toring and evaluation”. Pursuant to this pro- gramme and engagements in the OGP, two  laws were adopted, the “Law for Public No- tification and Consultation” and the “Law on  the Right of Information”.  INFRASTRUCTURE FOR  gEOSPATIAL INFORmATION  The Geographical Information (GI) and  the geo spatial data service are a neces- sary part of the information society and   e-Government. ASIG was established pursu- ant to Law No. 72/2012. The basis for the esta-  blishment of the national geo-portal, were  laid during 2014. The establishment of the  National Geo-Portal is e new innovation of  specific importance in respect of the online  service, cartography information and geo-  information together with the database. The  establishment of this service for the very  first time in Albania, makes the unification of  information possible based on the ‘INSPIRE”- standards, avoids the overlapping related to  property relations, eliminates communica- tion bureaucracy and facilitates utilization of  cartography information.   PREPARATION OF LOCAL  gOVERNANCE FOR  e–government   ISSIS strategy for 2008-2013, was focused  in the development of e-governnance at   the central level. This strategy related a few   general objectives for the e-governance at  the local level accompanied by some acti-  vities in the action plan intending to raise  the awareness regarding the e-governance.  Periodical observations on the e-governance  at the local government carried out by NAIS  indicate that there are town halls (like Tira- na, Durres, Korca, Elbasan, Shkodra, Lezha,  etc.) and a few municipalities (like the mu- nicipalities of Shkodra and Lezha districts)  that have developed e-governance practi-  ces, such as providing information related to  services, e-participation, etc.  The use of ICT by these Local Units improved  the administrative processes, facilitated   access to information as well as improved  the quality of services in a number of fields  of the local government activities, such as,   taxes, budgets, territory planning and  management, inspection, emergencies,  inclussion of citizens and business in deci- sion-making and the more advanced models  of establishing the one-stop-shops, etc.   In the mean time there are a large number  of municipalities and city halls that are still  far away from the ICT e-government utili- zation. Despite the efforts, only in very few  cases the LG strategic documents cite obje-  ctives, programmes and projects related to  e-local governance (i.e. Lezha11), which indi- cates lack of a long-term vision in the field of  e-governance of the local government. The  limited presence of the LGUs in the web,   according to the approved standards, is  a sign of a low scale development of the   sector.   The unified and harmonized e-governance  development, both on the central and local  level, as well as the support for the deve-  lopment of the LG e-governance is nece-  ssary to expand the benefits of ICT utiliza- tion in all layers and levels.     11 Strategic Plan of Lezha City Hall, 2013-2030    21  CHALLENgES FOR THE DIgITAL  agenda 2015-2020  Conclussions based on the current situation  indicate that there is still a need for the fo-  llowing: - Legal and regulatory ammendments and   improvements that would respond to  the dynamic development of this field  and the establishment of the single di-  gital market ready to become part of the  regional and global developments;  - ICT infrastructure developments which  should be oriented toward the growth  and expansion of the fast and super fast  broadband in the whole territory of the  country;  - Increase of Internet penetration in the  family and business in the framework of  reducing the digital gap;  - Increase of numbers of online services  that facilitate their utilization partially  or fully in electronic ways ranging from  information to a complete online tra-  nsaction;  - Development of the proper ways of   providing public services through the on- line contact points and one-stop-shops;  - Implementation of the interaction  framework of systems and services;  - Standartization of ICT as a guarantee for  an integrated and sustainable develo-  pment of information society extended  in all sectors;  - Stimulation of the private sector in rela- tion to development of applications in  the interest and response to the needs  of citizens and businesses;  - Development of supporting infrastru-  cture in the public administration, both  at the central and local level, intending  to advance both systems and services;  - Increase of knowledge capacities of ICT  for the administration and other users,  i.e. citizens and businesses;  - Inter-institutional cooperation even at  the regional and global level for a safer  Internet and information society;    CH AP  TE R     I I 2    23  VISION  The Cross-cutting “Digital Agenda of Albania  2015-2020” aims toward the more coordi- nated and efficient direction of investments  in the sector of Informatin Technologies and  Communications, with the emphasis of pro- viding quality services for the citizens and  the improvement of livelihood. These poli- cies are harmonized with the sectorial stra-  tegy and they are also approximated with  European Agenda 2020, as well as with the  Regional Strategy SEE-2020.   Vision A society based in knowledge and info-  rmation, through the consolidation of di-  gital infrastructure in the whole territory  of the Republic of Albania; improvement  of the quality of online public services and  increase of governance transparency    The major priorities of this strategy are: the  improvement of national infrastructure of  information and communication techno-  logy; the development of electronic gove-  rnance and the establishment of a mu-  lti-purpose Cadaster. These are long-term  priorities foreseen in the NSDI and extended  in time for the 2015-2020 period.  1. Improvement of national infrastructure  of the information and communication  technologies, as the main pillar of a fast  development of the information society  and the growth of electronic readiness.   - Increase of access with a high transmi-  ssion speed, of at least 100 Mbps in 50%  of families, and at least, 30 Mbps for the  whole population;  - Growth of population percentage that  utilizes the Internet from 50 % at the  end of 2013 to 90% by the end of 2020;  - Number of businesses using ICT for  e-commerce purposes should be at the  rate of 50%;  - All schools with access to broadband   Internet;  2.

(Growth of the electronic  governance readiness index according  to UNPAN12, from 0. 5046 at the end of  2013 to 0.7 by the end of 2017);  VISION, POLICIES AND STRATEgIC  PRIORITIES  16 United Nations Public Administration Network.    24  - Simplification of administrative proce- dures and riorganization of processes;  - Establishment of a services model that  puts the citizen at the centre through  the creation of a unique till for public  services, as well as the improvement of  access to services for the citizens and  the increase of transparency for the se-  rvices of each public institution, mainly  through the utilization of information  and communication technology;  - Basic systems interrelated at the rate of  100%;  - Basic vital services for citizens and   bussinesses provided electronically,  both at the central and local level;  - 30-50% growth of the scale of users of  electronic services and e-governance;   3. Implementation of the national po-  licy for the Establishment of National  Geospatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI)  and that of the Multi-Purpose Cadaster   Office through the following:  - Creation of the Gravimetric geo-portal  and network;  - Establishment of a Multi-Purpose Cada-  ster Office;  - Functioning and certification of the   active network ALBPOS, as well as that  of the passive network ALBPOS;  - Establishment of the levelling network,  Class I and II, and acquisition of Europe- an certifications;   - Maintanance and update of networks  pursuant to the European standards;  mAIN PRINCIPLES FOR  THE DEVELOPmENT  OF THE DIgITAL AgENDA  Delivering Services to the Citizens and Busi- nesses will be the main engine of this stra-  tegy. Amongst other things, this strategy will  be based on the following principles, which   determine the process of development for  the information society in Albania:   ► People come first. Each programme,  project and activity must respect the ci-  tizens’ rights, by also including the pri- vacy right.    ► Individual empowerment. Indivi-  dual empowerment as a result of the   transforming power of the digital te-  chnologies in all our economy and so- ciety. The growth of utilization of di-  gital technologies will also result in the  growth of individual empowerment.    ► access to services delivered by the go-  vernment. The Government will invest  in systems, infrastructure and servic- es that intend to reduce corruption,   increase transparency and increase   interaction with citizens and businesses.     ► Full compliance with the european   Union Policies. The establishment of the  information society in Albania should be  in compliance with the aquis of the Euro- pean Union. It should also be in compli- ance with the International Telecommu- nications Union (ITU) policies, Council of  Europe policies and other international  and regional organisations policies while  taking into account the level of national  development and country’s situation.     ► national integration of Ict resources.  Improvement of efficiency of ICT public  investments based on the integration of  data for complete suitability between  systems. Compliance with the EU sta-  ndards for a single digital market.     ► transborder and regional cooperation  and beyond. This cooperation will be fo- cused in a few fields, such as, research  and innovation, information and co-  mmunication technologies competitive- ness of small and average enterprises,  social inclusion, harmonization of the  online digital protection, etc, pursuant  to Pillar 1 of the European Digital Age-  nda 2020 - Single Digital Market13.  13 http://ec.Evropa.eu/digital-agenda/en/our-goals/pillar-i-digital-single-market#Article    25   ► cg-Lg cooperation. The Government  will draft supporting and regulatory po-  licies for the digitalization of local gove-  rnance services, as well as will coordi- nate the inter-operability for the joint  and delegated e-services.    ► trust and security of information ne-  tworks. The Government will imple- ment a system of norms, sanctions and  resources in order to guarantee the data  and ICT systems security. All the efforts  undertaken in the field of information  society must follow the agreed princi- ples and security standards in order not  to create additional conditions that may  compromise or violate the personal data  or those of a third party. These efforts  include the identification and authenti- cation, data protection, protection from  cyber crime, protection of intellectual  data, consumer protection, etc.   ► effectiveness and efficiency. Develo-  pment of the information society should  be implemented through projects that  support the goals and priorities of state  policies, as determined by the strategy  at the national, regional and local level  through the more efficient and effective  use of limited resources.     ► Quality of digital content. Each activi- ty, project or initiative that leads to the   establishment of the digital content,  especially those that are of a national   character, will be supported and stru-  ctured as part of the national digital   inheritance.     ► Private-Public cooperation – Partne- rship (PPP). In its activities, the   Government will cooperate, based on  the knowledge, skills and flexibility, with  businesses, universities, non-profitable  organizations and NGOs in Albania, for  an efficient development of the informa- tion society in the country.    ► technological neutrality. The principle  of technological neutrality in the regu- latory activities related to the develo-  pment of electronic communications  will be applied in order to protect the  interest of citizens and consumers, as  well as to ensure an open Internet.    The Digital Agenda 2015-2020 expands its   effects in all of the economic and social  sectors of the country. This is based on the  nature of ICT, as a technology of a general  interest and also because of the increased  influence of its utilization.   Development of information society in   Albania constitutes a joint objective of all  actors, such as, the public sector, the aca- demic world, NOGs, civil society and private  organizations. The successful completion of  this objective is related to the proper coordi- nation and harmonization of developments  among all sectors and actors.     CH AP  TE R     I II 3    27  ISSDA strategy 2015-2020, is part of the  strategic framework drafted by the Alba- nian Government that covers all the deve-  lopment fields of society and governance. In  order to have a society based on knowledge  and information, a sustainable economic  and social development, a consolidation of  the digital infrastructure in the whole terri- tory of the Republic of Albania, is needed in  order to develop these fields. At the same  time, the strategy will strictly respect the  European principles of a free and honest co-  mpetition, by improving the quality of pu-  blic services and increasing governance tra-  nsparency.   The objectives and foreseen activities to be  carried out according to the determined  fields have been specified as follows:  STRATEgIC PRIORITy 1:  POLICIES FOR THE DEVELOPmENT  OF ELECTRONIC gOVERNANCE  AND DELIVERy OF INTERACTIVE  PUBLIC SERVICES FOR CITIzENS  AND BUSINESSES   Policies of developing electronic governance  aim at providing digital quality services for  citizens. This new approach will increase the  opportunity for a better performance in the  work of CG and LG institutions as a result of  the joint efforts for more sustainable, long- term and safer solutions. The final goal is   work coordination and cooperation among  the actors in the ICT field in the delivery of  digital services.   objective 1       Increase and promote the electronic   services and e-services by 30% for citizens  and businesses. Increase of transparency and   improvement of public administration se-  rvices according to the Open Government  Partnership initiative will remain a priority.  Taking into consideration the above   objective all the decisions for ICT budgetary  investments should be in line with the mid- term government budgetary programmes  which serve also as a tool for the application  of priorities of the Albanian Government.  Achievement of this objective will be aimed  through the following activities:   Improvement of public services;  Improvement of public services includes the  establishment of front and back-office sys- tems, receipt of documents issued by the  Albanian state in the central and local level,  applications and claims, financial actions,  etc intending the delivery of these services  through unique centers for the integrated  services, like the one stop shops.   Improvement of government efficie-  ncy in the administration of income and   expenses;  POLICy OBJECTIVES AND mAJOR  PRODUCTS     28  This section intends to improve the existing  systems and establish new ICT systems that  include the following ones, such as, taxation,  customs, contract and concession manage- ment, social assistance and disabled persons  programmes, administration and manage- ment of state properties, administration of  agricultural, health, education, justice, LG  expenses, etc.   Assistance of ICT systems in the success- ful application of the administrative, ter- ritorial and justice reforms;  Implementation of the large reforms   undertaken by the Albanian Government,  such as, the territorial, administrative and  justice reforms, clearly require the support  of the ICT systems, as auxiliary elements  of their fruition. Taking into consideration  this goal the objective aims at the establi-  shment and operation of the following: the  Address System and its connection with the  National Population Register, ICT systems  that assist in increasing the performance  of LG, improvement of ICT systems serving  the courts, public notary and bailiffs offices,  property registration, efficient management  of correctional services, increase the levels  of central and local administration, etc.   Increase of efficiency in the production,  agriculture, tourism and industry sectors  through the ICT systems;  This section intends to modernize the pro- duction sectors in the country through the  ICT utilization, in order to facilitate the fulfill- ment of standards and the quality of prod- ucts and services in line with the directives  of European Community, aiming at the in- crease of exports for agricultural, farming,  food and mineral products, as well as for the  transfer of technologies.    Administration and standardization of  state data, as an auxiliary tool in the  well-functioning and administration of  information  serving the growth of ser- vices for citizens and businesses, public  safety and fight against crime;  This activity will aim at the consolidation  of current databasis as well as the establi-  shment of new state databasis, their intera-  ction and intervention with the online data  and application systems. We need to bear  in mind that the basis for the establishment  and consolidation of these databasis will be  the unique identification number for indivi-  duals and businesses.   Increase of human capacities by starting  to utilize new technologies from the pre- school systems to the public administra- tion and high ranking officials;  Albanian society needs to be prepared for  the new challenges which emphasize the  acquisiton of new information technologies.  On the other hand, each current or new ICT  system cannot be operational without the  assistance of human resources who need to  be prepared for their utilization. Thus, it is  necessary to apply ICT education systems,  starting from the pre-school, elementary,  high school, university, professional edu- cation up to the enhancement of ICT kno-  wledge for the civil servants of central and  local administration, in all levels.    Ehancement of performance and effi- ciency of LG throguh the utilization on  the new ICT systems and methodologies;  The goal of the Albanian Government is to  establish a relationship of quality service be- tween central and local administration and  the public by treating each citizen according  to the customer care principle in regard to  governmental services. Thus, the enhance- ment and consolidation of ICT utilization in  the central administration cannot be sepa- rated by their utilization in the local admini-  stration, which is responsible for a large  number of public services.    Increase transparency for the public.  This serves the interest of communica- tion with the public and the fight against  corruption;  This activity aims at increasing the pu-     29  blic credibility towards the Government,  enhancing information related to gove-  rnmental income and expenditure, for the  recruitment process and operation of state  administration, for governmental obliga- tions and engagements, current legislation  and legal initiaties, decisions and orders,  international engagements, etc.. This part  of the programme also included the obliga- tions deriving from the initiative for an open  partnership (OGP).   Integration of all IT systems and ele-  ctronic services through the practical   implementation of interaction of   connected IT systems and “e-Services”;  This activity intends to: - Increase the number of complete ele-   ctronic services accessed from every  equipment connected to the Internet,  such as, computer, mobile telephone,  iPad, etc...;  - Facilitate access and improve electro-  nic services for the citizens and busine-  sses through their online option in the  unique governmental portal e-albania.  - Fighting against corruption by reducing  bureaucracy in the public administra- tion;  - Increase efficiency, effectiveness and  governmental transparency based on  the principles of the initiative for an  open governance;  - Enhance citizens participation in gove-  rnance and decision making, etc.  objective 2       Innovation against corruption – One Stop  Shops.  For the first time ever, the Albanian Govern- ment has undertaken the reform for deliver- ing integrated public services. These services  will be provided by the public administration  in the One-Stop-Shops. The ‘Innovation against Corruption” pro- gramme aims at reforming the concept of   public service by contributing to the mo-  dernization of public services, by simplifying,  integrating and unifying the service delivery  in a single center (The Public Service Center).  The programme will also provide its contri- bution to one of the government priorities  – the fight against corruption.  This dual mission (improvement of public  services and the fight against corruption)  will be achieved by implementing a series of  reforms: innovation of administrative proce- dure, as well as the necessary ICT tools and  instruments for the distribution of services  in a PSM format. Enhancement of benefits,  improvement of service delivery and redu-  ction of corruption leads to the following: • Reduction of time and expenses for citi-  zens in obtaining public services; • Obtaining of services from one single   window; • Improvement of quality services by uti-  lizing new innovative solutions; • Increase the credibility and enjoyment   by the citizens in relation to the ma-  nner the services are delivered from the   administration;  In order to achieve this major objective, a  few steps which consist of the following will  be carried out:  • Improvement of the regulatory envi- ronment and riconstruction of the new  engineering structure by also bulding up  the institutional coordination;   • Establishment of the necessary infra- structure (Digitalization and Moderniza- tion + Establishment);   • Putting in place of an internal monito-  ring system;  • Centralized model of service delivery; • Increase the accountability by publi-   shing performance results;  • Improvement and consolidation of ICT   infrastructure development.  objective 3        Ammendment and improvement of the legal  and regulatory framework for the e-gove-     30  rnance and information society.   The mid-term plan foresees the following: - Drafting and adoption of the law on   electronic governance with its sub-legal  acts to be used for its implementation;  - Drafting and adoption of the sub-legal  act for the implementation of the law  “On Public Notification and Consulta- tion”;  - Draft decision “Establishment and rules  for the administration of Electronic Re-  gister for public notifications and consu-  ltations”;  - Drafting and adoption of the law for the  electronic identification in line with the  EU acquis.  objective 4       Development of Electronic Governance  (e-Governance), intending to improve the  e-goevrnance index by 5 points (places).  Developments related to e-Governance will  be led by the principles of good and tra-  nsparent governance by stimulating a coo-  peration culture and aiming towards an  open, flexible and cooperating administra- tion with citizens and businesses. As a ca-  ndidate country, Albania will pursue the EU  practises related to the e-Governance and  will aim toward the implementation of the  EU ministers declaration for the e-Gove-  rnance.  Implementation of Objective 3 will be   fulfilled through the following activities: - Implementation of the National Inter-  action Framework, based on the Euro- pean Interaction Network in order to  complete the interaction of electronic  systems;  - Promotion of electronic services for cit- izens and businesses provided through  the Governmental Interaction Platform,  as well as the increase of new services  in the governmental portal e-Albania.al,  and the increase of online payment se-  rvices, etc...;  - Implementation of the electronic   exchange documents system, ERDMS  in all the line ministries and the central  administration and impovement of the  e-cabinet service;  - Establishment of the open data portal,  as part of the unique services portal   www.e-albania.al;   - Establishment, implementation of  the tracking system for the requests   addressed to the line ministries;  - Implementation of the electronic   signature whilst delivering official servi-  ces and communications;  - Further development of the foreign fi- nances management system, EAMIS;  - Increase of security of the physical and  logistical infrastructure of the gove-  rnmental network, GovNET ;  - Continuous improvement of capacities  of the Center for Governmental Data;  - Development of e-governance in the  Local Government Units (LGUs) through  the following:  o Implementation of the unified info-  rmative portal and electronic services  for the Local Government Units (LGUs);  o Fruition of interaction between the  Governmental Platform of System   Interaction of the LGUs with the central  systems, starting with ZRPP, NRC, RKGJC;  o Integration of services related to LGUs  in the service portal e-Albania, starting  with the display of information related  to the local tax obligations for the citi- zens;  o Establishment of IT platforms for the   administration of documents and track- ing of service dissemination in the LGUs;  - Awareness against the danger from cy- ber crime. Different activities will take  place in this regard in order to enhance  the inter-institutional cooperation be- tween the different structures of info-  rmation technology for the awareness  of the different interest groups and pre- vention of these dangers as well as the  development of safer internet practices;   Close cooperation with the national and     31  international research and development  centers in order to support the exchange  of geo-information between authorities  (techniques) and to improve geo-info-  rmation technologies;   Establishment of the National Electronic  Cadaster of Water Resources;   The establishment of the National Ele-  ctronic Cadaster for the underground  and surface drinking waters, highli-  ghted as a national priority, will require  the carrying out of the following acti-  vities:  Establishment of the infrastructure for the  management of water resources from the  qualitative and quantitative perspective at  the level of the national basin through the  GIS system.  Integrated management through the GIS  system of water resources thanks to the re- alization of balance between water resou-  rces, analysis of water resources users, co-  ntrol of the quantity and quality of utiliza- tion of water resources.    Electronic access to the Protected Areas  This is related to the security of transparency  with the public and other interested actors  during the decision-taking process and legal  initiatives in the nature field. The planned  activities consist on the establishment of an  online portal with access by the public and  actors to legally drafted documents which  are in process.

In the mean  time, for the same period there was a  reduction in relation to the fixed telephony  segment. These tendencies are similar  to the tendencies of the recent years,  whereupon the utilization of fixed telephony  was decreasing and was being replaced  by the mobile telephony. Also, the access  to the broadband segment has sustained  growth on both of its segments: from the  fixed networks as well as from the mobile  networks.   The number of active mobile phone users  (subscribers who have utilized mobile  services in the last 3 months) by the end of  2013 reached 3.7 million, compared to 3.5  million at the end of 2012. This consists of an  annual growth of 4% for the four operators,  whilst the number of users of the mobile  telephony according to the active SIM cards,  sustained a decrease by 6%, by reaching 5.3  million compared to 5.6 million by the end  of 2012. The penetration rate (number of  users per 100 inhabitants) in 2013 was 130%  according to the active users and 187%  according to the SIM card users.   The number of fixed telephony subscribers by  the end of 2013, reached approximately 281  thousand compared to 311 thousand by the  end of 2012, thus consisting in a reduction  by 10%. The reduction of the number of   subscribers for the fixed telephony was  following the reduction trend started in  2010 (with the exception of 2011 where a  growth was sustained). This reduction came  as a result of the continuous decrease of the  Albtelecom subscribers by 9%, as well as  the decrease by 13% of subscribers of the  alternative operators. The penetration rate  of the fixed telephony by the end of 2013  was about 10%.  The number of subscribers with fixed  and mobile broadband access (3G USB/ modem cards) by the end of 2013 reached  approximately 294 thousand, consisting in  a 36% growth in comparison with 2012. In  2013, both broadband access segments,  fixed and 3G (with USB/modem cards),  sustained a growth of respectively 14% and  101%. The penetration rate for both types of  access together is 10.4% per population and  37% per family.   Below is an overview of the development  of the number of subscribers for the mobile  telephony (active users) and that of the  fixed telephony in relation to the broadband  access of mobile and fixed networks. The  figures indicate clearly that the rates of  growth for the broadband access in both  networks are higher than those of the  telephony. The fixed networks are even  noticing opposite trends: growth of the  broadband access and reduction of fixed  telephony. In 2013, only 33% of active mobile  users utilized the 3G broadband access and   OVERVIEw OF THE ELECTRONIC  COmmUNICATIONS mARkET  APPENDIX 2    59  the number of subscribers with broadband  access in the fi xed networks consists of 65%  of subscribers of the fi xed telephony.   mOBILE TELEPHONy  The number of acti ve mobile users by the end  of 2013 reached in 3.7 million, compared to  3.5 million at the end of 2012. This consists  of an annual growth of 4% for all four  operators. In the mean ti me, the growth rate  diff ers according to the operatots: Operators  Plus and Vodafone have sustained a growth  of respecti vely 9% and 11%, while operators  Albtelecom (EM) and AMC have sustained a  reducti on of respecti vely 2% and 3%.

FIXED TELEPHONy Even during 2013 the fi xed telephony  conti nued the decreasing trend of the recent  years. Despite the fact that this trend is in  line with the EU countries, the penetrati on  rate of 10% is lower than that of the EU  countries. The number of fi xed telephony  subscribers reached approximately 281  thousand by the end of 2013, compared  to 311 thousand at the end of 2012, thus  a reducti on by 10%. The reducti on came as  a result of the conti nuous decrease by 9%  of the number of Albtelecom subscribers  and the reducti on by 13% of the number of  subscribers of the alternati ve operators.

The calculati on  methodology is provided in the ITU “Informa- ti on Society Measurement” Report.   The table below presents the development  of this indicator in Albania for the period of  2002-2012 in comparison with the regional  and world average. As seen, the IDI index for Albania remains  under the world average and the last one  in Europe, despite the annual growth.  Worldwide, Albania is ranked in the group of  countries with average results of this index  and is closer to the upper limit to move into  the group of countrues with above average  results.

However,  the reports for Albania in the recent years  indicate that our country is one of countries  with the largest growth of the access  sand utilization sub-indexes (The latter is  presented in the ITU Report, MIS/2013).  In order to understand what the important  factors that influence the IDI level are, the  following table carries out a comparison of  the IDI sub-indexes:  - The access sub-index includes: o Penetration of the fixed and mobile   telephony, the international bandwith  (connectivity) for Internet users  - The utilization index includes: - % of families with PCs, % of families with   Internet, Internet Users, penetration of  fixed broadband subscribers, penetra- tion of broadband wireless subscribers  - The proficiency sub-index includes: o % of individuals registered in high school,   % of individuals registered in university,  educated individuals  The study of the subsequent reports  indicates that the ITU calculated results  are not consistent and that they have  differences.   The table below presents the standard of  each of the 11 indicators used to calculate  the IDI index together with the maximum   result marked as the target for the indicator  (the maximum indicator changes, i.e. the  bandwidth for the international internet has  grown several times during the period of  2010-2013).  It is clear that:  - the standard sub-index for the pene- tration of the fixed telephony remains   almost at the same level for the period  of 2002-2012.  - the standard sub-index for the % of   families connected with PCs and the   internet remains low  - the standard sub-index for the broad- band fixed connections remains   extremely low (this depends on the low  penetration of the fixed telephony).  It can also be said that last year’s ITU Report  contained a wrong finding in relation to the  market of the mobile telephony in Albania  (the market has not reached maturity yet)  – and this is also reflected in the following  table. In fact, the penetration of the mobile  telephony is on the upper limit used as the  maximal indicator for the standard of this  sub-index (190%).

In general, the mobile broadband prices  per 500 MB for both the pre-paid and post- paid packages in comparison with other  regional and world countries are in low  levels (affordable) almost at the level of the  developed countries. The mobile broadband  service for 1 GB is at an average level in  comparison with other countries.   e-governance and  e-PartIcIPatIon IndeXes  UPAN periodical reports (UN Public Admi- nistration Network)1 carry out an evaluation  of the e-governance and e-participation  readiness indexes.

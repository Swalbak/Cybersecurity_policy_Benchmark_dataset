This new spirit of Senegal, as set out in a vision of \"An emerging Senegal in 2035\", aims to change how our economy is structured. Directly in line with this vision and amongst other major efforts, Senegal aims to use new technology and information and communications technology (ICT) in particular as the key drivers of this change. It is in this context that Senegal has adopted \"Senegal numérique 2025\" (SN2025) ['Digital Senegal 2025\"], our national strategy to convert Senegal to a digital society. With this in mind, SN2025 is based on three pillars: • The legal and institutional framework • Human resources • Digital confidence As far as the third of these three pillars of SN2025 ('digital confidence') is concerned, it appears that, for all the players involved, protecting infrastructure, information systems and users, and hence protecting cyberspace as a whole is one of the essential pillars of the ambitions which Senegal sets itself in digital terms. To guarantee this digital confidence, the Government of Senegal needs to ensure it has the frameworks, tools, knowhow, resources and capacities required not just to eliminate the vulnerabilities in Senegal's existing information systems, but also ensure we are monitoring for cyberthreats, to prevent cybercrime and prosecute it. The President's order ( on the security policy for the State information systems in Senegal (PSSI-ES) was issued to define the principles and rules to be used an optimum level of security for the government's information systems in accordance with current laws and regulations in force. This \"National Cybersecurity strategy 2022\" (SNC2022) sets out Senegal's strategic vision and aims in terms of cybersecurity, reflected in a constant support for the aims and priorities of SN2025. The key elements of SNC2022 are as follows: • To evaluate the strategic cybersecurity context in Senegal, including present and future threats; • The Government's vision of cybersecurity and the strategic aims to be achieved; • The general principles, roles and responsibilities which can support this strategy; • The logical framework for implementing it. 5 Senegal's cybersecurity vision is entitled, \"In Senegal in 2022, a cyberspace of confidence, secure and robust for all.\". To implement this vision, the Government of Senegal is working to achieve the five strategic aims set out below: 1. Strategic aim 1: strengthen the legal and institutional framework for cybersecurity in Senegal; 2. Strategic aim 2: protect critical information infrastructure (CII) and government information systems in Senegal; 3. Strategic aim 3: promote a cybersecurity culture in Senegal; 4. Strategic aim 4: strengthen our cybersecurity resources and technical knowhow in all sectors; 5. Strategic aim 5: be involved in regional and international cybersecurity work. In implementing SNC2022, the Government of Senegal will follow the principles of: • The rule of law • Shared responsibility • A risk-based approach • Universal access to cyberspace and use it to the full • Collaboration and cooperation amongst all the parties involved. With this in mind, the Government of Senegal will establish a national cybersecurity structure charged with playing a driving role in cybersecurity issues and implementing and coordinating cybersecurity initiatives in Senegal. 6 1 INTRODUCTION Information and communication technology (ICT) is developing rapidly and becoming an increasing part of everyday life in Senegal. In fact, the Senegalese government is actively promoting using ICT generally in everyday life in Senegal via its various national initiatives as described in its strategy SN2025. These initiatives are bringing about a remarkable transformation of Senegal into a digital society in which both public and private sectors use ICT in providing goods and services, conducting transactions and sharing information, enabling people all across Senegal to enjoy an economically wealthier everyday life. Converting Senegal to digital will involve creating new dependencies, not only on systems, data, infrastructure and cyberspace itself, but also in providing critical services. Any loss of confidence in these systems could harm the digitalisation of Senegal and would limit the benefits of this transformation. As ICT becomes increasingly integrated in all aspects of life, Senegal will inevitably face growing cyberthreats where troublemakers will continue to exploit our vulnerabilities. These troublemakers are using increasingly sophisticated methods and instruments to hack into information systems, steal, alter or even destroy personal data and public or private institutional data. Protecting these systems and data thus becomes a national priority as far as Senegal is concerned. SNC2022 is inspired by the priorities as set out in the PSE, Presidential order 003/PR of 03 January 2017 on PSSI-ES and the aims of SN2025, proposing a global approach in which private individuals, the private sector and government institutions all play their part to the full. In fact, it is these players who will ensure that a dynamic cybersecurity sector grows, along with a skills base which will enable Senegal to keep up to date and monitor the developing cyberthreat environment. This SNC2022 also reflects Senegal's determination and commitment to combat cyberthreats, now and in future. 7 2 CONTEXT AND SCOPE OF SNC2022 2.1 Strategic context Since 2004, Senegal has liberalised the telecommunications sector, establishing a legislative and regulatory framework aimed at growing ICT in a secure environment, making the extent and impact of developing technology more transparent in Senegal. In fact, the trends and opportunities observed have increased rapidly since then, with new online technologies, services and applications appearing fast. These developments have also created major opportunities for economic and social growth for Senegal, and will continue to offer major advantages for companies online. Like any other country, turning Senegal digital will mean relying increasingly on data networks and systems; inevitably, though, these trends will provide more opportunities for individual and groups of troublemakers to compromise these data networks and systems. There are no frontiers in cyberspace, so cybercriminals will continue to intensify their efforts and increase their abilities to target individuals' and organisations' systems across the world, including in Senegal. 2.1.1 Threats 2.1.1.1 Cybercrime To SNC2022, there are two kinds of cybercrime, as follows: • Offences which can only be committed using ICT (knowing that these technologies can be used both as the means for committing these offences and as their targets), such as designing and distributing malware with a view to financial and other gains; • Conventional offences which are perpetrated or aggravated by using ICT. Cybercrime and cyber-offences are often committed in or against Senegal for financial motives. Those who commit these offences may live in Senegal or anywhere else for that matter; but, even if there are signs of cybercrime and those responsible are identified, it is very often difficult for the forces of law and their international counterparts to pursue offenders, particularly if they are in jurisdictions with limited capacities and/or those which do not have any partnership agreements with Senegal, even though we have divisions specialising in combating cybercrime in our Police and national Gendarmerie, each with their own specialist human and technical resources to help investigate cybercrimes and cyber-offences. As well as the complex threat of cybercrime which faces Senegal, there is also organised crime working via the 'dark web'. As well as being vulnerable to malware and sophisticated attacks aimed at individuals' and organisations' systems and networks, Senegal is exposed to increasingly aggressive attacks such as ransomware and distributed denial of service (DDoS). As well as the threats from organised crime groups, there is also a more ongoing form of cybercrime, less sophisticated but more common, against individuals and. Mobile identity theft and fraud are examples of this kind of cybercrime aimed at individuals and organisations via financial transactions. 8 Although Senegal has Law no. 2008-11 on cybercrime of 25 January 2008, this raises questions and has its own shortcomings, making it less effective. It refers partly to the Criminal Code and partly to the Criminal Procedural Code, for example, which have not themselves been kept up to date with the environment and trends observed in Senegal. 2.1.1.2 'Hacktivism' Hacktivist groups are generally motivated by a political and social agenda and work on a decentralised basis: so they tend to attack their targets in the interests of specific causes or in pursuit of apparent demands. Although most hacktivist attacks are disturbing by their very nature and include attacks such as DDoS and hijacking websites, they have not mostly caused any major or lasting damage to their targets to date. 2.1.1.3 Internal threats Internal threats are one of the main risks to any organisation, including those in Senegal. An organisation's staff can access systems and critical data, which is a threat in itself, as they can cause financial and reputational damage by stealing sensitive data. Such staff can also use their knowledge of their organisation to enable or commit attacks designed to stop it working properly. As well as acting deliberately, staff can cause damage unintentionally by not knowing about their organisation's security procedures, particularly by downloading unprotected content, using infected peripherals and opening phishing e-mails. They may also become victims of social engineering via which they may unwittingly allow access to their networks or execute instructions which appear harmless in themselves but which benefit cyber-criminals. With this in mind, the President of the Republic's office, via the National Cryptology Commission (CNC) has taken the offensive and prescribed detailed measures for the security policy for Government information systems in Senegal (PSSI-ES). 2.1.1.4 Cyberterrorism and extremism Global trends suggest terrorist groups are still considering conducting cyberattacks against countries they target and continue to use the Internet to recruit and radicalise individuals online, be it against Senegal or other countries. Senegal could be a target for such groups one day, so we need to be aware of this threat. Although terrorist groups continue to prefer physical attacks, as economies and societies become increasingly digital worldwide, the probability of highly-qualified terrorist groups or 'lone wolves' increases likewise; and Senegal's reputation could suffer should it turn out that Senegalese acting alone are involved in attacking third countries. All this could be a major threat to Senegal and its interests in the future, so it is vital that we consider this in our strategy. 2.1.1.5 Direct and indirect threats from States Current trends in cyberespionage and cyberattacks amongst others indicate amongst other things that countries believe increasingly they are targeted, becoming the targets of State- sponsored terrorists seeking to penetrate their governments' systems and networks for political, technological or economic purposes. It is essential that Senegal should be aware of this threat and take steps to mitigate it. 9 2.1.2 Vulnerabilities Trends and forecasts globally1 indicate the rapid proliferation to come of the 'Internet of things' and that Senegal's commitment to digitalising its economy and society suggests there will be new vulnerabilities which can be exploited, even attacked on a grand scale. Indeed, considering the growing devices and processes which are interconnected or connected to the Internet, the vulnerabilities Senegal faces will include those of not having security devices at equipment level, but also threats to interconnected systems on which our society depends. As networks, systems and software become increasingly vulnerable, it is becoming urgent for our country to develop good practices and cybersecurity processes in all sectors. This need manifested itself since the recent large-scale attacks observed worldwide, like Wannacry in 2017, which hit many governments and businesses worldwide. As most cyberattacks are made exploiting known vulnerabilities and can easily be resolved, it is essential that each country take steps to encourage individuals, enterprises and institutions to take the measures required and invest adequately in reducing these vulnerabilities. This is consistent with the current situation in Senegal where, despite the work which has been done, we still lack the skills and knowhow to handle the cybersecurity requirements of the private and public sectors. Apart from IT engineers, most staff and officers of most private and public sector organisations in Senegal are unaware just how serious cyberthreats are and are not aware enough of this. Some major private sector organisations like banks and telecoms operators know something about cybersecurity and tend to promote the development of a cybersecurity-oriented culture amongst their staff, particularly in terms of high-risk practices; but there are many organisations, particularly those offering financial services, which do not always take steps which are adequate to their vulnerabilities. Considering there is no coordinated awareness programme at national level aimed at all sectors of Senegalese society, the general public is not aware of cybersecurity issues enough. One major vulnerability which we currently see in Senegal involves the shortcomings in the field of specialist skills and abilities required to keep abreast with what is happening in cybernetics and adequate technologies to manage the risks and threats involved. It is vital that Senegal deals with these shortcomings. Many public and private sector organisations in Senegal and individuals also tend to use systems which keep using obsolete or unprotected software versions. In many cases, we find they are using software which suppliers no longer support or for which protection systems no longer exist. Software which is unprotected or obsolete usually suffers from vulnerabilities which those who create cyberthreats search for and exploit. 2.2 Scope of the strategy SNC2022 explains Senegal's strategic vision and aims in terms of cybersecurity and a commitment to supporting national priorities constantly in promoting converting Senegal to digital. SNC2022 aims to guide the State's actions in terms of cybersecurity by offering the people of Senegal a vision, including public and private sector organisations, civil society and other stakeholders. 1 Roundup Of Internet Of Things Forecasts And Market Estimates, 2016 - 2016/#368ddbb9292d 10 SNC2022 covers the whole of Senegal, and announces actions aimed at all sectors of the economy and strata of Senegalese society, including government institutions, private sector organisations and private individuals. The Government will therefore make every effort to ensure that the strategy is implemented for the common good. SNC2022 also proposes improving cybersecurity constantly at all levels for the common good, and defines the context in which Senegal is involved at international level to develop a safe, secure cyberspace. The strategy defines cybersecurity as protecting information systems (software, hardware and infrastructure), the data they contain and the services they supply or on which they rely against all unlawful access, modifications, obstructions and usage, including actions, whether unlawful or not, due to failing to apply good practice or security procedures properly. The key elements in SNC2022 are as follows: • Evaluating the strategic context of cybersecurity in Senegal, including current and future threats; • The Government's vision for cybersecurity and the strategic aims to be achieved; • General principles, roles and responsibilities which can reinforce this strategy; • The logical framework for implementing it. 3 APPROACH The Government's approach to meet the cyberthreats Senegal faces is based on a precise vision and strategic aims. This approach will strengthen everything which is being done in Senegal to improve companies' cybersecurity by private individuals, public and private sector organisations and civil society and the academic world. 3.1 Vision statement The strategic vision as proposed represents what Senegal wants for the future. It is rational, all-embracing and forward-looking, analysing the reference situation for cybersecurity2 and defining the course for the various strategic development aims. To this end, the vision says: \"In Senegal in 2022, a cyberspace of confidence, secure and robust for all\" 3.2 Strategic aims To realise this vision, the Government of Senegal will endeavour to reach five strategic aims as follows: 1. Strategic aim 1: strengthen the legal and institutional cybersecurity framework in Senegal; 2. Strategic aim 2: protect critical information infrastructures (CII) and information systems of the State of Senegal; 2 The reference situation in Senegal in terms of cybersecurity, by experts from Oxford University, March 2016 11 3. Strategic aim 3: promote a cybersecurity culture in Senegal; 4. Strategic aim 4: strengthen resources and technical knowhow in cybersecurity in all sectors 5. Strategic aim 5: be involved in regional and international work on cybersecurity. 3.3 Governing principles In realising these aims, the Government of Senegal will follow the principles below: 1. The primacy of law: SNC2022 will be implemented in accordance with the laws in force in Senegal and international standards to protect rights in Senegal. 2. Shared responsibility: SNC 2022 will ensure that everyone involved in the cybersecurity ecosystem in Senegal, such as the authorities, businesses and other organisations and private individuals, commits themselves to protecting their data and IT systems to ensure they are robust and help ensure that other stakeholders' data and IT systems are secure. 3. A risk-based approach: the Government of Senegal commits itself to ensuring that everyone involved in the cybersecurity ecosystem in Senegal, such as the authorities, businesses and other organisations and private individuals, adopts a risk-based approach in evaluating and monitoring threats, in responding to incidents in cyberspace or in working in cybersecurity. 4. Universal access to cyberspace and using it to the full: the Government of Senegal will work to ensure that everyone involved in the cybersecurity ecosystem in Senegal, such as the authorities, businesses and other organisations and private individuals enjoys cyberspace to the full and uses it to the full to develop encourage more extended socioeconomic development in Senegal. 5. Cooperation and collaboration amongst stakeholders: the Government of Senegal recognises the roles and responsibilities of the different players involved in protecting the interests of the Senegalese in cyberspace, and commits itself to working and cooperating with all the stakeholders involved in the cybersecurity ecosystem in Senegal, such as the authorities, businesses and other organisations and private individuals and organisations outside Senegal and with international organisations to protect Senegal in cyberspace. 3.4 Overall approach to achieve these strategic aims To ensure everything we do in terms of cybersecurity is as harmonised as possible, SNC2022 will be implemented as follows. In implementing SNC2022, the Government of Senegal will work proactively to ensure that the tools and resources required to ensure the public and private sectors, civil society and anyone living in Senegal are sheltered from cyberthreats. It must also ensure that all the players above can develop the skills and resources and the ability to protect their IT systems and data per se dynamically. 12 4 AIMS TO BE ACHIEVED The elements below constitute the 'specific aims' and 'actions' to be implemented by 2022 to achieve the 'strategic aims' above and achieve the results desired. They are based on the principles as identified above, and are in line with the approach above: 4.1 Strategic aim 1: strengthen the legal and institutional framework for cybersecurity in Senegal We need to improve the current legal and regulatory framework in Senegal so we can manage cyberthreats effectively and combat cybercrime, while at the same time ensuring that the new opportunities created by turning Senegal digital become the aces of our economy. We also need an institutional framework to ensure effective governance of cybersecurity in Senegal, supported by clear functions and roles and well-defined responsibilities and processes. 4.1.1 Specific aim 1.1: strengthen the legal framework of cybersecurity While Senegal continues transforming itself into a digital society as defined in SN2025, it must at the same time combat various kinds of cybercrime and protect its cyber-interests. Also, given that the cybernetic landscape is developing rapidly and continuously, Senegal will need to review our laws and regulations regularly to ensure they are up to date and reflect emerging trends. Expected outcomes: 4.1.1.1 Senegal will have an up to date system of laws and regulations in line with developments in cyberspace and international standards, enabling us to combat the malignant cyber activities which threaten our country or which are committed in it. 4.1.1.2 Senegal's system of laws and regulations will provide judicial and security units which have the tools and technologies they need to combat cybercrime. Actions: 4.1.1.1 Analyse the shortcomings in the laws and regulations concerning ICT and develop adequate tools to improve the cyber-environment and combat cybercrime. 4.1.1.2 Subscribe to regional and international conventions on cybercrime and cybersecurity. 4.1.1.3 Examine and improve the laws and regulations on the procedural powers in investigating cybercrime to prevent, respond to and pursue those who commit those crimes more effectively. 4.1.1.4 Strengthen our laws and regulations on data protection and bring them in line with international standards. 13 4.1.2 Specific aim 1.2: strengthen the institutional framework to ensure effective governance in cybersecurity Faced with the increasingly complex threats and challenges cybersecurity involves, the Government of Senegal owes it to itself to provide a strong leadership and effective governance. For this, it is essential that the Government creates an institutional framework which encourages and enables cybersecurity activities to be coordinated quickly and promptly, combined with a coherent, structured approach. This framework will articulate and attribute a set of functions relevant to cybersecurity governance in our country, comprising reviewing SNC2022 regularly, strategic advice and leadership, monitoring cybersecurity initiatives, coordinating detecting and responding to cyber-incidents at national level and preparing private and public organisations and those who have or use IT systems in Senegal in particular. Expected outcomes: 4.1.2.1 An operational centralised adequate governance structure has been created. 4.1.2.2 A coherent, effective national approach to develop, implement and coordinate cybersecurity operations in Senegal is effective. Actions: 4.1.2.1 Establish a national cybersecurity structure which will implement SNC2022 and be responsible for developing and coordinating national cybersecurity operations. 4.1.2.2 Implement the CERT/CSIRT national structure in the shape of a unit within the national cybersecurity structure with precise defined functions and responsibilities, including responding to incidents. 4.1.2.3 Identify the relevant public and private sector institutions and use them to make up a consultative committee on cybersecurity whose purpose will be to advise our national cybersecurity structure on matters of strategy. 4.1.2.4 Set up a cyber-defence command and control centre. 4.1.2.5 Strengthen the powers of the defence and security forces and their resources used in combating cybercrime, particularly in using investigation and evidential procedures effectively against crimes and offences committed using digital resources or IT networks. 4.1.2.6 Draw up a cyber-defence strategy which defines our national approach to the cyberthreats facing our national security. 14 4.1.3 Specific aim 1.3: establish cybersecurity standards, guidelines and an operational and technical framework Senegal will develop and implement standards and guidelines and operational structures to ensure that public and private sector organisations and those who own and operate critical information infrastructures (CIIs) and our citizens adopt good practices and common actions in the field of cybersecurity. These practices and measures must be founded on the national definition of cybersecurity in Senegal. Desired outcomes: 4.1.3.1 Clear, understandable and appropriate cybersecurity standards and guidelines are issued, an operational and technical framework, processes and procedures are established and respected in Senegal. Actions: 4.1.3.1 Issue a set of cybersecurity standards based on international standards but adapted to national level, including on software and writing its source code. 4.1.3.2 Implement an operational and technical management charged with issuing cybersecurity standards and monitoring that they are applied. 4.1.3.3 Promote awareness and implement standards in public and private sectors, amongst SMEs above all. 4.2 Strategic aim 2: strengthen the protection of critical information infrastructures (CIIs) and government information systems in Senegal The systems and networks which make up cyberspace must be able to keep working during and after cyber-incidents. That is why protecting our Government's systems and networks and those of CIIs are an absolute priority as far as the Government is concerned. The Government will work to ensure that CIIs and Senegalese information systems as a whole can withstand cyber-attacks. For this, it is essential that private sector organisations and their managers and Boards in particular are not just aware of their responsibilities and obligations, but also have the right support to enable them to implement adequate measures to meet cyberthreats. 4.2.1 Specific aim 2.1: ensure critical information infrastructures are protected and that Senegal's information systems are safe To ensure CIIs are protected and Senegal's IT systems are secure, the Government must first understand what their vulnerabilities are. Expected outcomes: 4.2.1.1 An exhaustive survey of the vulnerabilities and security levels of the CIIs and Senegal's information systems is available. 4.2.1.2 Design and implement essential measures to improve and showcase how secure Senegal's CIIs and information systems are. 15 4.2.1.3 Owners of CIIs and information systems' abilities to manage cyberthreats and cyber incidents is improved. Actions: 4.2.1.1 Establish a directory of CIIs and information systems in Senegal. 4.2.1.2 Define the cybersecurity frameworks, procedures and processes required for any institution which has or manages CIIs and Senegal's information systems. 4.2.1.3 Establish a framework for managing the vulnerabilities of CIIs and Government information system to encourage monitoring them regularly. 4.2.1.4 Conduct tests and other surveillance activities regularly on CIIs and information systems in Senegal. 4.2.1.5 Define minimum and maximum security requirements for Senegal's CIIs and information systems. 4.2.2 Specific aim 2.2: monitor cyberthreats and risk management permanently The number and gravity of the cyberthreats and cyber-risks facing individuals and organisations continues to grow. Our national cybersecurity structure will be responsible for coordinating managing these cyberthreats and risks, current or emergent, at national level. Expected outcomes: 4.2.2.1 A coordinating national approach and implementation for managing incidents, supported by a current statement of cyberthreats have been adopted. 4.2.2.2 Senegal now has a better understanding of the size and scale of cyberthreats since cyber- incidents were reported to our national cybersecurity structure 4.2.2.3 Senegal's management of cyber-incidents has been more complete, effective and efficient since a centralised authority was set up for reporting incidents and response to the national cybersecurity structure. Actions: 4.2.2.1 Define minimum requirements in keeping records of incidents needed to analyse them. 4.2.2.2 Monitor, analyse and manage threats and risks continuously, mitigate, prepare for, respond to and recover from incidents. 4.2.2.3 Set up a national register of risks, regulations and national directives to promote evaluating and managing risks. 4.2.2.4 Create a cybernetic incident log and update it continuously, assess such incidents and offer solutions. 4.2.2.5 Implement data protection and risk management procedures. 16 4.2.2.6 Design and implement scenarios and programmes for simulating cybersecurity incidents to be used in national drills. 4.2.2.7 Implement national crisis management measures, conduct regular tests by way of cyberattack exercises and evaluate the learnings from these exercises to improve these measures. 4.2.2.8 Create and update continuously an emergency cybersecurity plan defining the roles and responsibilities of the national cybersecurity structure and the defence and security forces in the event of cyberattacks. 4.3 Strategic aim 3: promote a cybersecurity culture in Senegal Whether digitalising Senegal succeeds depends on whether organisations and individuals have confidence in online services: so the Government needs to work with the public and private sectors to increase their knowledge and understanding of the cyberthreats Senegal and its people currently face. In fact, while a number of organisations, especially in banking and telecoms, are already taking steps to protect themselves, they are still in a minority. 4.3.1 Specific aim 3.1: make all the groups concerned and the general public aware of the security risks in cyberspace. The Government will run awareness campaigns aimed at both the general public and organisations on cybersecurity risks and how to protect themselves. To do this, it will adopt a range of approaches to optimise the impact of these campaigns, and will work as required in partnership with other organisations and those which offer their customers interfaces exposed to cyberthreats in particular. Expected outcomes: 4.3.1.1 Individuals and organisations have adopted good practices to reduce the number, severity and impact of the successful cyber-attacks which occur in Senegal continuously. 4.3.1.2 Individuals and organisations understand how important cybersecurity is, what their responsibilities and obligations are and what they need to do to protect themselves, promoting a cybersecurity culture in Senegal generally. Actions: 4.3.1.1 Conduct a national study to establish how aware people are of cybersecurity at all levels of society and implement a national awareness programme to cover the various target groups. 4.3.1.2 Spread good practice in cybersecurity. 4.3.1.3 Provide mandatory cybersecurity training for senior officers and directors in the private sector so they understand the risks and threats involved better and how to mitigate them. 4.3.2 Specific aim 3.2: establish a reliable environment of confidence to provide government services online and electronic transactions Spreading online services and government services online and electronic transactions are major elements in working towards a digital Senegal. To achieve this aim, the Government must take up the crucial challenge of the security of services in Senegal. In fact, a minimum 17 level of security needs to be established so individuals and organisations in Senegal can use digital services in confidence. To do this, the Government will implement specific security measures for these services to encourage people to be confident in them. These include: • Authentication, validating an individual's or entity's identity • Confidentiality, protecting data so only those authorised can access it • Integrity, providing assurance this data has not been modified or falsified • Nonrepudiation, certifying people have been involved in an action or transaction. More specifically, the Government will amongst other things develop the integration of a key management infrastructure (KMI), IPv6 standard and minimum security standards in designing and deploying government services online and electronic transactions. The Senegalese Government's activities towards this aim are in line with the relevant initiatives defined by SN2025 such as government business architecture or systems for paying taxes and customs duties electronically. Expected outcomes: 4.3.2.1 Monitoring and minimum cybersecurity requirements are implemented in government services online and electronic transactions, which organisations and people in Senegal and from abroad use fully confidently. Actions: 4.3.2.1 Encourage the use of KMI security functions, particularly confidentiality, authentication and integrity to create reliable, secure environments for government services online and electronic transactions. 4.3.2.2 Migrate from IPv4 protocol to IPv6. 4.3.2.3 Ensure minimum security requirements are paramount in developing government services online and electronic transactions so people trust in digital. 4.3.3 Specific aim 3.3: promote the use of government services online and electronic transactions The Government fully recognises the importance of developing knowledge of and explaining the aspects of the security of these services in increasing confidence. With this in mind, the Government will focus on spreading information about the security of these services so people and organisations can choose and make informed decisions about using these services. To understand the concerns of people and organisations in Senegal and respond to them, the Government will set up reliable points of contact which will gather details of users' concerns and decide whether the security aspects of those services meet them. The Government will also ensure that these security facilities are presented to those who use these services in a format and in the language of their choice. In summary, the Government will encourage users, organisations and the government to communicate effectively to maintain confidence in these services. 18 Expected outcomes: 4.3.3.1 People have confidence in using government services online and electronic transactions in Senegal. Actions: 4.3.3.2 Set up national points of contact on cybersecurity whose role, amongst other things, will be to gather details of the concerns of those who use government services online and electronic transactions, respond to these concerns and encourage people to use these services. 4.3.3.3 Tell people about cybersecurity measures put in place for government services online and electronic transactions. 4.4 Strategic aim 4: strengthen cybersecurity resources and technical knowhow in all sectors Competent, qualified human resources in cybersecurity will be needed if an innovative and dynamic ecosystem is to emerge in this specific sector of ICT. Senegal currently has shortcomings in cybersecurity both in education and professional training programmes, staff development and specialist cybersecurity careers. To tackle these, the Government will make developing skills and critical expertise in cybersecurity in Senegal a major priority. 4.4.1 Specific aim 4.1: strengthen resources and technical knowhow in cybersecurity To realise this aim, the Government will set up a national programme to strengthen cybersecurity resources to secure CIIs, information systems and Internet access networks in Senegal. Expected outcomes: 4.4.1.1 Senegal will have the skills and expertise to monitor, analyse and manage threats and risks continuously and mitigate, prepare for, respond to and provide feedback on incidents.

This section defines the roles and responsibilities of the key players involved in implementing SNC2022 clearly. The people who live in Senegal are responsible for taking all reasonable steps to protect the data, software, IT hardware and systems which they own or use in their professional or private life. This is essential for Senegal, given that individuals account for a considerable proportion of our population in cyberspace, and could be an effective line of defence in cyberspace against those who wish us harm, but could also make us vulnerable. Organisations in Senegal use connectivity and technology as an integral part of their business; they own and operate digital systems, provide digital services and hold personal data. So their responsibility is to protect the resources they have and use and ensure the continuity and security of the digital services they provide. With this in mind, it is vital that businesses and other organisations use all the standards and practices available to protect all personal data they hold and ensure their security and ability to withstand and survive anything which happens to their systems or services. The Government of Senegal's responsibility is to protect our citizens from harm and bring all criminals to justice. It is also responsible for protecting Senegal against cyberthreats to its national security and critical infrastructures critiques; and, as it provides digital services itself and holds data too, the Government must take strict measures to protect this data and its information systems. As for Senegal's CIIs in providing essential services at national level, and although some of these CIIs or services may be held or operated by the private sector, at the end of the day, the Government is responsible for ensuring that our country is strong and can continue providing the services and functions everyone in Senegal needs. The Government also has a duty to advise and inform organisations and citizens on what they need to do to protect themselves online and issue standards organisations must comply with. The Government must also manage creating an environment which promotes a dynamic, innovative cyber sector in Senegal in which our educational system produces human resources who are able to meet the present and future needs of cybersecurity in Senegal. In a nutshell, the Government of Senegal is responsible for implementing our national cybersecurity strategy. A monitoring and evaluation committee chaired by the Minister for Digital Matters will be set up to monitor and evaluate the impact of implementing SNC2022 to assess and resolve any operational obstacles we encounter and assess the impact and results of SNC2022 in the long term. 22 The authorities, notably the criminal investigation police (police, gendarmes and customs) and the courts will work with our partners bilaterally and multilaterally to strengthen their work in investigating, preventing and prosecuting cybercrime. Our national defence forces (armed forces) are responsible for defending Senegal against cyber-threats against our country's security and sovereignty and investigating all threats in the realm of defence, such as cyberterrorism, cyber-warfare etc. Our national defence forces, via our national cyber-defence command and control centre, are responsible for systems for protecting data and infrastructures used in our national defence and work with our national cybersecurity structure to help protect against and prevent cyber incidents at national level and mitigate their effects and survive incidents. Our national cybersecurity structure will be set up as the central body for cybersecurity in Senegal responsible for implementing SNC2022. It will be responsible for planning, coordinating and implementing cybersecurity initiatives in Senegal. This structure will protect, prevent, mitigate and help everyone in Senegal recover from cyber incidents sur tout le Senegal and advise and assist organisations in Senegal. It will coordinate protecting CIIs and public and private information systems in this country, and develop and ensure they comply with policies, guidelines, standards and good practices. In brief, it will act as a national voice and centre of expertise in cybersecurity. A structure steering committee will be set up to create the national cybersecurity structure. The national cybersecurity consultative committee will be created to provide strategic advice on developing and implementing national initiatives in cybersecurity. The civil society organisations of Senegal will work with other stakeholders in the cybersecurity ecosystem in this country to ensure that public and private sector organisations act transparently and responsibly, to strengthen relations between these organisations and individuals and help make Senegalese society aware of cybersecurity issues. Academics will work with civil society and the public and private sectors to facilitate developing resources and expertise in cybersecurity, helping meet our current and future needs in terms of competent professionals aware of cybersecurity. Academia will also work with the civil society and the public and private sectors to conduct research and development into cybersecurity Those who own and operate critical information infrastructures (CIIs) and information systems in Senegal will be responsible for protecting their information systems, and so must take all necessary steps to protect them against cyber-threats. They must ensure they comply with standards, directives, processes, procedures and frameworks the government of Senegal creates in terms of cybersecurity. 5.2 Monitoring and evaluation Cyber-threats are developing constantly, so the Government is fully aware that, if SNC2022 is to be implemented successfully, it must have a monitoring and evaluation framework added. Conducted effectively, monitoring and evaluation can be used to devise new measures or update those which exist. For this major aspect, the Government's approach will be as follows: 23 5.2.1.1 Establish specific performance goals which can be measured and achieved within set times for different stakeholders responsible for implementing SNC2022. 5.2.1.2 Draw up annual action plans for each project, defining the expected outcomes, the approach to be used in achieving these results and identifying the resources required to ensure they are implemented successfully. These plans will be based on aims, performance indicators and deadlines set as part of the logical framework for implementing SNC2022. 5.2.1.3 Adopt a general monitoring and evaluation plan based on the approach proposed within three (3) months of launching SNC2022. 5.2.1.4 Monitor and evaluate per se the aims and performance indicators as defined in the logical implementation framework and produce provisional evaluation reports. 5.2.1.5 Regular examinations covering developments in realising the results expected, corrective measures and long-term impacts of SNC2022, including: o Annual reviews o A mid-term review at the end of year two of implementing SNC2022; o A long-term review at the end of year four of SNC2022. 6 CONCLUSIONS The rapid development of cyberspace offers major benefits for accelerating the growth of Senegal's economy; but cyberspace also involves vulnerabilities and growing cybercrime which undermine not only confidence in a digital Senegal but the 'digital Senegal 2025' vision itself. SNC2022 sets out the approach and commitment at national level to eliminating these vulnerabilities in relation to CIIs and information systems in Senegal and fighting cybercrime effectively. In taking this approach, Senegal is committed to being proactive faced with current and future threats by giving ourselves adequate resources. Implementing SNC2022 will, in fact, make Senegal more mature in terms of cybersecurity, not only through understanding and managing the vulnerabilities, threats, risks and incidents which cyberspace involves better, but also growing the cybersecurity sector with an expertise and highly competitive local products. By 2022, everyone involved in society will be using cyberspace properly, using all its potentiality in full confidence. 24 7 ANNEXE A – LOGICAL FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTING SNC2022 This annexe presents the key elements necessary to implement this strategy optimally: • Strategic aims: substantive long-term aims which will help achieve the vision; • Specific aims: the steps required to achieve each strategic aim; • Strategies/actions: what needs to be done to achieve the specific aims; • Deliverables/outcomes: results of action taken; • Lead and support agencies: the institutions or bodies which are principally responsible for realising each aim and those which provide supporting services. • Deadline: period in which deliverables/outcomes will be produced and/or strategies or actions implemented. • Key performance indicators: indicators, data measurements and trends which must be monitored to assess how we are progressing in implementing the strategy. • Funding sources: identifying potential funding structures for implementing strategy. 25 Strategic aim 1: strengthening the legal and institutional framework for cybersecurity in Senegal Specific aim 1.1: strengthening the legal framework for cybersecurity Expected outcomes: • Senegal will have an up to date framework of laws and regulations both in line with developments in cyberspace and with international standards, enabling us to combat the cyber-activities of our country's enemies and those which are committed within our country effectively. • Senegal's laws and regulations will provide for criminal investigation and security units with the right tools and technologies to do their job fighting cybercrime Strategies/ actions Lead and support agencies Deliverables/ results Due date Key performance indicators Possible funding sources Estimated cost (XOF) 1.1.1 Analyse the shortcomings in the framework of laws and regulations on ICT and produce adequate tools to improve the cyber environment and fight cybercrime.

Cyberspace is larger than the IT world, and also includes IT networks, IT systems, digital media and data, whether real or virtual. • Distributed denial of service (DDoS): a kind of attack which renders a service unavailable to its normal users, disturbing the normal operation of the system by making large numbers of requests. • Phishing is an insidious system used to get you to reveal your personal details, such as passwords or credit card, social security or bank account numbers. • Cyber incident: an event which represents a potential or actual threat to a device, computer or network connected to the Internet and/or data processed, stored or transmitted on this data and which may need to be responded to to mitigate the effects. • Social engineering: manipulating people psychologically for the purposes of fraud. Social engineering uses psychological, social and, more widely, organisational weaknesses to get something from its intended victims (goods, services, bank transfers, physical or IT access, disclosing confidential information etc.) • Integrity: a system's integrity is the means by which an IT system is protected against malfunctions, aggression and attacks. • Internet: the global public access IT network, a network of networks, with no central brain, made up of millions of networks, both public and private, academic, commercial and governmental, grouped in autonomous networks themselves. 57 • The Internet of things: a global infrastructure for the information society which can be used to use advanced services by interconnecting objects (physical or virtual) thanks to interoperable information and communication technologies which exist or are evolving. • Malware: any kind of software which seeks to harm an IT system without the user's consent. Malware includes viruses, worms, trojans and other threats. • Cyberthreats: anything which can compromise security or damage devices, computers, software or networks online, all the data they contain and the services they provide or support. • Non-repudiation: being able to verify that the sender and receiver are in fact the parties who sent or received a message. • Ransomware: a kind of malware which takes personal data hostage, by encrypting it then demanding that their owner sends money in exchange for the key which can be used to decrypt it. Ransomware can also prevent users accessing a machine until a key or release tool is sent to the victim in exchange for a sum of money. • Resilience: an information system's ability to resist a breakdown or cyberattack and restore itself after an incident. • Risks: the effects of data being attacked without attacking the information system and/or the effects of attacking an information system. • Vulnerability: a weakness in an IT system which enables an attacker to undermine that system's integrity, that is, its normal workings, or the confidentiality or integrity of the data which it contains.",

to meet its development challenges, Senegal has adopted the Emerging Senegal  Plan (Plan Senegal Emergent (PSE)), a national strategy which breaks with the approaches of  recent decades and puts Senegal on a new route to economic and social development. This  new spirit of Senegal, as set out in a vision of \"An emerging Senegal in 2035\", aims to change  how our economy is structured.     Directly in line with this vision and amongst other major efforts, Senegal aims to use new  technology and information and communications technology (ICT) in particular as the key  drivers of this change.     It is in this context that Senegal has adopted \"Senegal numérique 2025\" (SN2025) ['Digital  Senegal 2025\"], our national strategy to convert Senegal to a digital society. With this in mind,  SN2025 is based on three pillars:     • The legal and institutional framework  • Human resources  • Digital confidence     As far as the third of these three pillars of SN2025 ('digital confidence') is concerned, it  appears that, for all the players involved, protecting infrastructure, information systems and  users, and hence protecting cyberspace as a whole is one of the essential pillars of the  ambitions which Senegal sets itself in digital terms.     To guarantee this digital confidence, the Government of Senegal needs to ensure it has the  frameworks, tools, knowhow, resources and capacities required not just to eliminate the  vulnerabilities in Senegal's existing information systems, but also ensure we are monitoring for  cyberthreats, to prevent cybercrime and prosecute it.     The President's order ( https://www.sec.gouv.sn/-PSSI-ES-.html) on the security policy for the  State information systems in Senegal (PSSI-ES) was issued to define the principles and rules  to be used an optimum level of security for the government's information systems in  accordance with current laws and regulations in force.    This \"National Cybersecurity strategy 2022\" (SNC2022) sets out Senegal's strategic vision  and aims in terms of cybersecurity, reflected in a constant support for the aims and priorities of  SN2025.    The key elements of SNC2022 are as follows:     • To evaluate the strategic cybersecurity context in Senegal, including present and  future threats;     • The Government's vision of cybersecurity and the strategic aims to be achieved;      • The general principles, roles and responsibilities which can support this strategy;     • The logical framework for implementing it.            5     Senegal's cybersecurity vision is entitled, \"In Senegal in 2022, a cyberspace of confidence,   secure and robust for all.\".      To implement this vision, the Government of Senegal is working to achieve the five strategic  aims set out below:     1. Strategic aim 1: strengthen the legal and institutional framework for cybersecurity in  Senegal;     2. Strategic aim 2: protect critical information infrastructure (CII) and government   information systems in Senegal;     3. Strategic aim 3: promote a cybersecurity culture in Senegal;     4. Strategic aim 4: strengthen our cybersecurity resources and technical knowhow in all  sectors;     5. Strategic aim 5: be involved in regional and international cybersecurity work.     In implementing SNC2022, the Government of Senegal will follow the principles of:      • The rule of law   • Shared responsibility  • A risk-based approach  • Universal access to cyberspace and use it to the full   • Collaboration and cooperation amongst all the parties involved.      With this in mind, the Government of Senegal will establish a national cybersecurity   structure charged with playing a driving role in cybersecurity issues and implementing and  coordinating cybersecurity initiatives in Senegal.           6        1 INTRODUCTION     Information and communication technology (ICT) is developing rapidly and becoming an  increasing part of everyday life in Senegal. In fact, the Senegalese government is actively  promoting using ICT generally in everyday life in Senegal via its various national initiatives as  described in its strategy SN2025. These initiatives are bringing about a remarkable  transformation of Senegal into a digital society in which both public and private sectors use  ICT in providing goods and services, conducting transactions and sharing information,  enabling people all across Senegal to enjoy an economically wealthier everyday life.    Converting Senegal to digital will involve creating new dependencies, not only on systems,  data, infrastructure and cyberspace itself, but also in providing critical services. Any loss of  confidence in these systems could harm the digitalisation of Senegal and would limit the  benefits of this transformation.     As ICT becomes increasingly integrated in all aspects of life, Senegal will inevitably face  growing cyberthreats where troublemakers will continue to exploit our vulnerabilities. These  troublemakers are using increasingly sophisticated methods and instruments to hack into  information systems, steal, alter or even destroy personal data and public or private  institutional data.     Protecting these systems and data thus becomes a national priority as far as Senegal is  concerned.     SNC2022 is inspired by the priorities as set out in the PSE, Presidential order 003/PR of 03  January 2017 on PSSI-ES and the aims of SN2025, proposing a global approach in which  private individuals, the private sector and government institutions all play their part to the full.  In fact, it is these players who will ensure that a dynamic cybersecurity sector grows, along  with a skills base which will enable Senegal to keep up to date and monitor the developing  cyberthreat environment. This SNC2022 also reflects Senegal's determination and  commitment to combat cyberthreats, now and in future.          7       2 CONTEXT AND SCOPE OF SNC2022     2.1 Strategic context     Since 2004, Senegal has liberalised the telecommunications sector, establishing a legislative  and regulatory framework aimed at growing ICT in a secure environment, making the extent  and impact of developing technology more transparent in Senegal. In fact, the trends and  opportunities observed have increased rapidly since then, with new online technologies,  services and applications appearing fast. These developments have also created major  opportunities for economic and social growth for Senegal, and will continue to offer major  advantages for companies online.     Like any other country, turning Senegal digital will mean relying increasingly on data networks  and systems; inevitably, though, these trends will provide more opportunities for individual and  groups of troublemakers to compromise these data networks and systems. There are no  frontiers in cyberspace, so cybercriminals will continue to intensify their efforts and increase  their abilities to target individuals' and organisations' systems across the world, including in  Senegal.     2.1.1 Threats     2.1.1.1 Cybercrime    To SNC2022, there are two kinds of cybercrime, as follows:      • Offences which can only be committed using ICT (knowing that these technologies can  be used both as the means for committing these offences and as their targets), such  as designing and distributing malware with a view to financial and other gains;      • Conventional offences which are perpetrated or aggravated by using ICT.     Cybercrime and cyber-offences are often committed in or against Senegal for financial  motives. Those who commit these offences may live in Senegal or anywhere else for that  matter; but, even if there are signs of cybercrime and those responsible are identified, it is very  often difficult for the forces of law and their international counterparts to pursue offenders,  particularly if they are in jurisdictions with limited capacities and/or those which do not have  any partnership agreements with Senegal, even though we have divisions specialising in  combating cybercrime in our Police and national Gendarmerie, each with their own specialist  human and technical resources to help investigate cybercrimes and cyber-offences.     As well as the complex threat of cybercrime which faces Senegal, there is also organised  crime working via the 'dark web'. As well as being vulnerable to malware and sophisticated  attacks aimed at individuals' and organisations' systems and networks, Senegal is exposed to  increasingly aggressive attacks such as ransomware and distributed denial of service (DDoS).     As well as the threats from organised crime groups, there is also a more ongoing form of  cybercrime, less sophisticated but more common, against individuals and. Mobile identity theft  and fraud are examples of this kind of cybercrime aimed at individuals and organisations via  financial transactions.             8     Although Senegal has Law no. 2008-11 on cybercrime of 25 January 2008, this raises  questions and has its own shortcomings, making it less effective. It refers partly to the Criminal  Code and partly to the Criminal Procedural Code, for example, which have not themselves  been kept up to date with the environment and trends observed in Senegal.     2.1.1.2 'Hacktivism'    Hacktivist groups are generally motivated by a political and social agenda and work on a  decentralised basis: so they tend to attack their targets in the interests of specific causes or in  pursuit of apparent demands. Although most hacktivist attacks are disturbing by their very  nature and include attacks such as DDoS and hijacking websites, they have not mostly  caused any major or lasting damage to their targets to date.     2.1.1.3 Internal threats    Internal threats are one of the main risks to any organisation, including those in Senegal. An  organisation's staff can access systems and critical data, which is a threat in itself, as they can  cause financial and reputational damage by stealing sensitive data. Such staff can also use  their knowledge of their organisation to enable or commit attacks designed to stop it working  properly. As well as acting deliberately, staff can cause damage unintentionally by not  knowing about their organisation's security procedures, particularly by downloading  unprotected content, using infected peripherals and opening phishing e-mails. They may also  become victims of social engineering via which they may unwittingly allow access to their  networks or execute instructions which appear harmless in themselves but which benefit  cyber-criminals.  With this in mind, the President of the Republic's office, via the National  Cryptology Commission (CNC) has taken the offensive and prescribed detailed measures for  the security policy for Government information systems in Senegal (PSSI-ES).      2.1.1.4 Cyberterrorism and extremism    Global trends suggest terrorist groups are still considering conducting cyberattacks against  countries they target and continue to use the Internet to recruit and radicalise individuals  online, be it against Senegal or other countries. Senegal could be a target for such groups one  day, so we need to be aware of this threat. Although terrorist groups continue to prefer  physical attacks, as economies and societies become increasingly digital worldwide, the  probability of highly-qualified terrorist groups or 'lone wolves' increases likewise; and  Senegal's reputation could suffer should it turn out that Senegalese acting alone are involved  in attacking third countries. All this could be a major threat to Senegal and its interests in the  future, so it is vital that we consider this in our strategy.     2.1.1.5 Direct and indirect threats from States     Current trends in cyberespionage and cyberattacks amongst others indicate amongst other  things that countries believe increasingly they are targeted, becoming the targets of State- sponsored terrorists seeking to penetrate their governments' systems and networks for  political, technological or economic purposes. It is essential that Senegal should be aware of  this threat and take steps to mitigate it.                9     2.1.2 Vulnerabilities     Trends and forecasts globally1 indicate the rapid proliferation to come of the 'Internet of things'  and that Senegal's commitment to digitalising its economy and society suggests there will be  new vulnerabilities which can be exploited, even attacked on a grand scale. Indeed,  considering the growing devices and processes which are interconnected or connected to the  Internet, the vulnerabilities Senegal faces will include those of not having security devices at  equipment level, but also threats to interconnected systems on which our society depends.     As networks, systems and software become increasingly vulnerable, it is becoming urgent for  our country to develop good practices and cybersecurity processes in all sectors. This need  manifested itself since the recent large-scale attacks observed worldwide, like Wannacry in  2017, which hit many governments and businesses worldwide. As most cyberattacks are  made exploiting known vulnerabilities and can easily be resolved, it is essential that each  country take steps to encourage individuals, enterprises and institutions to take the measures  required and invest adequately in reducing these vulnerabilities.    This is consistent with the current situation in Senegal where, despite the work which has  been done, we still lack the skills and knowhow to handle the cybersecurity requirements of  the private and public sectors. Apart from IT engineers, most staff and officers of most private  and public sector organisations in Senegal are unaware just how serious cyberthreats are and  are not aware enough of this. Some major private sector organisations like banks and  telecoms operators know something about cybersecurity and tend to promote the  development of a cybersecurity-oriented culture amongst their staff, particularly in terms of  high-risk practices; but there are many organisations, particularly those offering financial  services, which do not always take steps which are adequate to their vulnerabilities.  Considering there is no coordinated awareness programme at national level aimed at all  sectors of Senegalese society, the general public is not aware of cybersecurity issues enough.     One major vulnerability which we currently see in Senegal involves the shortcomings in the  field of specialist skills and abilities required to keep abreast with what is happening in  cybernetics and adequate technologies to manage the risks and threats involved. It is vital that  Senegal deals with these shortcomings.    Many public and private sector organisations in Senegal and individuals also tend to use  systems which keep using obsolete or unprotected software versions. In many cases, we find  they are using software which suppliers no longer support or for which protection systems no  longer exist. Software which is unprotected or obsolete usually suffers from vulnerabilities  which those who create cyberthreats search for and exploit.     2.2 Scope of the strategy     SNC2022 explains Senegal's strategic vision and aims in terms of cybersecurity and a  commitment to supporting national priorities constantly in promoting converting Senegal to  digital. SNC2022 aims to guide the State's actions in terms of cybersecurity by offering the  people of Senegal a vision, including public and private sector organisations, civil society and  other stakeholders.                                                                   1 Roundup Of Internet Of Things Forecasts And Market Estimates, 2016 -  https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2016/11/27/roundup-of-internet-of-things-forecasts-and-market-estimates- 2016/#368ddbb9292d           10     SNC2022 covers the whole of Senegal, and announces actions aimed at all sectors of the  economy and strata of Senegalese society, including government institutions, private sector  organisations and private individuals. The Government will therefore make every effort to  ensure that the strategy is implemented for the common good. SNC2022 also proposes  improving cybersecurity constantly at all levels for the common good, and defines the context  in which Senegal is involved at international level to develop a safe, secure cyberspace.     The strategy defines cybersecurity as protecting information systems (software, hardware and  infrastructure), the data they contain and the services they supply or on which they rely  against all unlawful access, modifications, obstructions and usage, including actions, whether  unlawful or not, due to failing to apply good practice or security procedures properly.    The key elements in SNC2022 are as follows:     • Evaluating the strategic context of cybersecurity in Senegal, including current and  future threats;     • The Government's vision for cybersecurity and the strategic aims to be achieved;     • General principles, roles and responsibilities which can reinforce this strategy;     • The logical framework for implementing it.      3 APPROACH     The Government's approach to meet the cyberthreats Senegal faces is based on a precise  vision and strategic aims. This approach will strengthen everything which is being done in  Senegal to improve companies' cybersecurity by private individuals, public and private sector  organisations and civil society and the academic world.     3.1 Vision statement     The strategic vision as proposed represents what Senegal wants for the future. It is rational,  all-embracing and forward-looking, analysing the reference situation for cybersecurity2 and  defining the course for the various strategic development aims. To this end, the vision says:     \"In Senegal in 2022, a cyberspace of confidence, secure and robust for all\"      3.2 Strategic aims     To realise this vision, the Government of Senegal will endeavour to reach five strategic aims  as follows:      1. Strategic aim 1: strengthen the legal and institutional cybersecurity framework in  Senegal;     2. Strategic aim 2: protect critical information infrastructures (CII) and information  systems of the State of Senegal;                                                                 2 The reference situation in Senegal in terms of cybersecurity, by experts from Oxford University, March 2016          11     3. Strategic aim 3: promote a cybersecurity culture in Senegal;     4. Strategic aim 4: strengthen resources and technical knowhow in cybersecurity in all  sectors     5. Strategic aim 5: be involved in regional and international work on cybersecurity.        3.3 Governing principles     In realising these aims, the Government of Senegal will follow the principles below:      1. The primacy of law: SNC2022 will be implemented in accordance with the laws in  force in Senegal and international standards to protect rights in Senegal.      2. Shared responsibility: SNC 2022 will ensure that everyone involved in the  cybersecurity ecosystem in Senegal, such as the authorities, businesses and other  organisations and private individuals, commits themselves to protecting their data and  IT systems to ensure they are robust and help ensure that other stakeholders' data and  IT systems are secure.     3. A risk-based approach: the Government of Senegal commits itself to ensuring that   everyone involved in the cybersecurity ecosystem in Senegal, such as the authorities,  businesses and other organisations and private individuals, adopts a risk-based  approach in evaluating and monitoring threats, in responding to incidents in  cyberspace or in working in cybersecurity.     4. Universal access to cyberspace and using it to the full: the Government of   Senegal will work to ensure that everyone involved in the cybersecurity ecosystem in  Senegal, such as the authorities, businesses and other organisations and private  individuals enjoys cyberspace to the full and uses it to the full to develop encourage  more extended socioeconomic development in Senegal.     5. Cooperation and collaboration amongst stakeholders: the Government of Senegal   recognises the roles and responsibilities of the different players involved in protecting  the interests of the Senegalese in cyberspace, and commits itself to working and  cooperating with all the stakeholders involved in the cybersecurity ecosystem in  Senegal, such as the authorities, businesses and other organisations and private  individuals and organisations outside Senegal and with international organisations to  protect Senegal in cyberspace.      3.4 Overall approach to achieve these strategic aims     To ensure everything we do in terms of cybersecurity is as harmonised as possible, SNC2022  will be implemented as follows.      In implementing SNC2022, the Government of Senegal will work proactively to ensure   that the tools and resources required to ensure the public and private sectors, civil   society and anyone living in Senegal are sheltered from cyberthreats. It must also   ensure that all the players above can develop the skills and resources and the ability to   protect their IT systems and data per se dynamically.          12     4 AIMS TO BE ACHIEVED      The elements below constitute the 'specific aims' and 'actions' to be implemented by 2022 to  achieve the 'strategic aims' above and achieve the results desired. They are based on the  principles as identified above, and are in line with the approach above:     4.1 Strategic aim 1: strengthen the legal and institutional framework for   cybersecurity in Senegal     We need to improve the current legal and regulatory framework in Senegal so we can manage  cyberthreats effectively and combat cybercrime, while at the same time ensuring that the new  opportunities created by turning Senegal digital become the aces of our economy.    We also need an institutional framework to ensure effective governance of cybersecurity in  Senegal, supported by clear functions and roles and well-defined responsibilities and  processes.     4.1.1 Specific aim 1.1: strengthen the legal framework of cybersecurity     While Senegal continues transforming itself into a digital society as defined in SN2025, it must  at the same time combat various kinds of cybercrime and protect its cyber-interests. Also,  given that the cybernetic landscape is developing rapidly and continuously, Senegal will need  to review our laws and regulations regularly to ensure they are up to date and reflect emerging  trends.     Expected outcomes:     4.1.1.1    Senegal will have an up to date system of laws and regulations in line with developments in   cyberspace and international standards, enabling us to combat the malignant cyber activities  which threaten our country or which are committed in it.      4.1.1.2   Senegal's system of laws and regulations will provide judicial and security units which have  the tools and technologies they need to combat cybercrime.      Actions:      4.1.1.1   Analyse the shortcomings in the laws and regulations concerning ICT and develop adequate  tools to improve the cyber-environment and combat cybercrime.     4.1.1.2   Subscribe to regional and international conventions on cybercrime and cybersecurity.     4.1.1.3   Examine and improve the laws and regulations on the procedural powers in investigating  cybercrime to prevent, respond to and pursue those who commit those crimes more  effectively.   4.1.1.4   Strengthen our laws and regulations on data protection and bring them in line with  international standards.                    13     4.1.2 Specific aim 1.2: strengthen the institutional framework to ensure effective governance   in cybersecurity     Faced with the increasingly complex threats and challenges cybersecurity involves, the  Government of Senegal owes it to itself to provide a strong leadership and effective  governance. For this, it is essential that the Government creates an institutional framework  which encourages and enables cybersecurity activities to be coordinated quickly and promptly,  combined with a coherent, structured approach. This framework will articulate and attribute a  set of functions relevant to cybersecurity governance in our country, comprising reviewing  SNC2022 regularly, strategic advice and leadership, monitoring cybersecurity initiatives,  coordinating detecting and responding to cyber-incidents at national level and preparing  private and public organisations and those who have or use IT systems in Senegal in  particular.    Expected outcomes:       4.1.2.1 An operational centralised adequate governance structure has been created.     4.1.2.2   A coherent, effective national approach to develop, implement and coordinate cybersecurity   operations in Senegal is effective.     Actions:       4.1.2.1   Establish a national cybersecurity structure which will implement SNC2022 and be responsible  for developing and coordinating national cybersecurity operations.      4.1.2.2   Implement the CERT/CSIRT national structure in the shape of a unit within the national   cybersecurity structure with precise defined functions and responsibilities, including  responding to incidents.      4.1.2.3   Identify the relevant public and private sector institutions and use them to make up a   consultative committee on cybersecurity whose purpose will be to advise our national  cybersecurity structure on matters of strategy.      4.1.2.4   Set up a cyber-defence command and control centre.     4.1.2.5    Strengthen the powers of the defence and security forces and their resources used in   combating cybercrime, particularly in using investigation and evidential procedures effectively  against crimes and offences committed using digital resources or IT networks.     4.1.2.6   Draw up a cyber-defence strategy which defines our national approach to the cyberthreats  facing our national security.           14        4.1.3 Specific aim 1.3: establish cybersecurity standards, guidelines and an operational and   technical framework     Senegal will develop and implement standards and guidelines and operational structures to  ensure that public and private sector organisations and those who own and operate critical  information infrastructures (CIIs) and our citizens adopt good practices and common actions in  the field of cybersecurity. These practices and measures must be founded on the national  definition of cybersecurity in Senegal.    Desired outcomes:      4.1.3.1   Clear, understandable and appropriate cybersecurity standards and guidelines are issued, an   operational and technical framework, processes and procedures are established and  respected in Senegal.       Actions:      4.1.3.1   Issue a set of cybersecurity standards based on international standards but adapted to  national level, including on software and writing its source code.     4.1.3.2   Implement an operational and technical management charged with issuing cybersecurity  standards and monitoring that they are applied.     4.1.3.3   Promote awareness and implement standards in public and private sectors, amongst SMEs  above all.     4.2 Strategic aim 2: strengthen the protection of critical information   infrastructures (CIIs) and government information systems in Senegal     The systems and networks which make up cyberspace must be able to keep working during  and after cyber-incidents. That is why protecting our Government's systems and networks and  those of CIIs are an absolute priority as far as the Government is concerned. The Government  will work to ensure that CIIs and Senegalese information systems as a whole can withstand  cyber-attacks. For this, it is essential that private sector organisations and their managers and  Boards in particular are not just aware of their responsibilities and obligations, but also have  the right support to enable them to implement adequate measures to meet cyberthreats.    4.2.1 Specific aim 2.1: ensure critical information infrastructures are protected and that   Senegal's information systems are safe     To ensure CIIs are protected and Senegal's IT systems are secure, the Government must first  understand what their vulnerabilities are.    Expected outcomes:      4.2.1.1   An exhaustive survey of the vulnerabilities and security levels of the CIIs and Senegal's   information systems is available.     4.2.1.2   Design and implement essential measures to improve and showcase how secure Senegal's   CIIs and information systems are.          15     4.2.1.3   Owners of CIIs and information systems' abilities to manage cyberthreats and cyber incidents  is improved.     Actions:      4.2.1.1 Establish a directory of CIIs and information systems in Senegal.     4.2.1.2   Define the cybersecurity frameworks, procedures and processes required for any institution  which has or manages CIIs and Senegal's information systems.     4.2.1.3   Establish a framework for managing the vulnerabilities of CIIs and Government information  system to encourage monitoring them regularly.      4.2.1.4   Conduct tests and other surveillance activities regularly on CIIs and information systems in  Senegal.      4.2.1.5   Define minimum and maximum security requirements for Senegal's CIIs and information  systems.     4.2.2 Specific aim 2.2: monitor cyberthreats and risk management permanently      The number and gravity of the cyberthreats and cyber-risks facing individuals and  organisations continues to grow. Our national cybersecurity structure will be responsible for  coordinating managing these cyberthreats and risks, current or emergent, at national level.     Expected outcomes:    4.2.2.1  A coordinating national approach and implementation for managing incidents, supported by a   current statement of cyberthreats have been adopted.     4.2.2.2   Senegal now has a better understanding of the size and scale of cyberthreats since cyber- incidents were reported to our national cybersecurity structure     4.2.2.3   Senegal's management of cyber-incidents has been more complete, effective and efficient   since a centralised authority was set up for reporting incidents and response to the national  cybersecurity structure.      Actions:      4.2.2.1   Define minimum requirements in keeping records of incidents needed to analyse them.      4.2.2.2   Monitor, analyse and manage threats and risks continuously, mitigate, prepare for, respond to  and recover from incidents.      4.2.2.3   Set up a national register of risks, regulations and national directives to promote evaluating   and managing risks.      4.2.2.4   Create a cybernetic incident log and update it continuously, assess such incidents and offer  solutions.      4.2.2.5   Implement data protection and risk management procedures.           16     4.2.2.6   Design and implement scenarios and programmes for simulating cybersecurity incidents to be  used in national drills.     4.2.2.7   Implement national crisis management measures, conduct regular tests by way of cyberattack   exercises and evaluate the learnings from these exercises to improve these measures.      4.2.2.8   Create and update continuously an emergency cybersecurity plan defining the roles and  responsibilities of the national cybersecurity structure and the defence and security forces in  the event of cyberattacks.      4.3 Strategic aim 3: promote a cybersecurity culture in Senegal      Whether digitalising Senegal succeeds depends on whether organisations and individuals  have confidence in online services: so the Government needs to work with the public and  private sectors to increase their knowledge and understanding of the cyberthreats Senegal  and its people currently face. In fact, while a number of organisations, especially in banking  and telecoms, are already taking steps to protect themselves, they are still in a minority.     4.3.1 Specific aim 3.1: make all the groups concerned and the general public aware of the   security risks in cyberspace.      The Government will run awareness campaigns aimed at both the general public and organisations on  cybersecurity risks and how to protect themselves. To do this, it will adopt a range of approaches to  optimise the impact of these campaigns, and will work as required in partnership with other  organisations and those which offer their customers interfaces exposed to cyberthreats in particular.     Expected outcomes:     4.3.1.1    Individuals and organisations have adopted good practices to reduce the number, severity   and impact of the successful cyber-attacks which occur in Senegal continuously.     4.3.1.2    Individuals and organisations understand how important cybersecurity is, what their  responsibilities and obligations are and what they need to do to protect themselves, promoting  a cybersecurity culture in Senegal generally.     Actions:      4.3.1.1    Conduct a national study to establish how aware people are of cybersecurity at all levels of  society and implement a national awareness programme to cover the various target groups.      4.3.1.2    Spread good practice in cybersecurity.     4.3.1.3   Provide mandatory cybersecurity training for senior officers and directors in the private sector  so they understand the risks and threats involved better and how to mitigate them.     4.3.2 Specific aim 3.2: establish a reliable environment of confidence to provide government   services online and electronic transactions     Spreading online services and government services online and electronic transactions are  major elements in working towards a digital Senegal. To achieve this aim, the Government  must take up the crucial challenge of the security of services in Senegal. In fact, a minimum          17     level of security needs to be established so individuals and organisations in Senegal can use  digital services in confidence. To do this, the Government will implement specific security  measures for these services to encourage people to be confident in them. These include:      • Authentication, validating an individual's or entity's identity   • Confidentiality, protecting data so only those authorised can access it   • Integrity, providing assurance this data has not been modified or falsified  • Nonrepudiation, certifying people have been involved in an action or transaction.      More specifically, the Government will amongst other things develop the integration of a key  management infrastructure (KMI), IPv6 standard and minimum security standards in designing  and deploying government services online and electronic transactions. The Senegalese  Government's activities towards this aim are in line with the relevant initiatives defined by  SN2025 such as government business architecture or systems for paying taxes and customs  duties electronically.       Expected outcomes:    4.3.2.1    Monitoring and minimum cybersecurity requirements are implemented in government services   online and electronic transactions, which organisations and people in Senegal and from  abroad use fully confidently.       Actions:      4.3.2.1   Encourage the use of KMI security functions, particularly confidentiality, authentication and  integrity to create reliable, secure environments for government services online and electronic  transactions.       4.3.2.2   Migrate from IPv4 protocol to IPv6.     4.3.2.3   Ensure minimum security requirements are paramount in developing government services   online and electronic transactions so people trust in digital.     4.3.3 Specific aim 3.3: promote the use of government services online and electronic   transactions     The Government fully recognises the importance of developing knowledge of and explaining  the aspects of the security of these services in increasing confidence. With this in mind, the   Government will focus on spreading information about the security of these services so people  and organisations can choose and make informed decisions about using these services. To  understand the concerns of people and organisations in Senegal and respond to them, the   Government will set up reliable points of contact which will gather details of users' concerns  and decide whether the security aspects of those services meet them. The Government will  also ensure that these security facilities are presented to those who use these services in a  format and in the language of their choice. In summary, the Government will encourage users,  organisations and the government to communicate effectively to maintain confidence in these  services.                     18     Expected outcomes:     4.3.3.1    People have confidence in using government services online and electronic transactions in   Senegal.      Actions:     4.3.3.2    Set up national points of contact on cybersecurity whose role, amongst other things, will be to   gather details of the concerns of those who use government services online and electronic  transactions, respond to these concerns and encourage people to use these services.     4.3.3.3    Tell people about cybersecurity measures put in place for government services online and  electronic transactions.     4.4 Strategic aim 4: strengthen cybersecurity resources and technical   knowhow in all sectors     Competent, qualified human resources in cybersecurity will be needed if an innovative and  dynamic ecosystem is to emerge in this specific sector of ICT. Senegal currently has  shortcomings in cybersecurity both in education and professional training programmes, staff  development and specialist cybersecurity careers. To tackle these, the Government will make  developing skills and critical expertise in cybersecurity in Senegal a major priority.     4.4.1 Specific aim 4.1: strengthen resources and technical knowhow in cybersecurity        To realise this aim, the Government will set up a national programme to strengthen  cybersecurity resources to secure CIIs, information systems and Internet access networks in  Senegal.      Expected outcomes:    4.4.1.1   Senegal will have the skills and expertise to monitor, analyse and manage threats and risks   continuously and mitigate, prepare for, respond to and provide feedback on incidents.     Actions:      4.4.1.1   Evaluate national and government institutions' CERT/CSIRT resources and technical  knowhow regularly to deal with weaknesses identified.     4.4.1.2   Train and guide national CERT/CSIRT staff regularly so they can handle the most   sophisticated cyber-attacks.    4.4.1.3   Train and guide government institution staff regularly so they have the resources and   knowhow to prepare for, protect themselves against respond to and recover from incidents.      4.4.1.4   Establish basic cybersecurity training requirements for the private and public sectors.                 19     4.4.2 Specific aim 4.2: strengthen the resources and technical knowhow required to apply   laws and regulations effectively      The bodies charged with applying the law will develop the skills and resources required to  implement the legal and regulatory framework and pursue those who commit cybercrime by or  against anyone or any organisation in Senegal.    Expected outcomes:    4.4.2.1   The organisations responsible for applying the law in Senegal have the skills and resources   required to tackle cybercrime.    Actions:      4.4.2.1   Train and guide staff of security services and the courts continuously to strengthen their  resources and technical knowhow to tackle cybercrime.     4.4.2.2   Set up mandatory training in digital investigations and handling evidence for staff of security  services, the courts and other organisations involved in detecting and prosecuting cybercrime.     4.4.3 Specific aim 4.3: ensure there are enough cybersecurity training/jobs      Considering the roles and responsibilities shared between academia, civil society, the public  and private sectors in responding to the shortage of skills in cybersecurity in, the Government  will adopt a consistent national approach to develop these skills so there is more technical  knowhow about cybersecurity locally. Working with all stakeholders, the Government must  increase the number of cybersecurity professionals coming out of Senegal's education system  who have the skills required to meet our current needs.       Expected outcomes:    4.4.3.1    There are national education and training programmes in cybersecurity at pre-school,   primary, secondary and university level    4.4.3.2    Cybersecurity is recognised as a sector with entrance routes and careers clearly defined.    4.4.3.3    Cybersecurity is an essential element of continuous training for everyone involved.     Actions:      4.4.3.1   Draw up a coordinated programme at national level for education and training in cybersecurity,   with a secondary and university arm under the auspices of the ministries concerned.     4.4.3.2   Promote careers in cybersecurity.    4.4.3.3   Evaluate and update programmes and documentation for pre-school, primary, secondary and   university levels to include cybersecurity concepts under the auspices of the ministries in  charge of education.             20     4.4.3.4    Draw up partnership contracts between the universities and major colleges at home and/or  abroad and the public and private sectors to develop cybersecurity studies, research and  training programmes.      4.4.4 Specific aim 4.4: promote the development of the cybersecurity sector in Senegal     The Government will stimulate the growth of an innovative sector in developing reliable  cybersecurity products, within which professionals and organisations will enjoy the support,  skills and investment required to prosper. To this end, the Government will strengthen the  initiatives already under way as part of the SN2025 such as developing digital technology  parks, especially that in Diamniadio or again Startup Senegal.    Expected outcomes:    4.4.4.1   Investment in cybersecurity providers and structures has increased significantly.    4.4.4.2   The cybersecurity sector and its contribution to GDP is increasing annually.    4.4.4.3   The Government is supporting cybersecurity providers and structures proactively in a number   of ways, including public sector contracts and incentives.    Actions:      4.4.4.4   Promote local and foreign investments in cybersecurity in Senegal and offer incentives.      4.4.4.5   Conduct studies on how cybercrime is affecting Senegal's economy.     4.4.4.6   Support local businesses specialising in developing and delivering cybersecurity solutions.    4.5 Strategic aim 5: be involved in regional and international cybersecurity   work      Cyberspace knows no borders, so Senegal will need to work with other countries at regional  and international level if it is to help people trust in digital. For the same reason, the   Government will also make being involved in regional cybersecurity work a priority, and will  work with partners worldwide to meet cybersecurity issues, so helping to contribute to the  emergence of a safer cyberspace.    4.5.1. Specific aim 5.1: strengthen international cooperation on cybersecurity issues   The Government of Senegal will seek to reinforce its collaboration and contribution to cybersecurity  issues, especially in fighting cybercrime and supporting international cooperation in cybersecurity by  taking our place in the cyber-ecosystem globally and encouraging the people of Senegal to behave  responsibly.    Expected outcomes:    4.5.1.1   Senegal is actively and effectively involved in regional and international cybersecurity work.    4.5.1.2   Working together more strongly, bilaterally and multilaterally on cybersecurity issues.               21     Actions:      4.5.1.1   Coordinate Senegal's involvement and strengthen its collaboration with other States and  regional and international partners in cybersecurity, especially in fighting cybercrime.      4.5.1.2    Participate actively in regional and international cybersecurity activities, especially in fighting   cybercrime.      5 MANAGING AND MONITORING IMPLEMENTING SNC2022      5.1 Roles and responsibilities      The Government of Senegal is fully aware how essential governance and an institutional  framework are for cybersecurity, based on the collective responsibility of all stakeholders to  protect IT systems, networks, critical installations, data and users. This section defines the  roles and responsibilities of the key players involved in implementing SNC2022 clearly.    The people who live in Senegal are responsible for taking all reasonable steps to protect the  data, software, IT hardware and systems which they own or use in their professional or private  life. This is essential for Senegal, given that individuals account for a considerable proportion  of our population in cyberspace, and could be an effective line of defence in cyberspace  against those who wish us harm, but could also make us vulnerable.    Organisations in Senegal use connectivity and technology as an integral part of their  business; they own and operate digital systems, provide digital services and hold personal  data. So their responsibility is to protect the resources they have and use and ensure the  continuity and security of the digital services they provide. With this in mind, it is vital that  businesses and other organisations use all the standards and practices available to protect all  personal data they hold and ensure their security and ability to withstand and survive anything  which happens to their systems or services.     The Government of Senegal's responsibility is to protect our citizens from harm and bring all  criminals to justice. It is also responsible for protecting Senegal against cyberthreats to its  national security and critical infrastructures critiques; and, as it provides digital services itself  and holds data too, the Government must take strict measures to protect this data and its  information systems. As for Senegal's CIIs in providing essential services at national level, and  although some of these CIIs or services may be held or operated by the private sector, at the  end of the day, the Government is responsible for ensuring that our country is strong and can  continue providing the services and functions everyone in Senegal needs. The Government  also has a duty to advise and inform organisations and citizens on what they need to do to  protect themselves online and issue standards organisations must comply with. The  Government must also manage creating an environment which promotes a dynamic,  innovative cyber sector in Senegal in which our educational system produces human  resources who are able to meet the present and future needs of cybersecurity in Senegal. In a  nutshell, the Government of Senegal is responsible for implementing our national  cybersecurity strategy. A monitoring and evaluation committee chaired by the Minister for  Digital Matters will be set up to monitor and evaluate the impact of implementing SNC2022 to  assess and resolve any operational obstacles we encounter and assess the impact and results  of SNC2022 in the long term.            22     The authorities, notably the criminal investigation police (police, gendarmes and   customs) and the courts will work with our partners bilaterally and multilaterally to  strengthen their work in investigating, preventing and prosecuting cybercrime.    Our national defence forces (armed forces) are responsible for defending Senegal against  cyber-threats against our country's security and sovereignty and investigating all threats in the  realm of defence, such as cyberterrorism, cyber-warfare etc. Our national defence forces, via  our national cyber-defence command and control centre, are responsible for systems for  protecting data and infrastructures used in our national defence and work with our national  cybersecurity structure to help protect against and prevent cyber incidents at national level  and mitigate their effects and survive incidents.     Our national cybersecurity structure will be set up as the central body for cybersecurity in  Senegal responsible for implementing SNC2022. It will be responsible for planning,  coordinating and implementing cybersecurity initiatives in Senegal. This structure will protect,  prevent, mitigate and help everyone in Senegal recover from cyber incidents sur tout le  Senegal and advise and assist organisations in Senegal. It will coordinate protecting CIIs and  public and private information systems in this country, and develop and ensure they comply  with policies, guidelines, standards and good practices. In brief, it will act as a national voice  and centre of expertise in cybersecurity. A structure steering committee will be set up to  create the national cybersecurity structure.    The national cybersecurity consultative committee will be created to provide strategic  advice on developing and implementing national initiatives in cybersecurity.     The civil society organisations of Senegal will work with other stakeholders in the  cybersecurity ecosystem in this country to ensure that public and private sector organisations  act transparently and responsibly, to strengthen relations between these organisations and  individuals and help make Senegalese society aware of cybersecurity issues.     Academics will work with civil society and the public and private sectors to facilitate  developing resources and expertise in cybersecurity, helping meet our current and future  needs in terms of competent professionals aware of cybersecurity. Academia will also work  with the civil society and the public and private sectors to conduct research and development  into cybersecurity    Those who own and operate critical information infrastructures (CIIs) and information   systems in Senegal will be responsible for protecting their information systems, and so must  take all necessary steps to protect them against cyber-threats. They must ensure they comply  with standards, directives, processes, procedures and frameworks the government of Senegal  creates in terms of cybersecurity.       5.2 Monitoring and evaluation     Cyber-threats are developing constantly, so the Government is fully aware that, if SNC2022 is  to be implemented successfully, it must have a monitoring and evaluation framework added.  Conducted effectively, monitoring and evaluation can be used to devise new measures or  update those which exist.    For this major aspect, the Government's approach will be as follows:          23       5.2.1.1    Establish specific performance goals which can be measured and achieved within set times   for different stakeholders responsible for implementing SNC2022.     5.2.1.2    Draw up annual action plans for each project, defining the expected outcomes, the approach   to be used in achieving these results and identifying the resources required to ensure they are  implemented successfully. These plans will be based on aims, performance indicators and  deadlines set as part of the logical framework for implementing SNC2022.     5.2.1.3    Adopt a general monitoring and evaluation plan based on the approach proposed within three  (3) months of launching SNC2022.     5.2.1.4    Monitor and evaluate per se the aims and performance indicators as defined in the logical  implementation framework and produce provisional evaluation reports.      5.2.1.5    Regular examinations covering developments in realising the results expected, corrective   measures and long-term impacts of SNC2022, including:      o Annual reviews  o A mid-term review at the end of year two of implementing SNC2022;  o A long-term review at the end of year four of SNC2022.      6 CONCLUSIONS     The rapid development of cyberspace offers major benefits for accelerating the growth of  Senegal's economy; but cyberspace also involves vulnerabilities and growing cybercrime  which undermine not only confidence in a digital Senegal but the 'digital Senegal 2025' vision  itself.    SNC2022 sets out the approach and commitment at national level to eliminating these  vulnerabilities in relation to CIIs and information systems in Senegal and fighting cybercrime  effectively.

Cyberspace is larger than the IT world, and  also includes IT networks, IT systems, digital media and data, whether real or virtual.     • Distributed denial of service (DDoS): a kind of attack which renders a service  unavailable to its normal users, disturbing the normal operation of the system by making  large numbers of requests.     • Phishing is an insidious system used to get you to reveal your personal details, such as  passwords or credit card, social security or bank account numbers.     • Cyber incident: an event which represents a potential or actual threat to a device,  computer or network connected to the Internet and/or data processed, stored or  transmitted on this data and which may need to be responded to to mitigate the effects.     • Social engineering: manipulating people psychologically for the purposes of fraud.  Social engineering uses psychological, social and, more widely, organisational  weaknesses to get something from its intended victims (goods, services, bank transfers,  physical or IT access, disclosing confidential information etc.)     • Integrity: a system's integrity is the means by which an IT system is protected against  malfunctions, aggression and attacks.      • Internet: the global public access IT network, a network of networks, with no central  brain, made up of millions of networks, both public and private, academic, commercial  and governmental, grouped in autonomous networks themselves.             57     • The Internet of things: a global infrastructure for the information society which can be  used to use advanced services by interconnecting objects (physical or virtual) thanks to  interoperable information and communication technologies which exist or are evolving.      • Malware: any kind of software which seeks to harm an IT system without the user's  consent. Malware includes viruses, worms, trojans and other threats.     • Cyberthreats: anything which can compromise security or damage devices, computers,  software or networks online, all the data they contain and the services they provide or  support.     • Non-repudiation: being able to verify that the sender and receiver are in fact the parties  who sent or received a message.     • Ransomware: a kind of malware which takes personal data hostage, by encrypting it  then demanding that their owner sends money in exchange for the key which can be  used to decrypt it. Ransomware can also prevent users accessing a machine until a key  or release tool is sent to the victim in exchange for a sum of money.     • Resilience: an information system's ability to resist a breakdown or cyberattack and  restore itself after an incident.      • Risks: the effects of data being attacked without attacking the information system and/or  the effects of attacking an information system.      • Vulnerability: a weakness in an IT system which enables an attacker to undermine that  system's integrity, that is, its normal workings, or the confidentiality or integrity of the  data which it contains.",

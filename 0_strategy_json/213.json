The increase in the use of ICT and Internet is changing the society by creating new ways of connection, communication, cooperation and economic development through the access to cyber space. This has made our society more and more dependant on the use of these technologies. Albania ranks one of the countries where the development of telecommunications, access to Internet and informatization of the society is advancing very quickly. The increase in the use of communication represents an added value for the economic and social development of the country, but at the same time it makes it vulnerable to cyber attacks against state and private actors. The cyber attacks have the potential to seriously damage the exchange of information between the public institutions, the telecommunication and financial and banking system, by interrupting also vital services. 4 This document is developed in support of the new Investment Program of the Albanian Government on ICT:  Improvement of services that are provided to the public;  A safe information society; and The National Security Strategy 2014-2020 (a paragrah is cited from this strategy ‘on setting and complying with the highest standards for the retention and protection of information in all the forms that it exists, by focusing special efforts for the protection from cyber attacks’). 4 National Security Strategy (NSS), 2014 – 2020 In addition to the positive elements, the access to cyber space increases the potential risk for the damage or misuse of data and computer systems. As a consequence of the increase of cyber risks, the security of the integrity of data and confidentiality and a safe access to the cyber space have become one of the biggest challenges, which our society has to face nowadays, turning it into an issue of national security. Policy Paper on Cyber Security 2015 - 2017 9 This document is also in line with the Digital Agenda for Europe 2020 (a sentence is cited  The increase of the trust in ICT through strengthening the security policy for the networks and information) as well as in line with the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace). The purpose of this Policy Paper is to review and coordinate the obligations that stem from the commitments that are undertaken for a safe cyberspace, in order to ensure fulfillment of responsibilities of all the actors in a coordinated way. In this way, the further development of the information society could be ensured as a safe, reliable and open environment as well as the promotion of the values and opportunities provided by the use of cyber space. Following an analysis of the current situation and developments, this document defines the vision and the objectives for the development over the period 2015-2017 and provides the main directions of the policies that will be followed in order to achieve these objectives. The document is based on the best European models and practices with regard to the objectives and solutions that are foreseen, always taking into consideration the specific features of the Albanian society and economy. There is an Action Plan attached to this Policy Paper, which is going to be reviewed at least once a year. The main documents where the Policy Paper on Cyber Security 2015 – 2017 is based on are as follows: ● Digital Agenda of Albania (2014 - 2020) ● National Security Strategy (NSS) ● Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace5 All stakeholders from the public and private sectors are consulted in order to draft this document and assistance is provided also by the European Union experts throuth TAIEX. 5 Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace - Join(2013) 1 final - 7/2/2013 Policy Paper on Cyber Security 2015 - 2017 10 Current situation in Albania The Cross-cutting Strategy on Information Society 2008-2013 (CSIS) approved by the DCM No. 59 dated. 21.1.2009, in addition to being a strategic document that defined the main directions and objectives for the development in the area of information society over the period 2008 – 2013, was the only document which briefly mentioned cyber security as one of the areas, which should be considered as a priority due to the vision of the Albanian Givernment to increase and develop E-Government through the provision of e-services. Computer security was mentioned in the initiatives in the area of information society in the CSIS:  Children’s Online Safety and encourage the coordination of the process on Codes of Conduct  Setting up the National Agency on Cyber Security (ALCIRT)  Developing the Public Key Infrastructure and providing safe services In accordance to the Law \"On Protection of Children’s Rights\", \"The Action Plan on Children 2012 -2015\" approved by Decision of the Council of Ministers No. 182 dated 13.03.2012, the Albanian legislation in force and the best European practice in this area; \"The Safer Social Networking Principles for the EU countries\", published by the European Commission in February 2009 and the document on \"The European Framework for Safer Mobile Use by Younger Teenagers and Children\", signed by different mobile operators in Europe in February 2007, Albanian operators signed on 7 February 2013 “The Code of Conduct for the safer and responsible use of electronic communications networks and services in Albania”. Also, in the course of implementation of the Cross-cutting Strategy on Information Society 2008- 2013 (CSIS), the National Agency on Information Society has provided the following services:  Safe authentication and identification for 25 institutions, 2500 users;  Safe Internet for 65 institutions;  Automatic and central instalation of applications in 2000 PCs of the Ministeries that are in domain; Policy Paper on Cyber Security 2015 - 2017 11  Central management of anti-virus protection for 7 institutions, 1000 computers;  e-signature through Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for 2 institutions; The use of Information and Communications Technology has considerably increased over the recent years. According to the data published by EPCA, the number of active users of mobile phone services reached approximately 3.7 million users by the end of 2013. The penetration rate of mobile telephony based on active SIM cards reached 130%. The broadband Internet access has considerably increased by 14% during 2013 for fixed broadband connections as well as for mobile broadband, for modem card and USB connections 88 - 101% respectively during 2013. In total, the number of broadband subscribers (fixed and mobile) was increased by 36% during 2013. The total number of fixed broadband connections reached up to 182.556 at the end of 2013 and the number of broadband service users based on mobile phones reached up to 1.231.269 at the end of 2013. The number of Internet users in Albania is increased several times over the recent years. According to the data published by the International Telecommunication Union, the penetration of Internet in Albania over the last ten years has increased from 0.97% in 2003 to over 60% in 2013. 5 Year 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Albania 0.97 2.42 6.04 9.61 15.04 23.86 41.20 45.00 49.00 54.66 60.10 In the meantime, the number of violations of the security of networks and information is increasing rapidly. This brings about financial losses and generates new risks and threats for the development of the Information Society. In this context, it is necessary to undertake measures for a safe development of the Information Society. 5 Source: Policy Paper on Cyber Security 2015 - 2017 12 Referring to the official statistics from the Albanian State Police on cyber crime, which is provided as an offence by the Criminal Code of the Republic of Albania, it results that 180 criminal offences were reported over the period January – December 2014; 76 of them are detected, with 86 offenders, 74 of them are on bail, 10 are arrested and 2 are at large. 108 criminal offences were reported over the period January – December 2013, 63 of them are detected, with 69 offenders, out of whom 58 are on bail, 9 arrested and 2 are at large.

Policy Paper on Cyber Security 2015 - 2017 18 Vision, principles and strategic objectives The cyber space should be considered as a multidimentional area, with several layers and territories, beyond the national borders. The cyber security should be based on the following basic principles: - Protection of fundamental human rights, freedom of speech, personal data and privacy: Cyber security could be efficient only in case it is based on the fundamental human rights and freedoms, pursuant to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and universal values of the EU. Reciprocally, the rights of individuals could not be ensured without having safe networks and systems in place. Every exchange of information, when it includes personal data, should be made in accordance with the EU legislation on Data Protection and the Law No. 9887, dated 10.03.2008, as amended “On Protection of Personal Data” and should also take into consideration the rights of individuals in this area. - Providing access to all citizens: Limited access and/or lack of access to Internet and the digital illiteracy constitute a disadvantage for citizens, taking into account that the digital world characterizes the activity within the society. Every human being should be able to access Internet and have an unlimited information flow. The integrity and security of Internet should be guaranteed in order to provide safe access to all. - Shared responsibility: Cyber security can not be regarded as a problem that impacts or belongs to one institution, public institutions, private sector or to citizens. It is a problem that impacts all the areas of life and society. As such, it asks for necessary security measures by all the users of ICT and the cyber space. THIS DOCUMENT DEFINES THE FOLLOWING VISION: For a safer, more reliable and more sustainable cyber space for the citizens, business and the Government, in support of the economic and social development of Albania. Policy Paper on Cyber Security 2015 - 2017 19 - Strengthening the cooperation and coordination: Based on the shared responsibilities, it is necessary to increase the cooperation and coordination between all the actors. In order to achieve the goal it is necessary to strengthen of interinstitutional cooperation, the cooperation with the public and private sector and the cooperation with the academic world. - International cooperation: The cyber space, as a space without borders, asks for an international cooperation and coordination, in order to ensure cyber security. Also, as Albania has joined NATO and the progress it has made towards EU membership, it is more and more an active partner of the initiatives and programes on cyber security and it should fulfil its commitments to the ally countries. - Administration of risk: The increase in the use of ICT and the trend for an ever more interconnected world has increased the risks that we are facing. Albania will undertake the necessary measures for the administration of risk based on the best standards and practices, in order to ensure the cyber security. - Abiding by the values: This document will serve as orientation to take all the measures, to develop the policies, standards, guides and procedures in order to ensure protection from the cyber risks, by complying at any time with the fundamental rights and freedoms and other democratic principles. The strategic objectives that will be followed in order to achieve the vision and observe the above-mentioned principles are as follows: i. Complete the legal framework in the cybersecurity area ii. Raise the awareness of cyber security iii. Increase the level of knowledge, skills and capacities for expertise in the cybersecurity area iv. Identification and Protection of Critical Information Infrastructure (CIIP) v. Developing and implementing minimum cybersecurity requirements vi. Increase the investments in order to enhance security in the state networks/systems Policy Paper on Cyber Security 2015 - 2017 20 vii. Strengthening the partnership with other counterpart structures inside and outside the country; Policies that should be followed Completion of the legal framework in the cybersecurity area Pursuant to the developments and initiatives, the necessary measures will be taken to analyse, adjust and complete the legislation in the cyber area. The best practices from the world, recommendations and international initiatives in this area, especially those from NATO and EU, will be assessed on a continuous basis, by adjusting the measures in the cybersecurity area, in accordance with the commitments that are undertaken to international partners. If it will be deemed necessary, they will be adjusted and approved, thus ensuring the increase of cybersecurity and the fight against cyber crime. It results from the analysis that was conducted to develop this Document that there are some ambiguities in the existing legal and institutional framework, which need to be addressed in the course of completion of legislation, as follows: a) Modernization of the legislation in force and reviewing it periodically in order to address cyber security connected to the developments of cyber space in Albania and harmonization with the international legislation, in order that the legislation that remains is suitable and effective. To promote the use of qualified electronic signatures in electronic transactions is under way these initiatives: - Drafting of the Draft Law on the Use of Secure Electronic Identification, Electronic Seals in e-government services; in order to guarantee identity in the virtual world either this is for natural and legal persons. Currently the draft law \"On electronic identification and trusted services \" is in the process of consulting the Assembly. Meanwhile, the regulation is ready harmonized with European law enforcement law 910/2014, which is expected to be adopted with the decision of the Council of Ministers after the adoption of the draft law. This legal package is expected to increase confidence in the online environment for the purpose of economic and social development, increasing trust the lack of which to date has caused the legal uncertainty that makes consumers, businesses and public authorities hesitate in conducting online transactions. - Widespread use of website and web server certificates for it will be introduced guaranteeing the secure identity of the public institutions and other private companies which offer electronic services in the interaction of public institutions with citizens, or business. Policy Paper on Cyber Security 2015 - 2017 21 b) Ordering/making it obligatory the periodic auditing and assessment of suitability and efficiency of the security of information systems, pursuant to the legal and regulatory framework in force. These measures will be taken in order to complete the current legislation in force 11 , which foresees auditing of state databases, leaving the systems in general outside the spectrum of action. c) Implement clear procedures under which state institutions that provide e-services for citizen, business, or for interaction between institutions will access the basics of it state data for the purpose of interoperability and improvement of service quality beneficiaries. d) Strengthening the institutions and increase in the security in the public administration by applying procedures and basic requirements that are accepted by all the actors. Strengthening the institutional framework a) Implementation of procedures for the protection of personal data of citizens in obtaining e- services. b) Education and awareness of actors in the public and private sector regarding the legal framework and regulatory in force. c) Establishing a unified reporting system for individuals and businesses reporting on crime cybernetics in order to take the necessary measures as well as the law enforcement institutions can determine the extent to which cybercrime in Albania affects individuals and on economy. 10 LAW Nr. 10325, dated 23.9.2010 “On the Basis of State Data” and DCM no. 945, dated 2.11.2012 for the adaption of the regulation \"Administration of the System of State Data Bases\" d) Evaluating the establishment of the respective respective structures at other institutions of public administration. Strengthening and supporting capacity building in the field of security cybernetics will be a continuous process in order for the state to serve as a model for security cybersecurity. e) Clear definition of structures and processes that will ensure coordination at the level politico-strategic and operational level including all actors in the public sector or private. Policy Paper on Cyber Security 2015 - 2017 22 Raising the awareness for cybersecurity It is widely known that the majority of cyber attacks are successful as a consequence of wrong configuration or failure of ICT users to implement the minimum protection measures. a) The Government will undertake initiatives and develop programs for the education and training of ICT users. These programs will include all the levels of public administration, such as: IT experts, administrators of systems and ICT, etc. 11 LAW No. 10325, dated 23.9.2010 “On state databases” and the DCM No. 945, dated 2.11.2012 on Approval of the Regulation for \"The Administration of state databases system\" b) Dissemination and publishing of information on the risks of the cyber space and issuing instructions and providing advice for mimimum security will be an ongoing process, which will aim at raising awareness and increasing the level of security of ordinary users. In addition to publishing information on these risks in the Web Pages of specialized institutions, a close cooperation will be established with the media in order for the public to be informed in the quickest possible way and to have access to information as widely as possible. c) An assessment will be made on the introduction of educational programs in the pre- university system and conducting awareness campaings in order to increase and develop the culture for a safe use of cyber space. d) Cooperation with the private sector, as one of the sectors that is mostly impacted from cyber attacks, will be strengthened by undertaking initiatives and joint projects. Raising awareness and implementation of standards from the private sector will be encouraged and supported. In particular, this cooperation will increase with: - Internet service providers, such as the entrance of cyber space in the country. Through building mutual trust, close co-operation with them on a voluntary basis will increase the effectiveness of dealing with cyber incidents by shortening the response time; and to put in place measures to block access to content websites illegal. - Civil Society, to address child safety issues on the Internet. - The Academy, to open study programs specializing in cyber security and for it raised funds by utilizing opportunities like Horizon 2020. - The banking sector as one of the sectors with the latest technology in terms of security. Through their security committee, they will be party to any legal and technical initiative in this field; as well as for the exchange of information on the weaknesses of products and technologies, ICTs, new types of attacks, institutionalization of relationships, drafting of Policy Paper on Cyber Security 2015 - 2017 23 plans coordinated measures and actions and the mutual exchange of related information with cyberattacks. Increase the level of knowledge, skills and capacities for expertise in the area of cyber security Activities are going to be organized in the short and middle-term period in order to increase the necessary human resources capacities in the area of cyber security. Regulations will be developed, which will include the concept of cyber security in the elementary schools, high schools and institutions of higher education. Auditing measures on cyber security in the internal auditing processes of the organizations will be discussed as well. a) In the framework of strengthening the institutions, will increase the technical capacities of human resources. This will be done through selected training programs that will aim at training participants in preventing attacks, minimizing damages, providing an effective response to information security incidents. b) Active participation in international conferences, meetings, seminars and exercises to do with cyber security. Exchange of information, analysis, experience, creation of joint projects, evaluation of technologies and security systems are seen not only as an opportunity to increase cyber security in public institutions, but also as an investment for the development and growth of successive generation capacities. Identification and Protection of Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) in Albania The development of technology and the continuous integration of the systems has resulted that some of the systems have become vital for the operation of the digital society, regarding them as critical infrastructure. a) Developing the necessary procedures and processes for the identification, inventory and ensuring their security has become a priority. Developing and implementation of minimum procedures and standards will be mandatory. b) Due to the fact that these are not only public systems, but could belong also to the private sector, the cooperation and exchange of information with the private sector will be encouraged in order to ensure the basic security for these systems. With reference to this Policy Paper on Cyber Security 2015 - 2017 24 objective, another very important aspect in addition to the protection of these critical systems, is the “resilience”, which will ensure continuity of business activities in cases of force majeure or different cyber attacks. The protection and resilience capacity of critical infrastructure and encouraging operators that own them to implement a full security architecture (including risk management and emergencies) will ensure effectivity, reliability and continuity of services that are provided by them. c) Defining the legal/regulatory basis, based on which the providers of critical infrastructures should report about serious cyber incidents. An analysis should be conducted for every case (which is reported or not) as cyber crime, the reasons why did it happened and actions that should be generated and reflected into laws, regulations or procedures, in order to avoid the recurrance of the incident. Developing and implementation of the minimum requirements on cyber security The increase of the security in the state administration, the increase in the use of ICT systems in the public administration and also ensuring their security is one of the priorities of this Document. a) Standards, guidelines and procedures based on the best international practices will be aligned and approved in order to be implemented in the public administration. b) It is a priority to develop and approve risk analysis procedures concerning security for the systems that are used and electronic services that are provided by institutions. The risk analysis will be an ongoing process and it will be conducted periodically. The implementation of these procedures will be one of the key elements to increase the level of cyber security. c) Further development of procedures to coordinate investments in order to analyse security and harmonize projects at the design stage will be assessed. d) Important systems will be identified in the state administration and institutions will invest in automated hardware and software as proactive and reactive ensure these systems they administer. e) The BCC (Business Continuity Center) and DRC (Disaster Recovery Center) will be set up for networks / state systems. Policy Paper on Cyber Security 2015 - 2017 25 f) A monitoring system will be set up, which will promptly notify the institutions of the risks cybernetics that are threatened by monitoring 24 \\ 7 most important nodes, and traffic events occurring in the system to enable the conclusion of conclusions from loggs that are stored without interfering or monitoring the content. Strengthening the partnership with other counterpart structures inside and outside the country The coordination and cooperation of all the actors is the basic element to ensure success. Due to the dynamic and speed of the development of ICT, the cooperation with the private sector will be strengthened. The security could be increased and the ICT in the public administration could be further developed in consistence with the developments and trends of technology. a) The increase of cooperation and coordination between the public institutions will be strengthened in order to ensure the interaction and coordination of security and minimizing the damages from cyber attacks. b) Albania supports and will be part of the international initiatives, which aim at increasing and strengthening the security. The cooperation will be strengthened especially with NATO and EU, by becoming an active member of the joint initiatives for cyber security. The membership of Albania in the well-known international cybersecurity organizations and associations and the increase of cooperation is a priority.

The increase in the use of ICT and Internet is changing the society by creating   new ways of connection, communication, cooperation and economic development through the   access to cyber space. This has made our society more and more dependant on the use of these   technologies.   Albania ranks one of the countries where the   development of telecommunications, access to   Internet and informatization of the society is   advancing very quickly. The increase in the use   of communication represents an added value   for the economic and social development of the   country, but at the same time it makes it   vulnerable to cyber attacks against state and   private actors. The cyber attacks have the   potential to seriously damage the exchange of   information between the public institutions, the   telecommunication and financial and banking   system, by interrupting also vital services. 4     This document is developed in support of the   new Investment Program of the Albanian Government on ICT:    Improvement of services that are provided to the public;    A safe information society; and   The National Security Strategy 2014-2020 (a paragrah is cited from this strategy ‘...on setting and   complying with the highest standards for the retention and protection of information in all the   forms that it exists, by focusing special efforts for the protection from cyber attacks’).      4  National Security Strategy (NSS), 2014 – 2020      In addition to the positive elements,   the access to cyber space increases the   potential risk for the damage or   misuse of data and computer systems.   As a consequence of the increase of   cyber risks, the security of the   integrity of data and confidentiality   and a safe access to the cyber space   have become one of the biggest   challenges, which our society has to   face nowadays, turning it into an issue   of national security.        Policy Paper on Cyber Security 2015 - 2017      9      This document is also in line with the Digital Agenda for Europe 2020 (a sentence is cited ... The   increase of the trust in ICT through strengthening the security policy for the networks and   information) as well as in line with  the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open,   Safe and Secure Cyberspace).       The purpose of this Policy Paper is to review and coordinate the obligations that stem from the   commitments that are undertaken for a safe cyberspace, in order to ensure fulfillment of   responsibilities of all the actors in a coordinated way. In this way, the further development of the   information society could be ensured as a safe, reliable and open environment as well as the   promotion of the values and opportunities provided by the use of cyber space.      Following an analysis of the current situation and developments, this document defines the vision   and the objectives for the development over the period 2015-2017 and provides the main   directions of the policies that will be followed in order to achieve these objectives. The document   is based on the best European models and practices with regard to the objectives and solutions that   are foreseen, always taking into consideration the specific features of the Albanian society and   economy.       There is an Action Plan attached to this Policy Paper, which is  going to be reviewed at least once   a year. The main documents where the Policy Paper on Cyber Security 2015 – 2017 is based on   are as follows:     ● Digital Agenda of Albania (2014 - 2020)      ● National Security Strategy (NSS)      ● Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace5       All stakeholders from the public and private sectors are consulted in order to draft this document   and assistance is provided also by the European Union experts throuth TAIEX.           5  Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union: An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace - Join(2013) 1 final - 7/2/2013    Policy Paper on Cyber Security 2015 - 2017      10      Current situation in Albania     The Cross-cutting Strategy on Information Society 2008-2013 (CSIS) approved by the DCM No.   59 dated. 21.1.2009, in addition to being a strategic document that defined the main directions   and objectives for the development in the area of information society over the period    2008 – 2013, was the only document which briefly mentioned cyber security as one of the areas,   which should be considered as a priority due to the vision of the Albanian Givernment to   increase and develop E-Government through the provision of e-services.    Computer security was mentioned in the initiatives in the area of information society in the   CSIS:    Children’s Online Safety and encourage the coordination of the process on Codes of   Conduct    Setting up the National Agency on Cyber Security (ALCIRT)    Developing the Public Key Infrastructure and providing safe services      In accordance to the Law \"On Protection of Children’s Rights\", \"The Action Plan on Children   2012 -2015\" approved by Decision of the Council of Ministers No. 182 dated 13.03.2012, the   Albanian legislation in force and the best European practice in this area; \"The Safer Social   Networking Principles for the EU countries\", published by the European Commission in   February 2009 and the document on \"The European Framework for Safer Mobile Use by   Younger Teenagers and Children\", signed by different mobile operators in Europe in February   2007, Albanian operators signed on 7 February 2013 “The Code of Conduct for the safer and   responsible use of electronic communications networks and services in Albania”.      Also, in the course of implementation of the Cross-cutting Strategy on Information Society 2008-  2013 (CSIS), the National Agency on Information Society has provided the following services:    Safe authentication and identification for 25 institutions, 2500 users;    Safe Internet for 65 institutions;    Automatic and central instalation of applications in 2000 PCs of the Ministeries that are in   domain;     Policy Paper on Cyber Security 2015 - 2017      11       Central management of anti-virus protection for 7 institutions, 1000 computers;    e-signature through Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for 2 institutions;   The use of Information and Communications Technology has considerably increased over  the   recent years. According to the data published by EPCA, the number of active users of mobile   phone services reached approximately 3.7 million users by the end of 2013. The penetration rate   of mobile telephony based on active SIM cards reached 130%.       The broadband Internet access has considerably increased by 14% during 2013 for fixed   broadband connections as well as for mobile broadband, for modem card and USB connections   88 - 101% respectively during 2013. In total, the number of broadband subscribers (fixed and   mobile) was increased by 36% during 2013.      The total number of fixed broadband connections reached up to 182.556 at the end of 2013 and   the number of broadband service users based on mobile phones reached up to 1.231.269 at the   end of 2013.      The number of Internet users in Albania is increased several times over the recent years.   According to the data published by the International Telecommunication Union, the penetration   of Internet in Albania over the last ten years has increased from 0.97% in 2003 to over 60% in   2013. 5          Year                              2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013                                              Albania 0.97 2.42 6.04 9.61 15.04 23.86 41.20 45.00 49.00 54.66 60.10                       In the meantime, the number of violations of the security of networks and information is   increasing rapidly. This brings about financial losses and generates new risks and threats for the   development of the Information Society.

Policy Paper on Cyber Security 2015 - 2017      18      Vision, principles and strategic objectives                            The cyber space should be considered as a multidimentional area, with several layers and   territories, beyond the national borders. The cyber security should be based on the following basic   principles:     - Protection of fundamental human rights, freedom of speech, personal data and   privacy: Cyber security could be efficient only in case it is based on the fundamental   human rights and freedoms, pursuant to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the   European Union and universal values of the EU. Reciprocally, the rights of individuals   could not be ensured without having safe networks and systems in place. Every exchange   of information, when it includes personal data, should be made in accordance with the   EU legislation on Data Protection and the Law No. 9887, dated 10.03.2008, as amended   “On Protection of Personal Data” and should also take into consideration the rights of   individuals in this area.      - Providing access to all citizens: Limited access and/or lack of access to Internet and the   digital illiteracy constitute a disadvantage for citizens, taking into account that the digital   world characterizes the activity within the society. Every human being should be able to   access Internet and have an unlimited information flow. The integrity and security of   Internet should be guaranteed in order to provide safe access to all.       - Shared responsibility: Cyber security can not be regarded as a problem that impacts or   belongs to one institution, public institutions, private sector or to citizens. It is a problem   that impacts all the areas of life and society. As such, it asks for necessary security   measures by all the users of ICT and the cyber space.   THIS DOCUMENT DEFINES THE FOLLOWING VISION:   For a safer, more reliable and more sustainable cyber space for the citizens,   business and the Government, in support of the economic and social development of   Albania.      Policy Paper on Cyber Security 2015 - 2017      19         - Strengthening the cooperation and coordination: Based on the shared responsibilities,   it is necessary to increase the cooperation and coordination between all the actors. In   order to achieve the goal it is necessary to strengthen of interinstitutional cooperation, the   cooperation with the public and private sector and the cooperation with the academic   world.      - International cooperation: The cyber space, as a space without borders, asks for an   international cooperation and coordination, in order to ensure cyber security. Also, as   Albania has joined NATO and the progress it has made towards EU membership, it is   more and more an active partner of the initiatives and programes on cyber security and it   should fulfil its commitments to the ally countries.      - Administration of risk: The increase in the use of ICT and the trend for an ever more   interconnected world has increased the risks that we are facing. Albania will undertake   the necessary measures for the administration of risk based on the best standards and   practices, in order to ensure the cyber security.      - Abiding by the values: This document will serve as orientation to take all the measures,   to develop the policies, standards, guides and procedures in order to ensure protection   from the cyber risks, by complying at any time with the fundamental rights and freedoms   and other democratic principles.        The strategic objectives that will be followed in order to achieve the vision and observe the   above-mentioned principles are as follows:      i. Complete the legal framework in the cybersecurity area      ii. Raise the awareness of cyber security      iii. Increase the level of knowledge, skills and capacities for expertise in the cybersecurity   area    iv. Identification and Protection of Critical Information Infrastructure (CIIP)      v. Developing and implementing minimum cybersecurity requirements     vi. Increase the investments in order to enhance security in the state networks/systems      Policy Paper on Cyber Security 2015 - 2017      20        vii. Strengthening the partnership with other counterpart structures inside and outside the   country;   Policies that should be followed      Completion of the legal framework in the cybersecurity area      Pursuant to the developments and initiatives, the necessary measures will be taken to analyse,   adjust and complete the legislation in the cyber area. The best practices from the world,   recommendations and international initiatives in this area, especially those from NATO and EU,   will be assessed on a continuous basis, by adjusting the measures in the cybersecurity area, in   accordance with the commitments that are undertaken to international partners. If it will be   deemed necessary, they will be adjusted and approved, thus ensuring the increase of cybersecurity   and the fight against cyber crime. It results from the analysis that was conducted to develop this   Document that there are some ambiguities in the existing legal and institutional framework, which   need to be addressed in the course of completion of legislation, as follows:     a) Modernization of the legislation in force and reviewing it periodically in order to address cyber   security connected to the developments of cyber space in Albania and harmonization with the   international legislation, in order that the legislation that remains is suitable and effective. To   promote the use of qualified electronic signatures in electronic transactions is under way these   initiatives:   - Drafting of the Draft Law on the Use of Secure Electronic Identification, Electronic Seals in   e-government services; in order to guarantee identity in the virtual world either this is for   natural and legal persons. Currently the draft law \"On electronic identification and trusted   services \" is in the process of consulting the Assembly. Meanwhile, the regulation is ready   harmonized with European law enforcement law 910/2014, which is expected to be adopted   with the decision of the Council of Ministers after the adoption of the draft law. This legal   package is expected to increase confidence in the online environment for the purpose of   economic and social development, increasing trust the lack of which to date has caused the   legal uncertainty that makes consumers, businesses and public authorities hesitate in   conducting online transactions.   - Widespread use of website and web server certificates for it will be introduced guaranteeing   the secure identity of the public institutions and other private companies which offer   electronic services in the interaction of public institutions with citizens, or business.     Policy Paper on Cyber Security 2015 - 2017      21         b) Ordering/making it obligatory the periodic auditing and assessment of suitability and   efficiency of the security of information systems, pursuant to the legal and regulatory   framework in force. These measures will be taken in order to complete the current legislation   in force 11  , which foresees auditing of state databases, leaving the systems in general outside   the spectrum of action.       c) Implement clear procedures under which state institutions that provide e-services for citizen,   business, or for interaction between institutions will access the basics of it state data for the   purpose of interoperability and improvement of service quality beneficiaries.     d) Strengthening the institutions and increase in the security in the public administration by   applying procedures and basic requirements that are accepted by all the actors.         Strengthening the institutional framework      a) Implementation of procedures for the protection of personal data of citizens in obtaining e-  services.   b) Education and awareness of actors in the public and private sector regarding the legal framework   and regulatory in force.   c)  Establishing a unified reporting system for individuals and businesses reporting on crime   cybernetics in order to take the necessary measures as well as the law enforcement institutions can   determine the extent to which cybercrime in Albania affects individuals and on economy.      10 LAW Nr. 10325, dated 23.9.2010 “On the Basis of State Data” and DCM no. 945, dated 2.11.2012 for the adaption of the   regulation \"Administration of the System of State Data Bases\"      d) Evaluating the establishment of the respective respective structures at other institutions of   public administration. Strengthening and supporting capacity building in the field of security   cybernetics will be a continuous process in order for the state to serve as a model for security   cybersecurity.   e) Clear definition of structures and processes that will ensure coordination at the level   politico-strategic and operational level including all actors in the public sector or private.     Policy Paper on Cyber Security 2015 - 2017      22      Raising the awareness for cybersecurity      It is widely known that the majority of cyber attacks are successful as a consequence of wrong   configuration or failure of ICT users to implement the minimum protection measures.      a) The Government will undertake initiatives and develop programs for the education and   training of ICT users. These programs will include all the levels of public administration,   such as: IT experts, administrators of systems and ICT, etc.       11  LAW No. 10325, dated 23.9.2010 “On state databases” and the DCM No. 945, dated 2.11.2012 on Approval of the Regulation for \"The Administration of state   databases system\"        b) Dissemination and publishing of information on the risks of the cyber space and issuing   instructions and providing advice for mimimum security will be an ongoing process,   which will aim at raising awareness and increasing the level of security of ordinary users.   In addition to publishing information on these risks in the Web Pages of specialized   institutions, a close cooperation will be established with the media in order for the public   to be informed in the quickest possible way and to have access to information as widely   as  possible.      c) An assessment will be made on the introduction of educational programs in the pre-  university system and conducting awareness campaings in order to increase and develop   the culture for a safe use of cyber space.    d) Cooperation with the private sector, as one of the sectors that is mostly impacted from cyber   attacks, will be strengthened by undertaking initiatives and joint projects. Raising awareness   and implementation of standards from the private sector will be encouraged and supported.    In particular, this cooperation will increase with:   - Internet service providers, such as the entrance of cyber space in the country. Through   building mutual trust, close co-operation with them on a voluntary basis will increase the   effectiveness of dealing with cyber incidents by shortening the response time; and to put in   place measures to block access to content websites illegal.   - Civil Society, to address child safety issues on the Internet.   - The Academy, to open study programs specializing in cyber security and for it raised   funds by utilizing opportunities like Horizon 2020.   - The banking sector as one of the sectors with the latest technology in terms of security.   Through their security committee, they will be party to any legal and technical initiative in   this field; as well as for the exchange of information on the weaknesses of products and                         technologies, ICTs, new types of attacks, institutionalization of relationships, drafting of     Policy Paper on Cyber Security 2015 - 2017      23      plans coordinated measures and actions and the mutual exchange of related information   with cyberattacks.      Increase the level of knowledge, skills and capacities for expertise in the area of cyber security      Activities are going to be organized in the short and middle-term period in order to increase the   necessary human resources capacities in the area of cyber security. Regulations will be developed,   which will include the concept of cyber security in the elementary schools, high schools and   institutions of higher education. Auditing measures on cyber security in the internal auditing   processes of the organizations will be discussed as well.      a) In the framework of strengthening the institutions, will increase the technical capacities of   human resources. This will be done through selected training programs that will aim at   training participants in preventing attacks, minimizing damages, providing an effective   response to information security incidents.     b) Active participation in international conferences, meetings, seminars and exercises               to do with cyber security. Exchange of information, analysis, experience,              creation of joint projects, evaluation of technologies and security systems              are seen not only as an opportunity to increase cyber security in public institutions, but also               as an investment for the development and growth of successive generation capacities.      Identification and Protection of Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) in Albania      The development of technology and the continuous integration of the systems has resulted that    some of the systems have become vital for the operation of the digital society, regarding them as   critical infrastructure.      a) Developing the necessary procedures and processes for the identification, inventory and   ensuring their security has become a priority. Developing and implementation of   minimum procedures and standards will be mandatory.   b) Due to the fact that these are not only public systems, but could belong also to the private   sector, the cooperation and exchange of information with the private sector will be   encouraged in order to ensure the basic security for these systems. With reference to this     Policy Paper on Cyber Security 2015 - 2017      24      objective, another very important aspect in addition to the protection of these critical   systems, is the “resilience”, which will ensure continuity of business activities in cases of   force majeure or different cyber attacks. The protection and resilience capacity of critical   infrastructure and encouraging operators that own them to implement a full security   architecture (including risk management and emergencies) will ensure effectivity,   reliability and continuity of services that are provided by them.    c) Defining the legal/regulatory basis, based on which the providers of critical   infrastructures should report about serious cyber incidents. An analysis should be   conducted for every case (which is reported or not) as cyber crime, the reasons why did it   happened and actions that should be generated and reflected into laws, regulations or   procedures, in order to avoid the recurrance of the incident.           Developing and implementation of the minimum requirements on cyber security  The increase of the security in the state administration, the increase in the use of ICT systems in   the public administration and also ensuring their security is one of the priorities of this   Document.      a) Standards, guidelines and procedures based on the best international practices will be   aligned and approved in order to be implemented in the public administration.       b) It is a priority to develop and approve risk analysis procedures concerning security for the   systems that are used and electronic services that are provided by institutions. The risk   analysis will be an ongoing process and it will be conducted periodically. The   implementation of these procedures will be one of the key elements to increase the level of   cyber security.       c) Further development of procedures to coordinate investments in order to analyse security   and harmonize projects at the design stage will be assessed.      d) Important systems will be identified in the state administration and institutions will invest in   automated hardware and software as proactive and reactive ensure these systems they   administer.      e) The BCC (Business Continuity Center) and DRC (Disaster Recovery Center) will be set up   for networks / state systems.        Policy Paper on Cyber Security 2015 - 2017      25      f) A monitoring system will be set up, which will promptly notify the institutions of the risks   cybernetics that are threatened by monitoring 24 \\ 7 most important nodes, and traffic   events occurring in the system to enable the conclusion of conclusions from loggs   that are stored without interfering or monitoring the content.            Strengthening the partnership with other counterpart structures inside and outside the country      The coordination and cooperation of all the actors is the basic element to ensure success. Due to   the dynamic and speed of the development of ICT, the cooperation with the private sector will be   strengthened. The security could be increased and the ICT in the public administration could be   further developed in consistence with the developments and trends of technology.      a) The increase of cooperation and coordination between the public institutions will be   strengthened in order to ensure the interaction and coordination of security and   minimizing the damages from cyber attacks.      b) Albania supports and will be part of the international initiatives, which aim at increasing   and strengthening the security. The cooperation will be strengthened especially with    NATO and EU, by becoming an active member of the joint initiatives for cyber security.   The membership of Albania in the well-known international cybersecurity organizations   and associations and the increase of cooperation is a priority.

Today, the Jordanian economy faces a set of difficult challenges, resulting from successive crises as well as international and regional conditions, namely continuous suspensions in Egyptian gas supplies and the ramifications of the Syrian crisis, particularly the influx of Syrian refugees, as Jordan currently hosts 1,300,000 of our brethren Syrians, which is depleting our limited resources and creating enormous pressures on our infrastructure and national economy. This situation has led to an increase in deficit and debt over the past few years. The implications of these difficult economic conditions have left their mark on the standard of living our citizens enjoy. Today, the number one priority and the foremost challenge our citizens face is to improve their living conditions and to secure better jobs that provide them and their families with a decent living and hope for a better future. These are concerns that | witnessed first-hand during my ongoing field visits. Price hikes and financial pressures our citizens face today are the hard realities we need to address. Accordingly, the state — in all its institutions ~ must provide socio-economic solutions and programmes to alleviate these burdens. Over the last few months, I have followed closely the government's performance, and the diligent and well-appreciated efforts it has exerted, which resulted in passing the budget, implementing economic reforms and enacting legislation in cooperation with Parliament. In light of the recent challenges, we affirm our determination to continue developing our national economy and chart our future direction in tandem with efforts to secure decent living standards and a promising bright future for the men 10 and women of our beloved Jordan. Against this backdrop, it is of the utmost urgency that the government devises an economic blueprint to guide our national economy over the next ten years. This economic blueprint should have a comprehensive framework targeting the following: enhancing financial and monetary policies and assuring their consistency; improving economic competitiveness; enhancing values of high productivity and self-reliance to realise sustainable and comprehensive development. In this context, | emphasise that the success of devising this blueprint hinges on adopting a participatory and consultative approach towards all stakeholders, namely governmental institutions, Parliament, private sector, civil society organizations and local communities. The blueprint should build on accumulated efforts and institutional studies, such as the “Privatization Evaluation Committee,” “Governorates Development Strategy,” and “National Employment Strategy,” in an effort to benefit from these strategies in devising future socio-economic policies, with specific programmes and work plans that address short- and long-terms challenges. The blueprint must also build on the government's policy statement and its program for the years 2013-2016, which have been presented to the 17th Lower House in its Extraordinary Session, on which the government won a vote of confidence, in addition to other national economic and political reform programmes. This shall provide a frame of reference for the current and successive governments in achieving sustainable growth rates and enhancing economic reforms. siou WAN It is important to emphasize here that the requested economic blueprint should be based on the following principles: 4. Preserving macro-financial stability and developing financial policies; improving Jordan's business environment; enhancing policies that promote innovation and sectoral development; enhancing local governance and implementing decentralization. 2. Supporting engines of growth; limiting budget deficit; preserving financial and monetary stability; enhancing competitiveness and investment attraction to generate more jobs for Jordanians. 3. Strengthening programmes targeting poverty and unemployment alleviation as weil as consumer protection and channelling subsidies to those who deserve it in order to enhance Jordan’s social safety net in an effort to protect and expand the middle class. 4. Supporting productive and entrepreneurial projects as well as Small and Medium Enterprises, through encouraging competition and preventing monopolies. 5. Elevating the quality of governmental services provided to citizens in various fields in a manner that builds on public sector reform programmes; giving priority to health and education sectors, in addition to training and employment programmes that meet labour market requirements; and assuring the highest levels of equality and justice in providing these services. 6. Ensuring a just distribution of developmental di development programmes. idends by giving priority to governorates’ 7. Devising a comprehensive system to enhance food, water and energy security and its diversification, in addition to expediting the execution of mega projects. Your Excellency Prime Minister, | shall emphasize here the importance of addressing this task with utmost attention and care to achieve feasible working plans, based on a specific time-frame with clear priorities and adopting successive action points, which are assessed in an institutional manner and are binding to governments. | also stress the importance of upholding accountability in measuring progress and achievement and a collective sense of shared responsibility as well as keenness to overcome shortcomings in the future. It is of equal importance, that these directives are handled with the utmost seriousness and avoid laxity in execution, in order to enhance the credibility of the state and all its institutions in addressing citizens’ concerns and assuring the decent standard of living they rightly deserve. Above all, we do not h for this economic blueprint, upon which we have very high hopes, to be a mere document that gets shelved away, but rather a productive endeavour, with tangible results and a clear time-frame. We face numerous and difficult challenges, but our cherished Jordanian citizens deserve the best we can provide. We are confident that Jordan, empowered by the will of its sons and daughters, will overcome these challenges through team work, diligent efforts and follow-up, aiming to realize our vision for the future of Jordan, Praying to God Almighty to preserve Jordan's pride and prosperity through the hard work of all Jordanians and to help us realize the aspirations of our beloved people. Peace be upon you, God’s mercy and blessings, Abdullah Il ibn Al Hussein Amman, 28 Jumada Al-Awwal 1435 Hijri wore 29 March 2014 Ae The Government’s reply to His Majesty King Abdullah Il’s letter In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate Your Majesty King Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein, Leader of the reform process and protector of Jordan and its stability and prosperity, Peace, God's mercy and blessings be upon you, My Cabinet and I have received, with gratitude and honour, Your Majesty's letter directing the government to draft a 10-year economic blueprint for Jordan. | would like to affirm to your Majesty that putting forward full-fledged plans, aimed at enhancing the country’s financial and monetary policy and guaranteeing their consistency, improving economic competitiveness, promoting the values of productivity and self-reliance in order to achieve sustainable and inclusive development and ensure a decent living and bright future for Jordanian men and women, has been a constant practice and a key goal of this government. ‘The Cabinet and | assure Your Majesty that we will work diligently to prepare this blueprint, adopting a participatory approach, based on openness to all of the country’s social and economic stakeholders, including government agencies, parliament, the private sector, civil society organizations and other national entities. Through this approach, the blueprint will be the fruit of a collective national endeavour, where all stakeholders have an active role to play, not only its drafting, but also in the process of its implementation and follow-up. Further, in line with Your Majesty's directives, this effort will result in drawing a roadmap for my government and the governments to follow. It will be based on the challenges facing the national economy, particularly those faced by the sectors of energy, water, transportation and infrastructure. In addition, the roadmap is expected to address the high rate of unemployment, especially among youth, the low level of women's participation in the workforce, discrepancies in the levels of development between governorates and the mounting public debt as well as the growing state budget deficit. Added to that is the impact of the difficult regional situation, particularly the Syrian refugee crisis, which poses a burden on Jordanian citizens and the national ‘economy. | would like also to emphasize that this undertaking will be built on sectoral and national efforts, policies and strategies, such as the National Recruitment Strategy and National Anti-Poverty Strategy, along with strategies tailored for vital sectors such as energy, agriculture, tourism, transportation and others. The blueprint will also be built on the National Agenda, in a way that ensures coordination and consistency between all these plans at the economic and social levels. The blueprint will complement the government's action plan and programmes for the years 2013-2016, which we presented to the 17th Parliament in its non-ordinary session. It will also be aligned with other national fiscal and economic reform programmes. Based on Your Majesty's letter, the vision aims to position Jordan as a regional hub of economic activities, capitalizing on the relative advantages of certain economic sectors. The task aims to achieve the following objectives: + Boost economic growth, achieve fiscal stability, reduce financial waste, deliver support to those who deserve it and reduce public debt to safe levels. + Enhance the business and investment environment and raise its competitiveness to attract local and foreign investment in the various economic sectors, enhance partnership between the public and private sectors and revisit the role of the private sector in terms of its size and its contribution to the development process. * Develop economic sectors, encourage market creativity and hone the tools and means of supporting priority and high-value added export-oriented sectors. STO TAN + Encourage small and medium-sized businesses, increase financial support for these enterprises, provide them with a suitable environment to prosper as engines of economic growth and promote their role as employers of young people, by encouraging the spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation. + Enhance the policies governing the labor market, focus on building a labor force through vocational training, especially youth, so that they gradually replace foreign workers and encourage women to join the labor market. + Stimulate local and comprehensive development in communities, narrow developmental gaps between governorates and apply decentralization to empower local communities and engage them in the decision-making process related to the development of their areas. + Increase women’s participation in labor market through spe ic programs, + Give necessary attention to people with special needs and work to fully integrate them in society. Your Majesty, As we prepare this blueprint for the future of the Jordanian economy, which will be completed before the end of this year, we will identify the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders, during both the drafting and implementation stages. The blueprint will be formulated by technical committees represented by all concerned sectors. It will harness all available expertise, locally and internationally, in order to produce an outcome that will be a national achievement for Jordan, in line with best international practices. The practical aspect of the blueprint will entail an executive program, extending to 2025, including indicators to measure performance and progress. The Unit of Follow-up and Oversight of Government Performance at the Prime Ministry will be activated to oversee all arrangements and proposals entailed in the plan. Reports will be published regularly, making them accessible to the Jordanian public to detect any failures in the process. This process is intended to increase the government's credibility and people's confidence in it. Those who fail to deliver will be held accountable. The challenges we face are numerous and formidable, but they motivate us to carry out the task in the spirit of teamwork, turning difficulties facing the national economy into opportunities that lead to the economic revival you envision, and allow us to serve our noble nation under your wise leadership. May God keep you as the leader and precious asset of our homeland, and preserve Jordan as a prosperous and proud country. Peace, God’s mercy and blessings be upon you, Te AG wy TAN Executive Summary wu WAN Over the past decade, Jordan has seen considerable economic and social achievements; GDP per capita has increased from JD (1512) in 2004 to about JD (3670) in 2014. Jordan has also invested ignificant resources in infrastructure facilities serving the citizens, made remarkable human development achievements, maintained stability and attracted foreign and domestic investment. These achievements were accompanied by some challenges that are still unresolved, mainly the development gap between governorates, high unemployment rates, especially among young people, low female economic participation and the relative decline in certain competitiveness indicators. However, the general situation in Jordan, the level of infrastructure and the institutional development help Jordan to leap ahead and start addressing and overcoming challenges. His Majesty King Abdullah Il has highlighted the most prominent challenges, the way to the future and the social and economic model that we aspire in his letter to the government to develop this vision for the next decade. “Jordan 2025” charts a path for the future and determines the integrated economic and social framework that will govern the economic and social policies based on providing opportunities for all. Its basic principles include promoting the rule of law and equal opportunities, increasing participatory policy making, achieving fiscal sustainability and strengthening institutions. To achieve this, it is necessary to improve infrastructure, enhance education and health and strengthen the role of the private sector and civil society institutions to contribute to the development process. Based on these principles, the vision proposes a roadmap for the future that requires consensus among broad segments of society on the roadmap and the roles of all concerned authorities and stakeholders, led by the private sector, which should play a prominent role in achieving the desired objectives. The government should also provide an enabling environment to achieve this. In addition, the success in achieving the vision and implementing policies contained therein requires a commitment by citizens, the government, the private sector and the civil society, reflecting the ideology of active citizenship referred to in His Majesty's discussion papers. Given the difficulty of predicting the future and the many changes that are ahead, \"Jordan 2025” is based on identifying a set of goals that we aspire to, how they can be achieved through certain procedures and policies that will be adopted on the sector level according to a flexible timetable that takes into account the developments on the global and regional levels and how to adapt to those changes. Therefore, the vision offers two scenarios depending on the progress achieved and the degree of commitment to implement the agreed upon policies. The baseline scenario assumes adopting some, and not all, of reform measures that are contained in the second section of this document. Consequently, growth rates achieved depend on the progress achieved and the degree of commitment to implement the proposed policies. The targeted scenario assumes taking further measures that would achieve high growth rates; this scenario includes a number of interventions in various sectors that would launch the development process in many sectors in order to achieve high and sustainable growth rates, reduce unemployment and poverty and increase economic participation, especially among young people and women. This scenario assumes a balanced and consistent distribution of roles between public and private sectors, a commitment to the implementation and institutionalization of the public- private partnership. The most important goal that the vision seeks to achieve is improving the welfare of citizens and the basic services provided to them, to create a balanced society where opportunities are available to all and the gap between governorates is bridged. The vision puts Jordanian citizens in the heart of the development process; success and failure are measured by the extent of the progress made at the level of individuals, and therefore the welfare of the community. On the economic and social level, the goal is to achieve self-reliance and financial stability based on financial sustainability, enhance the productivity and competitiveness of the Jordanian economy, gradually eliminate all forms of indiscriminate subsidies and target groups who really deserve the subsidy. This would further strengthen the economy's resilience and reduce the impact of external shocks. This document represents a long-term national vision and strategy rather than a detailed government action plan. It includes more than 400 policies or procedures that should be implemented through a participatory approach between the government, business sector and civil society. It is based on basic principles supporting the development model for the next decade, the compliance with the law and the strengthening of the institutionatization. Jordan 2025 Principles for Collective Action Law Abiding Instituionalized 7 = Meritocratic ‘Sustainability De Su WANG compettive AS excetence Participatory The proposed development approach based on these principles clarifies the roles of all actors in the community and requires determination and anticipation for the future. Achieving stability and reducing dependence on foreign countries require necessary short-term sacrifices to achieve sustainability. The vision shows that the initiatives contained therein should be implemented within a sequential and transitional time frame, and since the 2015 budget has been passed in the year in which the financial reform program ends under the agreement with the International Monetary Fund, there are a number of high-impact and relatively low cost initiatives that should be started. “Jordan 2025” vision requires all citizens, whether in the public or private sector, to adhere to the implementation and the general principles, supported by faith in the rule of law and the importance of setting high standards of excellence. The other crucial element for success is the relentless determination to implement the reforms in order to strengthen financial independence and self-reliance. Therefore, it is necessary to increase productivity and competitiveness in the long term to achieve the desired objectives. This requires commitment and effective implementation by setting measurable and easy to follow-up goals. To that end, the Prime Minister’s Delivery Unit was re-established to follow up the most important initiatives proposed and overcome the obstacles facing their implementation. “Jordan 2025” vision is divided into two parts. The first part includes a number of chapters, the first of which provides a summary of the economic and social reality, and covers issues related to the sectors of health, education, employment and economic participation. This part indicates that Jordan has achieved successes on some levels, although the performance of several comparable countries indicates that there are certain challenges that need to be addressed immediately. For example, the assessment of the health sector shows some aspects of development, but the rate of non-communicable diseases in Jordan is considered very high. The main challenges facing the education sector, which was, until recently, a success story, are the growing pressure on the infrastructure and the capacity of the education sector as a result of population Growth and the increased forced migrations, as well as the lack of financial allocations needed to develop the educational system to keep pace with the rapid development of modern educational systems in developed societies. Challenges also include the weak ability of the educational system to produce quality outputs that respond to the requirements of the knowledge economy and the labor market. The poor performance of a comprehensive system of quality that is associated with a foring, evaluation and accountability system and an accreditation system for educational institutions, in addition to the low enrollment rate in vocational and technical education and training. The low employment rates are a source of concern, given their social and political implications. The document highlights the main challenges facing the labor sector in Jordan, mainly the low ‘economic participation, especially by women, the decline in the size of the labor force relative to the working age population, high unemployment rates, especially among women, youths (age 15-24) and university graduates as well as differences in the unemployment rates between governorates. The challenges also include the increased flow of foreign workers into the kingdom who crowd out Jordanian workers in certain professions and disciplines because of the great disparity in wages. The document addresses resource management and security, particularly water, energy and food security. The vision provides an analysis of resource security, especially in energy, water and food sectors and presents a number of initiatives and policies on how to ensure the sustainability of these sectors that are related to the rest of the sectors. The transport sector is also considered one of the vital sectors within the infrastructure facilities that should be given priority in implementing the related initiatives. This chapter also addresses the social aspects of poverty, unemployment and social protection. The analysis discusses the progress that has been made on these levels and the urgent challenges that require policies and procedures to mitigate the effects of poverty and unemployment in particular, especially in the governorates where these rates are high. The document analyzes these various sectoral challenges within the four pillars: citizens, the society, the business sector and the government. The vision shows the challenges faced by citizens, especially those related to education, health, employment and economic participation as well as how to increase it, At the society level, the cohesion of the Jordanian society has protected it against many external shocks. However, the development of societies and the nature of the current, or expected, challenges they face require an approach that takes into account certain indicators; the poverty rate is still high and there are many indicators, such as domestic and campus violence and road accidents, which need to be assessed. Therefore, this vision seeks to formulate a road map in order to improve some indicators related to the society's stability and balance. Se TAN As for the private sector, the general business environment in Jordan has worsened compared to other countries, which requires extensive attention to improve the quality of the business environment in order to attract direct domestic and foreign investments. It is necessary to enforce the laws firmly, fairly and equally and achieve legislative stability with respect to the business environment. It is also necessary to focus on small and medium-sized enterprises, improve their access to finance, innovation and creativity, encourage their entrepreneurship, increase their competitiveness in local and export markets. On the macroeconomic level, the most important priorities include achieving economic growth and ve growth rates of about 3% in spite of the unfavorable regional conditions. Jordan has honored international obligations with regard to addressing the imbalances, particularly public spending and debt. However, challenges still lie ahead and require keeping up the pace of reform to achieve sustainable growth, which will positively affect all segments of society all over the kingdom. This section also evaluates the performance of the public sector and the improvements in indicators of transparency and integrity and addresses the restructuring of the public sector and the effectiveness of public service delivery; achievements and shortfalls have been reviewed and some policies and measures to improve the government performance have been suggested. ‘The second chapter reviews the new growth model that will enable us to achieve the goals and aspirations we hope to attain in 2025, the national development efforts that should be implemented and priority markets and sectors. It will demonstrate how to stimulate growth, achieve prosperity for Jordanians and determine required skills and resources, as well as reviewing the mechanisms for creating the enabling environment. This chapter also reviews two scenarios, the baseline scenario and the targeted scenario, depending on certain measures and initiatives on various sectoral levels, taking into account the internal and external factors. The difference between the “baseline” scenario and the “targeted” scenario is the expected range within which the value of the realized performance indicators which may fluctuate, that will be discussed in detail in the second part of this document. According to the targeted scenario, the document intend to achieve real economic growth rates of about 7.5% in 2025, at a rate of 5.7% within the vision period, while the baseline scenario aims to achieve an economic growth rate of 4.8%. With regard to poverty and unemployment, the targeted scenario aims to reduce poverty and unemployment rates to about 8.0% and 9.17% respectively, compared to about 10% and 11.7% respectively in the baseline scenario. The targeted scenario seeks to reduce the ratio of public debt to GDP to 47%, compared to about 60% in the baseline scenario. In this chapter, the vision identifies a number of clusters that have been determined through studies, analysis and consultation as priority high-potential clusters to stimulate economic growth and create job opportunities for Jordanians. The vision provides an analysis of the reality of these clusters and lentifies the initiatives and measures that should be implemented to develop them. These clusters include, for example, engineering industries and construction, health care and medical tourism, digital services and information technology, tourism and conferences and financial services. They are distributed between industrial and services clusters and they have proven their success in creating decent job opportunities for Jordanians, which can be rolled out throughout the kingdom. This was followed by a review of how to achieve growth, deepen reforms and identify the new foundations advocated by this document in preparation for a new start. This section includes direct recommendations that focused on reinforcing the rule of law, strengthening the role of institutions and encouraging the competition on all levels. It is also necessary to adopt a culture of excellence and adhere to international best practices. In the second part, all initiatives and measures in the various economic sectors were reviewed; these sectors are divided into four main groups according to the document: the government, the business sector, the society and citizens. The chapter also reviews the various sectoral indicators intended to be achieved in 2025 according to the proposed implementation phases. The review includes the policies and measures related to the targeted scenario and the results expected to be achieved during the expected implementation periods. @F% SAI ww MANIC Introduction yw TAN In accordance with His Majesty's directive, the government has consulted widely over the past 12 months through a number of channels in order to develop a roadmap for national prosperity to 2025. This effort of developing ‘Jordan 2025’ was led by a Steering Committee chaired by the Prime Minister and including the participation of a number of ministers and representatives from the private sector and from across civil society . The Steering Committee was supported by 17 sectoral committees convened and managed by the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC) that included more than 300experts and representatives from government, business and civil society across Jordan. These 17 technical committees identified the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats faced by the Jordanian economy and society today. They also reviewed more than 1600 recommendations already made in over 80 previous plans and strategies developed over the past decade in order to. understand what where previous policies and plans have succeeded and failed and to identify those proposals that have not yet been implemented but should over the coming decade. These plans and strategies have subsequently been collated for public access and are now available on the website In addition to the work of these 17 committees, a broader process of engagement was also launched to ensure that every citizen, civil society organization, political party and business association was provided with the opportunity to contribute their views and ideas into the process of developing “Jordan 2025\". The government issued a Public Call for Submissions in national newspapers in ‘September 2014 and through the MOPIC website. This process followed international best practice for public participation and consultation and was the Jordan that this form of open pul ipation has been used. In addition to newspaper advertisements, 45 business associations, civil society organizations, political parties and other groups were directly contacted by MOPIC and encouraged to take part in the process through this open submissions process. National Conference was also held at the Dead Sea on 20 September 2014. Over 780 Jordanians from all segments of society were invited to attend. 450 individuals and institutions accepted the invitation and participated in the one-day conference, which was attended by the Prime Minister and members of the government. Participants exchanged views and ideas about how Jordan can and should move forward through seven working groups each focused on a specific strategic area important for the kingdom's future. As a result of these consultative and collaborative efforts, “Jordan 2025” provides a clear and honest assessment of the Kingdom's current situation; outlines a vision with specific goals to be achieve; and provides a roadmap, including specific initiatives and timelines, to be followed to achieve our aspirations. It is however important to note that the priority initiatives outlined in this document do not represent everything the government needs to do over the coming decade. As circumstances change, including the emergence of new risks, threats and opportunities, future governments will need to identify additional initiatives to be undertaken. Nevertheless, the policies contained in “Jordan 2025” represent significant and important structural reforms and programmatic improvements that we cannot lose sight of over the coming decade. They have been selected and prioritized based on a number of criteria, including: + The nature of barriers and constraints that hindered previous reform efforts. + Their expected positive, long term and sustainable impact on our citizens and society. + Their contribution in promoting exports as our key engine for growth and job creation. + The jobs they can generate for Jordanians over the long term. * Their potential to improve income distribution between and within Governorates. * Their cost to implement and sustain give our given our objective of restoring and sustaining fiscal sustainability. Many of these proposed actions and policies are not new; some have already been recommende previous plans and strategies developed by the Government, private sector and/or civil society organizations. , such as the National Agenda Document, the National Employment Strategy, the Poverty Reduction Strategy, the “We Are All Jordan” document and other sectoral strategies. Since many of these sound proposals and recommendations remain valid and are likely when implemented to make real change, they have been restated in “Jordan 2025”. “Jordan 2025” also includes Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to the desired outcomes in each reform area in order to enable the government, the business community, civil society organizations and citizens to assess the extent to which progress in real outcomes is being achieved from the actions being taken. Sr, wANe BS These KPls have been provided not just for 2025 but at four year intervals over the next decade. This will allow future governments to monitor and assess whether the reforms being undertaken are generating the desired outcomes. Equally, if implementation is behind schedule and/or the desire outcomes are not being realized, the Government will have the opportunity to course-correct the executive programs for subsequent years and annual budgets to re-scope priority initiatives and related government acti Like any roadmap or plan for the future, the targets that we set at the beginning of our journey must represent a level of confidence and ambition for the future and a commitment to address the challenges and barriers that have held back progress in the past. In addition to identifying the specific actions required, this Plan provides a high-level sequence for the proposed actions in each reform area. Ultimately, the government is responsible for setting budgets and priorities in any given year and must retain the flexibility and discretion to modify priorities based on economic, social and financial conditions at the time. While the logical sequence of activities and milestones are clear, the intention of the timelines outlined in this document is to be indicative rather than prescriptive, in order to provide flexibility to decision makers. ‘There is a widespread belief in Jordan that implementation is the task of government alone and that the failures of the past have been due to failures in government, There is no doubt that there are inadequacies and poor accountability and that the government bears the lion's share of the responsibility for the Kingdom's past under-performance in implementation. However, successful reform requires the commitment of all stakeholders- the private sector, the civil society and individual citizens- to do their part, by, for example, paying their taxes and abiding by the rule of law and the principle of equal opportunity. The evaluation of past experience includes lessons and recommendations that will help move forward to the future. The common understanding of the nature of the challenges, the destination that we need to reach and the degree of urgency would dictate the policies to be followed within a clear timeframe to build the Jordan we want by 2025. sigs TAN. aA Chapter One gue WAG 1. JordanToday Before charting a course for the next decade, it is important to begin with a clear and honest assessment of where we have come from over the past decade since the National Agenda and where we stand today as a society and an economy across all aspects of our development. This chapter provides an integrated and holistic assessment of our Kingdom's social and economic condition at the end of the 2014 through four windows: the current state of our citizens, our society, the private sector and the performance of Government. Figure 1: Jordan 2025 Pillars SOCIETY Jordan Communities CITIZEN Workforce Participation. BUSINESS GOVERNMENT duction Through this framework, Jordan 2025 seeks to understand the current state of Jordanians and Jordanian families; the state of our society as a whole; and how the interaction of civil society, the private sector and the government enables or inhibits our prosperity as citizens. In order to put our current social and economic outcomes into some context for judgment, a range of economic and social performance indicators were compared with a selection of benchmark countries both from our own region in the Middle East as well as countries around the world with similar characteristics to Jordan, such as population size, business environment and natural resources. In order to define our ambitions for the future over the next decade, we must compare ourselves not just to those at a similar level of development today, but also to ountries with more advanced levels of development to which we aspire to achieve in the future. By considering world’s best practice even if those economies are much more advanced than Jordan is today, we can help define our ambitions and the road map for action over the next decade. 39 Ae Based on a comprehensive scan of countries with comparable characteristics, Jordan was compared to a number of countries, as shown in the table below: Table 1: Jordan 2025: Benchmark Peer Countries GDP per | Total natural CTC Maaco) (PPP, 2012) | (as % of GDP) Population | GDP 2012 | GDP per size 2013 | (Sbillion) | capita ($) fertee Titers rt IS (1000 sq km) Georgia 45 15,7 3,489 6,808 Tunisia 10,8 45,7 4,231 10,797 er 63 3 es Bulgaria 73 51 6,986 16,044 Uruguay 34 49,9 14,676 18,280 2,50% 475 Croatia 43 59,2 13,767 20,964 1,60% 56 Hungary 99 1246 12,586 22,635 0,90% ot Lithuania 3 42,3 14,100 24,356 1,00% 63 Finland 54 2474 45,815, 39,199 1,40% 304 Ireland 46 2106 45,783 43,834 0,10% 69 Switzerland 8 631.2 78,900 53,191 0,00% 40 Singapore 5,3 267,5 62,170 72,724 0,00% 07 Source: World Bank, IMF. 1.1 Citizen Outcomes Today Jordan today is considered an “upper-middle income” country by the World Bank. Jordan has achieved this status in 2012 because of the growth rates achieved over the past decade. This is represented by Jordan's ranking on the Human Development Index (HDI), and the Health and education pillar in the World Economic Forum's Competitiveness report. Seu ar Ate Figure 2: Human Development Outcomes Social Outcomes ~ Relative Performance Human Development Health and primary education Index (2013) pillar, WEF Competitiveness Report, 2014 Out of 148 Countries on & Finland 1 Switzerland O 3 Singapore 2 ssingaper * Ireland 6 Finland 24 i Piet vc TT Lithuania 35 Peet 2 Hungary (43 Jordan 2006 TT 33 —§ Croatia Q nas Uruguay ¢) 50 sa 45 Bulgaria © 58 Jordan dh 77 Georgia B79 Tunisia O 90 Ungny 55 Jordan 2011 I 6s <— Niger @ 107 Georgia TE 70 ‘Shun Haman DespmeatIndes, Wold Econom orm, Jordan's ranking shows that it is ahead of some countries, such [other upper middle income countries such as] Tunisia and Georgia, on the Human Development Index. However, the health and education pillars, as measured by the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index, show a relative decline over the past decade compared to some countries. This suggests that some countries have been able to achieve larger gains in health and education ‘outcomes than those achieved in Jordan. It also reflects the stress placed on our education and health system due to the pressures placed on Jordan’s hosting of over 1.4m Syrian refugees as a result of the unprecedented regional instability we have been living through since 2011. In terms of the composition of the population, Jordan's large proportion of young people represents a unique opportunity of strategic importance to achieve long- term prosperity of the Kingdom. As shown in the demographic pyramid below, the essence of this opportunity is the age profile of the Kingdom's population, which is a unique demographic “gift”. More than half the Jordanian population are under the age of 24, and over the next decade, the population is projected to grow at 1.35% and the labour force is expected to rise by 2.3% per year. This means that for the next 20 years to 2035, the working age population in Jordan (15-64) will be larger than the dependent population (children and the elderly). Our demographic reality lies at the centre of “Jordan 2025”. To seize the benefits of this “gift”, educational attainment levels and training must be dramatically improved and workforce participation rates among both males and females must be increased. This represents one of the most important opportunities to improve the well-being of Jordanians.

S E E S rs 1.1.1 Health As prosperity has risen in Jordan, public health outcomes have improved considerably over the past 30 years. Since 1980, life expectancy has increased from 66 to 74.4 in 2014, while infant mortality has decreased from 45 to 17 per 1,000 live births over the same period.

These achievements are the result of consistent investment in, and expansion of, the national healthcare system. Jordan now has one of the best healthcare systems in the region. Health workers in Jordan, especially doctors and nurses, are recognized, regionally and internationally, for the excellence of their skills and training, As a result, Jordan is also now recognized as a global leader in medical tourism. P37 & TAN Despite these achievements in health outcomes, a number of challenges are still evident and growing. Jordan has one of the world's highest rates of non- communicable diseases (such as diabetes), typically caused by lifestyle choices. It is estimated that more than 30% of average healthy life years in Jordan is lost due to early mortality, sickness, and disability. This result is the lowest score among Jordan’s benchmark group of countries and third lowest in region (ahead of only Iraq and Syria). The economic consequences and costs are undoubtedly significant and growing. These factors contribute to lower workforce participation rates and higher costs to the public healthcare system, especially for employers due to worker absenteeism, earlier retirement and lower overall productivity.

Further improvements in the quality and cost of care in the healthcare system are also key priorities. The majority of healthcare institutions in the Jordan are not accredited to international standards. Only 45% of military hospitals, 16% of Ministry of Health hospitals and 13% of private hospitals are accredited today. 1.1.2 Education Over many decades, Jordan has established a regional and international reputation for the quality of its education system. It is one of our major national assets and a source of national pride. Educational ‘outcomes, the knowledge, skill and attainment levels of our people, is vital to the cohesion and vibrancy of our society and strength and competitiveness of our economy. Our education system helps to reaffirm our cultural identity and prepare our young people to be responsible and active citizens. Nevertheless, the available evidence suggests that Jordan's education system has begun to decline, particularly in the public school system. In general, education outcomes ~ the levels of achievement attained by students moving through and graduating from the national school and university system - suggest a decline in the standards of quality and excellence and a steady erosion of what was once a key source of national competitive advantage. The measures and reforms that have been implemented by the Ministry of Education over the past two years, particularly the reconsideration of high school examination, the ongoing review of the cross-cutting educational disciplines and the possible adoption of an approach of independent evaluation of the educational process outputs for all educational levels, are all steps in the right direction to improve the quality of the education system and restore its reputation. At the primary and secondary school levels, test scores and pass rates indicate that Jordan is no longer preparing the majority of its next generation for a globally and regionally competitive workforce. At the international level, Jordan’s overall attainment in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) has declined in comparison to other countries of similar levels of economic development. The average mathematics scores of Jordanian students were 406 compared to 498 for countries of the same category. Scores declined by 5% between 1999 and 2011, while almost all comparable economies have improved their scores during that period. Figure 6: International Education Outcomes Comparable International Education Outcomes Grade 8 TIMSS score for Grade 8 TIMSS score for ‘Mathematics Science 1999-2011 1999-2011 1999 2003 2007 2011 1999 2003 2007 2011 I International average Il Jordan Source: IMSS, The National Center for Education Jordan's private school attainment levels are outstanding on an international level suggesting that there is no barrier to our ability to create outstanding learning environments for our children. One of Jordan's top private schools had 47% of its students achieve IB scores of more than 35 points (against a global average of 27% of students). It is clearly possible for us to build globally competitive secondary education institutions. The real challenge is spreading the opportunity for higher quality education so that the majority of Jordanians can benefit from the public education system. As highlighted in previous education strategies, there are a number of possible reasons for the stagnation of outcomes from Jordan’s public education system, including: + Public expenditure per student is low by international standards {although increased spending alone does not guarantee better outcomes). + The quality of basic public school infrastructure is highly variable across the Kingdom. Many public schools are in need of investment and a regime of ongoing maintenance. +The school curriculum and teaching methods are outdated and largely rely on rote learning instead of stimulating critical thinking. + The administration of the public schoo! network is highly centralized. + Parental and community involvement in various school activities is very low. * Teacher training is underfunded and behind international best practice in terms of training methods. + The pressure on school infrastructure, particularly in the northern and central governorates as a result of the influx of Syrian refugee children, has forced a shortening of hours and the introduction of double shifts to accommodate the surge in demand, Fu AG Figure 7: Expenditure on Primary and Secondary Education Primary and Secondary Education Spending — Selected Countries ‘Spend per primary and secondary student ys. selected countries $ PPP, Selected Countries, 2011 15,000 12,000 9,000 6,000 3,000 Ex pe nd it ur e pe r St ud en t (P PP S) Ireland Finland Asracl_—=—‘Singaporel_Lithanla—Mangary—Walgala Jordan Note: Data for Singapore is from 2010 Source: World Bank (TIMSS) At the tertiary education level, there are two key issues. First, employers have noted for several years that the Kingdom's universities are not consistently delivering graduates with the skills and training required for the workforce. Second, there is too much focus on academic as opposed to vocational training. Only 13% of students in the public education system are studying vocational course, well below comparable international standards. This means that a significant number of graduates will immediately join the ranks of the jobless, despite the ready availability of jobs for vocationally skilled workers. Employer perceptions are reinforced by the fact that, unlike several universities in the GCC, Lebanon and Egypt, no Jordanian university is ranked within the top 500 universities worldwide according to the Times Higher Education-British Quacquarelli Symonds (THE-QS) global ranking of universities. According to the National Employment Strategy, employer satisfaction with the quality of graduates is low because they believe the curricula and teaching methods at the university level do not focus primarily on the needs of the labor market. The most concerning indicator about the quality of outcomes achieved by the tertiary education sector is the high unemployment rate amongst Jordan's university graduates. This represents a negative return on investment from the national tertiary education system. Many university students could build their skills and employability faster and at less cost by enrolling in vocational training programs to facilitate access to the labor market instead of choosing three or four year degree programs at university that do not necessarily guarantee decent jobs. The steady relative decline of the quality of outputs of higher education institutions in Jordan is reflected in the number of non-Jordanian students enrolled in Jordanian universities, as indicated by the Higher Education Strategy 2015-2018 that identified the major challenges facing the sector. In addition to low enrolment rates, the vocational training sector is “yielding poorly trained and uncommitted workers” according to a recent independent assessment. The assessment of the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) system indicates limited linkages between labour market needs and Jordan's vocational training institutes, poor instructor qualifications, lack of proper equipment for training, and overall lack of official occupational standards validated by employers to ensure there is a clear frame of reference for all training programs. wee WAN 1.1.3 Culture and Youth The growth of the culture and youth sector during the past few years has led to raising awareness among all segments of society and developing youth cultural civil society institutions, by contributing to the provision of financial and logistical support to them, which is one of the most important factors in the sustainability of their positive impact. It has also led to activating the role of youth in the multiple aspects of the development process. Despite the modest cultural, youth and sports infrastructure, Jordan has made remarkable progress by increasing the number of cultural center and sports cities in several governorates. This has had a clear positive impact in the development of this sector by increasing and diversifying cultural youth activities. Large segments of society, whether individuals or civil society institutions, have benefited, from these infrastructures, which has positively increased community awareness and contributed to the economic and social development. The culture and youth sector can be an effective economic and social lever for promoting national development by investing in the cultural industries sector, known for their efficiency and ability to spread to Arab countries, especially film and drama industry, knowledge, publishing and festivals. If activated, this sector can also be a real driver for tourism development, or more specifically cultural tourism, in Jordan. ‘The promotion of cultural development in its holistic sense, and raising awareness and enlightenment, is the basis for protecting stability and ensuring civil peace in light of the growing negative societal phenomena that is threatening the stability and civil peace, such as violence in its many forms, intellectual extremism and exaggeration. The culture and youth sector, as well as the education sector, bear the greatest burden in this regard. 1.1.4 Participation in the Workforce A new development model must be built; the current development model is unable to encourage young population to take advantage of the opportunities provided by the national economy by finding decent job opportunities and support youth Innovation and entrepreneurship. The levels of participation in the workforce, and the revised participation (workforce “employed and unemployed” relative to working-age population), clearly show that Jordan, according to the World Bank, ranks215th out of 218 countries in the world in terms of level of participation in the workforce. Jordan has made little progress on this dimension of development for the past two decades. The numbers behind this outcome are important to acknowledge. The Jordanian workforce in 2013 was estimated at 1.7 million people in both formal and informal sectors. It is estimated that only 37.1% of the working age population are economically active, while 62.9% (or 2.5 million people of working age) are inactive. Distribution by gender shows that 65% of males are economically active compared to only 15% of females. In comparison, averages in the MENA region are 76% for males and 27% for females, and the world averages are 77% for males and 51% for females. Our single biggest challenge over the next decade is addressing this workforce participation challenge. Our current development model is clearly not creating the number and quality of jobs demanded by our citizens; and our citizens must be willing to take-on the jobs that are available in our economy. This is a multi-dimensional problem that requires an equally multidimensional set of policy and program responses. In particular, the low female participation rate is a significant lost opportunity for Jordan. Our current 15% rate of female participation in the workforce is amongst the lowest in the world reinforced by Jordan’s rank on the Gender Inequality Index of 99 out of 146, and 134 of 142 in the Global Gender Gap Index. Jordan ranks 13 out of 16 countries in the Middle East and Africa, lagging behind most Arab countries, including Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt Mauritania and GCC countries. Furthermore, average wage for females is 67% lower than the average wage for males in all types of jobs. 27% Figure 8: Gender Equality Gender Equality Female Participation Rate, 2012 Rank of Selected Countries Gender Inequality Index, 2013 Rank of Selected Countries te te ar dl ei li lt it id il n i ‘Source: UNDP, World Bank According to the macroeconomic model that has been used as part of the development of Jordan 2025 this vision, increasing female participation rate in Jordan to the MENA average (from 15% to 27% over the next decade) would have major positive impacts on economic growth in Jordan, by at least 5% by 2025. Achieving better workforce participation and retention rates would not only drive growth and raise household prosperity, but would accelerate improvements in the nation’s finances by increasing the number of tax-paying workers in the formal sector. This would also help to fund social security programs for the less privileged and improve government services in all governorates of the Kingdom. 1.1.5 Employment Although strong growth in key sectors has driven significant employment creation on the demand side over the past decade, many of the newly created jobs are being filled by low-cost, low-skilled foreign workers instead of Jordanians. An estimated 658,000 foreign workers work in Jordan, nearly two-thirds of work in the informal sector. Foreign workers are most present in construction, agriculture and manufacturing (41%, 38%, 37% of respective sector workforces), which are also three of the fastest-growing sectors outside the public sector. While the presence of cheaper foreign labour enhances the competitiveness of several key sectors of Jordan’s economy, it also puts downward pressure on the wages of Jordanians in those sectors. This has historically added to the ‘culture of shame’ that some jobs available in the private sector are not suitable for Jordanians, which has led many Jordanians instead to seek out the better paid and more secure opportunities that have been made available in the public sector. As the National Employment Strategy highlighted, if we manage to encourage Jordanians to enter and remain in the workforce, the next challenge will be creating more jobs and improving labour market mechanisms that help young people to find available job opportunities. However, typical labour market mechanisms that exist in healthy and productive economies are largely absent or dysfunctional in Jordan today- replaced instead by non-institutional job hunting methods. There is a need to develop a dynamic and transparent labour market on both the supply and demand sides. The Ministry of Labour has recently started to develop mechanisms and organize employment campaigns to bridge the existing gap. These efforts should be supported and institutionalized to develop active labor market policies. Several sectors face a supply and demand mismatch. In healthcare, for example, Jordanian universities currently produce 3,500 medical and nursing graduates each year, while Higher Education Strategy estimates indicate that only 1,300 new medical professionals are hired by Jordan's domestic healthcare industry each year. This suggests that the supply of doctors and nurses is almost three times the level of demand. W535 ee An estimated 236,000 Jordanians currently work in Saudi Arabia, 170,000 in the UAE and 70,000 in Kuwait. While the Jordanian expatriates in the region and the world can contribute to national development, sustainable long term economic development cannot be built by having a large number of the nation’s ‘best and brightest’ work abroad and replacing them with unskilled foreign workers who. transfer their savings outside the country. The first priority of our national education system and labour markets should be to provide meaningful opportunities for Jordanians to work in Jordan. In addition to improving the performance of our education system and the efficiency of our labour markets, we must also address the desires and aspirations of youth and their parents. Most importantly, social attitudes towards vocational jobs need to change and the incentive system between public sector and private sector employment needs to be fundamentally re-evaluated. The government continues to the employer of both the first and last resort for the majority of Jordanians. Consequently, there are over 250,000 people on the Civil Service waiting list for a public sector position because of the perception of the public sector offering a more attractive and secure package to many young job seekers. To change this reality, Jordan's private sector must be the primary engine for growth and job creation for Jordanians. Too many of the private sector jobs created today are filled by foreign workers rather than Jordanians. Young people should be encouraged to work in vocational professions and the private sector should be the most desired place to work. Our education system needs to focus on equipping our youth with vocational skills and, as they enter the workforce, our youth need to be encouraged and enabled through a more transparent and level playing field when they apply for vacant positions. New market matching mechanisms need to be accompanied by hiring practices that reinforce a broader cultural change away from wasta and towards meritocracy, because perceptions about wasta are entrenched across the labour market today. 1.2 Social Outcomes The measurement of social outcomes is a relatively new but increasingly recognized and expanding field internationally. Citizens and policy makers are increasingly interested in looking beyond the traditional measurements of wealth (e.g. GDP and poverty) to broader and more holistic assessments, such as social cohesion and notions of wellbeing and life satisfaction felt by individuals and communities. The state of our society today can also be assessed through a set of criteria, such as the rule of law, justice, social inclusion and marginalization. 1.2.1 Rule of Law Belief in, and widespread social adherence to, the rule of law is fundamental to the confidence, stability and proper functioning of any society and state. In broad terms, Jordan’s judiciary is seen to be relatively independent but needs capacity building. According to World Bank indicators, contract enforcement is a particular area of weakness that must be addressed as a priority because of its negative impact on local and foreign investor cot Figure 9: Rule of Law Rule of Law \"the Weld an ‘Note: Scores rane fom 0 Low evel of achievement) to 1 ‘Source: Bertelsmann Foundation 14 Doing Baxiness Report In recent years, progress has been made in strengthening the country’s fight against corruption and building up the capabilities of the national integrity institutions, as evidenced by Jordan’s performance on the Transparency International corruption perceptions index 2014. In terms of international comparison, Jordan is perceived to be less corrupt than most countries in the world, including several EU member states such as Hungary, Bulgaria and Croatia. This is of course no room for complacency and Jordan 2025 includes measurés to continue to strengthen the national integrity system in the fight against corruption. The broader social challenge for the Kingdom will be building a genuine culture of respect and compliance with the rule of law in everyday life. Many Jordanians have become accustomed to using wasta and social connections to short-circuit official procedures. rn AG Figure 10: Anti-Corruption Performance Measurement Indicators Corruption —- Comparison to Selected Countries Irregular Payments & Bribes and Diversion of Pubic nds World EceoomeF nk out of (148 counties), Selected Counties, 2013-2014 Source: Transpareney Infernational, The Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014 1.2.2 Citizenship Citizenship — the sense of belonging, equality before the law and equal opportunities -is a vital prerequisite for any prosperous and stable society. Acts of good citizenship come in many forms, for example voting in national and municipal election, driving safely, and volunteering time to support a community group. Along with strong family ties, citizenship is one of the vital threads that strengthen the social and cultural fabric for our future. Public debate about the importance of citizenship has gained significant prominence over the past year through the discussion papers issued by His Majesty King Abdullah Il Majesty, in which he has outlined what ‘Active Citizenship’ means, why it is so important and how Jordanians can embrace the principle of active citizenship in their everyday life. Just as it is a vital ingredient into our political development journey, Active Citizenship also has vitally important economic as well as social implications. For example paying taxes is an important act of responsible citizenship. Good neighbors, who are mindful of rubbish and keeping shared spaces clean, are also good citizens. The growth of our civil society sector over the past decade is encouraging, with 127 international non-governmental organizations and 4500 local organizations operating in Jordan in this area, in addition to new programs and platforms for volunteerism that are spreading fast. Improving the depth and resilience of our social fabric through a strong sense of shared pride and a culture of active civic ‘engagement must remain a key priority for the future. 1.2.3 Families and Local Communities. The family, which constitutes the bedrock of Jordanian society, has witnessed tremendous change in the face of numerous external pressures over the last decade. The rapid growth of the Kingdom in the decade prior to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis brought about significant changes in daily life, including new amenities and services and the proliferation of technology. As they have all around the world, these new developments have reshaped the identity, lifestyle and habits of all our citizens. ‘The education level of Jordanian women has also significantly improved and brought about a shift in the ‘outlook and expectations of many Jordanian women, including a desire by many to have a career as well as a family. The confluence of these factors has placed new and challenging pressures on Jordanian families. It is not surprising in light of social and economic pressures that the fertility rate in Jordan has fallen and that incidents of divorce have increased. In 1976, the fertility rate in Jordan was 7.4 children per female. By 2012, it had fallen to 3.5 children per female. Conversely, the divorce rate has increased significantly in recent years rising to 2.6% in 2011, 2.8% in 2012 and 2.9% in 2013. Families are also vitally important for shaping the aspirations of our youth and instilling them with the civic values and ethics. Parenting attitudes have a direct impact on the life skills and attitudes passed on to the next generation, which in turn can have a big impact on educational attainment levels and employability skills later in life when they join the labour market. wiry WAN 1.2.4 Poverty and Disadvantaged Community Jordan has developed a wide-reaching and robust social safety, which has resulted in significant and important gains in reducing poverty and creating a more equal society over the past decade. The percentage of the population living in poverty has fallen from over 21% in 1997 to 14% in 2010 (the last year for which comprehensive national data is available), Nevertheless, poverty remains a national challenge and is more pronounced the further a governorate is located from Amman. If relatively large governorates like Zarqa, Amman and Irbid are excluded, the average poverty level rises to 20%. This shows that despite achieving gains at the national level, reducing the disparities between governorates continues to be an important policy priority for the next decade. Furthermore, a significant percentage of the population are struggling just above the official poverty line, underlining the importance of focusing on the development of lower-middle income groups to keep these groups from falling under the poverty line. 1.2.5 Cost of Living The government's attention and priorities have focused for decades on the expenditure side of the household budget ledger, including alleviating cost of living pressures through various direct and indirect subsidies. Social welfare spending, defined as total spending on direct and indirect subsidies for the poor, such as commodity subsidies and supporting health and education sectors, has increased in recent years. Social spending is estimated at about JD two billion annually, or 8.4% of GDP and 23.7% of the general budget for 2013. ‘The reasons for increased social spending are: + First, the increased demand for direct and indirect subsidies as a result of population growth and refugee crises faced by Jordan. * Second, pension spend has increased to 12% of the national budget and is expected to more than double within 10 years. hird, subsidies on electricity production, transmission and generation have increased significantly in order to help contain the cost of electricity to households and certain sectors. Financial assistance to the National Electric Power Company (NEPCO) and Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ) and their subsidiaries was estimated at 4.8% and 0.8% of GDP for 2014 respectively. While this has clearly helped to contain price increases, it has stretched the nation’s finances and created a welfare dependence among many Jordanian families as they try to manage the rising cost of living in an environment in which the income side of their household ledger has not made sufficient gains. Jordan's hard-fought gains in tackling poverty and inequality over the past decade remain fragile and at risk of being reversed unless we continue to support the poor and underprivileged. But the methods and approach we take to providing that support must change. It is not feasible to maintain the current levels of social spending as a share of GDP over the next decade given our budget pressures today and our expanding population in the years to come. The social support we can provide must be better targeted on those who are genuinely in need and we must help Jordanian families respond to cost of living concerns by expanding their income earning potential through employment rather than providing general subsidies to offset price increases. 1.2.6 Housing and Neighborhoods Finding and securing decent housing remains a source of concern for many Jordanian families. Home ownership in Jordan is low by international standards, and real estate prices have risen dramatically over the past decade in many parts of the Kingdom driven by a sharp rise in land prices and the pressure on housing supply created by successive waves of refugee migration to Jordai the majority of housing units today are not affordable for the majority of Jordanian fami now a surplus of high-end housing and a lack of supply of affordable housing for low and middle-income families despite clear market need at that level. Multi-family households and overcrowding are now increasingly common as 25% of households include one sleeping room and 44% have two sleeping rooms. Average household size is 5.4 with over 40% of urban households. 47% of rural households have 6+ people in one dwelling. International research also highlights that inadequate and overcrowded housing leads to worst health outcomes due to lower hygiene and poorer educational outcomes for children, especially in poor areas. Given the significance of housing as an issue for families, a clear and integrated national housing policy needs to be developed. Neighborhood and community safety is also an important issue for families and communities, and a vital factor for maintaining the confidence of local businesses and foreign tourists alike. One of Jordan’s great strengths is its comparative advantage as a safe and tolerant society in the middle of a troubled and volatile region. Jordan is considered by the international community to be a relatively stable society, providing citizens with a general sense of safety in public spaces, and making Jordan 8 more attractive location for foreign direct investment, particularly in comparison to other countries in the region.

According to rankings assembled by the World Economic Forum, Jordan is strong in the areas of public safety, performing well on dimensions such as the business costs of crime and violence (#16/148), organized crime (#13/148), and the reliability of police services (#43/148). Road safety stands out as a particular area of concern for the Kingdom. Jordan has one of the world’s highest rates of road fatalities, suggesting that urgent attention is required to create safer roads and neighborhoods for Jordanian families. Part of the solution must also be a change in driver attitudes and behaviors on our nation’s roads.

Our domestic population and domestic economy is too small to provide the jobs and the growth we require to provide the quality of life Jordanians aspire to. Jordan has many competitive advantages including as a strategic location at the intersection of three continents (Asia, Europe and Africa) and within the Middle East region between the GCC and the Levant. It also boasts a stable political climate and strong relations with neighboring countries and the world and has established a position as a strategic supplier of highly-skilled human resources for the GCC market. The private sector and Jordanian business leaders have proven their ability to compete at the regional and international levels. While there are many success stories we can be proud of, more needs to be done in order to strengthen the competitiveness of Jordan’s business environment as a basis for export success and as a hub for regional headquarters and investments by foreign investors. As shown in the figure below, despite significant growth in foreign trade during the past five years in absolute terms, export share of GDP declined from 48% in 2004 to 42% of GDP in 2014. The ratio of Jordan's exports to GDP is low compared to other similar countries. wu AN Figure 12: Foreign Trade Developments ‘Total of Exports as Percentage of GDP Total of Exports and Imports ‘Total exports and Imports “Total exports relative performance, 1998-2013, $ billion % of GDP. 2013, j 1 £ SEEEE GEG QELEREG2 E02 Total part e-Folio Source:Department of Statistics Source: UNCTAD This has led to a widening trade balance deficit, amounting to about JD9906.9 million in 2013, a rise of nearly JD772.7 million compared to 2012. Our high and persistent trade deficit is one of the most important challenges facing our national financial position, Our trade deficit reached 41.5% in 2013 of GDP due to increased imports of oil and oil derivatives and sluggish growth in exports as a share of GDP due to declining relative competitiveness of the economy as a whole. As highlighted in the graph below, our exports are also highly concentrated in many sectors on one or two markets highlighting the need to further diversify both the product mix and destination for our exports.

It also enjoys political, security and macroeconomic stability, excellent infrastructure, qualified human resources, in addition to the legislation governing the investment process. The volume of investments in 2013 was about JD2.2 billion, and they were concentrated in the sectors of industry, tourism entertainment cities, hotels, maritime transportation, hospitals and agriculture. As part of the ongoing efforts to develop the business environment and investment, the government has reviewed and amended several economic and trade legislation, notably those relating to investment, reorganization of the business, bankruptcy, liquidation and activating public-private partnerships, in line with best international practices in this area. Crucial to our trade and investment success is the quality of our local business environment. The volume of investments in 2013 was about JD2.2 billion, concentrated in industrials, tourism and entertainment, maritime transportation, hospitals and agriculture sectors. Nevertheless, as measured by respected international rankings, there is significant need for improvement in the competitiveness of the Kingdom’s business environment. In 2015 Jordan was ranked 117th out of 189 economies in the World Bank’sEase of Doing Business ranking, compared to 116th out of 189 countries in the previous year. Jordan's ranking in the 2015 World Economic Forum's. competitiveness indicators improved by four places to 64th globally out of 144 countries. According to these comparative international assessments, the areas most in need of reforms include investor protection arrangements, the cost of establishing a business, access to credit, the tax system, resolving insolvency and contract enforcement.

The average private sector worker's contribution more than doubled in value between 2000 and 2013. The biggest productivity increases in the past decade were in the mining sector, with 56% increase, and the finance sector, with 53% increase. Nevertheless, these impressive productivity gains still place us significantly behind the productivity levels of more advanced economies and they have been limited to the private sector. Compared to OECD countries, Jordan performs below all benchmark countries on labour productivity, averaging USS13 of value-added per person-hour worked. This was much lower than, for example, $29 for Turkey, $31 for the Czech Republic, $55 for Switzerland or $71 for Ireland. Productivity is also closely related to the innovative capacity of the economy and the ability to create new and better products, services and business models that meet the market needs. Despite being ranked seventh in the world for the availability of scientists and engineers, Jordan does not generate many patent applications, Jordan ranks below average in its peer group and only average amongst the region on the Global Innovation index. wx Improvements in the general business environment should also help to drive further improvements in productivity and innovation, by encouraging the importation of new technologies, systems and processes. Furthermore, a study of international benchmarks shows that public sector productivity is ighly correlated and responsive to private sector productivity, indicating that an improvement in the overall functioning of the government and more efficient service delivery would have a significant impact on improving private productivity levels. 1.3.3 Access to Capital Despite the growing instability and insecurity in the region, Jordan has exp of direct and indirect foreign investment in many economic sectors. This strengthened the Central Bank’s ability to develop a financially resilient and sophisticated banking system in accordance with international standards and practices, in comparison with regional and Arab banking institutions. This is shown by the indicators of financial strength of the banking system, particularly those related to rates of liquidity, profitability and capital adequacy, which has had the greatest impact in significantly increasing the investment attractiveness of banking institutions. 50% of equity in licensed banks in Jordan is held by non-Jordanians, which is considered one of the most important and strategic investments, due to their stability and growth. On the other hand, the negative repercussions of the global economic crisis in recent years and the increased uncertainty in the region have led banks to adopt tougher lending policies. The growing financing needs of the government and the trend towards the local market to fulfill a large part of these needs have reinforced banks’ conservative lending behavior, which in turn created a safe and competitive investment opportunity for lending to the private sector. Similarly, total deposits in local banks increased by 10.5% at the end of 2013, while non-resident deposits have seen a steady growth of 19.2%, which is an indicator of increased confidence in the Jordanian economy and banking system. ‘The Central Bank acknowledges that funding for Micro, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises has been modest (10% of total facilities granted), which highlights the need to strengthen the sector’s ability to access required finance with favorable lending conditions, since it is one of the vitally important sectors to drive economic activity. In light of this reality, the Central Bank strengthened its role in supporting local high value added economic sectors in order to stimulate economic growth, The Bank has given more attention to SMEs, providing funding programs directed towards local industry, tourism, renewable energy and agriculture, for terms appropriate to clients’ financing needs (five years for industry, tourism and agriculture and ten years for renewable energy), and with a ceiling of 5% of loan portfolio of operating banks. In addition, the Central Bank has sought to provide credit lines for ‘SME through the banks operating in the Kingdom. Jordan has managed to secure $70 million soft loan from the World Bank and a credit line of $50 million with similar conditions from the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development. This was later followed by another credit line of $150 million from the same fund due to the success of the banking sector in utilizing these amounts in the development of SME in Jordan. Almost the full amount of the World Bank loan was used in developing more than four thousand micro, small and medium enterprises, 60% of which were established outside the capital city. Work is underway to complete final terms of reference for a special loan from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) worth $150 million for the same purpose. The Central Bank has provided the needed facilities and support to enable banks to benefit from this loan at appropriate costs and maturities. Accordingly, the funds that have been, or will be, provided to the sector amount to $420 million. According to a study conducted by the World Bank, 49% of large enterprises were able to access needed bank credit, compared to 35% for medium enterprises, 26% for small enterprises and 15% for micro enterprises. It is worth noting that several non-bank financial institutions provide finance for micro, small and medium enterprises. Hopefully, the activities of these institutions will significantly grow in thanks to the central bank's determination to organize and monitor the work of these institutions. The Bank has set up a system to monitor and supervise microfinance institutions in order to strengthen their role in financing micro and small enterprises, which play a vital role in the fighting poverty and unemployment and promoting financial depth and economic growth. This system has recently been approved by the Council of Ministers. In addition to domestic capital, foreign capital- especially foreign direct investment (FDI)-is critical to the economic growth, productivity increase and technology transfer. Available data indicate that Jordan has managed to increase foreign direct investment (FDI stock amounts to 80% of GDP, second only to Lebanon in the region). Much of the FDI inflow was from the GCC, Iraq and the Jordanian working abroad. A large part of FDI inflow has gone into the real estate sector. sta WAN In comparison with the countries in the region, Jordan has managed to attract 3% of the total FDI coming into the MENA region. Jordan's GDP accounts for 0.8% of the combined MENA GDP. This indicates that Jordan has become a favorite destination for many investors. However, Jordan still can position itself as an important hub on the global investment map, and a regional investment incubator for financial services, renewable energy and information technology, like those countries that managed to position themselves as regional hubs for service exports. By comparison, other regional hubs for services exports, such as Ireland and Singapore, achieve much higher levels (142% and 252% of GDP respectively compared to Jordan’s 80% of GDP). 1.3.4 Entrepreneurship and Small and Medium Enterprises Jordan is a country of entrepreneurs and start-ups. According to the World Bank, 10% of working age population are startup owners and micro, small and medium enterprises represent more than 98% of total establishments in Jordan. The high level of entrepreneurship in Jordan may be due to the weak growth of jobs created by large companies, the decline of employment in the public sector institutions after the privatization program and government policies aimed at reducing the public budget deficit and rationalizing the public sector in recent years. Nevertheless, the new business and SME segments of the private sector have experienced modest growth in recent years. Net growth in the number of non-agricultural economic projects was only 1.3% per year over the period 2006-2011. The lowest growth rate was that of enterprises that employ less than 5 workers, at just over 1% per year, compared to 4% per year for enterprises that employ 10-19 workers, 20-49 workers and more than 100 workers. Entrepreneurs and startup owners in Jordan face several difficulties in starting their business or expanding their scope and objectives. The most important challenges they face are the lack of specialized funding programs, high costs of funding, inflexible funding conditions that are not aligned to the needs and capabilities of small and medium enterprise owners, the administrative and procedural difficulties related to business registration and high indirect taxes and fees for the registration and licensing of businesses. Jordan Enterprise Development Corporation (JEDCO) provides several financial and technical support programs for SME. In 1994, the Central Bank established Jordan Loan Guarantee Corporation to provide guarantees for SME loans and increase their access to appropriate funding. The Bank contributed in providing a special fund for industrial finance managed by the Corporation because of the importance of this sector within the small and medium enterprise sector. Nevertheless, the small capital of the company and the limited funding available to the Fund remain the biggest obstacles to expanding the umbrella of the guarantees provided, at affordable and competitive commission rates, by commercial banks or other financing institutions that provide funding. In addition, the Central Bank provided several initiatives and funding programs to increase economic sectors’ capacity, notably renewable energy, industry, tourism and agriculture, and particularly SME, to access needed funding through banks, to 5% of total credit facilities provided by banks, and offered credit lines from foreign sources for the same purpose. In spite of these efforts, SME sector still faces several challenges, due to the lack of technical support, training, guidance and funding programs. As illustrated below, this has created the so-called “missing middle” in the structure of the economy. A significant decrease in the number of firms is observed when businesses reach the size of 10 or more employees. Ninety-six percent of firms in Jordan are “micro” firms, with less than 10 employees, accounting for just 8% of total company revenues. Large firms of 100 employees or more make up 0.4% of all firms and account for 75% of total revenues. we NG Figure 15: The Private Sector Structure (The Missing Middle) “Private Sector Structure Outcomes — the Missing Middle ‘Total Number of Firms vs Total Revenues of Firms at Each Stage of the Firm Life Cyele in Jordan, 2012 “ea Naber oF al Ree = tena § magn cen ag = Teast te no cc sar Sen: Dept Si Eas Sa 2012 Sinema The nature of competition between small and medium-sized enterprises is quite rigid due to the absence of a robust national competition. Small and medium. d enterprises do not contribute certain capital-intensive sectors, such as telecommunications. Nevertheless, as shown in the illustration, concentration levels remain high in a number of non-capital intensive sectors in Jordan such as information technology, pharmaceuticals (medicines), financial services and tourism. This creates barriers to entry for new players and can suffocate the potential both for lower prices and better quality products and services for consumers. In some cases this lack of competition is magnified by preferential legislation and tax concessions that enable industry incumbents to maintain their dominant position in some markets. Since small and medium-sized enterprises are vital in the development of the national economy and the creation of job opportunities, the National Strategy for the encouragement of entrepreneurship and the development of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises for 2015-2019 was prepared. Work is also under way to develop a law for small and medium enterprises.

As a result of these investments and the success of our private sector, the Jordanian economy is more diversified than many neighboring economies in the Middle East. To maintain and strengthen the diversity in our economy, it is necessary to continue to develop the export-potential of our economic sectors and activities with comparative advantages at the regional and global levels. Jordan 2025 identified a number of priority sectors for further development and promotion given their export and job creation potential. There is no doubt that Jordan has achieved high economic growth during the period 2002-2008. This growth, however, did not contribute to reducing poverty and unemployment or bridging the gap between governorates to the desired extent. This highlights the need to focus on improving social indicators rather than assuming that they go hand in hand with growth. Instead, these indicators should be directly measured and adopted as signs of development and goal achievement.

Jordan has been subject to waves of immigration that have contributed to population growth in a turbulent regional environment. Asa result, the responsibilities of public institutions have increased. As Government has become larger and more ‘complex, it has also become expensive to manage and sustain. At 31.3% of GDP in 2014, Jordan's public expenditure as a share of the economy is very large by international standards and needs to be reduced and made more efficient. In this context, we must build on previous efforts that have been undertaken as part of the restructuring of some public sector institutions under Law No. (17) for the year (2014) regarding the restructuring of governmental institutions and departments, under which some institutions were cancelled or merged. The creation of government department and development of organizational structures bylaw was also issued in order to create a legislative framework governing the organizational structure of the government and regulating the process of creating new institutions or preventing financial and administrative independence. Where appropriate, we should also look to the private sector to perform some basic functions currently undertaken in the public sector where they can deliver better quality services on a more sustainable financial basis while still being accountable to citizens. According to the Government Effectiveness Index, Jordan's performance has declined during the period 2002-2013 and ranked lower than comparable countries.

The central challenge is to implement the laws and regulations that already exist in an equal, fair and transparent manner. Government officials are not alone in the need to comply with the rule of law and administer it fairly. This requires a reciprocal commitment from citizens and business owners to comply with the law whether, for example, by paying taxes, abiding by government customs procedures or building design and safety regulations. Nevertheless, Government does need to set the example but unfortunately today the administration of laws and regulations remains highly uneven and subject to too much discretion and arbitrary interpretation. This is symptomatic of a broader problem in government which is that too often informal relationships and protocols take precedence over formal protocols and procedures. Importantly, this also includes hiring and firing decisions. This has resulted in a loss of citizen confidence in government. As the process of making decisions slows down, the costs in terms of lost time and additional transaction fees for citizens, businesses and entrepreneurs goes up. Our society and our system of government must become more strongly rule-based as this is fundamental to building a society and an economic system based on a level playing field. It also requires building administrative capacity and delegating responsibility to apply the law and regulations within government to the lowest level of management. In Jordan today, too many minor decisions are sent up the chain of command in some ministries or institutions instead of delegating authority to middle level managers for routine procedures and instructions. This has created a cri ‘of middle management in the public sector. Middle managers, who should be empowered to follow standard operating procedures and requirements clearly set down in laws and regulations, have become reluctant to make decisions. This has become most problematic with respect to making routine and regular financial decisions, such as the processing of regulated fees and charges and the signing of routine supply contracts. The system of delegation of powers to Secretary Generals adopted by the Council of Ministers last year us an important step forward in the process of improving decision making in the public sector and in accelerating the enforcement of laws and regulations in government institutions. The frequency of leadership changes in government together with centralized decision-making and the weakness of institutions have conspired to encourage and reinforce a short-term, tactical approach rather than strategic management approach to policy and public administration. This has resulted in frequent changes in legislative and regulatory settings, further undermining investor and citizen confidence in the strength and meaning of the rule of law. In this context, more needs to be done consistent with the recommendations of the National Integrity System review and the Privatization Evaluation Committee report. The management habits that permeate through the public sector can be changed if the following is don + Genuine, rule-based delegation of authority and commensurate accountability for results. + Greater commitment to competence and merit as the bases for recruitment and promotion in the civil service, in accordance with the appointment to leadership positions bylaw No. (3) for the year 2013, and the amendments to the Civil Service bylaw by developing employment and evaluation criteria the public sector. + A shift from last minute time management to well-planned plans at all levels of management. 1.4.4 The Size and Quality of Services The Kingdom's public sector is a large national institution with extensive reach and influence across all aspects of economic and social life. Jordan's public sector reflects the social contract between citizens and decision makers. What really matters for citizens and for the business community is performance and efficiency. Inrelation to the size and structure of public administration, itis helpful to consider several dimensions including: + the employment in the public sector. * direct ownership of economic activity through state-owned enterprises. * service delivery activities, such as provision of public education, healthcare and housing. + the scale of subsidies and tax exemptions offered to citizens and to the business community. Our public sector today suffers from overemployment, inefficiency and low levels of productivity. Jordan's public sector is now one of the largest in the world measured on a number of dimensions. The civil service consists of 110 ministries, units and subdivisions, and accounts for 20% of GDP. As a result, public sector salaries and pension obligations account for 27% of annual government expenditures. Many government entities have little or no funds available to pay for investment in training, systems and facilities maintenance to enhance the quality of services provided or to improve their productivity, which requires attention over the medium term. The level of direct ownership by the state in our economy has decreased in the past two decades due to the privatization program under which many assets were sold to local and international investors. The Privatization Commission report issued in 2014 estimates state-owned assets of about $15 billion today. These assets need to be managed in a way that ensures covering costs, achieving the best public benefits for citizens and relinquishing those remaining assets that should not be managed by the state because they interfere with the basic functions of government or because they potentially compete with the private sector. The Privatization Commission report has identified the principles and foundations for managing these assets in the public interest. Delivery of key services to society is a major part of the government's activities and an important form of connection between the Government and the people. Public spending on healthcare amounted to 6.2% of GDP in 2013, almost comparable to Switzerland (7.0% of GDP) and Finland (6.9% of GDP). Public spending on education was slightly lower than benchmark countries (3.9 % of GDP), while pensions spending was considerably higher (12.3% of GDP). Table 2: Public Expenditure on Social Services Provision of social services Public Expenditure on Social Services % share of GDP, 2013 Georgia 1.7% Hungary 50% 4,7% 9,9% Lithuania 47% 5,2% 6,0% Tunisia 42% 62% 3 Ireland 5.2% 62% 62% Source: World Bank Note: According to Government of Jordan sources, health expenditure in 2013 was 7.6% of GDP seu TAN Over the past five decades, the government has provided an extensive array of subsidies, tax exemptions and other direct transfers that have improved the lives of many Jordanian families. ‘Subsidies have also played a vital role in helping Jordanians and their families manage the rising cost of living, particularly over the last decade. High income tax exemption levels also mean that only 3% of Jordanians actually pay any income tax today. The new law aims at expanding the tax base. As noted above, despite the success of recent reforms to fuel subsidies, the aggregate cost of direct consumption subsidies still remains unsustainably high, at JD2 billion, or 8.5% of GDP. Jordan 2025 proposes a series of measures designed to help maintain social services and safety nets for Jordanians who genuinely need assistance, while at the same time ensuring the cost of those social services is financially manageable for the country over the longer term. With respect to the quality of services delivered by Government, public satisfaction levels have declined over the past decade across all major areas of service delivery impacting the daily life of Jordanians. The Government Performance Development Program 2013-2014 acknowledges this challenge and renews efforts within Government to upgrade basic services across the board. E- Government solutions provide significant promise to increase convenience for citizens and efficiency for Government (including greater efficacy to help combat corruption). Despite having identified the potential for e-Government as early as 2001 early and despite having the capabilities of Jordan's ICT sector to support implementation, Jordan has not succeeded in realizing the full potential of e- Government and now finds itself lagging the rest of the region in this area.

By shedding light on the decisions and actions of government, transparency helps to build a more informed citizenry and a government that is more responsive to the needs and demands of citizens. Citizens should have ready access to information about what government entities are doing, how taxpayer money is being spent by public sector entities and the rationale as to why leaders in government believe those activities are going to create specific or broad-scale public goods of benefit to all citizens. It is clear from a number of international indicators and rankings that Jordan has made progress, but has significant room for improvement in transparency and accountability to citizens. Setting high standards of excellence government performance requirements generally, and information disclosure to citizens specifically, is an important foundation for effective transparency. In this context, it is noteworthy that Jordan is the first and so far only Arab country to be part of a multilateral transparency initiative called the Open Government Partnership (OGP). Using international standards of excellence and commitment mechanisms, this initiative is an effective way to set a high bar of excellence and to use the power of international obligations and commitments as a motivator for local action and real implementation. Jordan's participation in the OGP and the commitments it has. made as part of this initiative provides an independent way of assessing current outcomes on transparency and accountability dimensions of government performance. In terms of application within the public sector, a Practice Guide on Public Sector Governance issued in 2014 to translate the principles of transparency and accountability into every day practice. sre TAN One area of importance to transparency is the disclosure of basic government performance information to the public. Simply publishing a lot of raw information in the public domain, such as statistics and reports, does not constitute effective transparency nor does it aid accountability. To support strong accountability to citizens the information provided by government must be accurate, easily understood and timely. The advent of new communication tools and platforms over the past decade, including the internet, has helped to make the government's mandate and activities more transparent to citizens. It is now commonplace, for example, for Government ministries and entities to have a website articulating their vision, mission and core responsibilities. Nevertheless, these information and reporting platforms need to be maintained on a daily basis and new tools and capabilities added, such as e-Government processes and social media tools for sharing information In addition to basic information, there is significant room to improve the way in which information on budget and finance is shared with the public, and performance data of relevance to citizens is disclosed, such as graduation rates from schools and the successful treatments rates achieved by hospitals and medical clinics in the national health system. Another key area for transparency and accountability is the institutionalization of public consultation mechanisms in the development of new policies. Recent major policy reviews, such as the Privatization and National Integrity reviews, have involved public consultation mechanisms, as did the process of developing Jordan 2025 (as outlined in the Introduction), including consultations between government and business and civil society organizations as well as an open Call for Submissions process. These methods for public consultation need to be institutionalized across Government in the development of future plans and strategies. The national media also play a vital role as the ‘fourth estate’ by using publicly available information as the basis for commentary and investigative reporting to stimulate national debate and dialogue about the major issues facing our country and the performance of the government in addressing those challenges. A recent report prepared by the Jordan Media Institute (JMI), the new media fact checking initiative supported by the King Abdullah Fund for Development and JMI, found that over 60% of news stories published in the Kingdom’s newspapers were sourced from Petra and other press statements issued by Government entities, civil society organizations and the private sector. This highlights both the opportunity to leverage the nation’s newspapers to broadcast government information and the need to strengthen the capacity of journalists to analyze, interpret and comment accurately on publicly available information. 1.4.6 Resource Security and Management Jordan faces significant national challenges due to the extreme scarcity of water, energy and arable land assets coupled with rapidly increasing consumption trends. This has been compounded by a lack of diversification in its sources for these key inputs (energy and food in particular), leaving the economy vulnerable to external shocks. Given consumption trends and Jordan’s plans for rapid economic expansion, demand is projected to significantly outpace current supply levels. However, recent years have seen an expansion in projects related to the diversification of energy sources, and initiatives related to strategic projects in the water sector. 1.4.6.1 Water Security Jordan suffers from clear imbalance between water demand and available water resources. On the one hand, the demand for water and sanitation services is unprecedented and growing while renewable water resources are limited. This is accompanied by the overconsumption and over-pumping from the majority of aquifers. The gap between demand and available supply has widened due to climate change; dam storage and groundwater recharge have fallen, which led to decreasing per capita use to less than 135 m3 per year. On the other hand, fiscal deficit in water and sanitation services has greatly increased as a result of the stagnation of self-revenue generated from low tariff of domestic and agricultural water and high operational costs due to the long distance of water sources to consumption centers. Moreover, the sector's revenues do not cover its expense due to the high cost of finding and providing new non-traditional water sources, such , the rising input prices, particularly electricity prices due to Jordan's dependence on importing more than 96% of its energy needs and the hosting of large influxes of refugees by Jordan. Reports indicate that the financial retum only covers two-thirds of service delivery cost, and that the sector losses have increased. by 1% of GDP. Furthermore, future predictions show a growing deficit in the coming years. sre TAN Water loss rate (water not paid for) is 41% as a result of the attacks on water networks and sources and low efficiency of supply and distribution systems for domestic and industrial and agricultural purposes due to financial inability to sustain them. This situation has led to economic, social and political pressures. To prevent water from becoming an obstacle to development, the government allocated more money to meet the growing demand for water and to find additional water sources. Serious efforts have been made to ensure the sustainability and maximum utilization of water and reduce waste of water, and therefore using water for developmental purposes. In addition, legislation and laws have been passed to preserve water resources, develop water sustainability strategies and distribute water equally across the Kingdom. Jordan withdraws approximately 25-30% more water than its internal resources can provide. The problem of scarcity is compounded by chronic inefficiency. The national water network is estimated to lose approximately 41% of the available daily supply through leaks and theft from the network. Keeping the current price of water to end users constant and assuming full usage and efficiency in the distribution network, this water loss represents JD120 million of lost government revenue each year, which represents 67% of the current revenues earned from water charges. Despite severe scarcity, Jordan has been able to provide its people with high levels of water supply and sanitation services whereby 97% of its urban and 91% of its rural population have access to water. However, water supply is intermittent, with many households receiving water once a week. Sani services cover 58% of the population. Although the efforts to boost supply, such as the Di conveyance project, and stem losses from the system by reducing leaks and theft, are important, can and should be done on the demand side to change consumption behaviors. The successful private sector participation in the water sector (Wastewater Treatment Plant Project and the Disi Water Conveyance Project) and commercial-based business through establishing water companies, have contributed to increasing water security. Future plans include improving the sector's financial efficiency to ensure sustainable achievement of sectoral goals of raising per capita domestic water consumption rate over the next ten years to about 445 liters/day, and increase the population connected to water networks to 95%. The Ministry will seek to distribute water equally among the Kingdom's governorates and remote areas, and provide enough water to meet the needs of economic, agricultural, industrial, tourism and trade sectors. Plans also include increasing the population connected to sewage networks from 58% to 75% by 2025. With regard to the reuse of treated wastewater, the Ministry seeks to increase the quantity to be used in agricultural and industrial fields, so that 100% of treated water is used. 1.4.6.2 Energy Security Jordan imports about 97% of its energy requirements, which includes mainly crude oil, oil derivatives and natural gas. Local sources cover the remaining 3% of requirements with renewable energy contributing only a small proportion to this mixture. In 2013, total primary energy consumed in Jordan was about 8.2 million tons of oil equivalent, 82% of which are Crude oil and oil derivatives, 11% natural gas, 3% renewable energy and imported electricity and 4% petroleum coke and coal. ‘The high annual growth rates of demand for energy (5.5% for primary energy and 6.4% for demand for electricity), compared to global levels is one of the Kingdom's most significant development challenges. The influx of Syrian refugees into Jordan has increased the demand for energy and electricity. Per capita primary energy consumption is 1250 Kilograms oil equivalent (kgoe), and per capita share of electricity is 2230 kilowatt-hour (kWh), which are higher than in comparable developing countries. Energy consumption density was 208 kgoe per $1,000 of GDP, which is high compared to developed economies where energy consumption density is about 150 kgoe per $1,000 at fixed prices. The installed electricity generation capacity is currently 3900 MW. Work is underway to ensure additional generation capacity by expanding power generation through special generation projects ‘owned and funded by the private sector. The national electricity grid for transmission and distribution has expanded to cover the Kingdom's governorates and most rural and remote communities. The percentage of the population with electricity supply reached 99.9% in 2013, which is similar to rates in advanced economies. Electricity tariff rates for consumers are heavily subsidized at about 100% of consumer prices. To address this imbalance, a national plan for the gradual removal of subsidies by increasing electricity tariffs annually was approved so that by the end of 2017, full costs will be recovered and the Treasury will stop subsidizing the electricity sector. Work is also underway to reduce electrical losses by 17% on transmission and distribution networks. In order to ease the burden of the energy sector on economic and social development, a comprehensive national strategy is now being pursued to increase the contribution of local sources in the total energy mix through a number of initiatives. The most important of these are expanding renewable energy projects, activating energy efficiency programs, using oil shale as an alternative resource for producing electricity and producing shale oil, using nuclear power as an alternative energy source, further expanding the use of natural gas in power generation and promoting energy interconnection projects between countries in the region to achieve greater energy security. os TAN 1.4.6.3 Food Security Jordan imports 81% of its food requirements. This includes importation 63.4% of the Kingdom's cereals requirements. Unlike energy supplies, Jordan’s portfolio of food supplies is reasonably well diversified and the Kingdom has a three to twelve month strategic stockpile of basic commodities. Nevertheless, Jordan is highly exposed to international commodity price fluctuations. In 2014, the Kingdom imported about 600.000 tons per year of basic commodities, an increase of 11% compared to 2013. Jordan's imports of sugar, rice, dry milk and vegetable oils were between 3% and 20% compared to 2013. There is a three to twelve months strategic stock of basic commodities in the Kingdom. Jordan imports wheat and barley throughout the year at an annual rate of between 1.6 and 4.5 million tons to maintain the strategic reserves required to achieve a balance between imported and consumed quantities and capacities of various storage sites. The Kingdom's consumption of wheat increased in 2014 by 21% compared to 2010. Its consumption of flour also increased since the beginning of this year by 5,000 tons per month due to the population growth and the influx of Syrian refugees. The most important challenges in this area are the fluctuation of international prices of basic food commodities and the high consumption levels, which requires increasing local production and food security requirements and expanding storage capacity in the Kingdom. Moreover, the population increase due to the influx of more than a million and four hundred thousand Syrian refugees, in addition to the Kingdom's population of about six million and seven hundred thousand people, led to a significant increase in the consumption of food items. This places financial burdens on the government, particularly in relation to bread; total subsidies for grains (wheat and feed) amounted to about JD222 million in 2014. With regard to energy and water prices, the government has worked hard to contain the impact of commodity price shocks on households through price controls and subsidies. While Jordan continues to review the subsidy reform policy in the next decade to direct support to those who deserve it and to remove the distortions caused by subsidies, these measures should be addressed gradually, taking into account the sources of income and the ability of the various segments of the society to adapt. 1.4.7 Infrastructure According to the World Economic Forum, Jordan ranks comparatively well for the quality of its infrastructure (38th out of 148 comparable economies). The road and air transport infrastructure, electricity supply, and mobile phone networks are key strengths for future economic growth and integration with regional and global markets. Transportation infrastructure along road and air links is well developed, with plans to improve the maritime and railway infrastructure. Jordan has an extensive 8,000 km road network spanning across the Kingdom, connecting it with all its neighboring countries, The Port of Aqaba and the new Queen Alia International Airport are the Kingdom's two major gateways to the rest of the world, and both are undergoing significant upgrades in capacity and the quality of services provided. In addition, other long-term infrastructure mega-projects, such as the Red-Dead Sea Canal and the national rail network also offer more opportunities to significantly enhance the Kingdom's economic security and resilience and improve Jordan's position as a hub for regional commerce. It is clear that infrastructure projects are critical to enhancing the Kingdom's energy, water and food security as well as stimulating private sector growth and trade expansion with the region and the world. While the new projects recently delivered and those that are currently underway are encouraging, the lesson learned from the last decade is that more forward planning is required as is greater expertise in Government with respect to tendering and negotiation of Public Private Partnership agreements for these types of megaprojects. Foreign investors are interested in coming to Jordan and supporting the Kingdoms infrastructure development requirements, but they need a stable legal and contractual framework. The new Investment Law and the Public-Private Partnership Law are the legislative framework that will help to speed up the approval of projects and underpin contractual obligations for major projects. Oa TAN The transport sector is one of the important sectors on which focus should be placed and for which a clear strategy should be developed, especially public transport as one of the critical priorities. In this context, the long-term national transport sector strategy is an opportunity to consolidate the results already achieved and to strengthen the modernization of the transport system to fully support economic development in Jordan. The proposed strategy is a combination of regulatory measures (legislation and regulations) and infrastructure projects designed to meet these challenges. It is noteworthy that there are a number of important strategic projects to enhance the sector’s performance, both in public transport- such as the Amman- Zarqa Bus Rapid Transit- and national rail network. 1.4.8 Macroeconomic Outcomes Sound and sustainable finances are fundamental to the health of any economy. A steady sequence of external shocks, including the Global Financial Crisis, the Arab Spring, the disruption of natural gas supplies from Egypt and the pressures caused by the influx of Syrian refugees, have placed tremendous pressure of the nation’s macro-economic fundamentals. Jordan's debt as a percentage of GDP is 83%. The government budget deficit is unsustainably high, at about 8.3% of GDP for 2014, The fiscal and current account deficits continue to put a major strain on all areas of the economy, restricting the policy options available to the government. Nevertheless, the recent measures taken by the government over the past two years have improved the sovereign credit rating of Jordan, according to Standards & Poor's latest report on Jordan. There are certainly some external factors beyond our control that constrain our ability to accelerate growth. Nonetheless, making real progress is an urgent task, and we must proceed with further reforms in order to restore long-term fiscal sustainability, notwithstanding the external environment. ‘The Government has taken a number of difficult decisions and implemented several difficult reforms, for which it received international recognition, including the lifting of fuel subsidies at the end of 2012. There will be more difficult choices and reforms required over the coming decade, on both the revenue and expenditure sides of the Government's accounts. 1.4.8.1 Government Revenue The Government's revenue base today is highly dependent on indirect taxes, especially income tax, rather than direct taxes. The charts below illustrate the composition of the government's revenue in 2013. The rate of growth in tax revenues as a percentage of GDP shows that government tax revenue has been stagnant for a decade despite the growth in the economy. The new income tax law aims to improve the government's revenue based on rates that are more socially accepted. Figure 20: Government Revenue Government Revenue Contribution of tax Annual government revenue, revenue to GDP, 2013, by source, 2013 == Nominal GDP 2” Se Ta events x BN JO D Grants 8 pe rr) — 697 | Nontas Revenve “Tasso Income & Profits [68 Source: Ministry of Finance, 2018 As highlighted earlier in this document, Jordan suffers from a low level of formal workforce participation by its working age population. It is estimated that 50% of Jordanians of working age are either actively seeking work but unemployed or working in the informal sector. That low level of participation in the formal economy, combined with a high tax-free threshold on income, means that ‘only 3% of Jordanians contribute to the income tax base of the Kingdom. To offset the cost of living on Jordanian families and to encourage growth and job creation through the private sector, the Government also grants a significant number of tax exemptions. Tax exemptions granted to both individuals and corporate are estimated at more than JD834 million in foregone revenue in 2013, or 2.5% of GDP. This requires a comprehensive review and a new approach to these exemptions and how they are to be granted. In addition to rates and approved exemptions, the capabilities and capacities of government tax collection agencies are critical factors. As highlighted in the chart below, the enforcement of current tax laws and regulations by revenue departments raises many question marks and erodes the confidence of taxpayers in these departments. An estimated JD370 million in taxes due remained unpaid in 2012 and tax evasion was estimated at JD750 in the same year. The financial reform plan, which was recently adopted by the Council of Ministers and whose executive program will be prepared, seeks to deal with these challenges in order to enhance the government's ability to increase its revenue effectively and efficiently.

Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public spending and developing targeting systems that take into account the social and economic environment in Jordan are important approaches to achieving both social stability and financial sustainability. Better identification and targeting of the poor and vulnerable families is essential to support those genuinely in need and prevent segments of ‘our new and emerging middle classes from falling back into poverty. A combination of measures implemented gradually over time will be required, including improved tax collection mechanisms, application of the law, increased transparency and accountability and the replacement of consumption subsidies by cash payments to those who need it the most. Byten TAN ww WAN Chapter Two Sox SMA 2. Transforming our model of development Jordan has experienced difficult and volatile conditions over the past decades. Nevertheless, ithas achieved several important accomplishments although regional conditions were not conducive to planning for the future, Developing a vision for 2025 will be extremely difficult due to several changes. However, there is consensus on the need to strengthen the internal social and economic situation, develop the policies, and identify the initiatives that strengthen the society and economy, as well as the ability to reflect on and deal with the emerging issues, in order to achieve development. The assessment of the current situation clearly shows that a significant progress has been made over the past decade in improving the welfare of average Jordanian families, reducing poverty and achieving equality in society. This progress, however, has not been accompanied by an improvement of the Jordanian economy's competitiveness. As a result, these gains remain vulnerable to being overturned because of the current weaknesses and the relative decline in the competitiveness of the business environment in Jordan. There is no doubt that given the current financial pressures on our economy and its people and the elevated and continuing level of insecurity and conflict in our region, Vision 2025 is ambitious. However, as His Majesty has said, Jordan has proven time and time again throughout its history that our people are resilient and resourceful. As we have throughout our history, we must continue to pull together as a nation despite the challenges and obstacles in our path to achieve the levels of wellbeing and prosperity we aspire to for all Jordanians and the peace and security we would like to see across our region. The prosperity of every Jordanians family ultimately comes from the opportunities generated by a dynamic and competitive economy in which all citizens participate through employment and entrepreneurship. What is clear from the ‘Jordan Today’ assessment is that we have made considerable progress over the past decade in improving the wellbeing of the average Jordanian family and reducing poverty and inequality across our society, but that progress has not been achieved on the basis of a more dynamic and competitive economy. As a result hard-won gains of the recent past are now at risk of being lost because of the current weaknesses and vulnerabilities in our national finances and the declining overall competitiveness of our business environment. As the chart below shows, the competitiveness of Jordan's economy has deteriorated relative to other economies. Our central challenge over the next decade must be to reverse this decline. By building a more competitive economy, we will create the jobs Jordanians aspire to and achieve inclusive and sustainable prosperity and progress in individual and household income. Figure 23: Achieving Growth based on Competitiveness The Challenge Ahead - Prosperity based on Competitiveness Prosperity and Competitiveness Selected Countries, 2014 GD P Per C api ta, $ 00 0 Shure Wael ono Forum bal Cmptinenen Report Weed Bank As this chart makes clear, Jordan needs to chart a fundamentally different course to achieve the aspirations of Jordan 2025. As many commentators and stakeholders pointed out throughout the consultation process to develop Jordan 2025, the challenge is more of achieving effective and disciplined implementation rather than knowing ‘what to do’. Over the past decade, the government, the private sector, civil society associations, donor organizations, Royal Commissions and think tanks have produced many plans and strategies articulating ‘what to do’. These include, for example, the National Agenda (2005), the National Education Strategy (2006), the National Employment Strategy (2012), the Privatization Committee report (2013), the Higher Education Strategy (2013), the Public ‘Sector Development Strategy and Government Executive, Programs (2014-2016) and'the National Integrity Commission outputs (2013). These initiatives and many others ave accurately diagnosed Jordan’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, and made many sound recommendations. Nonetheless, the central challenge we have faced over the past ten years has been implementation: how to stay on course with agreed plans and strategies and complete all required tasks and activities at a high standard of excellence, on time and within budget. ere wATe Figure 26: Expected Public Debt to GDP Ratio according to the Targeted Scenario Expected Public Debt to GDP Ratio According to the Targeted Scenario s e e s e a e & Pub lie D ebt t o G DP R ati o 204 2015 —«016.=«207=«aNG_=S=«I=«200« HOON With regard to the structural composition of GDP, the cont n of the indust sector in GDP is expected to increase to 27.4%, compared to the current contribution of 22.4%.

Figure 27: Structural Composition of Current and Expected GDP according to the Targeted Scenario Structural Composition of GDP 2013 Structural Composition of GDP 2025 ae ose Indotia Sector Sana aa Gonsrestion Pee TAN Where to Focus our National Efforts — Priority Markets and Sectors Jordan is a small open economy with population growth rate much higher than the global average. Therefore, due to the small size of our local economy, it cult to deliver high-quality sustainable growth and create the number and quality of jobs needed to employ Jordanians over the next decade and beyond. Accordingly, Jordan’s economy must be export-oriented, to be able to compete and innovate in order to attract investments into Jordan to serve markets throughout our region and produce high-quality goods and services. This is a basic requirement to drive growth which will in turn create jobs and higher household incomes for Jordanian families. Like other small economies, configuring our economic system for export success in this way is a big challenge. Over the past decade the Kingdom's overall export performance has been disappointing, growing at just 1.7% per year between 2004 and 2013 (Jordan Department of Statistics, 2013). Export growth has trailed overail GDP growth, and the current account balance has widened substantially, although in large part this is a result of a forced increase in energy imports due to regional instability. With limited natural and financial resources, our key asset is the skill and ingenuity of the Jordanian people. Ultimately, the private sector must be the central engine to achieve economic activity at home and encourage exports. Our business leaders and entrepreneurs should make decisions about what products we can manufacture at home for export purposes and the expertise we can sell to others as services, such as IT solutions, tourism, healthcare and education. The ultimate test for our businesses. ~ and our economy ~ is why customers overseas will buy from Jordan as opposed to somewhere else. For example: + Why will hospitals in GCC countries buy pharmaceutical products from Jordan instead of from India? + Why will some countries continue to import phosphate from Jordan instead of from another phosphate producing country? + Why will European and Asian tourists choose to visit Jordan instead of somewhere else in the region of comparable natural and historical interest? + Why will students from around the Arab and Muslim world choose to come to Jordan for higher education studies instead of somewhere else in the region or beyond? The government has a vital role to play in creating the enabling environment for our private sector to grow and compete successfully on the regional and global stage, and developing a sound fiscal and monetary policy as a pre-condition for investment. Rules, regulations and instructions must be clear, predictable and efficient so as not to impose undue cost and uncertainty on business decisions. Governments have a powerful ‘toolbox’ for supporting economic and social development. They can create or change laws and regulations, impose fines, allocate land, promote companies abroad through embassies and trade delegations and take many other actions. Nevertheless, \"our\"’system”of \"Government\" will”always have\"limited\"financial\"resources.” As such, it needs to make choices about how to deploy its resources in order to best support the growth of the economy. With the objective of building a more competitive export-oriented economy in mind, it is vital for the economic development strategy of the country to be clear about two key drivers for export success: + Which countries should be, in the long term, our largest and most important priority markets for Jordanian exports? + What goods and services are we well-placed to competitively develop in Jordan, given our existing capabilities and resources, and successfully and sustainably export them to those priority markets? 2.1 Priority Export Markets ‘Small, open and export-oriented economies are typically most successful when they become integral to the trade and investment flows of their surrounding region. MENA economies, including Jordan, are not nearly as integrated into their regional economy as are those in Asia and Europe. Intra-regional trade flows in MENA are extremely low in global terms: 11% compared to 5% in Asia and 74% in the EU. While the current conflict in the region will continue to constrain the growth of intra-regional trade and investment, Jordan must look beyond the immediate regional crisis. The fact that intra-regional trade is so low across the MENA region represents a tremendous opportunity for Jordan. The following figure shows the regional market of interest to Jordan, which represents USS 3.8 trillion market comprising 380 million consumers. SET PNG Figure 28: Jordan’s Regional Market Jordan’s Regional Market — USD 3.8 Trillion and 380 Million Consumers Source: World Bank Given its geographic location at the intersection between the Levant and the GCC, Jordan has the potential to become a hub for investment into the Levant and upper Gulf. Within this total regional market, there are four distinct opportunities for Jordan: * First, the stable GCC economies. + Second, the economies of the Palestinian Territories, + Third, the larger but less stable markets of Iraq, Syria, Egypt and Libya. + Fourth, the large ‘over the horizon’ markets or Turkey and Iran. Jordan can play this regional hub role if we can create a business environment that is significantly superior to our near neighbors, and if our political stability remains a real and differentiated advantage as it is today. As highlighted in the figure below, Jordan has already also established an edge as an export hub to the large adjacent markets of Iraq and Syria based on cost and time to market. This must be further improved and Jordan's commercial, transport and logistics capabilities - the port in Aqaba, the new Abdali business district, the new Queen Alia International Airport and Jordan's road networks into adjacent markets — need to be fully leveraged. wu wae Figure 29: Export Competitiveness Export Competitiveness Cos to export 2014, in USD per container “Tine o export 2014 in days Selected Regional & Peer Countries Selected Regional & Peer Countries Snzaore dal Source: World Bank, Ease of Doing Business 2014 2.2 Priority Clusters to Drive Growth and Create Jobs Over the past two decades Jordan has established several significant industries in the economy which anchor private-sector economic activity. As the Kingdom looks ahead to the next decade, the Government's role is to facilitate the consolidation and expansion of our existing areas of strength, ‘such as mining and pharmaceuticals, and encourage the build-out of competitive ‘clusters’ of related and supporting industries to drive growth and job creation. This requires both careful analysis of the emerging needs and demands of our domestic economy and regional neighbors. It also requires creative thinking and some carefully chosen and well managed strategic bets. The criteria for deciding where to disproportionately invest Government policy attention and available resources should be clusters with the following characteristics: + Attractive demand characteristics in the domestic and regional economy. + Adjacent to, or building off, existing areas of strength. + Where Jordan can build and hold a sustainable position of competitive advantage over the medium to long term. + High potential for creating jobs for Jordanians. + Domestic and regional demand for products. iigh export potential. + Sustainable competitive advantage in the medium and long term to provide job opportunities. for Jordanians and contribute to bridging the development gap between governorates. This last criterion, job creation for Jordanians, is particularly important. Some of the economy's fastest growing industries, most notably construction, have exhibited strong demand characteristics, but have failed to generate meaningful and sustainable jobs for Jordanians. Forty-one percent of the workforce in the construction industry, for example, is comprised of foreign workers, many of them undocumented workers in the informal sector who are therefore not contributing to the nation’s tax base and not adequately protected with healthcare and other social safety nets. With these prioritization criteria in mind, the illustration below highlights the clusters that have been identified through research, analysis and consultation as high-potential priority clusters for the next decade. sits Figure 30: Existing, Emerging and High Potential Clusters for Growth Bia asain 2.3 Building on Existing Strengths 2.3.1 Construction and Engineering Cluster Jordan’s rapid economic development and economic openness has led to a significant influx of capital into the construction sector, which has benefited from an efficient and well-capitalized banking sector and very high amount of building and construction activity in recent years. There is an opportunity to grow and expand this cluster as Jordan becomes a regional hub for events and logistics, thus driving further commercial business activity, which requires more real estate assets and services. Building and construction now accounts for 10% of GDP and it is one of the fastest growing sectors in Jordan, Despite a significant slowdown during 2011-2013, the number of construction permits issued in Jordan has almost doubled in 2014, This cluster is also a major employer, employing roughly 85,000 Jordanians, although it is estimated that 60.000 jobs are held by nonJordanians. This represents a ‘major opportunity to employ more Jordanians if perceptions of the jobs in this cluster can be changed and greater vocational training provided to prepare Jordanians for the higher-skill segments of thi cluster, while following the recommendations of the National Employment Strategy. In order to develop and position Jordan as a regional hub for architectural and engineering services, this cluster must access engineering contracting work for construction projects in the Gulf region and Levant countries. The MENA market is estimated to have $2.5 trillion of construction permits, represents a huge ‘opportunity for Jordanian companies to increase exports, along with that of related clusters, such as transport and logistics. Within this cluster and given the regional security situation and the rapid growth in defense and military spending in the region, Jordan could also look to expand light equipment manufacturing in the defense sector. The capabilities already established at the King Abdullah Design and Development Bureau (KADDB) provide the nucleus of a potentially high-value cluster of related and supporting firms servicing the defense equipment market in the region, based on qualified engineering professionals in Jordan. Highly skilled vocational jobs can also be created downstream in the area of machinery and equipment manufacturing. sfu AN 2.3.2 Transport and Logistics Cluster Jordan's central location between the Levant and GCC has driven exceptional growth in the air transport and logistics sector in recent years. This sector is now one of Jordan's largest employers. A significant opportunity exists to continue to develop into a regional hub, leveraging the newly expanded Queen Alia International Airport, ongoing expansion of Aqaba port and Jordan’s extensive road networks into adjacent markets. Diplomatic and Humanitarian Logistics Services Jordan should look to leverage its international standing and soft power to establish the Kingdom as the preferred humanitarian logistics and diplomatic services hub for the region. Expansions of both Queen Alia International Airport and Aqaba Port will provide new excellent air and sea transport and logistics hubs for access by the global humanitarian community, donors and UN agencies. The quality of Jordan's road network ensures rapid time-to-market to reach affected communities both across the border to Syria or to many nearby refugee camps and settlements within Jordan. Further investment in warehousing and cold chain logistics could consolidate Jordan's capabilities to support humanitarian activities. Amman is already a starting point to several thousand diplomats, UN officials, aid workers and their families. This requires increasing investment in livability proposition for foreign expatriates particularly schools and family-friendly recreational activities - and developing Amman could as a preferred station for diplomats, UN officials and foreign aid workers. 2.3.3 Tourism and Events Cluster The tourism sector in Jordan has long been seen as having a number of unique and differentiated competitive advantages, not least the country’s many valuable tourist sites of high historical, religious and heritage importance. In spite of the huge potential of the Jordanian tourism sector, its contribution in the Jordanian economy is still imited due to the political instability ongoing across the region. Further progress also needs to be made in establishing the concept of balanced development of the sector and taking full advantage of tourism’s potential across the various governorates of the Kingdom. While regional instability has adversely affected foreign tourism volumes into Jordan, the number of Arab tourists, especially GCC citizens, has increased substantially due to the perceived insecurity of other Arab destinations. In addition, the specialized tourist services in Jordan that cater to the needs of this category of tourists, such as family, medical and wellness tourism, are significant given the reputation of the Kingdom's healthcare sector and the opportunity to integrate treatment with recuperative care and spa treatments, Medical and wellness tourism is forecast to triple between 2014 and 2017. Tourism currently provides only around 50,000 Jordanian jobs, representing 6% of the total ‘employment in the various economic sectors. There is a big opportunity to improve the ability of the tourism sector to increase the employment rate to global averages, estimated at about 18% given its ability to create more job opportunities. This increase should include all the Kingdom's governorates. In this context, it is necessary to take measures that would increase job-generating tourism investments, develop the education and training system in various tourist areas and replace foreign labor with Jordanian tabor as much as possible. In order to develop Jordan's tourism sector, the efforts that are being made by the concerned authorities, particularly the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, should be continued, by developing the various tourism subsectors in Jordan, such as the religious tourism, continuing to creating new tourist routes and developing those already existing in various governorates of the Kingdom and offering various tourist services in these areas. Atthe intersection of Jordan's attractiveness as a tourist destination and its potential positioning as a regional diplomatic and humanitarian hub sits conferences and events. The ongoing expansion of Jordan's 5-star hotel market and unique world-class facilities such as the King Hussein Conference Centre at the Dead Sea mean that the basic MICE infrastructure is already in place. Jordan is already host to World Economic Forums and major international industry conferences but could win a greater share of the regional MICE market. 2.3.4 Healthcare Cluster The healthcare sector in Jordan has excellent reputation both regionally and globally. It exploits the abundance of highly qualified doctors and nurses and high investment in healthcare infrastructure. It accounts for 5% of Jordan’s GDP and has achieved an international reputation. A number of factors in the short to medium term will continue to drive growth in the industry. These include the high levels of domestic healthcare spending (7.6% of GDP), high levels of insurance cover for the Jordanian population, the large number of Syrian refugees and the established reputation of Jordan as a destination-of-choice for medical treatment. ‘The sector produces a significant amount of jobs, estimated at 55,000, which are also generally high-skilled Jobs. Job growth has been slow, but it is expected to increase in line with an expanded wellness tourism industry. Medical and wellness tourism is a particularly attractive opportunity for Jordan given its unique\" combination of high-quality medical facilities and unique wellness assets such as the Dead Sea. wt 2.3.5 Life Sciences Cluster Jordan's internationally competitive pharmaceuticals manufacturing industry is one of Jordan's most established and fastest-growing industries, growing at 25% per year in recent years. It constitutes. Jordan's third-largest export product group after fertilizers and apparel. The MENA market for pharmaceuticals is estimated at $ 8 billion per year with Jordan's industries currently capturing only around 6% of that market. This suggests significant room for expansion of Jordanian exports across. the region. Employment in this industry remains low (about 8.000 jobs), as it is a capital- intensive activity, however, this figure is growing at 10% per year and many firms said they plan to expand their operations in Jordan. The combination of a globally competitive pharmaceuticals industry and excellent medical faci provides a strong foundation upon which to build-out a broader life sciences cluster, including clinical trial services, biotechnology research and product development. Jordan has one of the highest rates of physicians per capita in the world. Having clinical trial centres is an essential step for pharmaceutical innovation, which could contribute to diversifying local pharmaceutical industry beyond drug manufacturing 2.3.6 Digital and business services cluster The availability of skilled workers, developed infrastructure and the strategic location of Jordan have made ICT and Business Services a core sector in Jordan. The telecommunications market in Jordan is. mature, with a mobile penetration rate of 147% in proportion to the population, and the sector is filled with innovative software developers, service providers and start-ups. The ICT sector needs to be highly export oriented because domestic demand will remain modest due to the predominance of SMEs who are largely unable to absorb high value added ICT products or related business services. The critical challenge for the sector is helping Jordanian ICT companies in accessing regional export opportunities. The demand for ICT services in MENA is expected to reach $120 billion over the next two years. This sector provides, directly or indirectly, a significant number of job opportunities for Jordanians {about 80,000 jobs in 2013). Direct job opportunities were about 16,000 in 2013. However, employment in the sector has contracted recently, shrinking by about 2.5% annually between 2007 and 2013, due to the export of talent and expertise that has taken place, particularly to GCC countries, in addition to the forced reduction of employees by companies due to technological developments in the sector. As the size of the middle class in the GCC grows, spending on consumer goods and tourism has expanded substantially, which has driven associated demand for payment processing, customer service support and back-office operations support. Jordan is potentially uniquely placed in the region to provide these services, given its current comparative advantage of bilingual (Arabic-English) well-educated youth, who are well suited to serving the countries of the region. These Business Process. Outsourcing (BPO) operations are potentially also well suited for young, skilled Jordanian women, and could thereby contribute to increasing female participation in the workforce in Jordan. 2.3.7 Educational Services Cluster Jordan has traditionally had a very high-performing higher education sector and a strong reputation across much of the Arab World. In addition, Jordan’s climate and political stability make it uniquely attractive place for Arab youth to live in and study. Nevertheless, the quality of higher education ‘outcomes has flattened in recent years. No Jordan-based university is currently ranked in the top 500 universities worldwide, while the GCC countries are investing heavily in building a developed tertiary education sector through partnerships with world-renowned education institutions. This sector has significant potential to become an economic growth driver with very good job creation characteristics, but Jordan will need to focus on raising the quality of its educational institutions through demanding standards of excellence, new investment and public private partnerships with leading international institutions. Despite the low enrollment of Jordanians in vocational training, this sector is set for significant growth given the unemployment rate and youth unemployment problems across the region. Given its existing higher education infrastructure and transport connections, there is no reason why Jordan could not become a vocational training hub and content development centre-of-excellence for the Arab World. Bg WAN 2.3.8 Financial Services Cluster The financial sector in Jordan is stable and efficient thanks to the continuous improvement in the performance of its institutions and the quality and comprehensiveness of its services, which indicates the financial depth of this sector in comparison with countries in the region. At the end of 2013, the contribution of the financial and insurance services sector in GDP was about 11.5%, and the ratio of licensed bank assets to GDP was nearly 180%. This is an indication of the comprehensiveness of banking services and the important role of banks in the development of other economic sectors. Nevertheless, the utilization of these services is still modest and needs to be expanded. Furthermore, ancial and banking products need to be diversified to meet the needs of institutions and individuals and stay in line with developments in more advanced financial services markets. The financial services sector has always been one of the vital sectors of the national economy. Therefore, there is a need to intensify efforts aimed at further expanding its activities by creating the infrastructure necessary to facilitate broader and better access for all Jordanians to financial services, especially in remote areas, and improve access to finance, particularly for micro, small and medium. enterprises that will play an active and vital role in the inclusive and sustainable development of Jordan. In this area, the new programs (Jordan Loan Guarantee Corporation) and the establishment of Credit Information Company will have an important role in speeding up credit grant decisions, improving access to loans for productive sectors, in particular SMEs and reducing credit risk. Moreover, spreading financial and banking awareness and the development of payment and settlement systems will help expand financial services and enhance customer protection. In addition, expanding the scope of work of the Deposit Insurance Corporation to include Islamic banks and activating its role in the banking protection network will have an active role in deepening confidence in the banking system and stimulating the financial services in the market. The existence of a developed financial market helps promote and encourage local investment, develop financial services, raise the efficiency of the investment process and increase the effectiveness of the performance of saving and investment funds. Strengthening and expanding the umbrella of the social protection network and raising insurance awareness about Social Security will have a positive impact on promoting investment activity in the financial services sector and providing insurance services for many categories of the society. Furthermore, improving the efficiency of the insurance sector, diversifying its products and publicizing the benefits of investment in this sector will contribute in expanding its activities from the local market to the regional markets and positioning Jordan as a regional insurance hub, especially in light of the growing unrest in the region. 2.4 The Importance of Agility: Openness to New Opportunities and Trends Given the pace of technological change, the rapid changes in global financial markets and the uncertainty of the regional security outlook, new risks and opportunities will emerge which will inform whether these clusters remain the right ones to focus government policy attention and incentives on or whether adjustments are required. Jordanian businesses and entrepreneurs are best placed to spot risks and opportunities in the global market, Regular dialogue between the public and private sector will ensure that national policy settings towards sector and cluster development can adjust in line with changing market dynamics. 2.4.1 How to Create Inclusive Growth and Achieve Prosperity Although we have made significant progress over the past decade, significant challenges lie ahead as we seek to achieve greater and better quality prosperity for all Jordanians. What is clear from the trajectory of our development over the past decade is that recent prosperity gains have not been based ‘on improvements in competitiveness. This is not a sound footing upon which to strive to achieve inclusive and sustainable growth. At the heart of a new development model must be a candid admission that simply di doing things. 1g more of the same will not achieve our as| tions. We need to embrace new ways of that paves the way for a new start, based on first determining the \\les for collective action - the consensus basis upon which all Jordanians agree to move forward collectively to achieve our shared goals and aspirations we have as a nation. There are seven core principles embedded in Jordan 2025. Together, these principles should serve all of us -\" as\" citizens,\" public” officials,\" private” sector\" employees, \"civil\"society\"leaders\"~ as our guiding star for our economic and social development journey over the next decade and beyond, DES STAN Figure 31: Jordan’s Principles for Collective Action for 2025 Jordan 2025 Principles for Collective Action Law Abiding Institutionalized 7, Meritocratio. siicnamZe OS WAG exes tasters Participatory 2.4.1.1 Rule of Law: From Avoidance to Adherence The importance of the rule of law to all Jordanians citizens was highlighted earlier. Rule of faw in an institutionalized and consistent manner is critical for citizens and investors to have confidence that disputes will be resolved through a fair and efficient process and contracts will be enforced as agreed. Trust is difficult to secure and is easily lost. In the absence of trust in the rule of law and the fairness of regulations that are supposed to regulate the relationship between society members, we end up in a vicious cycle of low trust as illustrated below. When trust in the law is low and compliance is weak, the government typically responses by introducing new and tougher regulations to try to force better compliance. However, this often leads to further constraining citizens and businesses. At the core of our national development challenge is transforming from a society whose confidence in the rule of low is relatively low towards a society with a high level of trust and confidence among citizens that the law will be applied equally and without bias. Jordan 2025 identifies a number of specific initiatives and actions aimed at building a higher-trust society as the basis for improving confidence and belief in the rule of law. Based on the recommendations of the National Integrity System, these initiatives include: + Improving the transparency and accessibility of government information — so that citizens can be better informed about what government is doing and how taxpayer money is. being spent on their behalf. + Institutionalizing public consultation mechanisms - to give citizens the chance to have their voice heard on major policy issues. + Investing in the improvement of the capabilities of regulatory agencies to promote law enforcement- to ensure that the government has the tools it needs to enforce the law properly and not sporadically or indiscriminately. + Improving the communication of government decisions and regulatory changes ~to enable citizens and businesses to understand the changes and prepare themselves to adapt to new developments.” The outputs, recommendations and executive programs of the Integrity Committee are an appropriate roadmap to enhance confidence in the rule of law and seek to achieve the desired social justice. wu Figure 32: Social Trust and the Rule of Law Social Trust and the Rule of Law as the Basis for Governance Sree eat HIGH Compliance Ses ee Vicious Cycle 2.4.1.2 Meritocracy —- From Wasta and Favoritism to Equal Opportunity In both the private and public sector, Jordanians continue to perceive that wasta is the critical success factor, both in terms of obtaining employment and securing preferential treatment by government entities. When asked, “What are the key deciding factors in obtaining a job in the public and private sectors,?,” 21% of Jordan youth responded that “wasta” is the most important factor, while another 50% of respondents answered that “wealth” or “social relations”. Just 26% responded that “personal merit” was the most important factor in securing a job. A system that does not reward personal merit will not incentivize our youth to put in the effort and determination required to excel in their studies as the next generation of entrepreneurs and employees in our workforce. Opportunities to access jobs and to move up the career ladder must be equalized in order to change this incentive structure. Transforming the incentive structure will require a change in deeply engrained attitudes and beliefs, and will therefore take time. However, many of the systems and structure of public administration have come to create an ‘un-level playing field’. For example, the tertiary education system has also become an un-evel playing field because a significant percentage of university positions are assigned to sons and daughters of particular types of employees in the public sector. As a result, students who may have worked harder and earned better grades are denied a position in their preferred course. The same thing applies to the labor market in the public and private sectors. Jordan 2025 includes a number of initiatives designed to help address important social and economic development priorities in a way that also ‘levels the playing field’. These initiatives include: + Establishing a unified and universal national health insurance system that is not linked to employment but available to all Jordanians. This will not only enhance the healthcare coverage provided to all Jordanians but also neutralize one of the areas of perceived difference between the merits of public sector over private sector employment. + Reforming the university and vocational training admissions process, so that entry into university is based fundamentally on merit and that young students in need of financial assistance are still supported but through alternate mechanisms linked to their successful graduation from higher education rather than their preferential entry into a i or vocational college. * Linking public sector pay rises and promotions to good performance assessments and successful completion of minimum, mandatory and certified training requirements, so that hardworking and competent civil servants can be confident that their efforts dedication will be rewarded. * Phasing out tax exemptions and concessions, to ensure that our businesses are able to compete on fair and equal terms within their industry and able to calculate the true cost. wire TAN 2.4.1.3 Participatory - From Culture of Entitlement to Active Citizenship The government in Jordan has historically taken a very expansive role in caring for citizens, primarily by trying to mitigate external impacts on the cost of living for households. This has typically taken the form of management of supply of critical goods and subsidies to cushion the impact of unexpected price increases. However, the nation’s finances can no longer support government policy setting focused on controlling the ‘cost’ side of the household ledger. Instead, government policy must shift emphasis to focus on enabling all Jordanians to increase the income side of the household ledger, through employment and entrepreneurship. In other words, the government must increasingly focus on policies — in education and labour markets in particular — that ensure all Jordanians are equipped with valuable skills and a mindset for success to help them enter the workforce and by ensuring that the business environment and labour markets are as competitive and transparent as possible. This shift in policy, from trying to control and contain the cost of living to enabling the economic rights and income-earning potential of citizens, through education and training investments, is one of the most fundamental requirements for the Kingdom's future. It is therefore at the heart of this Jordan 2025 plan. Macroeconomic model conducted as part of the development of Jordan 2025 clearly highlighted that the biggest driver of improvements in national wealth and household prosperity is boosting participation in the formal economy by Jordanians men and women. In line with the principle of participation and consistent with the principle of meritocracy, Jordan 2025 reiterates the need for the ongoing and full implementation of the National Employment Strategy and other measures designed to accelerate as fast as possible job creation and workforce participation. This is a formidable challenge given that Jordan currently has one of the lowest workforce participation rates in the world and the regional security context is currently constraining the ability of the economy to grow through exports and investment. But it must remain our central focus. The specific initiatives in Jordan 2025 aimed at boosting participation include:” jignificant expansion of vocational training - including active measures to channel more young Jordanians into vocational rather than academic higher education. It is proposed to achieve this scaling-up of the vocational training. sector through Public Private Partnerships (PPP) with best-in-class international providers of vocational training linked to the priority economic clusters that have been identified. An approach of embracing PPPs will mean that Jordan not only benefit from investment in new and improved facilities, but also world-class content through teacher training methods and curricula, as well as the opportunity to certify Jordanian vocational graduates with internationally recognized qualifications. + Deeper and more transparent job vacancy market- so that young Jordanians have easy and transparent access to job vacancies rather than relying on friends and family networks to find opportunities. + Expansion of career counseling services at universities, schools and labour departments — to help raise the awareness of school and university age Jordanians about different career paths and ‘employment opportunities in the workforce. * Continuation of career fairs and recruiting events - organized by, and linked closely to, the priority clusters for development identified earlier. * Institutionalization of partnership with the sector’s representative institutions to undertake their responsibilities of reducing employments by establishing units to perform these tasks. 2.4.1.4 Excellence — From locally accepted quality levels to global best practice The strongest lever for driving the ambition and performance of a nation is to set high and demanding standards of excellence. Standards of excellence are already a part of everyday life. + As citizens, we expect that the cars we purchase and drive have passed rigorous safety standards before they can be sold. + We expect restaurants and cafes to abide by hygiene standards and protocols so that we do not get sick. + We would not fly overseas if we were not confident that the aircraft had been maintained to the highest standards of safety and that the pilots have met or exceeded their required number of hours to maintain their pilots’ licenses. There are however many aspects in our economic system and daily social life in which standards of excellence either do not exist, are not rigorous enough or exist but are not enforced. We should embrace higher standards of excellence and strive. Se AG to meet or exceed those standards of excellence through training, and when necessary, through enforcement It is possible to identify and adopt international best-practice standards in most aspects of daily life and our economic system. Adopting international standards not only saves time and cost, but also speaks to our ambition and aspirations as a society and as a country. There is no doubt that trying to achieve those standards will be difficult and, in some cases, take many years, but our economy and society will become stronger and more resilient even as we move towards achieving international best practice. Many companies and government institutions advertise having won excellence certifications as a mark of their quality and excellence. Jordan had only 39 ISO registered companies in 2013, versus 1,119 in the UAE and 7,186 in Hungary. These 39 companies represent just 0.03% of all firms in Jordan. In addition, the National Export Strategy has concluded that most small and medium-sized enterprises are unable to benefit from bilateral trade agreements because their standards are not sufficient to access major European and MENA markets, despite the lack of trade barriers working to our advantage. Specific initiatives in Jordan 2025 to pursue excellence include: * Provide tax credits for companies that successfully achieve international certification for their company or their products and services. This will help to offset the cost of training and compliance that companies incur in applying for certification. Tax credits will only be granted upon documented evidence of successful certification and for a specific period. + Extensive use Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) across infrastructure, vocational training and selected social service provision areas to provide not just finance to support our development, but more importantly to import with them international best practice standards, including in the form of training curricula and certification processes to improve the skills of Jordanians workers for the future. + Mandate that a number of government entities secure internationally accredited certification to help strengthen public institutions. This will equire a dedicated program, linked to other initiatives in Jordan 2025, to upgrade facilities, systems and processes and staff training, + Strengthen the capacities of the Ministry of Public Sector Development/ Institute of Public Administration to help government institutions achieve international standards. + Strengthen the capacities the King Abdullah Center for Excellence (KACE) as the nation’s principal advocate and independent evaluator of standards of excellence achievement across the public and private sectors. Transparency is a vital component, indeed a pre-requisite, for excellence. Transparency is also the best mechanism for boosting accountability, generating confidence at all levels and making ambitious commitments that require active and hard work to achieve. Jordan 2025 includes a number of important transparency ini ives, including: * The development of public reporting systems for the disclosure of outcomes achieved in certain public services areas such as education and health, thereby enabling citizens so see the results (outcomes) that are being achieved’ against pre-determined standards of excellence, whether learning outcomes for their children or treatment outcomes achieved by their local hospital. * Publication of annual reports of pul institutions, in a timely manner to help media and citizens evaluate the outputs produced and the outcomes achieved from the spending of public money by each government entity. + Publication of progress reports on the implementation of Jordan 2025 through over the next 10 years. 2.4.1.5 Competitive — From a small domestic economy to a dynamic regional hub Jordan is a small country with d resources and a young and still rapidly growing population. These limitations mean that Jordan must become a regional hub for trade and investment and a successful export nation. As outlined above, Jordan is located at the geographic heart of a regional economy worth over USS 3 trillion with 380 consumers. ‘To achieve this aspiration, in the short to medium term, Jordan 2025 includes the following recommendations: + Develop priority industry clusters as outlined earlier, including by updating the industrial pol cy, for 2015-2018. To increase the international competitiveness of the domestic clusters identified earlier so that they can become successful exporters of goods and services. * Develop the services sector by adopting and implementing the inclusive plan for the development of services sector and creating a national database for services trade. xr AN + Launch cluster coordination committees under the National Competitiveness and Innovation Council, to accelerate the process of cluster formation among related and supporting industries and to strengthen public-private collaboration in each priority cluster. These committees will be comprised of chambers of industry and commerce,” sectoral business associations and government representatives. Their tasks will include developing mechanisms necessary for cluster networking and directing vocational education and training institutions to support workforce development needs of their cluster. + Intensify initiatives aimed at enhancing and developing the competitiveness of SMEs, promoting the culture of entrepreneurship and innovation by adopting the National Strategy to Encourage Entrepreneurship and develop micro, small and medium enterprises 2015-2019 and accelerating reforms of the regulatory and legal environment, such as adopting the Law on Small and Medium Enterprises. Moreover, the ability of small and medium enterprises to access finance should be strengthened and their entrepreneurial and managerial skills should be improved. This must be accompanied by narrowing the gap between the outputs of vocational education and training and the heeds of the labor market in an integrated manner with both the National Education Strategy and the National Employment Strategy and the National Strategy for Science and Innovation. + Accelerate and deepen export promotion capabilities and support programs and position Jordan as a regional hub for trade and logistics by updating trade policy 2015-2018, and opening new markets for Jordanian products and services, raise their quality and maximize their benefits from free trade agreements signed by the Kingdom. In order to enable Jordan to take advantage from its, geographic location and competitive advantages to become a regional trade hub, trade facilitati measures should be developed and improved, including the infrastructure of transport, logistics and free zones, import procedures should be facilitated, examination measures should be standardized and storage capacity should be increased. + Increase efforts to improve business environment for Jordanian companies and create investment opportunities to be distributed to the Kingdom's governorates by developing a hational investment strategy for the next ten years, further improving the Kingdom's investment climate, developing legislation governing the business environment and investment to strengthen investors’ confidence and providing the needed infrastructure, including increasing the spread of industrial cities in all the Kingdom’s governorates. + Strengthen the National Competition Policy and consumer protection mechanisms by developing a supply and consumer protection policy for 2015-2018, activating the Competition Affairs Committee and developing consumer protection mechanisms to strengthen the government's role in monitoring and addressing anti-competitive practices that contribute to unjustified price rises, lower the quality of products and services provided to consumers and limit the ability of small and medium. enterprises to grow and compete on a level playing field. 2.4.1.6 Sustainable — From living beyond our means to achieving sustainable and inclusive growth As outlined earlier in Jordan 2025, sustainability is a critical challenge in a number of areas. First, we must achieve long-term fiscal sustainability, which means restoring a sound balance between government revenues and expenditures through a combination of tax and spending measures. Second, Jordan faces significant challenges maintaining a sustainable use of our limited natural resources, especially water and energy. There are also the issues of food security and the heavy reliance on imports, which make Jordan vulnerable to supply shocks and global price volatility beyond our control. ‘To address these sustainability challenges, Jordan 2025 recommends a number of initiatives: + Take urgent measures to improve tax administration and collection — including investments in expanding collection and enforcement capabilities. + Implement a set of medium and long-term measures aimed at making more ‘structural reforms to reduce costs and improve the effectiveness of the public sector. This includes restructuring human resources across the Civil Service, outsourcing non-core government activities to the private sector and reinvesting in the skills and capabilities of public servants, so that they can better use modern systems and tools of public administration to create long-term productivity and efficiency gains. + Use Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to secure the financing the technical expertise required to invest in infrastructure expansions - to boost supplies of energy and introduce new efficient technologies to optimize production and consumption, for example through smart grid technologies. + Ongoing investment in governorate development projects - through the Governorate Development Fund and other vehicles to ensure that local communities across the Kingdom have a viable and sustainable local economy capable of providing local jobs for local communities. BG 2.4.1.7 Institutionalized — From personalized to institutionalized decision making and management The lack of management skills is one of the most important determinants in the management of public institutions; efforts to boost performance are focused on technical rather than administrative aspects. The lack of general management skill must be addressed by making effort on a large scale in the coming years that includes both public and private sectors and focus on enhancing both administrative and technical skills. The capacity of senior and middle managers should be examined and they should be “rehabilitated” with new and modern administrative practices, such as time management and people management. Our national deficit of general management skill must be addressed in a systematic, large-scale and national effort over the coming years and encompass both the private and public sectors. Current senior and middle managers need to be exposed to, and ‘retooled’ with, new, modern management practices — from time management to people management skills. Furthermore, training in these management techniques and tools need to begin at the high school and tertiary education level so that we begin to shape the management skills of the next generation immediately. It should be noted here that it is necessary to build on, review and develop the system of performance evaluation of incumbents of top positions. Performance evaluation instructions and forms have recently been updated. With this challenge in mind and based on the Public Sector Reform Plan of 2013 and Jordan 2025 proposes several initiatives to deepen the institutionalization of management practice across Government and the economy and society more generally, including: + Asignificant upgrading of the Institute of Public Administration — to reposition it as a specialist, high-quality provider of management training for the public sector. This should be done through a PPP arrangement with a leading international civil service training school or college, so that international best practices are brought immediately to Jordan through the Institute. Once operational, the Institute could expand its service offerings on a commercial basis to the private sector and position itself as a regional centre of excellence by offering its programs to the civil services of neighboring countries. + Establishing a Jordanian Institute of Company Directors - to serve as an association of internationally trained and accredited Jordanian company directors. This should be a private sector led and operated initiative, potentially in partnership with a well-established international partner, and could be used in conjunction with the Institute of Public Administration to train senior government officials in preparation for appointment to the boards of government agencies and government related business enterprises. + Making the necessary adjustments to institutionalize the decision making process at the centre of government. ‘The Public Sector Reform Plan 2013 and its executive detai is the framework on which Jordan 202 based. In summary, the seven principles outlined here are embedded throughout the recommendations of Jordan 2025, Through the implementation of the initiatives recommended in Jordan 2025 our society and economy will begin to make the transitions outlined below, which will underpin the evolution of a new economic and social development model for the Kingdom. Figure 33: Parameters for Transforming the Development Model Parameters for Transforming the Development Model Jordan Today ae Jordan 2025 La Abin See Paricipatory Becles Compete Sustainable nes rie Sustainable nnd lnchive growth Ss Tnsttutionalized een su TANe 2.5 Required Resources for National Development In order to achieve our desired goals of stability and prosperity, we must work together based on the principles outlined above to use our available resources and capabilities as wisely and sustainably as possible, We must do so at a time when we face tremendous constraints given the pressure on the Kingdom's finances and the impact of regional instability on our economy. 2.5.1 Water, Land and Natural Resources Jordanians have become accustomed to creating opportunities from limited natural resources It is, vital that we manage our available stock of arable land by ensuring careful and long-sighted land use allocation and planning. Due to the low per capita share of available water sources, new sources should be found by desalinating (the Carrier of Bahrain), developing other non-traditional sources, assuring the sustainability of groundwater and maximizing the use of surface water by building dams (water harvesting). Raising the sector's financial efficiency includes reducing cost by improving energy efficiency and renewable energy use, and reducing theft and leaks. It is also necessary to begin implementing a structural reform program for the sector that includes restructuring in the water tariff to reflect the true value of the service has and this will have important implications for the agricultural and industrial sectors. Moreover, efforts to control and regulate the demand for water through a range of price and non-price mechanisms and incentives should be continued. The sanitation and purification of domestic and industrial wastewater and infrastructure for irrigation should be expanded. Another priority is to restructure water transport and distribution networks to ensure services are provided equally to all governorates. This includes the development of Wadi Araba from a holistic perspective. 2.5.2 Citizens As outlined earlier, our greatest asset is our people. Not surprisingly, our people have been placed at the centre of Jordan 2025 with a primary focus on ways and means to enhance employability, increase workforce participation of all of citizens and ensure that labour markets are flexible and efficient so that everyone able and seeking employment has an opportunity to work . In this context, the problem of unemployment in governorates should be addressed, and attention should be given to the issue of unemployment differences between the centers of governorates and their districts and between men and women generally. Making real progress to reduce disparities is one of the central outcomes that Jordan 2025 seeks to achieve over the next decade. A renewed and sustained national effort - as called for by the National Employment Strategy and involving both public and private sectors - needs to be made to dramatically expand vocational training and address cultural stereotypes and biases that encourage too many young Jordanians to pursue academic university study over vocational training. Part of the solution must be to expand the number of vocational training programs on offer to both men and women and transform the quality of the learning experience in this course. The private sector also needs to be closely involved in advising ‘on the design of skills-based training programs that will best meet the needs of the economy. Addressing the training needs of young Jordanians by itself will not be sufficient. The economy also needs to be growing to facilitate the creation of new jobs. Better harnessing the full potential of the Jordanian people therefore requires an integrated set of reforms: + First, our private sector needs to be the primary engine for economic activity and growth to create new job opportunities. + Second, reforming the education system needs to be a national priority to better prepare young Jordanians to join the labour market, in particular the vocational and medium-skilled opportunities that are already available. + Third, attitudes and mindsets - among our youth and their parents — need to change with respect to long-held views about what constitutes as ‘honorable’ job for a Jordanian. We cannot build Jordan on the back of engineers and doctors alone. Jordanians must see other vocations as equally valuable jobs in our economy and society. + Fourth, the relative price of Jordanian and foreign labour needs to change so that there is a stronger incentive for business to hire Jordanians over non- Jordanians. Finally, those already working in the informal sector must be motivated to move to the formal ‘economy, where they will be properly covered by social security and health insurance and contributing to the betterment of the country as a whole by paying tax. . This is the essential act of citizenship back to one’s own country but may requires offering appropriate incentives to encourage this move. wre TAN 2.5.3 Infrastructure ‘Over the past two decades, Jordan has made significant improvement in upgrading the scope and quality of national infrastructure networks including the national road network, electricity and water grids and the national telecommunications and IT network. The Kingdom now has well-developed usiness infrastructure. The new Queen Alia International Airport terminal is one of the newest in the world and Aqaba port's capabilities are being expanded. The Kingdoms ICT and transport networks have been strengthened through recent investments such as the Amman Airport Road expansion; and the national energy and water grids have also been expanded with completion of major projects such as the Disi water pipeline and the new 250MW Manakheer power plant opened in October 2014. These new infrastructure investments are vital to enhance the ability of the economy to deliver future growth. To meet financing needs, we should think about enabling the use of innovative financing methods including through laws and regulations such as the Investment Law and Public- Private Partnership Law. 2.5.4 Financial Resources Of all of the resources required to implement Jordan 2025 and move towards achieving our desired outcomes by 202, financial resources are the most constrained. Because we are not blessed with a large supply of a strategic commodity such as oil, we do not have the accumulated national wealth that many in our region rely on to fuel their national development aspirations. Instead, we have relied heavily on foreign development assistance which has traditionally accounted for 4-5% of annual GDP. While we have received short-term financial assistance from donors and our regional allies in the GCC, restoring the health of our national finances requires a determined focus on achieving long-term fiscal sustainability. To reduce debts and deficits, the government must continue to move forward with a number of reform measures aimed at cutting expenditures and raising government revenues. ‘The financial reform program, developed by the Ministry of Finance, with its planned executive program, already provides our foundation for the reforms ahead on the road back to fiscal sustainability. 2.5.5 Non-Government Financing for National Development Anumber of important non-government tools can be accessed over the coming decade to help finance ‘our economic and social development priorities. These tools should be used to finance both the ‘hard infrastructure’ of our economy, such as power stations and roads, and the ‘soft infrastructure’ such as skill improvement training programs and programs to deal with difficult-to-solve social issues, such as youth unemployment, road traffic accidents and fatalities. There are several important and emerging channels of non-government financing that should be explored over the coming decade that would take pressure off the Government's core budgs 1, Domestic and foreign direct investment. 2. Public Private Partnerships. 3. Islamic Finance instruments, including sukuk. 4. New models of social finance, including Social Impact Bonds. 5. Corporate Social Responsibility. 2.5.6 Domestic and Foreign Investment Through the national banking system and the Social Security Corporation, the savings of Jordanians can be deployed to assist in the funding of projects and programs of national significance, if proved to be financially feasible, with sufficient guarantees provided to contributing parties. Foreign investment plays a vital role in supporting the development of every economy around the world. There was $26 billion of foreign direct investment (FDI) capital stock in Jordan, according to 2012 data, representing more than 80% of GDP. Obviously, foreign investors have always been strategic partners for Jordan. We must recognize that we compete against other economies to win the interest and commitment of foreign investors. To succeed, we need to offer a regulatory environment that is more attractive and stable than their alternative investment options, low transaction costs and skilled hard-working people. The new investment law, which unified investment authorities, seeks to achieve this, and the practical application is the true translation of this trend. Investors naturally prefer investment destinations that offer a large domestic market as well as export opportunities. Given that Jordan cannot offer a large domestic market, we must outperform our competitors by a significant margin on the dimensions against which foreign investors make their investment decisions. Furthermore, if Jordan is to be a regional hub to a number of large markets - such as Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt -our transport connections to those markets and our national ICT and telecommunication infrastructure must be sophisticated compared to the rest of the world. wu WAN 2.5.7 Public-Private Partnerships Public-private partnerships have been used around the world for over three decades now. They have expanded from an initial focus on ‘hard infrastructure’, such as roads and power stations, to ‘soft infrastructure’ such as schools and hospitals. There are now well development models for structuring collaborative financing and project delivery arrangements between the government and the private sector, in order to appropriately share the risks and financial benefits. Structuring and overseeing PPP projects is complex and requires a combination of legal, financial, engineering and project management expertise. To be successful in negotiating PPP project arrangements with foreign investors, the government needs to invest wisely in the specialist, multi-disciplinary capabilities and be willing to hire external specialists to advise the government on the appropriate risk-teward sharing mechanisms. These capabilities are currently being developed at the Ministry of Finance, at the Partnership Unit established under the Public-Private Partnership Law. 2.5.8 Islamic Finance Islamic finance is widely accepted and rapidly growing segment of the global financial services sector. Global centers of excellence for Islamic Finance are now established. Such emerging centers also exist in Kuala Lumpur, Bahrain, Dubai and London. The year 2015 will see the first issuing of finance instruments to finance some financing needs of the government. 2.5.9 Social Finance In the United Kingdom and the United States, innovative and new financing mechanisms, knows as Social Impact Bonds (SIBs), are now being adopted to fund programs aimed at addressing difficult-to-solve social problems, such as infectious diseases and road safety challenges. Otherwise known as pay-for-performance contracts, these arrangements mean that the government only pays for a program if it is proven to deliver the desired results. The risk of failure is borne not by the government, as with traditional budgetary funding of social programs through Ministries, but by a group of third party investors who provide the initial capital and other funding required to launch the program. The government provides the appropriate environment and commits to pay if the program proves to be successful. In this way, SIBs help governments solve several problems at the same time. It only pays once certain performance outcomes have been achieved, typically several years into the future. Management and delivery of the services provided to the target audience is provided by a civil society organization not the government. If they work, the government will have made progress against difficult problems. If the new approaches do not work, the government will not have expended large sums of money. As the use and sophistication of SIBs grows internationally, Jordan will want to have the capacity to explore their application to the Kingdom's development challenges. 2.5.10 Corporate Social Responsibility Over the past decade Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs have expanded in Jordan and many of Jordan’s largest companies have CSR programs that provide vital sources of funding various activities. The Kingdom also has numerous philanthropic foundations, including numerous foundations and initiatives that support programs and initiatives for civil society development, education, social services and social entrepreneurship programs and initiatives to the poor. All participants engaged in these various funding avenues need to be active participants in helping to implement this vision. The government will need to put in place appropriate consultation and collaboration mechanisms to assess and verify the suitability of different funding models and approaches for the initiatives outlined in this vision. G6 & WAN 2.6 Creating the Enabling Environment Fundamental to Jordan's success in implementing a new economic and social development model (as proposed here) is clear alignment among the key stakeholders about the direction, magnitude and urgency of change required, For this vision to succeed, a number of critical conditions must be put in place in the short term in order to enable the full and effective implementation of the priorities initiatives outlined in this longer term to 2025. Those critical enabling conditions are: 4. A shared consensus across stakeholders ~ Executive and legislative branches, the civil society and the business community - around the basic requirements and principles for the new economic and social development model. 2.An agreement about the urgency with which reforms need to be implemented. 3, Effective and efficient decision making within the government and Parliament grounded in high-quality evidence-based policy analysis. 4, Continuous leadership and management development across the government sector. 5. Active citizenship and participation from the private sector and civil society organizations, including participation in debate and dialogue about major national issues and challenges and balanced analysis by the print in the interests of enabling well-informed public debate. 6. Effective and directed partnerships with donor and international financial institutions in order to channel available financial and technical assistance into the priority initiatives outlined in this vision. 7. Strategic partnership with the private sector, including foreign investors through Public Private Partnership (PPP) models that encourage long term commitment, the highest quality of standards and appropriate risk sharing between the government and investors. 8. Legislative stability and increased credibility and predictability of legislative amendments. Based on the “road map” outlined in this chapter, the next section of this vision recommends the priority initiatives that should be pursued by successive governments with the active support and participation of citizens, the private sector and the civil society sector. were TAN",

Today, the Jordanian economy faces a set of difficult challenges, resulting from successive crises as  well as international and regional conditions, namely continuous suspensions in Egyptian gas  supplies and the ramifications of the Syrian crisis, particularly the influx of Syrian refugees, as Jordan  currently hosts 1,300,000 of our brethren Syrians, which is depleting our limited resources and  creating enormous pressures on our infrastructure and national economy. This situation has led to an  increase in deficit and debt over the past few years.   The implications of these difficult economic conditions have left their mark on the standard of living  our citizens enjoy. Today, the number one priority and the foremost challenge our citizens face is to  improve their living conditions and to secure better jobs that provide them and their families with a  decent living and hope for a better future. These are concerns that | witnessed first-hand during my  ongoing field visits. Price hikes and financial pressures our citizens face today are the hard realities  we need to address. Accordingly, the state — in all its institutions ~ must provide socio-economic  solutions and programmes to alleviate these burdens.         Over the last few months, I have followed closely the government's performance, and the diligent and  well-appreciated efforts it has exerted, which resulted in passing the budget, implementing economic  reforms and enacting legislation in cooperation with Parliament.       In light of the recent challenges, we affirm our determination to continue developing our national  economy and chart our future direction in tandem with efforts to secure decent living standards and a  promising bright future for the men 10 and women of our beloved Jordan. Against this backdrop, it is  of the utmost urgency that the government devises an economic blueprint to guide our national  economy over the next ten years. This economic blueprint should have a comprehensive framework  targeting the following: enhancing financial and monetary policies and assuring their consistency;  improving economic competitiveness; enhancing values of high productivity and self-reliance to  realise sustainable and comprehensive development.       In this context, | emphasise that the success of devising this blueprint hinges on adopting a  participatory and consultative approach towards all stakeholders, namely governmental institutions,  Parliament, private sector, civil society organizations and local communities.   The blueprint should build on accumulated efforts and institutional studies, such as the “Privatization  Evaluation Committee,” “Governorates Development Strategy,” and “National Employment Strategy,”  in an effort to benefit from these strategies in devising future socio-economic policies, with specific  programmes and work plans that address short- and long-terms challenges.   The blueprint must also build on the government's policy statement and its program for the years  2013-2016, which have been presented to the 17th Lower House in its Extraordinary Session, on which  the government won a vote of confidence, in addition to other national economic and political reform  programmes. This shall provide a frame of reference for the current and successive governments in  achieving sustainable growth rates and enhancing economic reforms.   siou  WAN    It is important to emphasize here that the requested economic blueprint should be based on the   following principles:   4. Preserving macro-financial stability and developing financial policies; improving Jordan's  business environment; enhancing policies that promote innovation and sectoral  development; enhancing local governance and implementing decentralization.   2. Supporting engines of growth; limiting budget deficit; preserving financial and monetary  stability; enhancing competitiveness and investment attraction to generate more jobs for  Jordanians.   3. Strengthening programmes targeting poverty and unemployment alleviation as weil as  consumer protection and channelling subsidies to those who deserve it in order to enhance  Jordan’s social safety net in an effort to protect and expand the middle class.   4. Supporting productive and entrepreneurial projects as well as Small and Medium  Enterprises, through encouraging competition and preventing monopolies.       5. Elevating the quality of governmental services provided to citizens in various fields in a  manner that builds on public sector reform programmes; giving priority to health and  education sectors, in addition to training and employment programmes that meet labour  market requirements; and assuring the highest levels of equality and justice in providing  these services.           6. Ensuring a just distribution of developmental di  development programmes.   idends by giving priority to governorates’   7. Devising a comprehensive system to enhance food, water and energy security and its  diversification, in addition to expediting the execution of mega projects.   Your Excellency Prime Minister,   | shall emphasize here the importance of addressing this task with utmost attention and care to  achieve feasible working plans, based on a specific time-frame with clear priorities and adopting  successive action points, which are assessed in an institutional manner and are binding to  governments. | also stress the importance of upholding accountability in measuring progress and  achievement and a collective sense of shared responsibility as well as keenness to overcome  shortcomings in the future.   It is of equal importance, that these directives are handled with the utmost seriousness and avoid  laxity in execution, in order to enhance the credibility of the state and all its institutions in addressing  citizens’ concerns and assuring the decent standard of living they rightly deserve. Above all, we do not   h for this economic blueprint, upon which we have very high hopes, to be a mere document that  gets shelved away, but rather a productive endeavour, with tangible results and a clear time-frame.             We face numerous and difficult challenges, but our cherished Jordanian citizens deserve the best we  can provide. We are confident that Jordan, empowered by the will of its sons and daughters, will  overcome these challenges through team work, diligent efforts and follow-up, aiming to realize our  vision for the future of Jordan,   Praying to God Almighty to preserve Jordan's pride and prosperity through the hard work of all  Jordanians and to help us realize the aspirations of our beloved people.   Peace be upon you, God’s mercy and blessings,   Abdullah Il ibn Al Hussein   Amman, 28 Jumada Al-Awwal 1435 Hijri   wore 29 March 2014 Ae    The Government’s reply to His Majesty King Abdullah Il’s letter   In the name of God, the Most Merciful, the Compassionate   Your Majesty King Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein, Leader of the reform process and protector of  Jordan and its stability and prosperity,   Peace, God's mercy and blessings be upon you,   My Cabinet and I have received, with gratitude and honour, Your Majesty's letter directing the  government to draft a 10-year economic blueprint for Jordan. | would like to affirm to your Majesty that  putting forward full-fledged plans, aimed at enhancing the country’s financial and monetary policy and  guaranteeing their consistency, improving economic competitiveness, promoting the values of  productivity and self-reliance in order to achieve sustainable and inclusive development and ensure a  decent living and bright future for Jordanian men and women, has been a constant practice and a key  goal of this government.   ‘The Cabinet and | assure Your Majesty that we will work diligently to prepare this blueprint, adopting a  participatory approach, based on openness to all of the country’s social and economic stakeholders,  including government agencies, parliament, the private sector, civil society organizations and other  national entities. Through this approach, the blueprint will be the fruit of a collective national  endeavour, where all stakeholders have an active role to play, not only its drafting, but also in the  process of its implementation and follow-up. Further, in line with Your Majesty's directives, this effort  will result in drawing a roadmap for my government and the governments to follow. It will be based on  the challenges facing the national economy, particularly those faced by the sectors of energy, water,  transportation and infrastructure. In addition, the roadmap is expected to address the high rate of  unemployment, especially among youth, the low level of women's participation in the workforce,  discrepancies in the levels of development between governorates and the mounting public debt as  well as the growing state budget deficit. Added to that is the impact of the difficult regional situation,  particularly the Syrian refugee crisis, which poses a burden on Jordanian citizens and the national  ‘economy.       | would like also to emphasize that this undertaking will be built on sectoral and national efforts,  policies and strategies, such as the National Recruitment Strategy and National Anti-Poverty Strategy,  along with strategies tailored for vital sectors such as energy, agriculture, tourism, transportation and  others. The blueprint will also be built on the National Agenda, in a way that ensures coordination and  consistency between all these plans at the economic and social levels.   The blueprint will complement the government's action plan and programmes for the years 2013-2016,  which we presented to the 17th Parliament in its non-ordinary session. It will also be aligned with other  national fiscal and economic reform programmes. Based on Your Majesty's letter, the vision aims to  position Jordan as a regional hub of economic activities, capitalizing on the relative advantages of  certain economic sectors.        The task aims to achieve the following objectives:   + Boost economic growth, achieve fiscal stability, reduce financial waste, deliver support to  those who deserve it and reduce public debt to safe levels.   + Enhance the business and investment environment and raise its competitiveness to attract  local and foreign investment in the various economic sectors, enhance partnership between the  public and private sectors and revisit the role of the private sector in terms of its size and its  contribution to the development process.   * Develop economic sectors, encourage market creativity and hone the tools and means of  supporting priority and high-value added export-oriented sectors.   STO TAN    + Encourage small and medium-sized businesses, increase financial support for these enterprises,  provide them with a suitable environment to prosper as engines of economic growth and promote  their role as employers of young people, by encouraging the spirit of entrepreneurship and  innovation.   + Enhance the policies governing the labor market, focus on building a labor force through  vocational training, especially youth, so that they gradually replace foreign workers and  encourage women to join the labor market.   + Stimulate local and comprehensive development in communities, narrow developmental gaps  between governorates and apply decentralization to empower local communities and engage  them in the decision-making process related to the development of their areas.       + Increase women’s participation in labor market through spe       ic programs,   + Give necessary attention to people with special needs and work to fully integrate them in society.   Your Majesty,   As we prepare this blueprint for the future of the Jordanian economy, which will be completed before  the end of this year, we will identify the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders, during both the  drafting and implementation stages. The blueprint will be formulated by technical committees  represented by all concerned sectors. It will harness all available expertise, locally and internationally,  in order to produce an outcome that will be a national achievement for Jordan, in line with best  international practices.   The practical aspect of the blueprint will entail an executive program, extending to 2025, including  indicators to measure performance and progress. The Unit of Follow-up and Oversight of Government  Performance at the Prime Ministry will be activated to oversee all arrangements and proposals entailed  in the plan. Reports will be published regularly, making them accessible to the Jordanian public to  detect any failures in the process. This process is intended to increase the government's credibility  and people's confidence in it. Those who fail to deliver will be held accountable.         The challenges we face are numerous and formidable, but they motivate us to carry out the task in the  spirit of teamwork, turning difficulties facing the national economy into opportunities that lead to the  economic revival you envision, and allow us to serve our noble nation under your wise leadership.   May God keep you as the leader and precious asset of our homeland,  and preserve Jordan as a prosperous and proud country.       Peace, God’s mercy and blessings be upon you,   Te  AG    wy  TAN   Executive Summary   wu  WAN    Over the past decade, Jordan has seen considerable economic and social achievements; GDP per  capita has increased from JD (1512) in 2004 to about JD (3670) in 2014. Jordan has also invested  ignificant resources in infrastructure facilities serving the citizens, made remarkable human   development achievements, maintained stability and attracted foreign and domestic investment.           These achievements were accompanied by some challenges that are still unresolved, mainly the  development gap between governorates, high unemployment rates, especially among young people,  low female economic participation and the relative decline in certain competitiveness indicators.  However, the general situation in Jordan, the level of infrastructure and the institutional development  help Jordan to leap ahead and start addressing and overcoming challenges. His Majesty King  Abdullah Il has highlighted the most prominent challenges, the way to the future and the social and  economic model that we aspire in his letter to the government to develop this vision for the next  decade.   “Jordan 2025” charts a path for the future and determines the integrated economic and social  framework that will govern the economic and social policies based on providing opportunities for all.  Its basic principles include promoting the rule of law and equal opportunities, increasing participatory  policy making, achieving fiscal sustainability and strengthening institutions. To achieve this, it is  necessary to improve infrastructure, enhance education and health and strengthen the role of the  private sector and civil society institutions to contribute to the development process. Based on these  principles, the vision proposes a roadmap for the future that requires consensus among broad  segments of society on the roadmap and the roles of all concerned authorities and stakeholders, led  by the private sector, which should play a prominent role in achieving the desired objectives. The  government should also provide an enabling environment to achieve this. In addition, the success in  achieving the vision and implementing policies contained therein requires a commitment by citizens,  the government, the private sector and the civil society, reflecting the ideology of active citizenship  referred to in His Majesty's discussion papers.            Given the difficulty of predicting the future and the many changes that are ahead, \"Jordan 2025” is  based on identifying a set of goals that we aspire to, how they can be achieved through certain  procedures and policies that will be adopted on the sector level according to a flexible timetable that  takes into account the developments on the global and regional levels and how to adapt to those  changes. Therefore, the vision offers two scenarios depending on the progress achieved and the  degree of commitment to implement the agreed upon policies. The baseline scenario assumes  adopting some, and not all, of reform measures that are contained in the second section of this  document. Consequently, growth rates achieved depend on the progress achieved and the degree of  commitment to implement the proposed policies.           The targeted scenario assumes taking further measures that would achieve high growth rates; this  scenario includes a number of interventions in various sectors that would launch the development  process in many sectors in order to achieve high and sustainable growth rates, reduce unemployment  and poverty and increase economic participation, especially among young people and women. This  scenario assumes a balanced and consistent distribution of roles between public and private sectors,  a commitment to the implementation and institutionalization of the public- private partnership.       The most important goal that the vision seeks to achieve is improving the welfare of citizens and the  basic services provided to them, to create a balanced society where opportunities are available to all  and the gap between governorates is bridged. The vision puts Jordanian citizens in the heart of the  development process; success and failure are measured by the extent of the progress made at the  level of individuals, and therefore the welfare of the community. On the economic and social level, the  goal is to achieve self-reliance and financial stability based on financial sustainability, enhance the  productivity and competitiveness of the Jordanian economy, gradually eliminate all forms of  indiscriminate subsidies and target groups who really deserve the subsidy. This would further  strengthen the economy's resilience and reduce the impact of external shocks.           This document represents a long-term  national vision and strategy rather than  a detailed government action plan.  It includes more than 400 policies or  procedures that should be  implemented through a participatory  approach between the government,  business sector and civil society.  It is based on basic principles  supporting the development model  for the next decade, the compliance  with the law and the strengthening of  the institutionatization.            Jordan 2025 Principles for  Collective Action   Law Abiding   Instituionalized 7 = Meritocratic   ‘Sustainability De Su   WANG  compettive AS excetence   Participatory    The proposed development approach based on these principles clarifies the roles of all actors in the  community and requires determination and anticipation for the future. Achieving stability and reducing  dependence on foreign countries require necessary short-term sacrifices to achieve sustainability.       The vision shows that the initiatives contained therein should be implemented within a sequential and  transitional time frame, and since the 2015 budget has been passed in the year in which the financial  reform program ends under the agreement with the International Monetary Fund, there are a number  of high-impact and relatively low cost initiatives that should be started.   “Jordan 2025” vision requires all citizens, whether in the public or private sector, to adhere to the  implementation and the general principles, supported by faith in the rule of law and the importance of  setting high standards of excellence.   The other crucial element for success is the relentless determination to implement the reforms in order  to strengthen financial independence and self-reliance. Therefore, it is necessary to increase  productivity and competitiveness in the long term to achieve the desired objectives. This requires  commitment and effective implementation by setting measurable and easy to follow-up goals. To that  end, the Prime Minister’s Delivery Unit was re-established to follow up the most important initiatives  proposed and overcome the obstacles facing their implementation.       “Jordan 2025” vision is divided into two parts. The first part includes a number of chapters, the first of  which provides a summary of the economic and social reality, and covers issues related to the sectors  of health, education, employment and economic participation. This part indicates that Jordan has  achieved successes on some levels, although the performance of several comparable countries  indicates that there are certain challenges that need to be addressed immediately. For example, the  assessment of the health sector shows some aspects of development, but the rate of  non-communicable diseases in Jordan is considered very high.        The main challenges facing the education sector, which was, until recently, a success story, are the  growing pressure on the infrastructure and the capacity of the education sector as a result of population  Growth and the increased forced migrations, as well as the lack of financial allocations needed to  develop the educational system to keep pace with the rapid development of modern educational  systems in developed societies. Challenges also include the weak ability of the educational system to  produce quality outputs that respond to the requirements of the knowledge economy and the labor  market. The poor performance of a comprehensive system of quality that is associated with a   foring, evaluation and accountability system and an accreditation system for educational  institutions, in addition to the low enrollment rate in vocational and technical education and training.       The low employment rates are a source of concern, given their social and political implications.  The document highlights the main challenges facing the labor sector in Jordan, mainly the low  ‘economic participation, especially by women, the decline in the size of the labor force relative to the  working age population, high unemployment rates, especially among women, youths (age 15-24) and  university graduates as well as differences in the unemployment rates between governorates. The  challenges also include the increased flow of foreign workers into the kingdom who crowd out  Jordanian workers in certain professions and disciplines because of the great disparity in wages.         The document addresses resource management and security, particularly water, energy and food security.  The vision provides an analysis of resource security, especially in energy, water and food sectors and  presents a number of initiatives and policies on how to ensure the sustainability of these sectors that are  related to the rest of the sectors. The transport sector is also considered one of the vital sectors within the  infrastructure facilities that should be given priority in implementing the related initiatives.       This chapter also addresses the social aspects of poverty, unemployment and social protection. The  analysis discusses the progress that has been made on these levels and the urgent challenges that  require policies and procedures to mitigate the effects of poverty and unemployment in particular,  especially in the governorates where these rates are high.       The document analyzes these various sectoral challenges within the four pillars: citizens, the society,  the business sector and the government. The vision shows the challenges faced by citizens, especially  those related to education, health, employment and economic participation as well as how to increase  it, At the society level, the cohesion of the Jordanian society has protected it against many external  shocks. However, the development of societies and the nature of the current, or expected, challenges  they face require an approach that takes into account certain indicators; the poverty rate is still high  and there are many indicators, such as domestic and campus violence and road accidents, which need  to be assessed. Therefore, this vision seeks to formulate a road map in order to improve some  indicators related to the society's stability and balance.   Se  TAN    As for the private sector, the general business environment in Jordan has worsened compared to other  countries, which requires extensive attention to improve the quality of the business environment in  order to attract direct domestic and foreign investments. It is necessary to enforce the laws firmly,  fairly and equally and achieve legislative stability with respect to the business environment. It is also  necessary to focus on small and medium-sized enterprises, improve their access to finance,  innovation and creativity, encourage their entrepreneurship, increase their competitiveness in local  and export markets.       On the macroeconomic level, the most important priorities include achieving economic growth and       ve growth rates of about 3% in spite of the unfavorable regional conditions. Jordan has honored  international obligations with regard to addressing the imbalances, particularly public spending   and debt. However, challenges still lie ahead and require keeping up the pace of reform to achieve  sustainable growth, which will positively affect all segments of society all over the kingdom.                  This section also evaluates the performance of the public sector and the improvements in indicators  of transparency and integrity and addresses the restructuring of the public sector and the  effectiveness of public service delivery; achievements and shortfalls have been reviewed and some  policies and measures to improve the government performance have been suggested.   ‘The second chapter reviews the new growth model that will enable us to achieve the goals and  aspirations we hope to attain in 2025, the national development efforts that should be implemented  and priority markets and sectors. It will demonstrate how to stimulate growth, achieve prosperity for  Jordanians and determine required skills and resources, as well as reviewing the mechanisms for  creating the enabling environment. This chapter also reviews two scenarios, the baseline scenario and  the targeted scenario, depending on certain measures and initiatives on various sectoral levels, taking  into account the internal and external factors. The difference between the “baseline” scenario and the  “targeted” scenario is the expected range within which the value of the realized performance  indicators which may fluctuate, that will be discussed in detail in the second part of this document.         According to the targeted scenario, the document intend to achieve real economic growth rates of  about 7.5% in 2025, at a rate of 5.7% within the vision period, while the baseline scenario aims to  achieve an economic growth rate of 4.8%. With regard to poverty and unemployment, the targeted  scenario aims to reduce poverty and unemployment rates to about 8.0% and 9.17% respectively,  compared to about 10% and 11.7% respectively in the baseline scenario. The targeted scenario seeks  to reduce the ratio of public debt to GDP to 47%, compared to about 60% in the baseline scenario.       In this chapter, the vision identifies a number of clusters that have been determined through studies,  analysis and consultation as priority high-potential clusters to stimulate economic growth and create  job opportunities for Jordanians. The vision provides an analysis of the reality of these clusters and   lentifies the initiatives and measures that should be implemented to develop them. These clusters  include, for example, engineering industries and construction, health care and medical tourism, digital  services and information technology, tourism and conferences and financial services. They are  distributed between industrial and services clusters and they have proven their success in creating  decent job opportunities for Jordanians, which can be rolled out throughout the kingdom.       This was followed by a review of how to achieve growth, deepen reforms and identify the new  foundations advocated by this document in preparation for a new start. This section includes direct  recommendations that focused on reinforcing the rule of law, strengthening the role of institutions and  encouraging the competition on all levels. It is also necessary to adopt a culture of excellence and  adhere to international best practices.   In the second part, all initiatives and measures in the various economic sectors were reviewed; these  sectors are divided into four main groups according to the document: the government, the business  sector, the society and citizens. The chapter also reviews the various sectoral indicators intended to  be achieved in 2025 according to the proposed implementation phases. The review includes the  policies and measures related to the targeted scenario and the results expected to be achieved during  the expected implementation periods.   @F%  SAI    ww  MANIC   Introduction   yw  TAN    In accordance with His Majesty's directive, the government has consulted widely over the past 12  months through a number of channels in order to develop a roadmap for national prosperity to 2025.  This effort of developing ‘Jordan 2025’ was led by a Steering Committee chaired by the Prime Minister  and including the participation of a number of ministers and representatives from the private sector  and from across civil society .       The Steering Committee was supported by 17 sectoral committees convened and managed by the  Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC) that included more than 300experts and  representatives from government, business and civil society across Jordan.   These 17 technical committees identified the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats faced  by the Jordanian economy and society today. They also reviewed more than 1600 recommendations  already made in over 80 previous plans and strategies developed over the past decade in order to.  understand what where previous policies and plans have succeeded and failed and to identify those  proposals that have not yet been implemented but should over the coming decade. These plans and  strategies have subsequently been collated for public access and are now available on the website  www.inform.gov,jo.   In addition to the work of these 17 committees, a broader process of engagement was also launched  to ensure that every citizen, civil society organization, political party and business association was  provided with the opportunity to contribute their views and ideas into the process of developing  “Jordan 2025\". The government issued a Public Call for Submissions in national newspapers in  ‘September 2014 and through the MOPIC website. This process followed international best practice for  public participation and consultation and was the Jordan that this form of open pul   ipation has been used. In addition to newspaper advertisements, 45 business associations, civil  society organizations, political parties and other groups were directly contacted by MOPIC and  encouraged to take part in the process through this open submissions process.                         National Conference was also held at the Dead Sea on 20 September 2014. Over 780 Jordanians from  all segments of society were invited to attend. 450 individuals and institutions accepted the invitation  and participated in the one-day conference, which was attended by the Prime Minister and members of  the government. Participants exchanged views and ideas about how Jordan can and should move  forward through seven working groups each focused on a specific strategic area important for the  kingdom's future.       As a result of these consultative and collaborative efforts, “Jordan 2025” provides a clear and honest  assessment of the Kingdom's current situation; outlines a vision with specific goals to be achieve; and  provides a roadmap, including specific initiatives and timelines, to be followed to achieve our aspirations.   It is however important to note that the priority initiatives outlined in this document do not represent  everything the government needs to do over the coming decade. As circumstances change, including  the emergence of new risks, threats and opportunities, future governments will need to identify  additional initiatives to be undertaken. Nevertheless, the policies contained in “Jordan 2025”  represent significant and important structural reforms and programmatic improvements that we  cannot lose sight of over the coming decade. They have been selected and prioritized based on a  number of criteria, including:   + The nature of barriers and constraints that hindered previous reform efforts.   + Their expected positive, long term and sustainable impact on our citizens and society.   + Their contribution in promoting exports as our key engine for growth and job creation.   + The jobs they can generate for Jordanians over the long term.   * Their potential to improve income distribution between and within Governorates.   * Their cost to implement and sustain give our given our objective of  restoring and sustaining fiscal sustainability.       Many of these proposed actions and policies are not new; some have already been recommende  previous plans and strategies developed by the Government, private sector and/or civil society  organizations. , such as the National Agenda Document, the National Employment Strategy, the  Poverty Reduction Strategy, the “We Are All Jordan” document and other sectoral strategies. Since  many of these sound proposals and recommendations remain valid and are likely when implemented  to make real change, they have been restated in “Jordan 2025”.   “Jordan 2025” also includes Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to the desired outcomes in  each reform area in order to enable the government, the business community, civil society         organizations and citizens to assess the extent to which progress in real outcomes is being achieved  from the actions being taken.   Sr,  wANe BS    These KPls have been provided not just for 2025 but at four year intervals over the next decade. This  will allow future governments to monitor and assess whether the reforms being undertaken are  generating the desired outcomes. Equally, if implementation is behind schedule and/or the desire  outcomes are not being realized, the Government will have the opportunity to course-correct the  executive programs for subsequent years and annual budgets to re-scope priority initiatives and  related government acti       Like any roadmap or plan for the future, the targets that we set at the beginning of our journey must  represent a level of confidence and ambition for the future and a commitment to address the  challenges and barriers that have held back progress in the past. In addition to identifying the specific  actions required, this Plan provides a high-level sequence for the proposed actions in each reform  area. Ultimately, the government is responsible for setting budgets and priorities in any given year and  must retain the flexibility and discretion to modify priorities based on economic, social and financial  conditions at the time. While the logical sequence of activities and milestones are clear, the intention  of the timelines outlined in this document is to be indicative rather than prescriptive, in order to  provide flexibility to decision makers.         ‘There is a widespread belief in Jordan that implementation is the task of government alone and that  the failures of the past have been due to failures in government, There is no doubt that there are  inadequacies and poor accountability and that the government bears the lion's share of the  responsibility for the Kingdom's past under-performance in implementation. However, successful  reform requires the commitment of all stakeholders- the private sector, the civil society and individual  citizens- to do their part, by, for example, paying their taxes and abiding by the rule of law and the  principle of equal opportunity.   The evaluation of past experience includes lessons and recommendations that will help move forward  to the future. The common understanding of the nature of the challenges, the destination that we need  to reach and the degree of urgency would dictate the policies to be followed within a clear timeframe  to build the Jordan we want by 2025.   sigs  TAN.    aA   Chapter One   gue  WAG    1. JordanToday   Before charting a course for the next decade, it is important to begin with a clear and honest  assessment of where we have come from over the past decade since the National Agenda and where  we stand today as a society and an economy across all aspects of our development. This chapter  provides an integrated and holistic assessment of our Kingdom's social and economic condition at the  end of the 2014 through four windows: the current state of our citizens, our society, the private sector  and the performance of Government.   Figure 1: Jordan 2025 Pillars   SOCIETY                                                  Jordan  Communities   CITIZEN      Workforce  Participation.   BUSINESS GOVERNMENT   duction     Through this framework, Jordan 2025 seeks to understand the current state of Jordanians and  Jordanian families; the state of our society as a whole; and how the interaction of civil society, the  private sector and the government enables or inhibits our prosperity as citizens.       In order to put our current social and economic outcomes into some context for judgment, a range of  economic and social performance indicators were compared with a selection of benchmark countries  both from our own region in the Middle East as well as countries around the world with similar  characteristics to Jordan, such as population size, business environment and natural resources. In  order to define our ambitions for the future over the next decade, we must compare ourselves not just  to those at a similar level of development today, but also to ountries with more advanced levels of  development to which we aspire to achieve in the future. By considering world’s best practice even if  those economies are much more advanced than Jordan is today, we can help define our ambitions and  the road map for action over the next decade.  39  Ae    Based on a comprehensive scan of countries with comparable characteristics, Jordan was compared  to a number of countries, as shown in the table below:   Table 1: Jordan 2025: Benchmark Peer Countries         GDP per | Total natural  CTC Maaco)   (PPP, 2012) | (as % of GDP)                Population | GDP 2012 | GDP per  size 2013 | (Sbillion) | capita ($)   fertee Titers rt IS (1000 sq km)                     Georgia 45 15,7 3,489 6,808  Tunisia 10,8 45,7 4,231 10,797   er 63 3 es   Bulgaria 73 51 6,986 16,044   Uruguay 34 49,9 14,676 18,280 2,50% 475   Croatia 43 59,2 13,767 20,964 1,60% 56   Hungary 99 1246 12,586 22,635 0,90% ot  Lithuania 3 42,3 14,100 24,356 1,00% 63   Finland 54 2474 45,815, 39,199 1,40% 304   Ireland 46 2106 45,783 43,834 0,10% 69   Switzerland 8 631.2 78,900 53,191 0,00% 40   Singapore 5,3 267,5 62,170 72,724 0,00% 07   Source: World Bank, IMF.   1.1 Citizen Outcomes Today  Jordan today is considered an “upper-middle income” country by the World Bank. Jordan has  achieved this status in 2012 because of the growth rates achieved over the past decade. This is  represented by Jordan's ranking on the Human Development Index (HDI), and the Health and  education pillar in the World Economic Forum's Competitiveness report.

However, the health and education   pillars, as measured by the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index, show a relative  decline over the past decade compared to some countries.   This suggests that some countries have been able to achieve larger gains in health and education  ‘outcomes than those achieved in Jordan. It also reflects the stress placed on our education and health  system due to the pressures placed on Jordan’s hosting of over 1.4m Syrian refugees as a result of the  unprecedented regional instability we have been living through since 2011.   In terms of the composition of the population, Jordan's large proportion of young people represents a  unique opportunity of strategic importance to achieve long- term prosperity of the Kingdom. As shown  in the demographic pyramid below, the essence of this opportunity is the age profile of the Kingdom's  population, which is a unique demographic “gift”. More than half the Jordanian population are under  the age of 24, and over the next decade, the population is projected to grow at 1.35% and the labour  force is expected to rise by 2.3% per year. This means that for the next 20 years to 2035, the working  age population in Jordan (15-64) will be larger than the dependent population (children and the elderly).   Our demographic reality lies at the centre of “Jordan 2025”. To seize the benefits of this “gift”,  educational attainment levels and training must be dramatically improved and workforce participation  rates among both males and females must be increased. This represents one of the most important  opportunities to improve the well-being of Jordanians.

S E E S    rs   1.1.1 Health  As prosperity has risen in Jordan, public health outcomes have improved considerably over the past  30 years. Since 1980, life expectancy has increased from 66 to 74.4 in 2014, while infant mortality has  decreased from 45 to 17 per 1,000 live births over the same period.

These  achievements are the result of consistent investment in, and expansion of, the national healthcare  system. Jordan now has one of the best healthcare systems in the region. Health workers in Jordan,  especially doctors and nurses, are recognized, regionally and internationally, for the excellence of their  skills and training, As a result, Jordan is also now recognized as a global leader in medical tourism.       P37 &   TAN    Despite these achievements in health outcomes, a number of challenges are still evident and growing.  Jordan has one of the world's highest rates of non- communicable diseases (such as diabetes),  typically caused by lifestyle choices. It is estimated that more than 30% of average healthy life years in  Jordan is lost due to early mortality, sickness, and disability. This result is the lowest score among  Jordan’s benchmark group of countries and third lowest in region (ahead of only Iraq and Syria). The  economic consequences and costs are undoubtedly significant and growing. These factors contribute  to lower workforce participation rates and higher costs to the public healthcare system, especially for  employers due to worker absenteeism, earlier retirement and lower overall productivity.

Further  improvements in the quality and cost of care in the healthcare system are also key priorities. The  majority of healthcare institutions in the Jordan are not accredited to international standards. Only  45% of military hospitals, 16% of Ministry of Health hospitals and 13% of private hospitals are  accredited today.   1.1.2 Education  Over many decades, Jordan has established a regional and international reputation for the quality of its  education system. It is one of our major national assets and a source of national pride. Educational  ‘outcomes, the knowledge, skill and attainment levels of our people, is vital to the cohesion and vibrancy  of our society and strength and competitiveness of our economy. Our education system helps to reaffirm  our cultural identity and prepare our young people to be responsible and active citizens.       Nevertheless, the available evidence suggests that Jordan's education system has begun to decline,  particularly in the public school system. In general, education outcomes ~ the levels of achievement  attained by students moving through and graduating from the national school and university system -  suggest a decline in the standards of quality and excellence and a steady erosion of what was once a  key source of national competitive advantage. The measures and reforms that have been implemented  by the Ministry of Education over the past two years, particularly the reconsideration of high school  examination, the ongoing review of the cross-cutting educational disciplines and the possible  adoption of an approach of independent evaluation of the educational process outputs for all  educational levels, are all steps in the right direction to improve the quality of the education system  and restore its reputation.          At the primary and secondary school levels, test scores and pass rates indicate that Jordan is no  longer preparing the majority of its next generation for a globally and regionally competitive  workforce. At the international level, Jordan’s overall attainment in the Trends in International  Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) has declined in comparison to other countries of similar  levels of economic development. The average mathematics scores of Jordanian students were 406  compared to 498 for countries of the same category. Scores declined by 5% between 1999 and 2011,  while almost all comparable economies have improved their scores during that period.   Figure 6: International Education Outcomes   Comparable International Education Outcomes       Grade 8 TIMSS score for Grade 8 TIMSS score for  ‘Mathematics Science   1999-2011 1999-2011       1999 2003 2007 2011 1999 2003 2007 2011   I International average Il Jordan   Source:       IMSS, The National Center for Education   Jordan's private school attainment levels are outstanding on an international level suggesting that  there is no barrier to our ability to create outstanding learning environments for our children. One of  Jordan's top private schools had 47% of its students achieve IB scores of more than 35 points (against  a global average of 27% of students).   It is clearly possible for us to build globally competitive secondary education institutions. The real  challenge is spreading the opportunity for higher quality education so that the majority of Jordanians  can benefit from the public education system.   As highlighted in previous education strategies, there are a number of possible reasons for the  stagnation of outcomes from Jordan’s public education system, including:   + Public expenditure per student is low by international standards  {although increased spending alone does not guarantee better outcomes).   + The quality of basic public school infrastructure is highly variable across the Kingdom. Many public  schools are in need of investment and a regime of ongoing maintenance.   +The school curriculum and teaching methods are outdated and largely rely on rote learning instead  of stimulating critical thinking.   + The administration of the public schoo! network is highly centralized.   + Parental and community involvement in various school activities is very low.   * Teacher training is underfunded and behind international best practice in terms of training methods.   + The pressure on school infrastructure, particularly in the northern and central governorates as a  result of the influx of Syrian refugee children, has forced a shortening of hours and the introduction of  double shifts to accommodate the surge in demand,       Fu  AG    Figure 7: Expenditure on Primary and Secondary Education   Primary and Secondary Education Spending — Selected Countries  ‘Spend per primary and secondary student ys. selected countries   $ PPP, Selected Countries, 2011       15,000     12,000   9,000   6,000   3,000   Ex pe nd it ur e   pe r   St ud  en t   (P PP  S)          Ireland Finland Asracl_—=—‘Singaporel_Lithanla—Mangary—Walgala Jordan   Note: Data for Singapore is from 2010  Source: World Bank (TIMSS)   At the tertiary education level, there are two key issues. First, employers have noted for several years  that the Kingdom's universities are not consistently delivering graduates with the skills and training  required for the workforce. Second, there is too much focus on academic as opposed to vocational  training. Only 13% of students in the public education system are studying vocational course, well  below comparable international standards. This means that a significant number of graduates will  immediately join the ranks of the jobless, despite the ready availability of jobs for vocationally skilled  workers.               Employer perceptions are reinforced by the fact that, unlike several universities in the GCC, Lebanon  and Egypt, no Jordanian university is ranked within the top 500 universities worldwide according to  the Times Higher Education-British Quacquarelli Symonds (THE-QS) global ranking of universities.  According to the National Employment Strategy, employer satisfaction with the quality of graduates is  low because they believe the curricula and teaching methods at the university level do not focus  primarily on the needs of the labor market.         The most concerning indicator about the quality of outcomes achieved by the tertiary education sector  is the high unemployment rate amongst Jordan's university graduates. This represents a negative  return on investment from the national tertiary education system. Many university students could build  their skills and employability faster and at less cost by enrolling in vocational training programs to  facilitate access to the labor market instead of choosing three or four year degree programs at  university that do not necessarily guarantee decent jobs.   The steady relative decline of the quality of outputs of higher education institutions in Jordan is  reflected in the number of non-Jordanian students enrolled in Jordanian universities, as indicated by  the Higher Education Strategy 2015-2018 that identified the major challenges facing the sector.   In addition to low enrolment rates, the vocational training sector is “yielding poorly trained and  uncommitted workers” according to a recent independent assessment. The assessment of the  Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) system indicates limited linkages between  labour market needs and Jordan's vocational training institutes, poor instructor qualifications, lack of  proper equipment for training, and overall lack of official occupational standards validated by  employers to ensure there is a clear frame of reference for all training programs.  wee  WAN    1.1.3 Culture and Youth   The growth of the culture and youth sector during the past few years has led to raising awareness  among all segments of society and developing youth cultural civil society institutions, by contributing  to the provision of financial and logistical support to them, which is one of the most important factors  in the sustainability of their positive impact. It has also led to activating the role of youth in the multiple  aspects of the development process. Despite the modest cultural, youth and sports infrastructure,  Jordan has made remarkable progress by increasing the number of cultural center and sports cities in  several governorates. This has had a clear positive impact in the development of this sector by  increasing and diversifying cultural youth activities. Large segments of society, whether individuals or  civil society institutions, have benefited, from these infrastructures, which has positively increased  community awareness and contributed to the economic and social development.       The culture and youth sector can be an effective economic and social lever for promoting national  development by investing in the cultural industries sector, known for their efficiency and ability to  spread to Arab countries, especially film and drama industry, knowledge, publishing and festivals. If  activated, this sector can also be a real driver for tourism development, or more specifically cultural  tourism, in Jordan.   ‘The promotion of cultural development in its holistic sense, and raising awareness and enlightenment,  is the basis for protecting stability and ensuring civil peace in light of the growing negative societal  phenomena that is threatening the stability and civil peace, such as violence in its many forms,  intellectual extremism and exaggeration. The culture and youth sector, as well as the education sector,  bear the greatest burden in this regard.       1.1.4 Participation in the Workforce   A new development model must be built; the current development model is unable to encourage  young population to take advantage of the opportunities provided by the national economy by finding  decent job opportunities and support youth Innovation and entrepreneurship. The levels of  participation in the workforce, and the revised participation (workforce “employed and unemployed”  relative to working-age population), clearly show that Jordan, according to the World Bank, ranks215th  out of 218 countries in the world in terms of level of participation in the workforce. Jordan has made  little progress on this dimension of development for the past two decades.       The numbers behind this outcome are important to acknowledge. The Jordanian workforce in 2013 was  estimated at 1.7 million people in both formal and informal sectors. It is estimated that only 37.1% of the  working age population are economically active, while 62.9% (or 2.5 million people of working age) are  inactive. Distribution by gender shows that 65% of males are economically active compared to only 15%  of females. In comparison, averages in the MENA region are 76% for males and 27% for females, and the  world averages are 77% for males and 51% for females.       Our single biggest challenge over the next decade is addressing this workforce participation challenge.  Our current development model is clearly not creating the number and quality of jobs demanded by our  citizens; and our citizens must be willing to take-on the jobs that are available in our economy.        This is a multi-dimensional problem that requires an equally multidimensional set of policy and program  responses. In particular, the low female participation rate is a significant lost opportunity for Jordan. Our  current 15% rate of female participation in the workforce is amongst the lowest in the world reinforced  by Jordan’s rank on the Gender Inequality Index of 99 out of 146, and 134 of 142 in the Global Gender  Gap Index. Jordan ranks 13 out of 16 countries in the Middle East and Africa, lagging behind most Arab  countries, including Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt Mauritania and GCC countries. Furthermore,  average wage for females is 67% lower than the average wage for males in all types of jobs.             27%    Figure 8: Gender Equality   Gender Equality   Female Participation Rate, 2012  Rank of Selected Countries   Gender Inequality Index, 2013  Rank of Selected Countries   te te ar dl    ei li lt it id il    n i                   ‘Source: UNDP, World Bank   According to the macroeconomic model that has been used as part of the development of Jordan 2025 this  vision, increasing female participation rate in Jordan to the MENA average (from 15% to 27% over the next  decade) would have major positive impacts on economic growth in Jordan, by at least 5% by 2025.   Achieving better workforce participation and retention rates would not only drive growth and raise  household prosperity, but would accelerate improvements in the nation’s finances by increasing the  number of tax-paying workers in the formal sector. This would also help to fund social security  programs for the less privileged and improve government services in all governorates of the Kingdom.   1.1.5 Employment   Although strong growth in key sectors has driven significant employment creation on the demand side  over the past decade, many of the newly created jobs are being filled by low-cost, low-skilled foreign  workers instead of Jordanians. An estimated 658,000 foreign workers work in Jordan, nearly  two-thirds of work in the informal sector. Foreign workers are most present in construction, agriculture  and manufacturing (41%, 38%, 37% of respective sector workforces), which are also three of the  fastest-growing sectors outside the public sector.   While the presence of cheaper foreign labour enhances the competitiveness of several key sectors of  Jordan’s economy, it also puts downward pressure on the wages of Jordanians in those sectors. This  has historically added to the ‘culture of shame’ that some jobs available in the private sector are not   suitable for Jordanians, which has led many Jordanians instead to seek out the better paid and more  secure opportunities that have been made available in the public sector.       As the National Employment Strategy highlighted, if we manage to encourage Jordanians to enter and  remain in the workforce, the next challenge will be creating more jobs and improving labour market  mechanisms that help young people to find available job opportunities. However, typical labour market  mechanisms that exist in healthy and productive economies are largely absent or dysfunctional in  Jordan today- replaced instead by non-institutional job hunting methods. There is a need to develop  a dynamic and transparent labour market on both the supply and demand sides. The Ministry of  Labour has recently started to develop mechanisms and organize employment campaigns to bridge  the existing gap. These efforts should be supported and institutionalized to develop active labor  market policies.   Several sectors face a supply and demand mismatch. In healthcare, for example, Jordanian  universities currently produce 3,500 medical and nursing graduates each year, while Higher Education  Strategy estimates indicate that only 1,300 new medical professionals are hired by Jordan's domestic  healthcare industry each year. This suggests that the supply of doctors and nurses is almost three  times the level of demand.       W535 ee    An estimated 236,000 Jordanians currently work in Saudi Arabia, 170,000 in the UAE and 70,000 in  Kuwait. While the Jordanian expatriates in the region and the world can contribute to national  development, sustainable long term economic development cannot be built by having a large number  of the nation’s ‘best and brightest’ work abroad and replacing them with unskilled foreign workers who.  transfer their savings outside the country. The first priority of our national education system and  labour markets should be to provide meaningful opportunities for Jordanians to work in Jordan.   In addition to improving the performance of our education system and the efficiency of our labour  markets, we must also address the desires and aspirations of youth and their parents. Most  importantly, social attitudes towards vocational jobs need to change and the incentive system  between public sector and private sector employment needs to be fundamentally re-evaluated. The  government continues to the employer of both the first and last resort for the majority of Jordanians.  Consequently, there are over 250,000 people on the Civil Service waiting list for a public sector  position because of the perception of the public sector offering a more attractive and secure package  to many young job seekers.   To change this reality, Jordan's private sector must be the primary engine for growth and job creation  for Jordanians. Too many of the private sector jobs created today are filled by foreign workers rather  than Jordanians. Young people should be encouraged to work in vocational professions and the  private sector should be the most desired place to work. Our education system needs to focus on  equipping our youth with vocational skills and, as they enter the workforce, our youth need to be  encouraged and enabled through a more transparent and level playing field when they apply for vacant  positions. New market matching mechanisms need to be accompanied by hiring practices that  reinforce a broader cultural change away from wasta and towards meritocracy, because perceptions  about wasta are entrenched across the labour market today.         1.2 Social Outcomes  The measurement of social outcomes is a relatively new but increasingly recognized and expanding  field internationally. Citizens and policy makers are increasingly interested in looking beyond the  traditional measurements of wealth (e.g. GDP and poverty) to broader and more holistic assessments,  such as social cohesion and notions of wellbeing and life satisfaction felt by individuals and  communities. The state of our society today can also be assessed through a set of criteria, such as the  rule of law, justice, social inclusion and marginalization.       1.2.1 Rule of Law  Belief in, and widespread social adherence to, the rule of law is fundamental to the confidence,  stability and proper functioning of any society and state. In broad terms, Jordan’s judiciary is seen to  be relatively independent but needs capacity building. According to World Bank indicators, contract  enforcement is a particular area of weakness that must be addressed as a priority because of its  negative impact on local and foreign investor cot           Figure 9: Rule of Law   Rule of Law   \"the Weld an                    ‘Note: Scores rane fom 0 Low evel of achievement) to 1  ‘Source: Bertelsmann Foundation         14 Doing Baxiness Report   In recent years, progress has been made in strengthening the country’s fight against corruption and  building up the capabilities of the national integrity institutions, as evidenced by Jordan’s  performance on the Transparency International corruption perceptions index 2014. In terms of  international comparison, Jordan is perceived to be less corrupt than most countries in the world,  including several EU member states such as Hungary, Bulgaria and Croatia. This is of course no room  for complacency and Jordan 2025 includes measurés to continue to strengthen the national integrity  system in the fight against corruption.       The broader social challenge for the Kingdom will be building a genuine culture of respect and  compliance with the rule of law in everyday life. Many Jordanians have become accustomed to using  wasta and social connections to short-circuit official procedures. rn   AG             Figure 10: Anti-Corruption Performance Measurement Indicators   Corruption —- Comparison to Selected Countries   Irregular Payments & Bribes and Diversion of Pubic  nds World EceoomeF   nk out of (148 counties), Selected Counties, 2013-2014               Source: Transpareney Infernational, The Global Competitiveness Report 2013-2014   1.2.2 Citizenship   Citizenship — the sense of belonging, equality before the law and equal opportunities -is a vital prerequisite for  any prosperous and stable society. Acts of good citizenship come in many forms, for example voting in national  and municipal election, driving safely, and volunteering time to support a community group. Along with strong  family ties, citizenship is one of the vital threads that strengthen the social and cultural fabric for our future.   Public debate about the importance of citizenship has gained significant prominence over the past year  through the discussion papers issued by His Majesty King Abdullah Il Majesty, in which he has outlined  what ‘Active Citizenship’ means, why it is so important and how Jordanians can embrace the principle of  active citizenship in their everyday life. Just as it is a vital ingredient into our political development journey,  Active Citizenship also has vitally important economic as well as social implications. For example paying  taxes is an important act of responsible citizenship. Good neighbors, who are mindful of rubbish and  keeping shared spaces clean, are also good citizens.   The growth of our civil society sector over the past decade is encouraging, with 127 international  non-governmental organizations and 4500 local organizations operating in Jordan in this area, in addition  to new programs and platforms for volunteerism that are spreading fast. Improving the depth and  resilience of our social fabric through a strong sense of shared pride and a culture of active civic  ‘engagement must remain a key priority for the future.       1.2.3 Families and Local Communities.   The family, which constitutes the bedrock of Jordanian society, has witnessed tremendous change in the  face of numerous external pressures over the last decade. The rapid growth of the Kingdom in the decade  prior to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis brought about significant changes in daily life, including new  amenities and services and the proliferation of technology. As they have all around the world, these new  developments have reshaped the identity, lifestyle and habits of all our citizens.               ‘The education level of Jordanian women has also significantly improved and brought about a shift in the  ‘outlook and expectations of many Jordanian women, including a desire by many to have a career as well  as a family. The confluence of these factors has placed new and challenging pressures on Jordanian  families. It is not surprising in light of social and economic pressures that the fertility rate in Jordan has  fallen and that incidents of divorce have increased. In 1976, the fertility rate in Jordan was 7.4 children per  female. By 2012, it had fallen to 3.5 children per female. Conversely, the divorce rate has increased  significantly in recent years rising to 2.6% in 2011, 2.8% in 2012 and 2.9% in 2013.             Families are also vitally important for shaping the aspirations of our youth and instilling them with the civic  values and ethics. Parenting attitudes have a direct impact on the life skills and attitudes passed on to the  next generation, which in turn can have a big impact on educational attainment levels and employability  skills later in life when they join the labour market.   wiry  WAN    1.2.4 Poverty and Disadvantaged Community   Jordan has developed a wide-reaching and robust social safety, which has resulted in significant and  important gains in reducing poverty and creating a more equal society over the past decade. The  percentage of the population living in poverty has fallen from over 21% in 1997 to 14% in 2010 (the last year  for which comprehensive national data is available), Nevertheless, poverty remains a national challenge  and is more pronounced the further a governorate is located from Amman. If relatively large governorates  like Zarqa, Amman and Irbid are excluded, the average poverty level rises to 20%. This shows that despite  achieving gains at the national level, reducing the disparities between governorates continues to be an  important policy priority for the next decade. Furthermore, a significant percentage of the population are  struggling just above the official poverty line, underlining the importance of focusing on the development  of lower-middle income groups to keep these groups from falling under the poverty line.   1.2.5 Cost of Living   The government's attention and priorities have focused for decades on the expenditure side of the  household budget ledger, including alleviating cost of living pressures through various direct and  indirect subsidies. Social welfare spending, defined as total spending on direct and indirect subsidies  for the poor, such as commodity subsidies and supporting health and education sectors, has  increased in recent years. Social spending is estimated at about JD two billion annually, or 8.4% of  GDP and 23.7% of the general budget for 2013.           ‘The reasons for increased social spending are:   + First, the increased demand for direct and indirect subsidies as a result of population  growth and refugee crises faced by Jordan.   * Second, pension spend has increased to 12% of the national budget and is expected to more  than double within 10 years.   hird, subsidies on electricity production, transmission and generation have increased significantly  in order to help contain the cost of electricity to households and certain sectors. Financial  assistance to the National Electric Power Company (NEPCO) and Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ)  and their subsidiaries was estimated at 4.8% and 0.8% of GDP for 2014 respectively.         While this has clearly helped to contain price increases, it has stretched the nation’s finances and created  a welfare dependence among many Jordanian families as they try to manage the rising cost of living in an  environment in which the income side of their household ledger has not made sufficient gains.       Jordan's hard-fought gains in tackling poverty and inequality over the past decade remain fragile and  at risk of being reversed unless we continue to support the poor and underprivileged. But the methods  and approach we take to providing that support must change. It is not feasible to maintain the current  levels of social spending as a share of GDP over the next decade given our budget pressures today  and our expanding population in the years to come. The social support we can provide must be better  targeted on those who are genuinely in need and we must help Jordanian families respond to cost of  living concerns by expanding their income earning potential through employment rather than  providing general subsidies to offset price increases.   1.2.6 Housing and Neighborhoods       Finding and securing decent housing remains a source of concern for many Jordanian families. Home  ownership in Jordan is low by international standards, and real estate prices have risen dramatically  over the past decade in many parts of the Kingdom driven by a sharp rise in land prices and the  pressure on housing supply created by successive waves of refugee migration to Jordai  the majority of housing units today are not affordable for the majority of Jordanian fami  now a surplus of high-end housing and a lack of supply of affordable housing for low and  middle-income families despite clear market need at that level. Multi-family households and  overcrowding are now increasingly common as 25% of households include one sleeping room and  44% have two sleeping rooms. Average household size is 5.4 with over 40% of urban households. 47%  of rural households have 6+ people in one dwelling.                 International research also highlights that inadequate and overcrowded housing leads to worst health  outcomes due to lower hygiene and poorer educational outcomes for children, especially in poor  areas. Given the significance of housing as an issue for families, a clear and integrated national  housing policy needs to be developed.       Neighborhood and community safety is also an important issue for families and communities, and a  vital factor for maintaining the confidence of local businesses and foreign tourists alike. One of  Jordan’s great strengths is its comparative advantage as a safe and tolerant society in the middle of a  troubled and volatile region. Jordan is considered by the international community to be a relatively  stable society, providing citizens with a general sense of safety in public spaces, and making Jordan  8 more attractive location for foreign direct investment, particularly in comparison to other countries   in the region.

According to rankings assembled by the World Economic Forum, Jordan is strong in the areas of  public safety, performing well on dimensions such as the business costs of crime and violence  (#16/148), organized crime (#13/148), and the reliability of police services (#43/148).  Road safety stands out as a particular area of concern for the Kingdom. Jordan has one of the world’s  highest rates of road fatalities, suggesting that urgent attention is required to create safer roads and  neighborhoods for Jordanian families. Part of the solution must also be a change in driver attitudes  and behaviors on our nation’s roads.

Our domestic population and domestic economy is too small to provide the jobs and the  growth we require to provide the quality of life Jordanians aspire to.   Jordan has many competitive advantages including as a strategic location at the intersection of three  continents (Asia, Europe and Africa) and within the Middle East region between the GCC and the  Levant. It also boasts a stable political climate and strong relations with neighboring countries and the  world and has established a position as a strategic supplier of highly-skilled human resources for the  GCC market.       The private sector and Jordanian business leaders have proven their ability to compete at the regional  and international levels. While there are many success stories we can be proud of, more needs to be  done in order to strengthen the competitiveness of Jordan’s business environment as a basis for  export success and as a hub for regional headquarters and investments by foreign investors.  As shown in the figure below, despite significant growth in foreign trade during the past five years in  absolute terms, export share of GDP declined from 48% in 2004 to 42% of GDP in 2014. The ratio of  Jordan's exports to GDP is low compared to other similar countries.   wu  AN    Figure 12: Foreign Trade Developments   ‘Total of Exports as Percentage of GDP  Total of Exports and Imports   ‘Total exports and Imports “Total exports relative performance,  1998-2013, $ billion % of GDP. 2013,   j  1  £           SEEEE GEG QELEREG2 E02  Total part e-Folio        Source:Department of Statistics Source: UNCTAD   This has led to a widening trade balance deficit, amounting to about JD9906.9 million in 2013, a rise of  nearly JD772.7 million compared to 2012. Our high and persistent trade deficit is one of the most  important challenges facing our national financial position, Our trade deficit reached 41.5% in 2013 of  GDP due to increased imports of oil and oil derivatives and sluggish growth in exports as a share of  GDP due to declining relative competitiveness of the economy as a whole. As highlighted in the graph  below, our exports are also highly concentrated in many sectors on one or two markets highlighting  the need to further diversify both the product mix and destination for our exports.

It also enjoys political, security and macroeconomic stability, excellent infrastructure,  qualified human resources, in addition to the legislation governing the investment process. The  volume of investments in 2013 was about JD2.2 billion, and they were concentrated in the sectors of  industry, tourism entertainment cities, hotels, maritime transportation, hospitals and agriculture.         As part of the ongoing efforts to develop the business environment and investment, the government  has reviewed and amended several economic and trade legislation, notably those relating to  investment, reorganization of the business, bankruptcy, liquidation and activating public-private  partnerships, in line with best international practices in this area.       Crucial to our trade and investment success is the quality of our local business environment. The  volume of investments in 2013 was about JD2.2 billion, concentrated in industrials, tourism and  entertainment, maritime transportation, hospitals and agriculture sectors.   Nevertheless, as measured by respected international rankings, there is significant need for  improvement in the competitiveness of the Kingdom’s business environment. In 2015 Jordan was  ranked 117th out of 189 economies in the World Bank’sEase of Doing Business ranking, compared to  116th out of 189 countries in the previous year. Jordan's ranking in the 2015 World Economic Forum's.  competitiveness indicators improved by four places to 64th globally out of 144 countries.       According to these comparative international assessments, the areas most in need of reforms include  investor protection arrangements, the cost of establishing a business, access to credit, the tax  system, resolving insolvency and contract enforcement.

The average private sector worker's contribution  more than doubled in value between 2000 and 2013. The biggest productivity increases in the past  decade were in the mining sector, with 56% increase, and the finance sector, with 53% increase.       Nevertheless, these impressive productivity gains still place us significantly behind the productivity  levels of more advanced economies and they have been limited to the private sector. Compared to  OECD countries, Jordan performs below all benchmark countries on labour productivity, averaging  USS13 of value-added per person-hour worked. This was much lower than, for example, $29 for Turkey,  $31 for the Czech Republic, $55 for Switzerland or $71 for Ireland.  Productivity is also closely related to the innovative capacity of the economy and the ability to create  new and better products, services and business models that meet the market needs. Despite being  ranked seventh in the world for the availability of scientists and engineers, Jordan does not generate  many patent applications, Jordan ranks below average in its peer group and only average amongst the  region on the Global Innovation index.  wx         Improvements in the general business environment should also help to drive further improvements in  productivity and innovation, by encouraging the importation of new technologies, systems and  processes. Furthermore, a study of international benchmarks shows that public sector productivity is  ighly correlated and responsive to private sector productivity, indicating that an improvement in the   overall functioning of the government and more efficient service delivery would have a significant  impact on improving private productivity levels.       1.3.3 Access to Capital   Despite the growing instability and insecurity in the region, Jordan has exp  of direct and indirect foreign investment in many economic sectors. This strengthened the Central  Bank’s ability to develop a financially resilient and sophisticated banking system in accordance with  international standards and practices, in comparison with regional and Arab banking institutions. This  is shown by the indicators of financial strength of the banking system, particularly those related to  rates of liquidity, profitability and capital adequacy, which has had the greatest impact in significantly  increasing the investment attractiveness of banking institutions. 50% of equity in licensed banks in  Jordan is held by non-Jordanians, which is considered one of the most important and strategic  investments, due to their stability and growth.         On the other hand, the negative repercussions of the global economic crisis in recent years and the  increased uncertainty in the region have led banks to adopt tougher lending policies. The growing  financing needs of the government and the trend towards the local market to fulfill a large part of these  needs have reinforced banks’ conservative lending behavior, which in turn created a safe and  competitive investment opportunity for lending to the private sector. Similarly, total deposits in local  banks increased by 10.5% at the end of 2013, while non-resident deposits have seen a steady growth of  19.2%, which is an indicator of increased confidence in the Jordanian economy and banking system.   ‘The Central Bank acknowledges that funding for Micro, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises has been  modest (10% of total facilities granted), which highlights the need to strengthen the sector’s ability to  access required finance with favorable lending conditions, since it is one of the vitally important  sectors to drive economic activity. In light of this reality, the Central Bank strengthened its role in  supporting local high value added economic sectors in order to stimulate economic growth, The Bank  has given more attention to SMEs, providing funding programs directed towards local industry,  tourism, renewable energy and agriculture, for terms appropriate to clients’ financing needs (five years  for industry, tourism and agriculture and ten years for renewable energy), and with a ceiling of 5% of  loan portfolio of operating banks. In addition, the Central Bank has sought to provide credit lines for  ‘SME through the banks operating in the Kingdom. Jordan has managed to secure $70 million soft loan  from the World Bank and a credit line of $50 million with similar conditions from the Arab Fund for  Economic and Social Development. This was later followed by another credit line of $150 million from  the same fund due to the success of the banking sector in utilizing these amounts in the development  of SME in Jordan. Almost the full amount of the World Bank loan was used in developing more than  four thousand micro, small and medium enterprises, 60% of which were established outside the capital  city. Work is underway to complete final terms of reference for a special loan from the European Bank  for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) worth $150 million for the same purpose. The Central  Bank has provided the needed facilities and support to enable banks to benefit from this loan at  appropriate costs and maturities. Accordingly, the funds that have been, or will be, provided to the  sector amount to $420 million.                   According to a study conducted by the World Bank, 49% of large enterprises were able to access  needed bank credit, compared to 35% for medium enterprises, 26% for small enterprises and 15% for  micro enterprises. It is worth noting that several non-bank financial institutions provide finance for  micro, small and medium enterprises.           Hopefully, the activities of these institutions will significantly grow in thanks to the central bank's  determination to organize and monitor the work of these institutions. The Bank has set up a system to  monitor and supervise microfinance institutions in order to strengthen their role in financing micro and  small enterprises, which play a vital role in the fighting poverty and unemployment and promoting financial  depth and economic growth. This system has recently been approved by the Council of Ministers.   In addition to domestic capital, foreign capital- especially foreign direct investment (FDI)-is critical to  the economic growth, productivity increase and technology transfer. Available data indicate that  Jordan has managed to increase foreign direct investment (FDI stock amounts to 80% of GDP, second  only to Lebanon in the region). Much of the FDI inflow was from the GCC, Iraq and the Jordanian  working abroad. A large part of FDI inflow has gone into the real estate sector. sta   WAN    In comparison with the countries in the region, Jordan has managed to attract 3% of the total FDI  coming into the MENA region. Jordan's GDP accounts for 0.8% of the combined MENA GDP. This  indicates that Jordan has become a favorite destination for many investors. However, Jordan still can  position itself as an important hub on the global investment map, and a regional investment incubator  for financial services, renewable energy and information technology, like those countries that  managed to position themselves as regional hubs for service exports. By comparison, other regional  hubs for services exports, such as Ireland and Singapore, achieve much higher levels (142% and 252%  of GDP respectively compared to Jordan’s 80% of GDP).   1.3.4 Entrepreneurship and Small and Medium Enterprises   Jordan is a country of entrepreneurs and start-ups. According to the World Bank, 10% of working age  population are startup owners and micro, small and medium enterprises represent more than 98% of  total establishments in Jordan.         The high level of entrepreneurship in Jordan may be due to the weak growth of jobs created by large  companies, the decline of employment in the public sector institutions after the privatization program  and government policies aimed at reducing the public budget deficit and rationalizing the public sector  in recent years.       Nevertheless, the new business and SME segments of the private sector have experienced modest  growth in recent years. Net growth in the number of non-agricultural economic projects was only 1.3%  per year over the period 2006-2011. The lowest growth rate was that of enterprises that employ less  than 5 workers, at just over 1% per year, compared to 4% per year for enterprises that employ 10-19  workers, 20-49 workers and more than 100 workers.   Entrepreneurs and startup owners in Jordan face several difficulties in starting their business or  expanding their scope and objectives. The most important challenges they face are the lack of  specialized funding programs, high costs of funding, inflexible funding conditions that are not aligned  to the needs and capabilities of small and medium enterprise owners, the administrative and  procedural difficulties related to business registration and high indirect taxes and fees for the  registration and licensing of businesses.       Jordan Enterprise Development Corporation (JEDCO) provides several financial and technical support  programs for SME. In 1994, the Central Bank established Jordan Loan Guarantee Corporation to  provide guarantees for SME loans and increase their access to appropriate funding. The Bank  contributed in providing a special fund for industrial finance managed by the Corporation because of  the importance of this sector within the small and medium enterprise sector. Nevertheless, the small  capital of the company and the limited funding available to the Fund remain the biggest obstacles to  expanding the umbrella of the guarantees provided, at affordable and competitive commission rates,  by commercial banks or other financing institutions that provide funding. In addition, the Central Bank  provided several initiatives and funding programs to increase economic sectors’ capacity, notably  renewable energy, industry, tourism and agriculture, and particularly SME, to access needed funding  through banks, to 5% of total credit facilities provided by banks, and offered credit lines from foreign  sources for the same purpose. In spite of these efforts, SME sector still faces several challenges, due  to the lack of technical support, training, guidance and funding programs.   As illustrated below, this has created the so-called “missing middle” in the structure of the economy.  A significant decrease in the number of firms is observed when businesses reach the size of 10 or  more employees. Ninety-six percent of firms in Jordan are “micro” firms, with less than 10 employees,  accounting for just 8% of total company revenues. Large firms of 100 employees or more make up  0.4% of all firms and account for 75% of total revenues.   we  NG    Figure 15: The Private Sector Structure (The Missing Middle)   “Private Sector Structure Outcomes — the Missing Middle  ‘Total Number of Firms vs Total Revenues of Firms   at Each Stage of the Firm Life Cyele in Jordan, 2012  “ea Naber oF al Ree   = tena § magn cen ag = Teast te no cc sar  Sen: Dept Si Eas Sa 2012 Sinema   The nature of competition between small and medium-sized enterprises is quite rigid due to the  absence of a robust national competition. Small and medium. d enterprises do not contribute   certain capital-intensive sectors, such as telecommunications. Nevertheless, as shown in the  illustration, concentration levels remain high in a number of non-capital intensive sectors in Jordan  such as information technology, pharmaceuticals (medicines), financial services and tourism. This  creates barriers to entry for new players and can suffocate the potential both for lower prices and  better quality products and services for consumers. In some cases this lack of competition is  magnified by preferential legislation and tax concessions that enable industry incumbents to maintain  their dominant position in some markets.              Since small and medium-sized enterprises are vital in the development of the national economy and  the creation of job opportunities, the National Strategy for the encouragement of entrepreneurship and  the development of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises for 2015-2019 was prepared. Work is  also under way to develop a law for small and medium enterprises.

As a result of these investments and the success of our private sector, the  Jordanian economy is more diversified than many neighboring economies in the Middle East.     To maintain and strengthen the diversity in our economy, it is necessary to continue to develop the  export-potential of our economic sectors and activities with comparative advantages at the regional  and global levels. Jordan 2025 identified a number of priority sectors for further development and  promotion given their export and job creation potential.       There is no doubt that Jordan has achieved high economic growth during the period 2002-2008. This  growth, however, did not contribute to reducing poverty and unemployment or bridging the gap  between governorates to the desired extent. This highlights the need to focus on improving social  indicators rather than assuming that they go hand in hand with growth. Instead, these indicators  should be directly measured and adopted as signs of development and goal achievement.

Jordan has been subject to waves of immigration that  have contributed to population growth in a turbulent regional environment. Asa result, the  responsibilities of public institutions have increased. As Government has become larger and more  ‘complex, it has also become expensive to manage and sustain. At 31.3% of GDP in 2014, Jordan's  public expenditure as a share of the economy is very large by international standards and needs to be  reduced and made more efficient.   In this context, we must build on previous efforts that have been undertaken as part of the  restructuring of some public sector institutions under Law No. (17) for the year (2014) regarding the  restructuring of governmental institutions and departments, under which some institutions were  cancelled or merged. The creation of government department and development of organizational  structures bylaw was also issued in order to create a legislative framework governing the  organizational structure of the government and regulating the process of creating new institutions or  preventing financial and administrative independence.   Where appropriate, we should also look to the private sector to perform some basic functions  currently undertaken in the public sector where they can deliver better quality services on a more  sustainable financial basis while still being accountable to citizens. According to the Government  Effectiveness Index, Jordan's performance has declined during the period 2002-2013 and ranked lower  than comparable countries.

The central challenge is to implement the laws and regulations that already exist in an equal, fair and  transparent manner. Government officials are not alone in the need to comply with the rule of law and  administer it fairly. This requires a reciprocal commitment from citizens and business owners to  comply with the law whether, for example, by paying taxes, abiding by government customs  procedures or building design and safety regulations. Nevertheless, Government does need to set the  example but unfortunately today the administration of laws and regulations remains highly uneven  and subject to too much discretion and arbitrary interpretation.  This is symptomatic of a broader problem in government which is that too often informal relationships  and protocols take precedence over formal protocols and procedures. Importantly, this also includes  hiring and firing decisions. This has resulted in a loss of citizen confidence in government. As the  process of making decisions slows down, the costs in terms of lost time and additional transaction  fees for citizens, businesses and entrepreneurs goes up. Our society and our system of government  must become more strongly rule-based as this is fundamental to building a society and an economic  system based on a level playing field.         It also requires building administrative capacity and delegating responsibility to apply the law and  regulations within government to the lowest level of management. In Jordan today, too many minor  decisions are sent up the chain of command in some ministries or institutions instead of delegating  authority to middle level managers for routine procedures and instructions. This has created a cri  ‘of middle management in the public sector. Middle managers, who should be empowered to follow  standard operating procedures and requirements clearly set down in laws and regulations, have  become reluctant to make decisions. This has become most problematic with respect to making  routine and regular financial decisions, such as the processing of regulated fees and charges and the  signing of routine supply contracts. The system of delegation of powers to Secretary Generals  adopted by the Council of Ministers last year us an important step forward in the process of improving  decision making in the public sector and in accelerating the enforcement of laws and regulations in  government institutions.  The frequency of leadership changes in government together with centralized decision-making and  the weakness of institutions have conspired to encourage and reinforce a short-term, tactical  approach rather than strategic management approach to policy and public administration. This has  resulted in frequent changes in legislative and regulatory settings, further undermining investor and  citizen confidence in the strength and meaning of the rule of law.                  In this context, more needs to be done consistent with the recommendations of the National Integrity  System review and the Privatization Evaluation Committee report. The management habits that  permeate through the public sector can be changed if the following is don  + Genuine, rule-based delegation of authority and commensurate accountability for results.       + Greater commitment to competence and merit as the bases for recruitment and promotion in the civil  service, in accordance with the appointment to leadership positions bylaw No. (3) for the year 2013,  and the amendments to the Civil Service bylaw by developing employment and evaluation criteria the  public sector.   + A shift from last minute time management to well-planned plans at all levels of management.        1.4.4 The Size and Quality of Services   The Kingdom's public sector is a large national institution with extensive reach and influence across  all aspects of economic and social life. Jordan's public sector reflects the social contract between  citizens and decision makers. What really matters for citizens and for the business community is  performance and efficiency.   Inrelation to the size and structure of public administration, itis helpful to consider several dimensions including:  + the employment in the public sector.  * direct ownership of economic activity through state-owned enterprises.       * service delivery activities, such as provision of public education, healthcare and housing.  + the scale of subsidies and tax exemptions offered to citizens and to the business community.       Our public sector today suffers from overemployment, inefficiency and low levels of productivity.  Jordan's public sector is now one of the largest in the world measured on a number of dimensions.  The civil service consists of 110 ministries, units and subdivisions, and accounts for 20% of GDP. As  a result, public sector salaries and pension obligations account for 27% of annual government  expenditures. Many government entities have little or no funds available to pay for investment in  training, systems and facilities maintenance to enhance the quality of services provided or to improve  their productivity, which requires attention over the medium term.       The level of direct ownership by the state in our economy has decreased in the past two decades due  to the privatization program under which many assets were sold to local and international investors.  The Privatization Commission report issued in 2014 estimates state-owned assets of about $15 billion  today. These assets need to be managed in a way that ensures covering costs, achieving the best  public benefits for citizens and relinquishing those remaining assets that should not be managed by  the state because they interfere with the basic functions of government or because they potentially  compete with the private sector. The Privatization Commission report has identified the principles and  foundations for managing these assets in the public interest.       Delivery of key services to society is a major part of the government's activities and an important form  of connection between the Government and the people. Public spending on healthcare amounted to  6.2% of GDP in 2013, almost comparable to Switzerland (7.0% of GDP) and Finland (6.9% of GDP).  Public spending on education was slightly lower than benchmark countries (3.9 % of GDP), while  pensions spending was considerably higher (12.3% of GDP).         Table 2: Public Expenditure on Social Services   Provision of social services  Public Expenditure on Social Services % share of GDP, 2013      Georgia 1.7%   Hungary 50% 4,7% 9,9%  Lithuania 47% 5,2% 6,0%  Tunisia 42% 62% 3   Ireland 5.2% 62% 62%   Source: World Bank  Note: According to Government of Jordan sources, health expenditure in 2013 was 7.6% of GDP       seu  TAN    Over the past five decades, the government has provided an extensive array of subsidies, tax  exemptions and other direct transfers that have improved the lives of many Jordanian families.  ‘Subsidies have also played a vital role in helping Jordanians and their families manage the rising cost  of living, particularly over the last decade. High income tax exemption levels also mean that only 3%  of Jordanians actually pay any income tax today. The new law aims at expanding the tax base.  As noted above, despite the success of recent reforms to fuel subsidies, the aggregate cost of direct  consumption subsidies still remains unsustainably high, at JD2 billion, or 8.5% of GDP. Jordan 2025  proposes a series of measures designed to help maintain social services and safety nets for  Jordanians who genuinely need assistance, while at the same time ensuring the cost of those social  services is financially manageable for the country over the longer term.           With respect to the quality of services delivered by Government, public satisfaction levels have  declined over the past decade across all major areas of service delivery impacting the daily life of  Jordanians. The Government Performance Development Program 2013-2014 acknowledges this  challenge and renews efforts within Government to upgrade basic services across the board. E-  Government solutions provide significant promise to increase convenience for citizens and efficiency  for Government (including greater efficacy to help combat corruption). Despite having identified the  potential for e-Government as early as 2001 early and despite having the capabilities of Jordan's ICT  sector to support implementation, Jordan has not succeeded in realizing the full potential of  e- Government and now finds itself lagging the rest of the region in this area.

By shedding light on the decisions and actions of government, transparency helps to build a more  informed citizenry and a government that is more responsive to the needs and demands of citizens.  Citizens should have ready access to information about what government entities are doing, how  taxpayer money is being spent by public sector entities and the rationale as to why leaders in  government believe those activities are going to create specific or broad-scale public goods of benefit  to all citizens.             It is clear from a number of international indicators and rankings that Jordan has made progress, but  has significant room for improvement in transparency and accountability to citizens.   Setting high standards of excellence government performance requirements generally, and  information disclosure to citizens specifically, is an important foundation for effective transparency. In  this context, it is noteworthy that Jordan is the first and so far only Arab country to be part of a  multilateral transparency initiative called the Open Government Partnership (OGP). Using international  standards of excellence and commitment mechanisms, this initiative is an effective way to set a high   bar of excellence and to use the power of international obligations and commitments as a motivator  for local action and real implementation. Jordan's participation in the OGP and the commitments it has.  made as part of this initiative provides an independent way of assessing current outcomes on  transparency and accountability dimensions of government performance. In terms of application  within the public sector, a Practice Guide on Public Sector Governance issued in 2014 to translate the  principles of transparency and accountability into every day practice.                sre  TAN    One area of importance to transparency is the disclosure of basic government performance  information to the public. Simply publishing a lot of raw information in the public domain, such as  statistics and reports, does not constitute effective transparency nor does it aid accountability. To  support strong accountability to citizens the information provided by government must be accurate,  easily understood and timely. The advent of new communication tools and platforms over the past  decade, including the internet, has helped to make the government's mandate and activities more  transparent to citizens. It is now commonplace, for example, for Government ministries and entities to  have a website articulating their vision, mission and core responsibilities. Nevertheless, these  information and reporting platforms need to be maintained on a daily basis and new tools and  capabilities added, such as e-Government processes and social media tools for sharing information  In addition to basic information, there is significant room to improve the way in which information on  budget and finance is shared with the public, and performance data of relevance to citizens is  disclosed, such as graduation rates from schools and the successful treatments rates achieved by  hospitals and medical clinics in the national health system.         Another key area for transparency and accountability is the institutionalization of public consultation  mechanisms in the development of new policies. Recent major policy reviews, such as the  Privatization and National Integrity reviews, have involved public consultation mechanisms, as did the   process of developing Jordan 2025 (as outlined in the Introduction), including consultations between  government and business and civil society organizations as well as an open Call for Submissions  process. These methods for public consultation need to be institutionalized across Government in the   development of future plans and strategies.   The national media also play a vital role as the ‘fourth estate’ by using publicly available information  as the basis for commentary and investigative reporting to stimulate national debate and dialogue  about the major issues facing our country and the performance of the government in addressing those  challenges. A recent report prepared by the Jordan Media Institute (JMI), the new media fact checking  initiative supported by the King Abdullah Fund for Development and JMI, found that over 60% of news  stories published in the Kingdom’s newspapers were sourced from Petra and other press statements  issued by Government entities, civil society organizations and the private sector. This highlights both  the opportunity to leverage the nation’s newspapers to broadcast government information and the  need to strengthen the capacity of journalists to analyze, interpret and comment accurately on publicly  available information.   1.4.6 Resource Security and Management   Jordan faces significant national challenges due to the extreme scarcity of water, energy and arable  land assets coupled with rapidly increasing consumption trends. This has been compounded by a lack  of diversification in its sources for these key inputs (energy and food in particular), leaving the  economy vulnerable to external shocks.   Given consumption trends and Jordan’s plans for rapid economic expansion, demand is projected to  significantly outpace current supply levels. However, recent years have seen an expansion in projects related  to the diversification of energy sources, and initiatives related to strategic projects in the water sector.   1.4.6.1 Water Security   Jordan suffers from clear imbalance between water demand and available water resources. On the one hand,  the demand for water and sanitation services is unprecedented and growing while renewable water  resources are limited. This is accompanied by the overconsumption and over-pumping from the majority of  aquifers. The gap between demand and available supply has widened due to climate change; dam storage   and groundwater recharge have fallen, which led to decreasing per capita use to less than 135 m3 per year.   On the other hand, fiscal deficit in water and sanitation services has greatly increased as a result of the  stagnation of self-revenue generated from low tariff of domestic and agricultural water and high operational  costs due to the long distance of water sources to consumption centers. Moreover, the sector's revenues do  not cover its expense due to the high cost of finding and providing new non-traditional water sources, such   , the rising input prices, particularly electricity prices due to Jordan's dependence on importing more  than 96% of its energy needs and the hosting of large influxes of refugees by Jordan. Reports indicate that  the financial retum only covers two-thirds of service delivery cost, and that the sector losses have increased.  by 1% of GDP. Furthermore, future predictions show a growing deficit in the coming years.       sre  TAN    Water loss rate (water not paid for) is 41% as a result of the attacks on water networks and sources and  low efficiency of supply and distribution systems for domestic and industrial and agricultural  purposes due to financial inability to sustain them.   This situation has led to economic, social and political pressures. To prevent water from becoming an  obstacle to development, the government allocated more money to meet the growing demand for  water and to find additional water sources. Serious efforts have been made to ensure the sustainability  and maximum utilization of water and reduce waste of water, and therefore using water for  developmental purposes. In addition, legislation and laws have been passed to preserve water  resources, develop water sustainability strategies and distribute water equally across the Kingdom.  Jordan withdraws approximately 25-30% more water than its internal resources can provide. The  problem of scarcity is compounded by chronic inefficiency. The national water network is estimated to  lose approximately 41% of the available daily supply through leaks and theft from the network.  Keeping the current price of water to end users constant and assuming full usage and efficiency in the  distribution network, this water loss represents JD120 million of lost government revenue each year,  which represents 67% of the current revenues earned from water charges.   Despite severe scarcity, Jordan has been able to provide its people with high levels of water supply  and sanitation services whereby 97% of its urban and 91% of its rural population have access to water.  However, water supply is intermittent, with many households receiving water once a week. Sani  services cover 58% of the population. Although the efforts to boost supply, such as the Di  conveyance project, and stem losses from the system by reducing leaks and theft, are important,  can and should be done on the demand side to change consumption behaviors. The successful private  sector participation in the water sector (Wastewater Treatment Plant Project and the Disi Water  Conveyance Project) and commercial-based business through establishing water companies, have  contributed to increasing water security.                   Future plans include improving the sector's financial efficiency to ensure sustainable achievement of  sectoral goals of raising per capita domestic water consumption rate over the next ten years to about  445 liters/day, and increase the population connected to water networks to 95%. The Ministry will seek  to distribute water equally among the Kingdom's governorates and remote areas, and provide enough  water to meet the needs of economic, agricultural, industrial, tourism and trade sectors. Plans also  include increasing the population connected to sewage networks from 58% to 75% by 2025. With  regard to the reuse of treated wastewater, the Ministry seeks to increase the quantity to be used in  agricultural and industrial fields, so that 100% of treated water is used.   1.4.6.2 Energy Security   Jordan imports about 97% of its energy requirements, which includes mainly crude oil, oil derivatives  and natural gas. Local sources cover the remaining 3% of requirements with renewable energy  contributing only a small proportion to this mixture. In 2013, total primary energy consumed in Jordan  was about 8.2 million tons of oil equivalent, 82% of which are Crude oil and oil derivatives, 11% natural  gas, 3% renewable energy and imported electricity and 4% petroleum coke and coal.             ‘The high annual growth rates of demand for energy (5.5% for primary energy and 6.4% for demand for  electricity), compared to global levels is one of the Kingdom's most significant development  challenges. The influx of Syrian refugees into Jordan has increased the demand for energy and  electricity. Per capita primary energy consumption is 1250 Kilograms oil equivalent (kgoe), and per   capita share of electricity is 2230 kilowatt-hour (kWh), which are higher than in comparable developing  countries.   Energy consumption density was 208 kgoe per $1,000 of GDP, which is high compared to developed  economies where energy consumption density is about 150 kgoe per $1,000 at fixed prices.   The installed electricity generation capacity is currently 3900 MW. Work is underway to ensure  additional generation capacity by expanding power generation through special generation projects  ‘owned and funded by the private sector.             The national electricity grid for transmission and distribution has expanded to cover the Kingdom's  governorates and most rural and remote communities. The percentage of the population with  electricity supply reached 99.9% in 2013, which is similar to rates in advanced economies.  Electricity tariff rates for consumers are heavily subsidized at about 100% of consumer prices. To  address this imbalance, a national plan for the gradual removal of subsidies by increasing electricity  tariffs annually was approved so that by the end of 2017, full costs will be recovered and the Treasury  will stop subsidizing the electricity sector. Work is also underway to reduce electrical losses by 17%  on transmission and distribution networks.             In order to ease the burden of the energy sector on economic and social development, a  comprehensive national strategy is now being pursued to increase the contribution of local sources in  the total energy mix through a number of initiatives. The most important of these are expanding  renewable energy projects, activating energy efficiency programs, using oil shale as an alternative  resource for producing electricity and producing shale oil, using nuclear power as an alternative  energy source, further expanding the use of natural gas in power generation and promoting energy  interconnection projects between countries in the region to achieve greater energy security.   os  TAN    1.4.6.3 Food Security   Jordan imports 81% of its food requirements. This includes importation 63.4% of the Kingdom's  cereals requirements. Unlike energy supplies, Jordan’s portfolio of food supplies is reasonably well  diversified and the Kingdom has a three to twelve month strategic stockpile of basic commodities.  Nevertheless, Jordan is highly exposed to international commodity price fluctuations.   In 2014, the Kingdom imported about 600.000 tons per year of basic commodities, an increase of 11%  compared to 2013. Jordan's imports of sugar, rice, dry milk and vegetable oils were between 3% and 20%  compared to 2013. There is a three to twelve months strategic stock of basic commodities in the Kingdom.       Jordan imports wheat and barley throughout the year at an annual rate of between 1.6 and 4.5 million  tons to maintain the strategic reserves required to achieve a balance between imported and consumed  quantities and capacities of various storage sites. The Kingdom's consumption of wheat increased in  2014 by 21% compared to 2010. Its consumption of flour also increased since the beginning of this  year by 5,000 tons per month due to the population growth and the influx of Syrian refugees.       The most important challenges in this area are the fluctuation of international prices of basic food  commodities and the high consumption levels, which requires increasing local production and food  security requirements and expanding storage capacity in the Kingdom. Moreover, the population  increase due to the influx of more than a million and four hundred thousand Syrian refugees, in  addition to the Kingdom's population of about six million and seven hundred thousand people, led to  a significant increase in the consumption of food items. This places financial burdens on the  government, particularly in relation to bread; total subsidies for grains (wheat and feed) amounted to  about JD222 million in 2014.       With regard to energy and water prices, the government has worked hard to contain the impact of  commodity price shocks on households through price controls and subsidies. While Jordan continues  to review the subsidy reform policy in the next decade to direct support to those who deserve it and to  remove the distortions caused by subsidies, these measures should be addressed gradually, taking  into account the sources of income and the ability of the various segments of the society to adapt.       1.4.7 Infrastructure   According to the World Economic Forum, Jordan ranks comparatively well for the quality of its  infrastructure (38th out of 148 comparable economies). The road and air transport infrastructure,  electricity supply, and mobile phone networks are key strengths for future economic growth and  integration with regional and global markets.   Transportation infrastructure along road and air links is well developed, with plans to improve the  maritime and railway infrastructure. Jordan has an extensive 8,000 km road network spanning across  the Kingdom, connecting it with all its neighboring countries, The Port of Aqaba and the new Queen  Alia International Airport are the Kingdom's two major gateways to the rest of the world, and both are  undergoing significant upgrades in capacity and the quality of services provided.   In addition, other long-term infrastructure mega-projects, such as the Red-Dead Sea Canal and the  national rail network also offer more opportunities to significantly enhance the Kingdom's economic  security and resilience and improve Jordan's position as a hub for regional commerce.   It is clear that infrastructure projects are critical to enhancing the Kingdom's energy, water and food  security as well as stimulating private sector growth and trade expansion with the region and the  world. While the new projects recently delivered and those that are currently underway are  encouraging, the lesson learned from the last decade is that more forward planning is required as is  greater expertise in Government with respect to tendering and negotiation of Public Private  Partnership agreements for these types of megaprojects. Foreign investors are interested in coming  to Jordan and supporting the Kingdoms infrastructure development requirements, but they need a  stable legal and contractual framework. The new Investment Law and the Public-Private Partnership  Law are the legislative framework that will help to speed up the approval of projects and underpin  contractual obligations for major projects.   Oa  TAN    The transport sector is one of the important sectors on which focus should be placed and for which a  clear strategy should be developed, especially public transport as one of the critical priorities. In this  context, the long-term national transport sector strategy is an opportunity to consolidate the results  already achieved and to strengthen the modernization of the transport system to fully support economic  development in Jordan. The proposed strategy is a combination of regulatory measures (legislation and  regulations) and infrastructure projects designed to meet these challenges. It is noteworthy that there  are a number of important strategic projects to enhance the sector’s performance, both in public  transport- such as the Amman- Zarqa Bus Rapid Transit- and national rail network.   1.4.8 Macroeconomic Outcomes   Sound and sustainable finances are fundamental to the health of any economy. A steady sequence of  external shocks, including the Global Financial Crisis, the Arab Spring, the disruption of natural gas  supplies from Egypt and the pressures caused by the influx of Syrian refugees, have placed tremendous  pressure of the nation’s macro-economic fundamentals. Jordan's debt as a percentage of GDP is 83%.  The government budget deficit is unsustainably high, at about 8.3% of GDP for 2014,         The fiscal and current account deficits continue to put a major strain on all areas of the economy,  restricting the policy options available to the government. Nevertheless, the recent measures taken by  the government over the past two years have improved the sovereign credit rating of Jordan, according  to Standards & Poor's latest report on Jordan. There are certainly some external factors beyond our  control that constrain our ability to accelerate growth. Nonetheless, making real progress is an urgent  task, and we must proceed with further reforms in order to restore long-term fiscal sustainability,  notwithstanding the external environment.       ‘The Government has taken a number of difficult decisions and implemented several difficult reforms, for  which it received international recognition, including the lifting of fuel subsidies at the end of 2012. There  will be more difficult choices and reforms required over the coming decade, on both the revenue and  expenditure sides of the Government's accounts.       1.4.8.1 Government Revenue   The Government's revenue base today is highly dependent on indirect taxes, especially income tax,  rather than direct taxes. The charts below illustrate the composition of the government's revenue in  2013. The rate of growth in tax revenues as a percentage of GDP shows that government tax revenue has  been stagnant for a decade despite the growth in the economy. The new income tax law aims to improve  the government's revenue based on rates that are more socially accepted.

It is estimated that 50% of Jordanians of working age are  either actively seeking work but unemployed or working in the informal sector. That low level of  participation in the formal economy, combined with a high tax-free threshold on income, means that  ‘only 3% of Jordanians contribute to the income tax base of the Kingdom.   To offset the cost of living on Jordanian families and to encourage growth and job creation through the  private sector, the Government also grants a significant number of tax exemptions. Tax exemptions  granted to both individuals and corporate are estimated at more than JD834 million in foregone  revenue in 2013, or 2.5% of GDP. This requires a comprehensive review and a new approach to these  exemptions and how they are to be granted.   In addition to rates and approved exemptions, the capabilities and capacities of government tax  collection agencies are critical factors. As highlighted in the chart below, the enforcement of current  tax laws and regulations by revenue departments raises many question marks and erodes the  confidence of taxpayers in these departments. An estimated JD370 million in taxes due remained  unpaid in 2012 and tax evasion was estimated at JD750 in the same year. The financial reform plan,  which was recently adopted by the Council of Ministers and whose executive program will be  prepared, seeks to deal with these challenges in order to enhance the government's ability to increase  its revenue effectively and efficiently.

Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public spending and developing targeting systems that  take into account the social and economic environment in Jordan are important approaches to  achieving both social stability and financial sustainability. Better identification and targeting of the  poor and vulnerable families is essential to support those genuinely in need and prevent segments of  ‘our new and emerging middle classes from falling back into poverty. A combination of measures  implemented gradually over time will be required, including improved tax collection mechanisms,  application of the law, increased transparency and accountability and the replacement of consumption  subsidies by cash payments to those who need it the most.  Byten  TAN        ww  WAN   Chapter Two   Sox   SMA    2. Transforming our model of development   Jordan has experienced difficult and volatile conditions over the past decades. Nevertheless, ithas achieved  several important accomplishments although regional conditions were not conducive to planning for the  future, Developing a vision for 2025 will be extremely difficult due to several changes. However, there is  consensus on the need to strengthen the internal social and economic situation, develop the policies, and  identify the initiatives that strengthen the society and economy, as well as the ability to reflect on and deal  with the emerging issues, in order to achieve development. The assessment of the current situation clearly  shows that a significant progress has been made over the past decade in improving the welfare of average  Jordanian families, reducing poverty and achieving equality in society. This progress, however, has not been  accompanied by an improvement of the Jordanian economy's competitiveness. As a result, these gains  remain vulnerable to being overturned because of the current weaknesses and the relative decline in the  competitiveness of the business environment in Jordan.       There is no doubt that given the current financial pressures on our economy and its people and the  elevated and continuing level of insecurity and conflict in our region, Vision 2025 is ambitious. However,  as His Majesty has said, Jordan has proven time and time again throughout its history that our people  are resilient and resourceful. As we have throughout our history, we must continue to pull together as a  nation despite the challenges and obstacles in our path to achieve the levels of wellbeing and prosperity  we aspire to for all Jordanians and the peace and security we would like to see across our region.   The prosperity of every Jordanians family ultimately comes from the opportunities generated by a  dynamic and competitive economy in which all citizens participate through employment and  entrepreneurship. What is clear from the ‘Jordan Today’ assessment is that we have made  considerable progress over the past decade in improving the wellbeing of the average Jordanian  family and reducing poverty and inequality across our society, but that progress has not been  achieved on the basis of a more dynamic and competitive economy. As a result hard-won gains of the  recent past are now at risk of being lost because of the current weaknesses and vulnerabilities in our  national finances and the declining overall competitiveness of our business environment.       As the chart below shows, the competitiveness of Jordan's economy has deteriorated relative to other  economies. Our central challenge over the next decade must be to reverse this decline. By building a  more competitive economy, we will create the jobs Jordanians aspire to and achieve inclusive and  sustainable prosperity and progress in individual and household income.

As many commentators and stakeholders pointed out throughout the  consultation process to develop Jordan 2025, the challenge is more of achieving effective and  disciplined implementation rather than knowing ‘what to do’. Over the past decade, the government,  the private sector, civil society associations, donor organizations, Royal Commissions and think tanks  have produced many plans and strategies articulating ‘what to do’.      These include, for example, the National Agenda (2005), the National Education Strategy (2006), the  National Employment Strategy (2012), the Privatization Committee report (2013), the Higher Education  Strategy (2013), the Public ‘Sector Development Strategy and Government Executive, Programs  (2014-2016) and'the National Integrity Commission outputs (2013). These initiatives and many others  ave accurately diagnosed Jordan’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, and made   many sound recommendations. Nonetheless, the central challenge we have faced over the past ten  years has been implementation: how to stay on course with agreed plans and strategies and complete  all required tasks and activities at a high standard of excellence, on time and within budget.       ere  wATe    Figure 26: Expected Public Debt to GDP Ratio  according to the Targeted Scenario   Expected Public Debt to GDP Ratio According to the Targeted Scenario       s e e s    e a e    &   Pub lie   D ebt   t o G  DP  R  ati o      204 2015 —«016.=«207=«aNG_=S=«I=«200« HOON       With regard to the structural composition of GDP, the cont n of the indust sector in GDP is   expected to increase to 27.4%, compared to the current contribution of 22.4%.

Therefore, due to the small size of our local economy, it cult to deliver high-quality sustainable  growth and create the number and quality of jobs needed to employ Jordanians over the next decade  and beyond. Accordingly, Jordan’s economy must be export-oriented, to be able to compete and  innovate in order to attract investments into Jordan to serve markets throughout our region and  produce high-quality goods and services. This is a basic requirement to drive growth which will in turn  create jobs and higher household incomes for Jordanian families.              Like other small economies, configuring our economic system for export success in this way is a big  challenge. Over the past decade the Kingdom's overall export performance has been disappointing,  growing at just 1.7% per year between 2004 and 2013 (Jordan Department of Statistics, 2013). Export  growth has trailed overail GDP growth, and the current account balance has widened substantially,  although in large part this is a result of a forced increase in energy imports due to regional instability.  With limited natural and financial resources, our key asset is the skill and ingenuity of the Jordanian  people. Ultimately, the private sector must be the central engine to achieve economic activity at home  and encourage exports. Our business leaders and entrepreneurs should make decisions about what  products we can manufacture at home for export purposes and the expertise we can sell to others as  services, such as IT solutions, tourism, healthcare and education. The ultimate test for our businesses.  ~ and our economy ~ is why customers overseas will buy from Jordan as opposed to somewhere else.  For example:   + Why will hospitals in GCC countries buy pharmaceutical products from Jordan instead of from India?   + Why will some countries continue to import phosphate from Jordan instead of from another  phosphate producing country?   + Why will European and Asian tourists choose to visit Jordan instead of somewhere else in  the region of comparable natural and historical interest?   + Why will students from around the Arab and Muslim world choose to come to Jordan for  higher education studies instead of somewhere else in the region or beyond?   The government has a vital role to play in creating the enabling environment for our private sector to grow  and compete successfully on the regional and global stage, and developing a sound fiscal and monetary  policy as a pre-condition for investment. Rules, regulations and instructions must be clear, predictable and  efficient so as not to impose undue cost and uncertainty on business decisions.   Governments have a powerful ‘toolbox’ for supporting economic and social development. They can create or  change laws and regulations, impose fines, allocate land, promote companies abroad through embassies  and trade delegations and take many other actions. Nevertheless, \"our\"’system”of \"Government\" will”always  have\"limited\"financial\"resources.” As such, it needs to make choices about how to deploy its resources in  order to best support the growth of the economy.   With the objective of building a more competitive export-oriented economy in mind, it is vital for the  economic development strategy of the country to be clear about two key drivers for export success:   + Which countries should be, in the long term, our largest and most important priority markets  for Jordanian exports?       + What goods and services are we well-placed to competitively develop in Jordan, given our existing  capabilities and resources, and successfully and sustainably export them to those priority markets?   2.1 Priority Export Markets   ‘Small, open and export-oriented economies are typically most successful when they become integral to the  trade and investment flows of their surrounding region. MENA economies, including Jordan, are not nearly as  integrated into their regional economy as are those in Asia and Europe. Intra-regional trade flows in MENA are  extremely low in global terms: 11% compared to 5% in Asia and 74% in the EU.         While the current conflict in the region will continue to constrain the growth of intra-regional trade and  investment, Jordan must look beyond the immediate regional crisis. The fact that intra-regional trade is so low  across the MENA region represents a tremendous opportunity for Jordan. The following figure shows the  regional market of interest to Jordan, which represents USS 3.8 trillion market comprising 380 million consumers.       SET  PNG    Figure 28: Jordan’s Regional Market   Jordan’s Regional Market — USD 3.8 Trillion and 380 Million Consumers       Source: World Bank   Given its geographic location at the intersection between the Levant and the GCC, Jordan has the   potential to become a hub for investment into the Levant and upper Gulf. Within this total regional  market, there are four distinct opportunities for Jordan:       * First, the stable GCC economies.   + Second, the economies of the Palestinian Territories,   + Third, the larger but less stable markets of Iraq, Syria, Egypt and Libya.   + Fourth, the large ‘over the horizon’ markets or Turkey and Iran.   Jordan can play this regional hub role if we can create a business environment that is significantly  superior to our near neighbors, and if our political stability remains a real and differentiated advantage  as it is today. As highlighted in the figure below, Jordan has already also established an edge as an  export hub to the large adjacent markets of Iraq and Syria based on cost and time to market. This must  be further improved and Jordan's commercial, transport and logistics capabilities - the port in Aqaba,  the new Abdali business district, the new Queen Alia International Airport and Jordan's road networks  into adjacent markets — need to be fully leveraged.   wu  wae    Figure 29: Export Competitiveness   Export Competitiveness  Cos to export 2014, in USD per container “Tine o export 2014 in days   Selected Regional & Peer Countries Selected Regional & Peer Countries  Snzaore  dal        Source: World Bank, Ease of Doing Business 2014   2.2 Priority Clusters to Drive Growth and Create Jobs   Over the past two decades Jordan has established several significant industries in the economy which  anchor private-sector economic activity. As the Kingdom looks ahead to the next decade, the  Government's role is to facilitate the consolidation and expansion of our existing areas of strength,  ‘such as mining and pharmaceuticals, and encourage the build-out of competitive ‘clusters’ of related  and supporting industries to drive growth and job creation. This requires both careful analysis of the  emerging needs and demands of our domestic economy and regional neighbors. It also requires  creative thinking and some carefully chosen and well managed strategic bets. The criteria for deciding  where to disproportionately invest Government policy attention and available resources should be  clusters with the following characteristics:       + Attractive demand characteristics in the domestic and regional economy.   + Adjacent to, or building off, existing areas of strength.   + Where Jordan can build and hold a sustainable position of competitive advantage over the  medium to long term.   + High potential for creating jobs for Jordanians.   + Domestic and regional demand for products.   iigh export potential.       + Sustainable competitive advantage in the medium and long term to provide job opportunities.  for Jordanians and contribute to bridging the development gap between governorates.   This last criterion, job creation for Jordanians, is particularly important. Some of the economy's  fastest growing industries, most notably construction, have exhibited strong demand characteristics,  but have failed to generate meaningful and sustainable jobs for Jordanians. Forty-one percent of the  workforce in the construction industry, for example, is comprised of foreign workers, many of them  undocumented workers in the informal sector who are therefore not contributing to the nation’s tax  base and not adequately protected with healthcare and other social safety nets.   With these prioritization criteria in mind, the illustration below highlights the clusters that have been identified  through research, analysis and consultation as high-potential priority clusters for the next decade.       sits    Figure 30: Existing, Emerging and High Potential Clusters for Growth       Bia asain   2.3 Building on Existing Strengths   2.3.1 Construction and Engineering Cluster   Jordan’s rapid economic development and economic openness has led to a significant influx of capital  into the construction sector, which has benefited from an efficient and well-capitalized banking sector  and very high amount of building and construction activity in recent years. There is an opportunity to  grow and expand this cluster as Jordan becomes a regional hub for events and logistics, thus driving  further commercial business activity, which requires more real estate assets and services.               Building and construction now accounts for 10% of GDP and it is one of the fastest growing sectors in  Jordan, Despite a significant slowdown during 2011-2013, the number of construction permits issued  in Jordan has almost doubled in 2014, This cluster is also a major employer, employing roughly 85,000  Jordanians, although it is estimated that 60.000 jobs are held by nonJordanians. This represents a  ‘major opportunity to employ more Jordanians if perceptions of the jobs in this cluster can be changed  and greater vocational training provided to prepare Jordanians for the higher-skill segments of thi  cluster, while following the recommendations of the National Employment Strategy.                      In order to develop and position Jordan as a regional hub for architectural and engineering services,  this cluster must access engineering contracting work for construction projects in the Gulf region and  Levant countries.   The MENA market is estimated to have $2.5 trillion of construction permits, represents a huge  ‘opportunity for Jordanian companies to increase exports, along with that of related clusters, such as  transport and logistics.   Within this cluster and given the regional security situation and the rapid growth in defense and  military spending in the region, Jordan could also look to expand light equipment manufacturing in the  defense sector. The capabilities already established at the King Abdullah Design and Development  Bureau (KADDB) provide the nucleus of a potentially high-value cluster of related and supporting firms  servicing the defense equipment market in the region, based on qualified engineering professionals in  Jordan. Highly skilled vocational jobs can also be created downstream in the area of machinery and  equipment manufacturing.       sfu  AN    2.3.2 Transport and Logistics Cluster   Jordan's central location between the Levant and GCC has driven exceptional growth in the air transport  and logistics sector in recent years. This sector is now one of Jordan's largest employers. A significant  opportunity exists to continue to develop into a regional hub, leveraging the newly expanded Queen Alia  International Airport, ongoing expansion of Aqaba port and Jordan’s extensive road networks into  adjacent markets.   Diplomatic and Humanitarian Logistics Services Jordan should look to leverage its international standing  and soft power to establish the Kingdom as the preferred humanitarian logistics and diplomatic services  hub for the region. Expansions of both Queen Alia International Airport and Aqaba Port will provide new  excellent air and sea transport and logistics hubs for access by the global humanitarian community,  donors and UN agencies. The quality of Jordan's road network ensures rapid time-to-market to reach  affected communities both across the border to Syria or to many nearby refugee camps and settlements  within Jordan. Further investment in warehousing and cold chain logistics could consolidate Jordan's  capabilities to support humanitarian activities.      Amman is already a starting point to several thousand diplomats, UN officials, aid workers and their  families. This requires increasing investment in livability proposition for foreign expatriates particularly  schools and family-friendly recreational activities - and developing Amman could as a preferred station  for diplomats, UN officials and foreign aid workers.           2.3.3 Tourism and Events Cluster   The tourism sector in Jordan has long been seen as having a number of unique and differentiated  competitive advantages, not least the country’s many valuable tourist sites of high historical, religious  and heritage importance. In spite of the huge potential of the Jordanian tourism sector, its contribution   in the Jordanian economy is still imited due to the political instability ongoing across the region. Further  progress also needs to be made in establishing the concept of balanced development of the sector and  taking full advantage of tourism’s potential across the various governorates of the Kingdom.       While regional instability has adversely affected foreign tourism volumes into Jordan, the number of Arab  tourists, especially GCC citizens, has increased substantially due to the perceived insecurity of other Arab  destinations. In addition, the specialized tourist services in Jordan that cater to the needs of this category  of tourists, such as family, medical and wellness tourism, are significant given the reputation of the  Kingdom's healthcare sector and the opportunity to integrate treatment with recuperative care and spa  treatments, Medical and wellness tourism is forecast to triple between 2014 and 2017.       Tourism currently provides only around 50,000 Jordanian jobs, representing 6% of the total  ‘employment in the various economic sectors. There is a big opportunity to improve the ability of the  tourism sector to increase the employment rate to global averages, estimated at about 18% given its  ability to create more job opportunities.          This increase should include all the Kingdom's governorates. In this context, it is necessary to take  measures that would increase job-generating tourism investments, develop the education and training  system in various tourist areas and replace foreign labor with Jordanian tabor as much as possible.  In order to develop Jordan's tourism sector, the efforts that are being made by the concerned  authorities, particularly the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, should be continued, by developing  the various tourism subsectors in Jordan, such as the religious tourism, continuing to creating new  tourist routes and developing those already existing in various governorates of the Kingdom and  offering various tourist services in these areas.           Atthe intersection of Jordan's attractiveness as a tourist destination and its potential positioning as a  regional diplomatic and humanitarian hub sits conferences and events. The ongoing expansion of  Jordan's 5-star hotel market and unique world-class facilities such as the King Hussein Conference  Centre at the Dead Sea mean that the basic MICE infrastructure is already in place. Jordan is already  host to World Economic Forums and major international industry conferences but could win a greater  share of the regional MICE market.   2.3.4 Healthcare Cluster   The healthcare sector in Jordan has excellent reputation both regionally and globally. It exploits the  abundance of highly qualified doctors and nurses and high investment in healthcare infrastructure. It  accounts for 5% of Jordan’s GDP and has achieved an international reputation.   A number of factors in the short to medium term will continue to drive growth in the industry. These  include the high levels of domestic healthcare spending (7.6% of GDP), high levels of insurance cover  for the Jordanian population, the large number of Syrian refugees and the established reputation of  Jordan as a destination-of-choice for medical treatment.   ‘The sector produces a significant amount of jobs, estimated at 55,000, which are also generally high-skilled  Jobs. Job growth has been slow, but it is expected to increase in line with an expanded wellness tourism  industry. Medical and wellness tourism is a particularly attractive opportunity for Jordan given its unique\"  combination of high-quality medical facilities and unique wellness assets such as the Dead Sea.      wt    2.3.5 Life Sciences Cluster   Jordan's internationally competitive pharmaceuticals manufacturing industry is one of Jordan's most  established and fastest-growing industries, growing at 25% per year in recent years. It constitutes.  Jordan's third-largest export product group after fertilizers and apparel. The MENA market for  pharmaceuticals is estimated at $ 8 billion per year with Jordan's industries currently capturing only  around 6% of that market. This suggests significant room for expansion of Jordanian exports across.  the region.       Employment in this industry remains low (about 8.000 jobs), as it is a capital- intensive activity,  however, this figure is growing at 10% per year and many firms said they plan to expand their  operations in Jordan.       The combination of a globally competitive pharmaceuticals industry and excellent medical faci  provides a strong foundation upon which to build-out a broader life sciences cluster, including clinical  trial services, biotechnology research and product development. Jordan has one of the highest rates  of physicians per capita in the world. Having clinical trial centres is an essential step for  pharmaceutical innovation, which could contribute to diversifying local pharmaceutical industry  beyond drug manufacturing             2.3.6 Digital and business services cluster        The availability of skilled workers, developed infrastructure and the strategic location of Jordan have  made ICT and Business Services a core sector in Jordan. The telecommunications market in Jordan is.  mature, with a mobile penetration rate of 147% in proportion to the population, and the sector is filled  with innovative software developers, service providers and start-ups.   The ICT sector needs to be highly export oriented because domestic demand will remain modest due to  the predominance of SMEs who are largely unable to absorb high value added ICT products or related  business services. The critical challenge for the sector is helping Jordanian ICT companies in accessing  regional export opportunities. The demand for ICT services in MENA is expected to reach $120 billion  over the next two years.   This sector provides, directly or indirectly, a significant number of job opportunities for Jordanians  {about 80,000 jobs in 2013). Direct job opportunities were about 16,000 in 2013. However, employment in  the sector has contracted recently, shrinking by about 2.5% annually between 2007 and 2013, due to the  export of talent and expertise that has taken place, particularly to GCC countries, in addition to the forced  reduction of employees by companies due to technological developments in the sector.   As the size of the middle class in the GCC grows, spending on consumer goods and tourism has  expanded substantially, which has driven associated demand for payment processing, customer service  support and back-office operations support. Jordan is potentially uniquely placed in the region to  provide these services, given its current comparative advantage of bilingual (Arabic-English)  well-educated youth, who are well suited to serving the countries of the region. These Business Process.  Outsourcing (BPO) operations are potentially also well suited for young, skilled Jordanian women, and  could thereby contribute to increasing female participation in the workforce in Jordan.   2.3.7 Educational Services Cluster   Jordan has traditionally had a very high-performing higher education sector and a strong reputation  across much of the Arab World. In addition, Jordan’s climate and political stability make it uniquely  attractive place for Arab youth to live in and study. Nevertheless, the quality of higher education  ‘outcomes has flattened in recent years. No Jordan-based university is currently ranked in the top 500  universities worldwide, while the GCC countries are investing heavily in building a developed tertiary  education sector through partnerships with world-renowned education institutions.               This sector has significant potential to become an economic growth driver with very good job creation  characteristics, but Jordan will need to focus on raising the quality of its educational institutions through  demanding standards of excellence, new investment and public private partnerships with leading  international institutions.   Despite the low enrollment of Jordanians in vocational training, this sector is set for significant growth  given the unemployment rate and youth unemployment problems across the region. Given its existing  higher education infrastructure and transport connections, there is no reason why Jordan could not  become a vocational training hub and content development centre-of-excellence for the Arab World.       Bg  WAN    2.3.8 Financial Services Cluster   The financial sector in Jordan is stable and efficient thanks to the continuous improvement in the  performance of its institutions and the quality and comprehensiveness of its services, which indicates  the financial depth of this sector in comparison with countries in the region. At the end of 2013, the  contribution of the financial and insurance services sector in GDP was about 11.5%, and the ratio of  licensed bank assets to GDP was nearly 180%. This is an indication of the comprehensiveness of  banking services and the important role of banks in the development of other economic sectors.             Nevertheless, the utilization of these services is still modest and needs to be expanded. Furthermore,  ancial and banking products need to be diversified to meet the needs of institutions and individuals   and stay in line with developments in more advanced financial services markets.       The financial services sector has always been one of the vital sectors of the national economy.  Therefore, there is a need to intensify efforts aimed at further expanding its activities by creating the  infrastructure necessary to facilitate broader and better access for all Jordanians to financial services,  especially in remote areas, and improve access to finance, particularly for micro, small and medium.  enterprises that will play an active and vital role in the inclusive and sustainable development of Jordan.  In this area, the new programs (Jordan Loan Guarantee Corporation) and the establishment of Credit  Information Company will have an important role in speeding up credit grant decisions, improving  access to loans for productive sectors, in particular SMEs and reducing credit risk. Moreover, spreading  financial and banking awareness and the development of payment and settlement systems will help  expand financial services and enhance customer protection. In addition, expanding the scope of work of  the Deposit Insurance Corporation to include Islamic banks and activating its role in the banking  protection network will have an active role in deepening confidence in the banking system and  stimulating the financial services in the market.         The existence of a developed financial market helps promote and encourage local investment, develop  financial services, raise the efficiency of the investment process and increase the effectiveness of the  performance of saving and investment funds. Strengthening and expanding the umbrella of the social  protection network and raising insurance awareness about Social Security will have a positive impact on  promoting investment activity in the financial services sector and providing insurance services for many  categories of the society. Furthermore, improving the efficiency of the insurance sector, diversifying its  products and publicizing the benefits of investment in this sector will contribute in expanding its  activities from the local market to the regional markets and positioning Jordan as a regional insurance  hub, especially in light of the growing unrest in the region.   2.4 The Importance of Agility: Openness to New Opportunities and Trends         Given the pace of technological change, the rapid changes in global financial markets and the  uncertainty of the regional security outlook, new risks and opportunities will emerge which will inform  whether these clusters remain the right ones to focus government policy attention and incentives on or  whether adjustments are required. Jordanian businesses and entrepreneurs are best placed to spot  risks and opportunities in the global market, Regular dialogue between the public and private sector will  ensure that national policy settings towards sector and cluster development can adjust in line with  changing market dynamics.   2.4.1 How to Create Inclusive Growth and Achieve Prosperity        Although we have made significant progress over the past decade, significant challenges lie ahead as  we seek to achieve greater and better quality prosperity for all Jordanians. What is clear from the  trajectory of our development over the past decade is that recent prosperity gains have not been based  ‘on improvements in competitiveness. This is not a sound footing upon which to strive to achieve  inclusive and sustainable growth. At the heart of a new development model must be a candid admission  that simply di  doing things.       1g more of the same will not achieve our as|       tions. We need to embrace new ways of       that paves the way for a new start, based on first determining the  \\les for collective action - the consensus basis upon which all Jordanians agree to move forward   collectively to achieve our shared goals and aspirations we have as a nation.      There are seven core principles embedded in Jordan 2025. Together, these principles should serve all of  us -\" as\" citizens,\" public” officials,\" private” sector\" employees, \"civil\"society\"leaders\"~ as our guiding  star for our economic and social development journey over the next decade and beyond,      DES  STAN    Figure 31: Jordan’s Principles for Collective Action for 2025   Jordan 2025 Principles for Collective Action   Law Abiding   Institutionalized 7, Meritocratio.   siicnamZe OS   WAG exes tasters   Participatory   2.4.1.1 Rule of Law: From Avoidance to Adherence   The importance of the rule of law to all Jordanians citizens was highlighted earlier. Rule of faw in an  institutionalized and consistent manner is critical for citizens and investors to have confidence that  disputes will be resolved through a fair and efficient process and contracts will be enforced as agreed.  Trust is difficult to secure and is easily lost. In the absence of trust in the rule of law and the fairness  of regulations that are supposed to regulate the relationship between society members, we end up in  a vicious cycle of low trust as illustrated below. When trust in the law is low and compliance is weak,  the government typically responses by introducing new and tougher regulations to try to force better  compliance. However, this often leads to further constraining citizens and businesses.       At the core of our national development challenge is transforming from a society whose confidence in  the rule of low is relatively low towards a society with a high level of trust and confidence among  citizens that the law will be applied equally and without bias. Jordan 2025 identifies a number of  specific initiatives and actions aimed at building a higher-trust society as the basis for improving  confidence and belief in the rule of law.   Based on the recommendations of the National Integrity System, these initiatives include:   + Improving the transparency and accessibility of government information — so that  citizens can be better informed about what government is doing and how taxpayer money is.  being spent on their behalf.   + Institutionalizing public consultation mechanisms - to give citizens the chance to have  their voice heard on major policy issues.   + Investing in the improvement of the capabilities of regulatory agencies to promote  law enforcement- to ensure that the government has the tools it needs to enforce the law  properly and not sporadically or indiscriminately.   + Improving the communication of government decisions and regulatory changes ~to  enable citizens and businesses to understand the changes and prepare themselves to adapt  to new developments.”       The outputs, recommendations and executive programs of the Integrity Committee are an appropriate  roadmap to enhance confidence in the rule of law and seek to achieve the desired social justice.   wu    Figure 32: Social Trust and the Rule of Law   Social Trust and the Rule of Law as the Basis for Governance                        Sree eat  HIGH Compliance  Ses ee   Vicious Cycle   2.4.1.2 Meritocracy —- From Wasta and Favoritism to Equal Opportunity   In both the private and public sector, Jordanians continue to perceive that wasta is the critical success  factor, both in terms of obtaining employment and securing preferential treatment by government  entities. When asked, “What are the key deciding factors in obtaining a job in the public and  private sectors,?,” 21% of Jordan youth responded that “wasta” is the most important factor, while  another 50% of respondents answered that “wealth” or “social relations”. Just 26% responded that  “personal merit” was the most important factor in securing a job.   A system that does not reward personal merit will not incentivize our youth to put in the effort and  determination required to excel in their studies as the next generation of entrepreneurs and employees  in our workforce. Opportunities to access jobs and to move up the career ladder must be equalized in  order to change this incentive structure.         Transforming the incentive structure will require a change in deeply engrained attitudes and beliefs, and  will therefore take time. However, many of the systems and structure of public administration have come  to create an ‘un-level playing field’. For example, the tertiary education system has also become an  un-evel playing field because a significant percentage of university positions are assigned to sons and  daughters of particular types of employees in the public sector. As a result, students who may have  worked harder and earned better grades are denied a position in their preferred course. The same thing  applies to the labor market in the public and private sectors.   Jordan 2025 includes a number of initiatives designed to help address important social and economic  development priorities in a way that also ‘levels the playing field’. These initiatives include:   + Establishing a unified and universal national health insurance system that is not  linked to employment but available to all Jordanians. This will not only enhance the healthcare  coverage provided to all Jordanians but also neutralize one of the areas of perceived difference  between the merits of public sector over private sector employment.   + Reforming the university and vocational training admissions process, so that  entry into university is based fundamentally on merit and that young students in need of  financial assistance are still supported but through alternate mechanisms linked to their  successful graduation from higher education rather than their preferential entry into a   i or vocational college.      * Linking public sector pay rises and promotions to good performance assessments  and successful completion of minimum, mandatory and certified training requirements, so that  hardworking and competent civil servants can be confident that their efforts dedication will be rewarded.   * Phasing out tax exemptions and concessions, to ensure that our businesses are able  to compete on fair and equal terms within their industry and able to calculate the true cost.   wire  TAN        2.4.1.3 Participatory - From Culture of Entitlement to Active Citizenship   The government in Jordan has historically taken a very expansive role in caring for citizens, primarily by  trying to mitigate external impacts on the cost of living for households. This has typically taken the form of  management of supply of critical goods and subsidies to cushion the impact of unexpected price increases.       However, the nation’s finances can no longer support government policy setting focused on  controlling the ‘cost’ side of the household ledger. Instead, government policy must shift emphasis to  focus on enabling all Jordanians to increase the income side of the household ledger, through  employment and entrepreneurship. In other words, the government must increasingly focus on  policies — in education and labour markets in particular — that ensure all Jordanians are equipped with  valuable skills and a mindset for success to help them enter the workforce and by ensuring that the  business environment and labour markets are as competitive and transparent as possible.       This shift in policy, from trying to control and contain the cost of living to enabling the economic rights  and income-earning potential of citizens, through education and training investments, is one of the  most fundamental requirements for the Kingdom's future. It is therefore at the heart of this Jordan  2025 plan. Macroeconomic model conducted as part of the development of Jordan 2025 clearly  highlighted that the biggest driver of improvements in national wealth and household prosperity is  boosting participation in the formal economy by Jordanians men and women.       In line with the principle of participation and consistent with the principle of meritocracy, Jordan 2025  reiterates the need for the ongoing and full implementation of the National Employment Strategy and  other measures designed to accelerate as fast as possible job creation and workforce participation.  This is a formidable challenge given that Jordan currently has one of the lowest workforce  participation rates in the world and the regional security context is currently constraining the ability of  the economy to grow through exports and investment. But it must remain our central focus.  The specific initiatives in Jordan 2025 aimed at boosting participation include:”       jignificant expansion of vocational training - including active measures to channel more  young Jordanians into vocational rather than academic higher education. It is proposed to achieve this  scaling-up of the vocational training. sector through Public Private Partnerships (PPP) with  best-in-class international providers of vocational training linked to the priority economic clusters that  have been identified. An approach of embracing PPPs will mean that Jordan not only benefit from  investment in new and improved facilities, but also world-class content through teacher training  methods and curricula, as well as the opportunity to certify Jordanian vocational graduates with  internationally recognized qualifications.         + Deeper and more transparent job vacancy market- so that young Jordanians have easy and  transparent access to job vacancies rather than relying on friends and family networks to find opportunities.   + Expansion of career counseling services at universities, schools and labour departments —  to help raise the awareness of school and university age Jordanians about different career paths and  ‘employment opportunities in the workforce.       * Continuation of career fairs and recruiting events - organized by, and linked closely to, the  priority clusters for development identified earlier.   * Institutionalization of partnership with the sector’s representative institutions to undertake  their responsibilities of reducing employments by establishing units to perform these tasks.   2.4.1.4 Excellence — From locally accepted quality levels to global best practice   The strongest lever for driving the ambition and performance of a nation is to set high and demanding  standards of excellence. Standards of excellence are already a part of everyday life.   + As citizens, we expect that the cars we purchase and drive have passed rigorous safety  standards before they can be sold.   + We expect restaurants and cafes to abide by hygiene standards and protocols so that we do  not get sick.   + We would not fly overseas if we were not confident that the aircraft had been maintained to  the highest standards of safety and that the pilots have met or exceeded their required  number of hours to maintain their pilots’ licenses.   There are however many aspects in our economic system and daily social life in which standards of  excellence either do not exist, are not rigorous enough or exist but are not enforced. We should  embrace higher standards of excellence and strive.   Se  AG    to meet or exceed those standards of excellence through training, and when necessary, through  enforcement It is possible to identify and adopt international best-practice standards in most aspects of  daily life and our economic system. Adopting international standards not only saves time and cost, but  also speaks to our ambition and aspirations as a society and as a country. There is no doubt that trying to  achieve those standards will be difficult and, in some cases, take many years, but our economy and society  will become stronger and more resilient even as we move towards achieving international best practice.            Many companies and government institutions advertise having won excellence certifications as a mark  of their quality and excellence. Jordan had only 39 ISO registered companies in 2013, versus 1,119 in the  UAE and 7,186 in Hungary. These 39 companies represent just 0.03% of all firms in Jordan. In addition,  the National Export Strategy has concluded that most small and medium-sized enterprises are unable to  benefit from bilateral trade agreements because their standards are not sufficient to access major  European and MENA markets, despite the lack of trade barriers working to our advantage.  Specific initiatives in Jordan 2025 to pursue excellence include:       * Provide tax credits for companies that successfully achieve international  certification for their company or their products and services. This will help to  offset the cost of training and compliance that companies incur in applying for certification.  Tax credits will only be granted upon documented evidence of successful certification and for  a specific period.   + Extensive use Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) across infrastructure, vocational  training and selected social service provision areas to provide not just finance to support our  development, but more importantly to import with them international best practice standards,  including in the form of training curricula and certification processes to improve the skills of  Jordanians workers for the future.   + Mandate that a number of government entities secure internationally  accredited certification to help strengthen public institutions. This will equire a dedicated  program, linked to other initiatives in Jordan 2025, to upgrade facilities, systems and  processes and staff training,   + Strengthen the capacities of the Ministry of Public Sector Development/  Institute of Public Administration to help government institutions achieve international  standards.       + Strengthen the capacities the King Abdullah Center for Excellence (KACE)  as the nation’s principal advocate and independent evaluator of standards of excellence  achievement across the public and private sectors.   Transparency is a vital component, indeed a pre-requisite, for excellence. Transparency is also the best  mechanism for boosting accountability, generating confidence at all levels and making ambitious  commitments that require active and hard work to achieve.   Jordan 2025 includes a number of important transparency ini       ives, including:   * The development of public reporting systems for the disclosure of outcomes  achieved in certain public services areas such as education and health, thereby  enabling citizens so see the results (outcomes) that are being achieved’ against  pre-determined standards of excellence, whether learning outcomes for their children or  treatment outcomes achieved by their local hospital.       * Publication of annual reports of pul institutions, in a timely manner to help media  and citizens evaluate the outputs produced and the outcomes achieved from the spending of  public money by each government entity.   + Publication of progress reports on the implementation of Jordan 2025 through  www.plan.gov,jo over the next 10 years.   2.4.1.5 Competitive — From a small domestic economy to a dynamic regional hub       Jordan is a small country with d resources and a young and still rapidly growing population.  These limitations mean that Jordan must become a regional hub for trade and investment and a  successful export nation. As outlined above, Jordan is located at the geographic heart of a regional  economy worth over USS 3 trillion with 380 consumers.         ‘To achieve this aspiration, in the short to medium term, Jordan 2025 includes the following recommendations:   + Develop priority industry clusters as outlined earlier, including by updating the  industrial pol cy, for 2015-2018. To increase the international competitiveness of the domestic  clusters identified earlier so that they can become successful exporters of goods and services.        * Develop the services sector by adopting and implementing the inclusive plan for the  development of services sector and creating a national database for services trade.   xr  AN    + Launch cluster coordination committees under the National Competitiveness and  Innovation Council, to accelerate the process of cluster formation among related and supporting  industries and to strengthen public-private collaboration in each priority cluster. These committees  will be comprised of chambers of industry and commerce,” sectoral business associations and  government representatives. Their tasks will include developing mechanisms necessary for cluster  networking and directing vocational education and training institutions to support workforce  development needs of their cluster.       + Intensify initiatives aimed at enhancing and developing the competitiveness of SMEs,  promoting the culture of entrepreneurship and innovation by adopting the National Strategy to  Encourage Entrepreneurship and develop micro, small and medium enterprises 2015-2019 and  accelerating reforms of the regulatory and legal environment, such as adopting the Law on Small and  Medium Enterprises. Moreover, the ability of small and medium enterprises to access finance should  be strengthened and their entrepreneurial and managerial skills should be improved. This must be  accompanied by narrowing the gap between the outputs of vocational education and training and the  heeds of the labor market in an integrated manner with both the National Education Strategy and the  National Employment Strategy and the National Strategy for Science and Innovation.       + Accelerate and deepen export promotion capabilities and support programs and position  Jordan as a regional hub for trade and logistics by updating trade policy 2015-2018, and opening  new markets for Jordanian products and services, raise their quality and maximize their benefits from  free trade agreements signed by the Kingdom. In order to enable Jordan to take advantage from its,  geographic location and competitive advantages to become a regional trade hub, trade facilitati  measures should be developed and improved, including the infrastructure of transport, logistics and  free zones, import procedures should be facilitated, examination measures should be standardized  and storage capacity should be increased.             + Increase efforts to improve business environment for Jordanian companies and create  investment opportunities to be distributed to the Kingdom's governorates by developing a  hational investment strategy for the next ten years, further improving the Kingdom's investment  climate, developing legislation governing the business environment and investment to strengthen  investors’ confidence and providing the needed infrastructure, including increasing the spread of  industrial cities in all the Kingdom’s governorates.   + Strengthen the National Competition Policy and consumer protection mechanisms by  developing a supply and consumer protection policy for 2015-2018, activating the Competition Affairs  Committee and developing consumer protection mechanisms to strengthen the government's role in  monitoring and addressing anti-competitive practices that contribute to unjustified price rises, lower  the quality of products and services provided to consumers and limit the ability of small and medium.  enterprises to grow and compete on a level playing field.   2.4.1.6 Sustainable — From living beyond our means   to achieving sustainable and inclusive growth   As outlined earlier in Jordan 2025, sustainability is a critical challenge in a number of areas. First, we  must achieve long-term fiscal sustainability, which means restoring a sound balance between  government revenues and expenditures through a combination of tax and spending measures.           Second, Jordan faces significant challenges maintaining a sustainable use of our limited natural  resources, especially water and energy. There are also the issues of food security and the heavy reliance  on imports, which make Jordan vulnerable to supply shocks and global price volatility beyond our control.       ‘To address these sustainability challenges, Jordan 2025 recommends a number of initiatives:   + Take urgent measures to improve tax administration and collection — including investments  in expanding collection and enforcement capabilities.   + Implement a set of medium and long-term measures aimed at making more  ‘structural reforms to reduce costs and improve the effectiveness of the public sector.  This includes restructuring human resources across the Civil Service, outsourcing non-core  government activities to the private sector and reinvesting in the skills and capabilities of public  servants, so that they can better use modern systems and tools of public administration to create  long-term productivity and efficiency gains.   + Use Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to secure the financing the technical expertise  required to invest in infrastructure expansions - to boost supplies of energy and introduce new  efficient technologies to optimize production and consumption, for example through smart grid  technologies.       + Ongoing investment in governorate development projects - through the Governorate  Development Fund and other vehicles to ensure that local communities across the Kingdom have a viable  and sustainable local economy capable of providing local jobs for local communities.   BG    2.4.1.7 Institutionalized — From personalized to institutionalized  decision making and management   The lack of management skills is one of the most important determinants in the management of public  institutions; efforts to boost performance are focused on technical rather than administrative aspects.  The lack of general management skill must be addressed by making effort on a large scale in the  coming years that includes both public and private sectors and focus on enhancing both  administrative and technical skills. The capacity of senior and middle managers should be examined  and they should be “rehabilitated” with new and modern administrative practices, such as time  management and people management.            Our national deficit of general management skill must be addressed in a systematic, large-scale and  national effort over the coming years and encompass both the private and public sectors. Current  senior and middle managers need to be exposed to, and ‘retooled’ with, new, modern management  practices — from time management to people management skills. Furthermore, training in these  management techniques and tools need to begin at the high school and tertiary education level so that  we begin to shape the management skills of the next generation immediately.       It should be noted here that it is necessary to build on, review and develop the system of performance  evaluation of incumbents of top positions. Performance evaluation instructions and forms have  recently been updated.         With this challenge in mind and based on the Public Sector Reform Plan of 2013 and Jordan 2025  proposes several initiatives to deepen the institutionalization of management practice across  Government and the economy and society more generally, including:         + Asignificant upgrading of the Institute of Public Administration — to reposition it as a  specialist, high-quality provider of management training for the public sector. This should be  done through a PPP arrangement with a leading international civil service training school or  college, so that international best practices are brought immediately to Jordan through the  Institute. Once operational, the Institute could expand its service offerings on a commercial  basis to the private sector and position itself as a regional centre of excellence by offering its  programs to the civil services of neighboring countries.   + Establishing a Jordanian Institute of Company Directors - to serve as an association  of internationally trained and accredited Jordanian company directors. This should be a  private sector led and operated initiative, potentially in partnership with a well-established  international partner, and could be used in conjunction with the Institute of Public  Administration to train senior government officials in preparation for appointment to the  boards of government agencies and government related business enterprises.                  + Making the necessary adjustments to institutionalize the decision making process  at the centre of government.   ‘The Public Sector Reform Plan 2013 and its executive detai       is the framework on which Jordan 202       based.   In summary, the seven principles outlined here are embedded throughout the recommendations of Jordan  2025, Through the implementation of the initiatives recommended in Jordan 2025 our society and economy will  begin to make the transitions outlined below, which will underpin the evolution of a new economic and social  development model for the Kingdom.   Figure 33: Parameters for Transforming the Development Model   Parameters for Transforming the Development Model   Jordan Today ae Jordan 2025  La Abin  See  Paricipatory  Becles  Compete  Sustainable   nes   rie Sustainable nnd lnchive growth      Ss Tnsttutionalized een     su  TANe    2.5 Required Resources for National Development   In order to achieve our desired goals of stability and prosperity, we must work together based on the  principles outlined above to use our available resources and capabilities as wisely and sustainably as  possible, We must do so at a time when we face tremendous constraints given the pressure on the  Kingdom's finances and the impact of regional instability on our economy.   2.5.1 Water, Land and Natural Resources  Jordanians have become accustomed to creating opportunities from limited natural resources.. It is,  vital that we manage our available stock of arable land by ensuring careful and long-sighted land use  allocation and planning.       Due to the low per capita share of available water sources, new sources should be found by  desalinating (the Carrier of Bahrain), developing other non-traditional sources, assuring the  sustainability of groundwater and maximizing the use of surface water by building dams (water  harvesting). Raising the sector's financial efficiency includes reducing cost by improving energy  efficiency and renewable energy use, and reducing theft and leaks.   It is also necessary to begin implementing a structural reform program for the sector that includes  restructuring in the water tariff to reflect the true value of the service has and this will have important  implications for the agricultural and industrial sectors. Moreover, efforts to control and regulate the  demand for water through a range of price and non-price mechanisms and incentives should be  continued. The sanitation and purification of domestic and industrial wastewater and infrastructure for  irrigation should be expanded.       Another priority is to restructure water transport and distribution networks to ensure services are  provided equally to all governorates. This includes the development of Wadi Araba from a holistic  perspective.   2.5.2 Citizens   As outlined earlier, our greatest asset is our people. Not surprisingly, our people have been placed at  the centre of Jordan 2025 with a primary focus on ways and means to enhance employability, increase  workforce participation of all of citizens and ensure that labour markets are flexible and efficient so  that everyone able and seeking employment has an opportunity to work . In this context, the problem  of unemployment in governorates should be addressed, and attention should be given to the issue of  unemployment differences between the centers of governorates and their districts and between men  and women generally. Making real progress to reduce disparities is one of the central outcomes that  Jordan 2025 seeks to achieve over the next decade.         A renewed and sustained national effort - as called for by the National Employment Strategy and  involving both public and private sectors - needs to be made to dramatically expand vocational  training and address cultural stereotypes and biases that encourage too many young Jordanians to  pursue academic university study over vocational training. Part of the solution must be to expand the  number of vocational training programs on offer to both men and women and transform the quality of  the learning experience in this course. The private sector also needs to be closely involved in advising  ‘on the design of skills-based training programs that will best meet the needs of the economy.   Addressing the training needs of young Jordanians by itself will not be sufficient. The economy also  needs to be growing to facilitate the creation of new jobs. Better harnessing the full potential of the  Jordanian people therefore requires an integrated set of reforms:   + First, our private sector needs to be the primary engine for economic activity and growth to  create new job opportunities.   + Second, reforming the education system needs to be a national priority to better prepare  young Jordanians to join the labour market, in particular the vocational and medium-skilled  opportunities that are already available.       + Third, attitudes and mindsets - among our youth and their parents — need to change with  respect to long-held views about what constitutes as ‘honorable’ job for a Jordanian. We  cannot build Jordan on the back of engineers and doctors alone. Jordanians must see other  vocations as equally valuable jobs in our economy and society.       + Fourth, the relative price of Jordanian and foreign labour needs to change so that there is a  stronger incentive for business to hire Jordanians over non- Jordanians.   Finally, those already working in the informal sector must be motivated to move to the formal  ‘economy, where they will be properly covered by social security and health insurance and contributing  to the betterment of the country as a whole by paying tax. . This is the essential act of citizenship back  to one’s own country but may requires offering appropriate incentives to encourage this move.   wre  TAN    2.5.3 Infrastructure   ‘Over the past two decades, Jordan has made significant improvement in upgrading the scope and  quality of national infrastructure networks including the national road network, electricity and water  grids and the national telecommunications and IT network. The Kingdom now has well-developed  usiness infrastructure. The new Queen Alia International Airport terminal is one of the newest in the   world and Aqaba port's capabilities are being expanded. The Kingdoms ICT and transport networks  have been strengthened through recent investments such as the Amman Airport Road expansion; and  the national energy and water grids have also been expanded with completion of major projects such  as the Disi water pipeline and the new 250MW Manakheer power plant opened in October 2014.       These new infrastructure investments are vital to enhance the ability of the economy to deliver future  growth. To meet financing needs, we should think about enabling the use of innovative financing  methods including through laws and regulations such as the Investment Law and Public- Private  Partnership Law.   2.5.4 Financial Resources   Of all of the resources required to implement Jordan 2025 and move towards achieving our desired  outcomes by 202, financial resources are the most constrained. Because we are not blessed with a  large supply of a strategic commodity such as oil, we do not have the accumulated national wealth that  many in our region rely on to fuel their national development aspirations. Instead, we have relied  heavily on foreign development assistance which has traditionally accounted for 4-5% of annual GDP.  While we have received short-term financial assistance from donors and our regional allies in the GCC,  restoring the health of our national finances requires a determined focus on achieving long-term fiscal  sustainability. To reduce debts and deficits, the government must continue to move forward with a  number of reform measures aimed at cutting expenditures and raising government revenues.              ‘The financial reform program, developed by the Ministry of Finance, with its planned executive program,  already provides our foundation for the reforms ahead on the road back to fiscal sustainability.   2.5.5 Non-Government Financing for National Development   Anumber of important non-government tools can be accessed over the coming decade to help finance  ‘our economic and social development priorities. These tools should be used to finance both the ‘hard  infrastructure’ of our economy, such as power stations and roads, and the ‘soft infrastructure’ such as  skill improvement training programs and programs to deal with difficult-to-solve social issues, such  as youth unemployment, road traffic accidents and fatalities.   There are several important and emerging channels of non-government financing that should be  explored over the coming decade that would take pressure off the Government's core budgs       1, Domestic and foreign direct investment.   2. Public Private Partnerships.   3. Islamic Finance instruments, including sukuk.   4. New models of social finance, including Social Impact Bonds.   5. Corporate Social Responsibility.   2.5.6 Domestic and Foreign Investment   Through the national banking system and the Social Security Corporation, the savings of Jordanians  can be deployed to assist in the funding of projects and programs of national significance, if proved to  be financially feasible, with sufficient guarantees provided to contributing parties.   Foreign investment plays a vital role in supporting the development of every economy around the  world. There was $26 billion of foreign direct investment (FDI) capital stock in Jordan, according to  2012 data, representing more than 80% of GDP. Obviously, foreign investors have always been  strategic partners for Jordan.       We must recognize that we compete against other economies to win the interest and commitment of  foreign investors. To succeed, we need to offer a regulatory environment that is more attractive and  stable than their alternative investment options, low transaction costs and skilled hard-working  people. The new investment law, which unified investment authorities, seeks to achieve this, and the  practical application is the true translation of this trend.  Investors naturally prefer investment destinations that offer a large domestic market as well as export  opportunities. Given that Jordan cannot offer a large domestic market, we must outperform our  competitors by a significant margin on the dimensions against which foreign investors make their  investment decisions. Furthermore, if Jordan is to be a regional hub to a number of large markets - such  as Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Egypt -our transport connections to those markets and our national ICT  and telecommunication infrastructure must be sophisticated compared to the rest of the world.   wu  WAN    2.5.7 Public-Private Partnerships   Public-private partnerships have been used around the world for over three decades now. They have  expanded from an initial focus on ‘hard infrastructure’, such as roads and power stations, to ‘soft  infrastructure’ such as schools and hospitals. There are now well development models for structuring  collaborative financing and project delivery arrangements between the government and the private  sector, in order to appropriately share the risks and financial benefits.   Structuring and overseeing PPP projects is complex and requires a combination of legal, financial,  engineering and project management expertise. To be successful in negotiating PPP project  arrangements with foreign investors, the government needs to invest wisely in the specialist,  multi-disciplinary capabilities and be willing to hire external specialists to advise the government on  the appropriate risk-teward sharing mechanisms. These capabilities are currently being developed at  the Ministry of Finance, at the Partnership Unit established under the Public-Private Partnership Law.   2.5.8 Islamic Finance   Islamic finance is widely accepted and rapidly growing segment of the global financial services sector.  Global centers of excellence for Islamic Finance are now established. Such emerging centers also  exist in Kuala Lumpur, Bahrain, Dubai and London. The year 2015 will see the first issuing of finance  instruments to finance some financing needs of the government.   2.5.9 Social Finance   In the United Kingdom and the United States, innovative and new financing mechanisms, knows as  Social Impact Bonds (SIBs), are now being adopted to fund programs aimed at addressing   difficult-to-solve social problems, such as infectious diseases and road safety challenges. Otherwise  known as pay-for-performance contracts, these arrangements mean that the government only pays for  a program if it is proven to deliver the desired results. The risk of failure is borne not by the  government, as with traditional budgetary funding of social programs through Ministries, but by a  group of third party investors who provide the initial capital and other funding required to launch the  program. The government provides the appropriate environment and commits to pay if the program  proves to be successful.   In this way, SIBs help governments solve several problems at the same time. It only pays once certain  performance outcomes have been achieved, typically several years into the future. Management and  delivery of the services provided to the target audience is provided by a civil society organization not  the government. If they work, the government will have made progress against difficult problems. If the  new approaches do not work, the government will not have expended large sums of money. As the use  and sophistication of SIBs grows internationally, Jordan will want to have the capacity to explore their  application to the Kingdom's development challenges.   2.5.10 Corporate Social Responsibility       Over the past decade Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs have expanded in Jordan and  many of Jordan’s largest companies have CSR programs that provide vital sources of funding various  activities. The Kingdom also has numerous philanthropic foundations, including numerous  foundations and initiatives that support programs and initiatives for civil society development,  education, social services and social entrepreneurship programs and initiatives to the poor.  All participants engaged in these various funding avenues need to be active participants in helping to  implement this vision. The government will need to put in place appropriate consultation and  collaboration mechanisms to assess and verify the suitability of different funding models and  approaches for the initiatives outlined in this vision.       G6 &  WAN    2.6 Creating the Enabling Environment   Fundamental to Jordan's success in implementing a new economic and social development model (as  proposed here) is clear alignment among the key stakeholders about the direction, magnitude and  urgency of change required,   For this vision to succeed, a number of critical conditions must be put in place in the short term in order  to enable the full and effective implementation of the priorities initiatives outlined in this  longer term to 2025.       Those critical enabling conditions are:   4. A shared consensus across stakeholders ~ Executive and legislative branches, the civil  society and the business community - around the basic requirements and principles for the  new economic and social development model.       2.An agreement about the urgency with which reforms need to be implemented.   3, Effective and efficient decision making within the government and Parliament grounded in  high-quality evidence-based policy analysis.   4, Continuous leadership and management development across the government sector.        5. Active citizenship and participation from the private sector and civil society organizations,  including participation in debate and dialogue about major national issues and challenges and  balanced analysis by the print in the interests of enabling well-informed public debate.   6. Effective and directed partnerships with donor and international financial institutions in order to  channel available financial and technical assistance into the priority initiatives outlined in this vision.         7. Strategic partnership with the private sector, including foreign investors through Public  Private Partnership (PPP) models that encourage long term commitment, the highest quality  of standards and appropriate risk sharing between the government and investors.       8. Legislative stability and increased credibility and predictability of legislative amendments.       Based on the “road map” outlined in this chapter, the next section of this vision recommends the priority  initiatives that should be pursued by successive governments with the active support and participation  of citizens, the private sector and the civil society sector.       were  TAN",

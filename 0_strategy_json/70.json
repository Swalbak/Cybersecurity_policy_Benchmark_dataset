ISBN: 978-981-14-1612-5 Designed by: APT811 Design & Innovation Agency 1 FOREWORD Cybersecurity incidents made some of the biggest headlines in 2018. Data breaches, in particular, were reported across multiple industries. Facebook, Cathay Pacific and Marriott were just some of the high-profile organisations that were hacked and had sensitive information stolen. Singapore was not spared as well. We were hit by the most serious data breach in our history – 1.5 million SingHealth patients had their non-medical personal particulars illegally accessed and copied. As cyber threats grow in scale and sophistication, it is clearly no longer a question of “if”, but rather “when” an attack will hit us. Even as we strive to make our systems as secure as possible, it is imperative that we respond to an incident swiftly, robustly and decisively. The cyber-attack on SingHealth was a stark reminder for us to push further in our cybersecurity efforts collectively as a nation. On the international stage, Singapore remains firmly committed to the establishment of a rules- based international order in cyberspace; and condemns all malicious cyber activities, which threaten the safety and security of Singapore and Singaporeans. 2018 also saw significant progress in enhancing Singapore’s cybersecurity. We passed and implemented the Cybersecurity Act, which provides a legal framework for the oversight and maintenance of cybersecurity in Singapore. To nurture a vibrant cybersecurity ecosystem, we launched initiatives such as the Industry Call for Innovation, which laid the ground for long-term, holistic cybersecurity investments, and the David Koh Commissioner of Cybersecurity and Chief Executive Cyber Security Agency of Singapore Smart Nation Scholarship, to support talented students pursuing a career in cybersecurity. In addition, the establishment of the $30 million ASEAN-Singapore Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence underscores Singapore’s efforts to build regional cyber capacity and promote international collaboration. Singapore marks its Bicentennial Commemoration in 2019. This journey over the last 200 years has seen us develop from a small trading outpost to a global digital hub. As we advance towards our vision of a Smart Nation, cybersecurity is a vital prerequisite and key enabler – the invisible glue that instils trust and confidence in our digital plans. We hope this third edition of the Singapore Cyber Landscape will provide useful lessons from past incidents, so that we can better prepare ourselves for the digital future. Let us keep Singapore’s cyberspace safe and secure, together. 2 3 DDoS ATTACK PEAKS JAN APR JUL OCT FEB AUG NOV MAR JUN SEP DEC MAY • APT-attributed malware (nicknamed ‘Olympic Destroyer’) disrupted Opening Ceremony of the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games • Ransomware attacks hit Port of San Diego • Facebook data breach affected 30 million users • Financial information of 429,000 passengers stolen in British Airways data breach • Unauthorised access to more than 200 State Courts electronic case files • User accounts belonging to academic staff in four Singapore universities compromised in cyber-attack • PageUp malware breach affected 300,000 Careers@Gov portal users • 72 user accounts in Health Promotion Board’s HealthHub portal accessed illegally • Personal particulars of 1.5 million patients stolen in cyber-attack on SingHealth • Largest Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack in history on unidentified US-based service provider • SamSam ransomware disrupted Atlanta’s municipal services • Guest information stolen from 383 million Marriott International accounts • Personal details of German politicians exposed • Cathay Pacific Airways data breach affected 9.4 million passengers CYBER THREATS IN 2018 OVERVIEW OF RECORD PEAKS OF DISTRIBUTED DENIAL- OF-SERVICE ATTACKS – A COMPARISON In 2018, the largest Distributed Denial-of- Service (DDoS) attack ever recorded was conducted using a relatively new method.

This chapter details our observations on some of these cyber threats, trends, and motivations from the period of January to December 2018. INFORMATION 8 9 ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREATS DISRUPTIONIn the past two editions of the Singapore Cyber Landscape, we highlighted the significance and potential impact that Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) have on our cyber ecosystem. Often associated with a nation-state, APT groups have access to a wealth of resources and deep expertise to achieve their objectives, which include causing disruption, cyber theft for financial gain, and conducting cyber espionage. FINANCIAL GAIN A number of high-profile cyber-attacks targeting payment systems were attributed to APTs, resulting in significant losses to affected financial institutions. These attacks typically involve tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) such as phishing e-mails to compromise employee accounts and gain access to systems and networks, as well as technical methods to cover the attackers’ tracks. In June 2018, attackers breached the SWIFT payment system at the Bank of Chile and the Cosmos Bank, siphoning off US$10 million and US$13.5 million respectively, through fraudulent wire transfer requests. These attacks were likely conducted by the same APT group. APT groups may choose to target prominent, highly-visible international events with the aim of disrupting them to draw attention. The Opening Ceremony of the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games in February 2018 was one such example. The attack, attributed to an Asia-based APT group, disrupted Internet access and telecasts, and shut down websites covering the event. Another type of APT attack seeks to disrupt operations. Shamoon, a type of wiper malware associated with an APT group based in the Middle East, is designed to wipe data and render endpoints and servers unbootable. This prevents the targeted organisation from conducting business as usual. First seen in 2012 in the energy industry, it re- emerged in December 2018, affecting a number of organisations across many industries in the Middle East. CYBER ESPIONAGE APT groups are known for conducting information gathering and cyber espionage. Information gathered can be useful for intelligence purposes, and/or give countries a competitive advantage over rivals during state negotiations. One such example was a watering hole1 campaign active in the last quarter of 2018 that compromised several government and media websites in Vietnam and Cambodia. These websites were used to infect visitors with spying malware. This attack was attributed to an Asia-based APT group that cybersecurity experts had identified as being behind several espionage and spear-phishing campaigns targeting Southeast Asian countries. 1 A watering hole attack is a type of cyber-attack targeting a particular organisation, where malware is delivered from websites that are regularly visited by the organisation’s members and infects its systems. 10 11 CHAPTER 1 SPOTLIGHT ON CYBER THREATS WEBSITE DEFACEMENTS CSA detected 605 cases of website defacement in Singapore in 2018, a 70 per cent decrease from 2,040 in 2017. These websites belong to a range of organisations – from government agencies, businesses, and media companies. Two Singapore Government websites were among those defaced. While most affected websites belong to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), larger organisations were also hit. For example, the Singapore website of a major Japanese advertising firm was compromised and replaced by a message “Sec == ‘0’” in January 2018. A spike in defacements observed in November 2018 was likely caused by an attacker exploiting vulnerabilities in an unpatched web server. 101 websites belonging to various businesses hosted on this server were compromised by the same attacker in a single day. Defacements are indicative of vulnerabilities present in a website’s underlying infrastructure. This may be a harbinger of more damaging cyber- attacks, such as hosting malicious content on the website or using it as a platform to launch attacks. Defacements usually take place when unpatched/ outdated websites and their hosting servers are attacked. Common methods of intrusion include Structured Query Language (SQL) injections, 2 “[SingCERT] Alert on WordPress 4.9.7 Security Release,” SingCERT Advisories & Alerts, 12 July 2018, 1,750Year 2016 Year 2017 Year 2018 2,040 605 WEBSITE DEFACEMENTS (2016 – 2018) NO.

Websites published on the WordPress platform remained the most targeted for defacements in 2018, continuing a trend observed since 2016. In Singapore, over a third of the websites defaced were built on WordPress. A WordPress file deletion vulnerability, first disclosed on 26 June 2018 and affecting all versions of WordPress up to then, could allow an attacker to have full control over the website. WordPress released an updated platform version that fixed the vulnerability on 5 July 2018, and SingCERT published an alert a week later, advising WordPress website owners and web hosting providers to update to the latest version immediately.2 However, as of March 2019, about 40 per cent of the defaced WordPress websites had yet to be patched to the latest version. Worryingly, 185 of the defaced websites – or about 30 per cent of the cases – were defaced previously. Re-defacements suggest that website owners have yet to take appropriate security and patching measures to protect their websites, even after being attacked before. The variety of intrusion and compromise methods underlines the importance of using stronger login credentials and timely patching of known vulnerabilities. 3 IN 10 websites were defaced previously In January 2018, the Singapore website of a major Japanese advertising firm was compromised, with its homepage replaced only with the message “Sec == ‘0’”. 12 13 CHAPTER 1 SPOTLIGHT ON CYBER THREATS 16,100 phishing URLs with a Singapore-link were observed in 2018, a 30 per cent decrease from 2017. Phishing e-mails usually spoof, or pretend to originate from, reputable firms and organisations. Companies in the banking and financial services, technology, and file hosting services made up almost 90 per cent of spoofed companies in 2018. In Singapore, websites of Government organisations such as Ministry of Manpower (MOM), Singapore Police Force (SPF) and Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) were commonly spoofed to steal personal and financial data from victims. Phishing activity typically increases when major events occur. Threat actors dupe victims into opening phishing e-mails and their attachments PHISHING URLS JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC 1,879 767 1,526 3,849 812 1,931 1,155 1,867 2,406 553 1,601 1,786 by taking advantage of their interest in such events. During the FIFA World Cup tournament in June 2018, several soccer- themed phishing e-mails and websites were observed, targeting sports fans with fake gifts from FIFA or its sponsors. Fans who responded to these NUMBER OF PHISHING URLS WITH A SINGAPORE-LINK OBSERVED IN 2018 COMMONLY SPOOFED ORGANISATIONS IN 2018 TAKING ADVANTAGE OF “HTTPS” 2,450 phishing URLs were observed using “HTTPS” in 2018, a more than tenfold jump from just 200 of such URLs in 2017. Using “HTTPS” – rather than “HTTP” – lures victims into a false sense of security, by having them believe that they were transacting on a secure website. USE OF DYNAMIC DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM SERVICES (DDNS) SERVICES 210 URLs were observed using DDNS services in 2018, three times more than in 2017. Such services enable malicious URLs to change their IP addresses constantly to evade applications that block static malicious IP addresses. LEVERAGING GENERIC TOP LEVEL DOMAINS Domains such as “.com” (8,100 URLs) and “.club” (700 URLs) were commonly abused, making up more than half the observations for 2018. They are relatively cheap (or even available for free) and lack regulation, allowing threat actors to constantly create new malicious URLs. Users are advised to remain vigilant against phishing attacks, and to be cautious and verify the identity of the sender, before clicking on suspicious URLs. OK “giveaways” ended up giving away their personal information to cybercriminals. Separately, in the lead-up to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea-USA Singapore Summit held in June 2018, an intelligence-gathering campaign targeted South Koreans with phishing e-mails. These contained malware that could be used for keylogging and executing malicious commands on compromised devices. Increasingly, threat actors are also using ingenious tactics to trick individuals and evade detection. Some examples include the use of HTTPS, Dynamic Domain Name System (DDNS) services, and using generic top level domains: 1st Banking and Financial Services (e.g. Bank of America) 2nd Technology (e.g. Microsoft) 3rd File Hosting Services (e.g. Dropbox) Bank of America Microsoft Facebook Dropbox PayPal Amazon Apple AT&T Alibaba Google Yahoo Adobe Free Mobile France Postmaster Docusign GitLab ATB Financial Chase Bank Mailbox DHL 14 15 CHAPTER 1 SPOTLIGHT ON CYBER THREATS MALWARE Fewer ransomware cases were reported to CSA in 2018. There were also significantly fewer Command and Control (C&C) servers observed in Singapore; however, the number of botnet drones – compromised computers infected with malware – remained largely similar. RANSOMWARE 21 ransomware cases were reported to CSA in 2018, a decrease from 25 in 2017. Although the number of reported cases is low, the actual number of ransomware cases may be higher as many go unreported. Ransomware affected systems across multiple industries in Singapore, such as construction, education, and food and beverage. While there were no global widespread campaigns like the WannaCry attacks seen in 2017, ransomware remains lucrative, and continues to evolve in sophistication. GandCrab was described as “one of the most aggressive forms of ransomware”3 in 2018. Since its discovery in January 2018, GandCrab has infected over half a million computers and is believed to have extorted around US$300 million 3 “The GandCrab Ransomware Mindset,” Check Point Research, 13 March 2018, 4 On 22 March 2018, the City of Atlanta in the US state of Georgia suffered a ransomware attack which affected several local government systems and disrupted businesses. Almost US$17 million was reportedly spent in recovery efforts. The ransomware used in the attack, dubbed ‘SamSam’, was also linked to another ransomware attack on the Port of San Diego in September 2018. 5 Palmer, Danny. “Cybercrime: Ransomware remains a 'key' malware threat says Europol,” ZDNet, 18 September 2018, FEATURED TOPIC Machine learning and data- driven detection systems are being adopted in cybersecurity applications to cope with rapidly evolving cyber-attacks. However, threat actors are now leveraging adversarial Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to deceive these systems. One method of deception involves using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create new variants from known ADVERSARIAL AI IN CYBERSECURITY malware that are able to bypass malware detectors. One way to counter this attack would be to include GAN samples during re-training, so that the malware detector is tuned to identify this class of mutated samples. To combat against new cyber- attacks, AI engines constantly train and update their models. This adaptive learning process, however, creates an opportunity for threat actors GANDCRAB, THE MONEY- GRABBING RANSOMWARE GandCrab is offered in the Dark Web as Ransomware- as-a-Service (RaaS) by its criminal developers. Modeled after Software-as- a-Service (SaaS) principles, cybercriminals without programming knowledge would rent such ransomware for their malicious activities, and pay the developers by sharing a portion of the collected ransoms. Some characteristics of GandCrab include: (a) being frequently updated to evade detection and deletion, (b) targeting mainly English-speaking countries, and (c) customisable ransom demands. As part of the No More Ransom initiative, free decryption tools for later versions of GandCrab are made available for affected victims to recover their files. This public-private cooperation exemplifies the need for collaboration between government and industry partners to combat global cyber threats together. to poison data used to train the models and thus influence decision boundaries. One method of defending against this type of attack involves processing the training data to identify potential adversarial data manipulation first, before providing them to train the AI engines. in ransom payments. In February 2018, a private financial institution in Singapore was infected with GandCrab, when one of its employees surfed a compromised website and was prompted to install a ‘font update pack’ for displaying the website properly. Ransomware remains a common threat. Europol has warned that targeted ransomware attacks which are tailored to specific organisations or individuals, such as GandCrab and SamSam,4 may become the new normal.5 Organisations should ensure that their systems are regularly updated to thwart known ransomware threats. They should also not make any form of payment demanded, as there is no certainty they would get their data back. 16 17 CHAPTER 1 SPOTLIGHT ON CYBER THREATS FEATURED TOPIC Open ports attract malware infection and may be used to launch cyber-attacks, such as Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS attacks inundate websites and services with incoming traffic, causing them to become unavailable. In February 2018, the two largest DDoS attacks recorded in history occurred just five days apart from each other. Unlike large-scale DDoS attacks that usually employ malware-driven botnets, these two attacks stemmed from servers where specific ports were left open unnecessarily.6 The first attack peaked at 1.35 Tbps and targeted the developer platform, GitHub. The peak was 30 per cent higher than the previous record set by the attack targeting Dyn in 2016. The second attack targeted a US-based service provider, and set the current peak record of 1.7 Tbps. If users must utilise open ports for their work, they should always safeguard them by avoiding default credentials, and close the open ports promptly when not in use.

These are not new malware; Conficker, in particular, dates back to 2008. The top malware, Gamarue, steals personal information and can also function as a medium to distribute other malicious programs. Although Gamarue’s infrastructure was largely dismantled in an international operation in December 2017, efforts to wipe it out completely had been slow and challenging,8 and Gamarue had continued to infect systems throughout 2018.9 The persistence of Gamarue infections into 2018 suggests that many users have yet to patch their devices, or use antivirus software, to prevent infections. This is also the likely explanation for how WannaCry – the ransomware that wrecked havoc across the globe in 2017 that can now be easily detected by antivirus software – continued to persist on local systems and computers. Separately, the Mirai malware had been linked to botnet campaigns targeting unpatched Internet of Things (IoT) devices. A number of malicious campaigns are increasingly leveraging open-source Mirai malware – shared openly on the Internet – to conduct brute-force attacks with common usernames and passwords. The observations indicate that many users do not change default login credentials of their smart devices. On average, five common malware accounted for over half the daily infections in 2018. SingCERT is responsible for the prevention, detection and resolution of cybersecurity incidents in Singapore, acting on information provided by government agencies, international counterparts and the public. When SingCERT receives information regarding C&C servers hosted in Singapore, the team first confirms the locations of the servers, and then asks the relevant agencies such as the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) or relevant abuse team of the local hosting providers to take them down and restore legitimate services. When the hosting provider is located overseas, SingCERT collaborates with the relevant foreign Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) to do the same. 18 19 CHAPTER 1 SPOTLIGHT ON CYBER THREATS CHAPTER 2 TARGET.SG Singapore has been, and will continue to be, the target of cyber-attacks by Advanced Persistent Threat groups and other threat actors. This chapter offers insights and practical lessons from cyber-attacks that affected different segments of Singapore in 2018, and how we can learn from them to strengthen our collective cybersecurity. 20 21 CYBER-ATTACK ON SINGHEALTH CASE STUDY There was, however, no evidence that the data had been tampered with or deleted. No clinical services were disrupted, and patient care remained uncompromised. The Committee of Inquiry (COI) into the cyber-attack on SingHealth’s database system established that the cyber- attack was the work of a skilled and sophisticated actor, which bore the characteristics of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group. The COI found that the attacker was well- resourced, and had used advanced techniques and tools to target the SingHealth patient database and illegally exfiltrate patient data. The attacker was persistent, evaded detection for a long time, and even re-entered the network after being detected. WHAT HAPPENED? The attacker gained initial access to SingHealth’s IT network around August 2017, by infecting front end workstations, most likely through phishing attacks. After lying dormant for several months, the attacker moved laterally through the network between December 2017 and June 2018, compromising additional endpoints, servers and user accounts. From May 2018, the attacker made multiple unsuccessful attempts to connect to SingHealth’s patient database system. On 26 June 2018, the attacker obtained credentials to the database, and began querying and exfiltrating patient records the following day. On 4 July 2018, an IT administrator at Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS), the IT agency serving the public healthcare sector including SingHealth, noticed suspicious queries made on the database. The suspicious queries were terminated by IHiS’s IT administrators, and measures were put in place to prevent further queries from being made. On 10 July 2018, the cyber incident was escalated to the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA), SingHealth’s senior management, the Ministry of Health (MOH), and Ministry of Health Holdings (MOHH). CSA’s National Cyber Incident Response Team (NCIRT) was immediately deployed on site to work with IHiS to carry out joint investigations and remediation. They took steps to contain the threat, eliminate the attacker’s footholds, and prevent recurrence of the attack. In 2018, SingHealth’s network was the target of a deliberate and well-planned cyber-attack. The scale of this cyber-attack was unprecedented. The personal particulars of 1.5 million patients and the outpatient dispensed medication records of 160,000 of them were illegally accessed and copied. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s records were specifically and repeatedly targeted. TARGET.GOV.SG Even as we do our best to secure our systems, it is a matter of when, not if, our systems are breached. The cyber-attack on SingHealth is a reminder for us to do better in our cybersecurity efforts, together as a nation. – Mr David Koh, Commissioner of Cybersecurity and Chief Executive CSA, emphasising the need for collective cybersecurity 22 23 CHAPTER 2 TARGET.SG RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE COI INTO SINGHEALTH The COI made 16 recommendations relating to strategic and operational measures to strengthen the cybersecurity posture of SingHealth and IHiS. These recommendations are generally applicable to all organisations responsible for large databases of personal data. Some key actions that all organisations must consider implementing are as follows: Include cybersecurity as part of the organisation’s risk management, with deliberations and decisions on balancing cybersecurity and trade-offs (e.g. cost, operational requirements) based on unique business considerations (e.g. patient safety in the case of the public healthcare sector) managed at the senior level of leadership. Develop cyber incident response plans for various scenarios, and test and update them regularly by conducting realistic exercises and simulations. Provide all staff with training to build awareness on the best cyber hygiene practices, and cultivate an organisational culture where cybersecurity is everyone’s responsibility. Adopt multiple defences, such as encryption, firewalls and robust data- access practices, to layers of security measures, to better prevent, detect and respond to cyber incidents. Train and equip all staff to recognise and respond to cybersecurity incidents, and to report these incidents in a timely manner. Carry out comprehensive and regular checks and audits to identify gaps in the design of and compliance with policies, processes and procedures, and to ensure that these gaps are remedied according to plan. FEATURED TOPIC To build a secure and resilient Smart Nation, the Government’s approach to cybersecurity is underpinned by two key principles. First, we adopt a ‘defence- in-depth’ strategy, with multiple layers of cyber defence to impede attackers. These layers of defence cascade from the perimeter to within the systems. Given enough time and resources, sophisticated and determined attackers may eventually find their way into the system. The layered defence approach will enable security teams to detect any breach and respond swiftly. Second, we enhance our system defence on three fronts – People, Processes and Technology. In terms of People and Processes, the Government is developing a stronger cybersecurity culture across the Public Service, as well as STRENGTHEN GOVERNMENT ICT SYSTEMS tapping on technology to support its IT staff and automate cybersecurity tasks, such as patch management. In terms of Technology, the Government will continue to build up the defence and resilience of its systems, while implementing measures to better detect and respond to cyber threats. The Government can more effectively defend our systems if we involve the global and local communities of cyber defenders to identify vulnerabilities and strengthen the Government’s ICT systems. For example, the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) and CSA are partnering local and overseas cybersecurity communities on a Government Bug Bounty Programme (GBBP) to help search and uncover vulnerabilities in our system. CSA also coordinated national efforts to mitigate the risk of a similar attack affecting other Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) systems, by sharing threat intelligence with CII owners and instructing them to undertake relevant security measures. In view of further malicious activities detected on the SingHealth network on 19 July 2018, Internet Surfing Separation (ISS) was temporarily imposed on SingHealth’s IT systems on 20 July 2018. As a precautionary measure, temporary ISS was also implemented for IT systems in other unaffected public healthcare clusters (National Healthcare Group and National University Healthcare System) on 22 July 2018. The Government also paused the rollout of new Government ICT systems from 20 July to 3 August 2018. During the pause, a review of its existing cybersecurity measures was conducted. Although there was no evidence of Government ICT systems being compromised in this attack, additional measures on critical Government systems were introduced to detect and respond more quickly to cybersecurity threats. SingHealth began contacting the affected after the Government announced the news of the cyber-attack on 20 July 2018. Concurrently, SingCERT also issued advisories on precautions that organisations and members of the public could take, in anticipation of potential opportunistic attacks. 2 5 3 6 1 4 24 25 CHAPTER 2 TARGET.SG CYBER-ATTACK ON UNIVERSITIES CASE STUDY WHAT HAPPENED? In April 2018, CSA received information that there was a breach of user account credentials at various universities in Singapore. Further investigations revealed that at least 52 accounts from four universities – NTU, NUS, Singapore Management University (SMU), and Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) – had been compromised. Unsuspecting victims received spear phishing e-mails that directed them to a credential harvesting website, which closely FOLLOW-UP ACTION The affected universities reset the passwords of all users, and scanned computers and networks for signs of further compromise. SingCERT sent out advisories to alert all users about the incident, and heighten their vigilance against similar attacks and other potential cyber threats. resembled the web portals of the universities. These portals were made to look as if the victims had accidentally logged out of their accounts and prompted them to enter their login credentials. The login credentials of the victims were later used to gain unauthorised access to the online libraries of the universities, in order to obtain research publications of staff members across various research fields and academic disciplines. UNIVERSITY Threat actors target academic institutions for a variety of reasons. These include stealing sensitive research information, and using them as stepping stones to gain access to high security systems and networks. In 2017, the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) were hit by sophisticated cyber-attacks that were assessed to be the work of APTs. These incidents highlight the need for academic institutions to stay vigilant constantly and strengthen their cybersecurity defences, as part of measures to protect their intellectual property. TARGET.EDU.SG 26 27 CHAPTER 2 TARGET.SG TARGET.ORG.SG Organisations are frequently targeted by threat actors, most often to steal private and personal information from their databases. As more Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) go digital, business e-mail impersonation scams are expected to grow in tandem. The Singapore Police Force observed 378 business e-mail impersonation scams in 2018, up from 332 cases in 2017. In total, businesses in Singapore suffered losses of close to S$58 million in 2018, an increase of about 31 per cent from 2017. CRYPTO-JACKING CASE STUDY FEATURED TOPIC Cybersecurity firms have observed a shift in modus operandi from traditional ransomware to crypto-mining, as mining cryptocurrency becomes more profitable than other criminal business models. Internet of Things (IoT) devices have also emerged as a potential attack vector that may be abused by cybercriminals. ADB.Miner, a Monero crypto-mining botnet which borrowed scanning code from Mirai, was found in February 2018 targeting Android-based devices. Another Monero crypto-mining botnet, Smominru, utilises the ETERNALBLUE 11 exploit and has since infected more than 500,000 computers worldwide. UNAUTHORISED CRYPTO-MINING BECOMING MORE PREVALENT In January 2018, security company Sucuri discovered a campaign where over 2,000 WordPress websites were compromised by a malicious script. This script delivered crypto-mining and keylogging malware to devices. Users would experience a decline in computing performance of their devices when they visit these compromised websites, whose malware in turn harness the computing power to mine cryptocurrencies. Sensitive information such as payment details would also be captured by the malware. WHAT HAPPENED? In January 2018, SingCERT received information that a training institute’s web servers had been infected by malware. Four of the institute’s web servers were later found to be infected by a crypto-mining malware. No other suspicious activity was detected, although the infected web servers were observed communicating to Internet Protocol (IP) addresses associated with crypto-mining operations. SingCERT later discovered that the institute’s web server software had not been patched to the latest versions, leading to its subsequent compromise. The attacker exploited these vulnerabilities to hijack the systems and discreetly link the web servers to a crypto- mining pool. The cryptocurrency produced was then transferred to a cryptocurrency wallet for storage. The attacker remains unknown due to the anonymous nature of the encrypted wallet. FOLLOW-UP ACTION SingCERT provided technical assistance to the organisation to investigate and understand the root cause and potential impact of the incident. SingCERT also worked together with the organisation to restore all compromised web servers to their last known serviceable state. All organisations and businesses should manage their cybersecurity risks appropriately. These include ensuring that all systems are regularly updated and patched for known vulnerabilities, and educating employees on the importance of verifying important email requests with business partners first, before responding to them. The public may refer to the SingCERT alert published on 9 November 2017 for measures to counter the rising crypto-jacking threat.10 10 “[SingCERT] Alert on Browser-based Digital Currency Mining,” SingCERT Advisories & Alerts, 9 November 2017, 11 ETERNALBLUE is an exploit which leverages a vulnerability in Microsoft’s Server Message Block (SMB). SMB is a protocol used by computers to share access to files and appliances over a network. 28 29 CHAPTER 2 TARGET.SG TARGET.YOU.SG Many individuals continue to lack cybersecurity awareness and practise poor cyber hygiene. According to the Singapore Police Force, there were 1,204 cases investigated under the Computer Misuse Act (CMA)12 in 2018, a 40 per cent increase from 2017. Some of these cases were a result of victims who were not alert to phishing e-mails intended to steal their sensitive personal information such as passwords and credit card details. All individuals should protect themselves from cyber threats proactively, and practise good cyber hygiene habits at all times. These include checking for signs of phishing before clicking on unknown links or opening attachments in suspicious e-mails, installing computer protection software (i.e. anti-virus, anti-spyware/ malware, and firewall) and keeping them updated, and enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) where possible. Separately, online scams continued to be a concern. There were about 2,125 e-commerce scams reported in 2018, with victims losing a total of about S$1.9 million. 70 per cent of such scams took place on e-commerce platform Carousell, and involved electronic products and tickets to events and attractions. It is important for all individuals to exercise caution towards unrealistic bargains for merchandise on e-commerce platforms to avoid falling prey to such scams. WHAT HAPPENED? In July 2018, a member of the public sought SingCERT’s help after receiving a threatening e-mail. The e-mail claimed that the victim’s computer had been infected with malware, and demanded payment in exchange for not exposing video clips of the victim in compromising situations, allegedly recorded with the computer’s own web camera. To substantiate the threat, the e-mail also contained the victim’s e-mail password. FOLLOW-UP ACTION SingCERT advised the victim to change all passwords associated with the compromised e-mail account immediately, enable two-factor authentication for the e-mail account if possible, and not to make any form of payment. As a precautionary measure, SingCERT also recommended performing anti-virus scans on all the victim’s computing devices. It was later determined that the e-mail represented a new form of extortion scam that surfaced recently. The victim’s e-mail address and password were likely exposed in a previous data breach – where login credentials of affected individuals were leaked – and not obtained through malware that had compromised the victim’s computer, as the scammer had claimed. NEARLY@SCAMMED.COM CASE STUDY As our cyber threat surface increases, potential points of vulnerability will become commonplace. All individuals need to play a conscious role in creating a safe and secure cyberspace. – Dr Shashi Jayakumar, Senior Fellow, S Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), and Head, Centre of Excellence for National Security and Executive Coordinator, Future Issues and Technology, highlighting individuals’ role in cybersecurity 12 The Computer Misuse Act (CMA) replaces the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act (CMCA) when the Cybersecurity Act came into force on 31 August 2018. 30 31 CHAPTER 2 TARGET.SG CHAPTER 3 SINGAPORE’S CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY – DEVELOPMENTS IN 2018 Launched by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the 2016 Singapore International Cyber Week, Singapore’s Cybersecurity Strategy sets out Singapore’s cybersecurity vision, goals and priorities to create a resilient and trusted cyberspace. It is only with a safe and trusted cyberspace that we can fully realise the benefits of technology, and secure a better future for Singaporeans. This chapter looks back on some key milestones of the Strategy in 2018.   The Strategy comprises four pillars: Pillar One: Building a Resilient Infrastructure Pillar Two: Creating a Safer Cyberspace Pillar Three: Developing a Vibrant Cybersecurity Ecosystem Pillar Four: Strengthening International Partnerships 32 33 CSA has been coordinating the work to realise Singapore’s Cybersecurity Strategy since it was launched in 2016. This chapter provides some of the highlights and achievements across the four pillars of the Strategy in 2018. The first pillar aims to secure our digitally-enabled economy and society, with emphasis on the Government’s partnership with the private sector and the cybersecurity community to strengthen the resilience of our Critical Information Infrastructure (CII). Cybersecurity is a collective responsibility of the Government, businesses, individuals and the community. The second pillar looks at engaging businesses and the public to collectively build a safer and more secure cyberspace. Cybersecurity is both a security imperative and an economic opportunity. The third pillar focuses on developing a vibrant cybersecurity ecosystem. This includes building a pipeline of talent and a vibrant industry. Cyber threats are borderless. Strong international collaboration in cybersecurity is necessary to combat the threats in cyberspace. The fourth pillar emphasises the strengthening of international partnerships and creating opportunities for collaboration. PILLAR ONE BUILDING A RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE PILLAR TWO CREATING A SAFER CYBERSPACE PILLAR THREE DEVELOPING A VIBRANT CYBERSECURITY ECOSYSTEM PILLAR FOUR STRENGTHENING INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS 34 35 CHAPTER 3 SINGAPORE’S CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY – DEVELOPMENTS IN 2018 MEASURING MATURITY OF CII SECTORS As part of efforts to build a resilient infrastructure, CSA launched its CII Protection Programme. Under the programme, the Readiness Maturity Index (RMI) Framework evaluates the cybersecurity maturity of CII sectors delivering essential services, and allows Sector Leads to build cyber capabilities and resilience against evolving cyber threats. The maturity of a CII sector is measured based on respective CII owners’ attributes in the RMI Framework. As of 2018, all 11 CII sectors have attained a maturity level of “measurable”, which means that they have demonstrated governance, management oversight, formalised policies, assigned responsibilities, and training of people, with consistent and measurable outcomes. CSA will continue to develop appropriate cybersecurity metrics beyond the RMI framework. Since its formation, CSA has been conducting sector-specific Exercise CyberArk (XCA) to ensure readiness of all CII sectors in defending against increasingly sophisticated cyber-threats. In 2018, over 300 participants from the Media, Aviation, and Maritime sectors took part in XCA on separate occasions to review, exercise and validate their cyber defence capabilities and incident response plans. The 4-month planning and development cycle for each run of the exercise culminated in a 2-day Table-Top Exercise (TTX), where participants were BUILDING A RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE PILLAR ONE: Participants from the maritime sector being briefed at the opening address for Exercise CyberArk in July 2018.

PSA remains fully committed towards strengthening the capabilities and resilience of our people, processes and platforms against cyber threats, to ensure the continuity of global trade and realising the “Internet of Logistics”. – Mr Ong Kim Pong, Regional CEO of PSA Southeast Asia, on contributing to cybersecurity in Singapore’s maritime sector FEATURED TOPIC CYBERSECURITY ACT: THE JOURNEY The Cybersecurity Bill was passed in Parliament on 5 February 2018 and came into force on 31 August 2018. Extensive public consultations were carried out by CSA and the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) in the drafting of the Act. This included closed-door consultations with key stakeholders, ranging from Government agencies, potential CII owners, industry associations and cybersecurity professionals, as well as an open public consultation from 10 July to 24 August 2017. The Cybersecurity Act establishes a legal framework for the oversight and maintenance of national cybersecurity in Singapore. Its four key objectives are to: A key feature of the Act is the appointment of a Commissioner of Cybersecurity who is empowered by the Act to oversee all aspects of cybersecurity in Singapore. The Commissioner is assisted by Assistant Commissioners of Cybersecurity, appointed from the respective sectors, who provide the deep domain knowledge and expertise. The Cybersecurity Act provides the Commissioner and his supporting cybersecurity officers with an important regulatory instrument and statutory powers with which to strengthen Singapore’s cybersecurity and combat cyber threats. Strengthen the protection of CII against cyber-attacks. Authorise CSA to prevent and respond to cybersecurity threats and incidents. Establish a framework for sharing cyber- security information. Establish a light-touch licensing framework for cybersecurity service providers (to come into force at a later date). CONDUCTING CYBERSECURITY EXERCISES FOR CII SECTORS put through a series of scenarios that gradually built up towards a cyber- crisis. Simulated media conferences were then conducted to validate the sectors’ crisis communication processes. Besides the sector-specific XCA, CSA also conducts a national-level, multi- sectoral exercise – Exercise Cyber Star (XCS) – to validate the National Cyber Crisis Management System. Two runs of XCS have been conducted to date, with the third one planned for 2019. 36 37 CHAPTER 3 SINGAPORE’S CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY – DEVELOPMENTS IN 2018 FEATURED TOPIC NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY AWARENESS CAMPAIGN In May 2018, CSA launched the second campaign, Cyber Tips 4 You. The campaign identified four cyber tips for the public to adopt: CREATING A SAFER CYBERSPACE PILLAR TWO: The four tips were presented in various broadcast and print formats, including radio channels, bus stops and MRT stations. Members of the public were also invited to attend a café-inspired event, Cybersecurity Awareness For Everyone (CAFÉ), to learn how to create strong and memorable passwords. About 12,000 visitors attended the two- day launch event held at Bedok Mall. Starting from November 2018, a Cyber Savvy Machine Pop-Up, featuring a Cyber Savvy vending machine and information panels, will make its rounds to one public library each month over a period of one year. Library-goers can test their cybersecurity knowledge by attempting a quiz on the machine and win a small gift in the process. Supporting the outreach effort are students from Nanyang Polytechnic, who will help to spread cybersecurity messages at the library on selected days. They will also showcase a “Cyber Savvy game”, which they developed with CSA, in the respective libraries. CYBERGREEN CyberGreen aims to research and aggregate open source information to measure and create awareness of the cyber health status of a country. In partnership with the CyberGreen Institute, Singapore developed cyber health metrics for the ASEAN region to provide an overview of the overall state of cyber health while allowing regional Computer Emergency INTERNET HYGIENE RATING AND BENCHMARKING Visitors trying their hand at creating a strong password at the “Cyber Tips 4 You” campaign at Bedok Mall in May 2018.

FEATURED TOPIC Through R&D, DSO National Laboratories developed the DSO Crypto Chip to protect Singapore’s sensitive communications and information from potential adversaries. Its small size and low power consumption13 allow it to be used on space- and power-constrained systems, while meeting the challenging demands of high throughput and security. The chip incorporates DSO’s unique protection mechanism, which destroys all secret data when tampered. This would render the chip useless. SECURING OUR COMMUNICATIONS – DSO CRYPTO CHIP CSA implemented the Internet Hygiene Rating and Benchmarking (IHRB) tool for CII Sector Leads and owners in 2018. The tool incorporates a management-friendly dashboard that improves an organisation’s cybersecurity situational awareness, and encourages regular self-checks by benchmarking against entities in the same or similar industries. It also enhances the organisation’s Internet hygiene level through the constant review of ratings based on industry- specific threats and trends. All CII Sector Leads and owners are given access to the IHRB for their continuous internal monitoring. Through this data-driven security performance rating, Sector Leads and owners are able to create a common benchmark for comparison, enabling them to come up with proactive policies to improve their cybersecurity. Response Teams (CERTs) to carry out remediation and mitigation efforts proactively. In 2018, the platform added more scanning locations and enhanced the risk protocols matrix. It also provided better visualisations and allowed countries to compare their state of cyber health with others. 38 39 CHAPTER 3 SINGAPORE’S CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY – DEVELOPMENTS IN 2018 FEATURED TOPIC INNOVATION CYBERSECURITY ECOSYSTEM @ BLOCK71 In March 2018, CSA and the Info-communications Media Development Authority (IMDA) supported the establishment of the Innovation Cybersecurity Ecosystem at Block71 (ICE71), for three key programmes: 1. ICE71 Inspire – A bootcamp targeting the academia and industry to deepen appreciation for entrepreneurship, provide networking opportunities, and enable potential entrepreneurs to get valuable insights from cyber and innovation experts. 2. ICE71 Accelerate – An accelerator programme for early-stage start-ups to gain access to talent, mentors, funding and local ecosystem events. 3. ICE71 Scale – To provide access to complimentary working space, testing facilities, regional markets and corporate support services for start-ups. In less than a year, ICE71 has organised a total of 40 events and reached out to more than 50,000 members of the public. Its programmes have also engaged some 200 mentors who have helped guide the start-ups in their go-to-market strategies. DEVELOPING A VIBRANT CYBERSECURITY ECOSYSTEM PILLAR THREE: ENCOURAGING INDUSTRY INNOVATION AND BUILDING ADVANCED CAPABILITIES THROUGH R&D CSA works with Government agencies, universities, research institutes, and industry to encourage innovation for next-generation solutions to meet the needs of local and international markets. Efforts in 2018 included: 14 They include Ascendas-Singbridge, PacificLight Power, Singapore LNG Corporation, Singapore Press Holdings, and SMRT Corporation. 15 The Common Criteria product assurance certification, or ISO/IEC 15408, is the de facto standard for cybersecurity product certification around the world. 16 In 2018, the NCR secured additional S$50 million of funding till 2020 to focus on four areas – cloud security, cyber forensic and assurance, applications security and edge computing, and artificial intelligence for cybersecurity. a. Lean LaunchPad Programme (LLP) Cybersecurity Track. CSA and the National Research Foundation (NRF) supported the LLP Cybersecurity Track, a 10-week experiential learning programme to equip cybersecurity researchers and young start-ups with the necessary networks, tools, and market validation to bring their inventions to market. b. Industry Call for Innovation. To catalyse the development of innovative cybersecurity solutions and adoption by end users, CSA initiated an Industry Call for Innovation in 2018. CSA collaborated with industry14 to consolidate their cyber needs into challenge statements. The Call drew more than 70 proposals from industry solution providers to develop solutions for 10 challenge statements. c. Establishing National Satellites of Excellence (NSoEs). Anchored in local universities, the NSoEs were established to build and consolidate local research strengths in domains of national interest. Their research focuses on Trustworthy Software Systems, Mobile Systems Security & Cloud Security, and Design Science and Technologies for Secure Critical Infrastructure. d. Singapore Common Criteria Scheme. Singapore attained the status of a Common Criteria15 Certificate Authorising Nation in January 2019. With this, local developers need not send their product overseas for certification, saving time and costs. This increases the potential of IT- security products produced in Singapore for export, strengthens Singapore’s competitiveness in the global cybersecurity market, and attracts global evaluation and testing laboratories to base their operations in Singapore. e. National Cybersecurity R&D Programme (NCR). Together with NRF, CSA chairs the NCR to fund projects16 that seeks to improve the trustworthiness of cyber infrastructure with emphasis on security, resilience, and usability. Examples of funded projects include SecureAge-NUS’s advanced anti-malware solution using deep learning, and Scantist-NTU’s smart binary-level vulnerability assessment for cyber-attack prevention.

Source: Smart Nation and Digital Government Group. MINDEF/SAF has also formed and operationalised Defence Cyber Incident Response Teams (DCIRTs). These DCIRTs are made up of personnel from MINDEF, SAF, Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA), and DSO National Laboratories. Their responsibilities include responding to cyber incidents in the Defence Sector, and supporting and augmenting CSA’s cyber incident response efforts at the national-level. Cybersecurity is essential to safeguard the convenience and productivity we enjoy with digital connectivity and smart devices. I look forward to serving as a cyber defender to protect our cyberspace. – Mr Sng Yu Feng Chester, recipient of Smart Nation Scholarship, expressing his commitment to Singapore’s cybersecurity 17 The seven other associations are: (i) Cloud Security Alliance; (ii) ISACA Singapore Chapter; (iii) (ISC)2 Singapore Chapter; (iv) IT Service Management Forum Singapore Chapter; (v) The Law Society of Singapore; (vi) Singapore Computer Society; and (vii) SGTech. 18 Adapted from the Infocomm and Technology Security Track of the National Skills Framework. BUILDING A WORLD-CLASS TALENT POOL To promote the growth and development of cybersecurity students and professionals, CSA worked closely with industry, academia and associations to build a pipeline of cybersecurity talent for Singapore through the following initiatives in 2018: • Launching the annual Youth Cyber Exploration Programme (YCEP) with Singapore Polytechnic, to inculcate student interest in cybersecurity. • Co-organising the Cybersecurity Career Mentoring Programme (CCMP) with the Singapore Computer Society (SCS) to provide career guidance in the field of cybersecurity. • Launching the Student Volunteer & Recognition Programme (SVRP) with the Association of Information Security Professionals (AiSP). CSA also supported AiSP in updating and maintaining a cybersecurity Body of Knowledge (BOK), to provide knowledge-based perspectives for industry, Institutes of Technical Education (ITEs), polytechnics and universities. • Establishing the annual Cybersecurity Awards with AiSP and the support of seven17 other professional and industry associations, to recognise contributions to the cybersecurity ecosystem. • Launching the Cyber Security Competency Framework (CSCF)18 in CSA and introducing it to the Whole-of-Government (WoG) for cybersecurity professionals. CSCF lays out structured development pathways to drive capability development through targeted training, professional certification and career progression. • Launching the Smart Nation Scholarship (SNS) with the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) and IMDA to develop and nurture tech leaders and talents in the Public Service. Four scholarships for cybersecurity were awarded in 2018. 42 43 CHAPTER 3 SINGAPORE’S CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY – DEVELOPMENTS IN 2018 Singapore is an active participant at international platforms and fora on cybersecurity. As an ASEAN member, Singapore supported and contributed to regional efforts to build cybersecurity capabilities. Singapore is partnering with the UN Office for Disarmament STRENGTHENING INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS PILLAR FOUR: ASEAN cybersecurity and ICT Ministers at the 3rd AMCC in September 2018 agreed to subscribe in-principle to the 11 voluntary, non- binding norms recommended in the 2015 UNGGE report. Source: CSA. FEATURED TOPIC In 2017, the National Cyber Security Centre of The Netherlands (NCSC- NL) together with CSA conducted a landscape study to identify gaps in Internet of Things (IoT) security standards and technology. The findings were refined into a set of working initiatives for IoT security that were jointly proposed by Singapore and The Netherlands at the Annual Meeting of the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise (GFCE), co-branded with SICW’s IoT Security Roundtable, during SICW 2018. The initiatives aimed to lead and galvanise global efforts in creating a safer and more secure IoT. In the initial phase of the IoT Security Initiative, NCSC-NL and CSA agreed to prioritise the efforts on three most critical areas, namely, Certification and Testing, Supply Chain Security, and Unique Device Identities. GALVANISING GLOBAL EFFORTS Affairs (UNODA) on an online training course to promote understanding and implementation of agreements reached by the UNGGE, and a UN- Singapore Cyber Programme to build awareness of cyber norms and cyber scenario policy planning in ASEAN Member States. FEATURED TOPIC ENHANCING CAPACITY AND CAPABILITIES IN CYBERSECURITY TOGETHER Singapore will launch the S$30 million ASEAN-Singapore Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence (ASCCE) in 2019, an extension of the S$10 million ASEAN Cyber Capacity Programme that has been contributing to the enhancement of ASEAN’s cybersecurity capabilities in both the technical and policy aspects. The ASCCE will complement existing initiatives, such as the ASEAN-Japan Cybersecurity Capacity Building Centre in Thailand. It will focus on strengthening ASEAN Member States’ cyber strategy development, legislation and research capabilities, increasing technical expertise and incident response skills of national CERTs in the region. The ASCCE will also promote CERT- to-CERT open-source information sharing. In April 2018, under Singapore’s ASEAN Chairmanship, a first-ever ASEAN Leaders’ Statement on Cybersecurity Cooperation was adopted at the 32nd ASEAN Summit. Singapore has worked closely with ASEAN Member States, industry partners and international organisations such as the INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation to follow up on tasks set by ASEAN Leaders. Singapore hosted the annual ASEAN Ministerial Conference on Cybersecurity (AMCC) over the past three years to bring together Ministers from all ASEAN Member States who are responsible for ICT and cybersecurity issues, including the ASEAN Secretary-General. We helped to draft the ASEAN Cybersecurity Cooperation Strategy, which was adopted in March 2017 and provides a blueprint for coordination of cybersecurity capacity building efforts. Participants at the 3rd AMCC in September 2018 agreed to subscribe in-principle to the 11 voluntary, non-binding norms recommended in the 2015 Report of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UNGGE). They also agreed to focus on regional capacity building in implementing these norms. Singapore has consistently advocated for the international community to build consensus and develop a rules- and norms-based international order in cyberspace, where its users can remain safe and secure. Singapore stands ready to work with all parties toward closer international cooperation in the cyber and digital sphere. – Mr S. Iswaran, Minister for Communications and Information, and Minister-in-Charge of Cybersecurity, on Singapore’s efforts in building a safe and secure cyberspace 44 45 CHAPTER 3 SINGAPORE’S CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY – DEVELOPMENTS IN 2018 0 0 0 110 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 MORE FREQUENT DATA BREACHES MORE DISRUPTIVE ATTACKS AGAINST THE CLOUD GREATER RISKS FOR SMART BUILDINGS AND CONNECTED SYSTEMS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE – DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD INCREASED THREAT TO GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS BIOMETRIC DATA MORE VALUABLE TO THREAT ACTORS 1 2 3 4 5 6 Data has become the most valued ‘commodity’ in cyberspace, which means cybercriminals will try even harder to breach computer databases – especially those that store large amounts of private and personal information. As buildings and factories become ‘smarter’ – through the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and connected industrial control systems (ICS) – the risk of them being attacked to hold their owners to ransom, or exploited to spread malware or conduct DDoS attacks, also increases. Threat actors will focus on disrupting supply chains which have become highly interconnected and automated. Industries dominated by a few companies are especially vulnerable, as problems in one stage of production may potentially lead to a breakdown in the entire supply chain. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be a double-edged sword for cybersecurity – it can significantly enhance the capabilities of security systems, such as in anomaly detection and response. However, threat actors can also leverage AI to search for vulnerabilities in computer systems, and create ‘smarter’ malware. With more databases hosted in the cloud, threat actors will be on the lookout for potential vulnerabilities in cloud infrastructure. While their primary goal remains data theft, threat actors will also try to exploit cloud services for other malicious aims, such as to amplify Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. As biometric authentication becomes increasingly common, threat actors will shift to target and manipulate biometric data, to build virtual identities and gain access to personal information. What would the next few years portend for cybersecurity? The combination of technological advancements and our transition into ever higher levels of connectivity means that cyber threats will become even more targeted, sophisticated and deceptive. These are six trends we foresee happening in the near future: 0 0 0 110 1 1 1 0 0 0 110 1 1 1 0 0 101 0 0 0 110 1 1 1 0 0 0 110 1 1 1 0100010010010 10 0 010 0 010 0 010 0 0 0 01 00100010000010010001 00100001000010010010 0 0 010 0 0 010 0 0 010 010 0 LOOKING AHEAD ANTICIPATED TRENDS 46 47  LOOKING AHEAD ANTICIPATED TRENDS FEATURED TOPIC IoT – THE INSECURITY OF THINGS? The IoT has been an industry buzzword for years. As we become increasingly reliant on interconnected devices in every aspect of our lives, there lies the concomitant need to protect potentially billions of them from intrusions and interference that could compromise personal privacy or threaten public safety. In recent years, massive IoT botnets such as Mirai, Hajime and Persirai have shown themselves to be capable of globally destructive attacks. A report released by cybersecurity firm F5 Labs last year stated that Singapore has constantly appeared in the top five 19 Boddy, Sara and Shattuck, Justin. “The Hunt for IoT: The Growth and Evolution of Thingbots Ensures Chaos,” F5 Labs – Threat Analysis Report, 13 March 2018, evolution-of-thingbots-ensures-chaos. destinations for IoT attacks19. There are also privacy concerns when IoT devices are being targeted, with the Police having received reports of victims finding their IP cameras compromised and sometimes manipulated to film in a particular direction. It has never been more crucial to secure this interconnected world that we live in. For a start, every stakeholder must play their role in ensuring basic security mistakes – such as open ports, default credentials, and data sent without encryption – are excised from IoT equipment. 48 49  LOOKING AHEAD ANTICIPATED TRENDS GLOSSARY Term Definition Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) An attack in which perpetrators successfully gain access to a targeted system, and stay undetected for a long period of time to exfiltrate, modify, or destroy critical data. APTs can also refer to the advanced, and often state-linked or state-sponsored threat actors that conduct extended campaigns, such as cyber espionage. Attack Surface Referring to all vulnerable resources of a system, or the sum of the points through which an attacker could try to enter an environment. Bot/Botnet An automated software program used to carry out specific tasks. A botnet is a network of compromised computers infected with malicious bots, controlled as a group without the owners' knowledge. Brute-force attack A trial-and-error method which involves trying various combinations of usernames and passwords repetitively to gain access into a computer system or website. Command and control (C&C) servers Centralised devices operated by attackers to maintain communications with compromised systems (known as botnets) within a target network. Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) The computer or computer system necessary for the continuous delivery of an essential service, which the loss or compromise thereof will have a debilitating effect on the availability of the essential services in Singapore. Cryptocurrency A form of digital token secured by cryptography and can be used as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value. Used synonymously with digital or virtual currency. Examples include Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin. Crypto-jacking The unauthorized use of a computer or computer system by cybercriminals to mine cryptocurrency. Cybercrime Refers to cyber-extortion, online cheating cases, and offences under the Computer Misuse Act (CMA) such as unauthorised access of computer material and unauthorised use of computer service. Cyberspace The complex environment resulting from the interaction of people, software and services on the Internet by means of technology devices and networks connected to it, which does not exist in any physical form. Singapore’s cyberspace includes domain names with “.SG” or Singapore- mentions, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses used in Singapore, and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) located here. Term Definition Dark Web A section of the Internet only accessible through software that allows users to remain anonymous or untraceable. The Dark Web is part of the Deep Web. The Deep Web encompasses web resources that search engines like Google and Yahoo cannot find, such as legitimate but private resources (e.g. e-mail), or public resources behind a paywall or login wall (e.g. paid journal subscriptions). Data Breach The unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks of personal data/ information in an organisation's possession or under its control. Denial of Service (DoS) / Distributed DoS (DDoS) Where an attacker attempts to prevent legitimate users from accessing information or services online. The most common and obvious type of DoS attack occurs when an attacker \"floods\" a network with information. In a distributed DoS attack, an attacker takes unauthorised control of multiple computers, which may be harnessed as a botnet, to launch a DoS attack. Hacktivists An individual or group who wants to undermine the reputation or destabilise the operations of an entity, or to publicise their political or social agenda and gain recognition, usually by hacking an organisation's website. Industrial Control Systems (ICS) ICS belong to a class of operational technology (OT) systems used in nearly every industrial sector to monitor, control and automate industrial operations and processes. Internet of Things (IoT) The vast network of everyday objects, like baby monitors, printers, televisions, and autonomous vehicles that are connected to the Internet. Keylogging The use of a software to record every keystroke that is made by a user on a computing device. It is usually done covertly for malicious intent, such as gaining knowledge of passwords. Malware Malicious software intended to perform unauthorised processes that will have adverse impact on the security of a computer system. E.g. virus, worm, Trojan horse, spyware and adware. Personal Data / Information Data which, on its own (e.g. full name, NRIC number) or in combination with other available data (e.g. medical or educational information, can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity. Phishing A common technique used by threat actors to trick people (typically through e-mails) into divulging personal information, transferring money, or installing malware. Ransomware Malware that encrypts files on a victim's device, rendering them unusable until a ransom is paid, usually in the form of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency. It may spread through phishing e-mails that contain malicious attachments or links, or malicious pop-ups that appear when users access unsafe websites. Spoofing Tricking computer systems or other users by hiding or faking one’s true identity. Commonly spoofed targets include e-mails, IP addresses, and websites. 50 51 Cyber Security Agency of Singapore Website: General enquiries/feedback: contact@csa.gov.sg GoSafeOnline Website: General enquiries/feedback: gosafeonline@csa.gov.sg SingCERT Hotline for incident reporting: (+65) 6323 5052 E-mail for incident reporting: singcert@csa.gov.sg ScamAlert Contact anti-scam helpline: (+65) 1800 722 6688 Visit ScamAlert website: If you have any feedback on this publication, or wish to find out more about Singapore’s efforts in cybersecurity, please visit the following websites or contact us: If you wish to report a cybersecurity incident, please contact: If you wish to seek scam-related advice: 52 mailto:contact%40csa.gov.sg?subject= mailto:gosafeonline%40csa.gov.sg?subject= mailto:singcert%40csa.gov.sg?subject=",

ISBN: 978-981-14-1612-5   Designed by: APT811 Design & Innovation Agency www.apt811.com  1  https://www.apt811.com   FOREWORD  Cybersecurity incidents made some of the  biggest headlines in 2018. Data breaches,   in particular, were reported across multiple  industries. Facebook, Cathay Pacific and   Marriott were just some of the high-profile  organisations that were hacked and had   sensitive information stolen.   Singapore was not spared as well. We were  hit by the most serious data breach in our  history – 1.5 million SingHealth patients had  their non-medical personal particulars illegally  accessed and copied. As cyber threats grow in  scale and sophistication, it is clearly no longer a  question of “if”, but rather “when” an attack will  hit us. Even as we strive to make our systems  as secure as possible, it is imperative that we  respond to an incident swiftly, robustly and  decisively. The cyber-attack on SingHealth was  a stark reminder for us to push further in our  cybersecurity efforts collectively as a nation.  On the international stage, Singapore remains  firmly committed to the establishment of a rules- based international order in cyberspace; and  condemns all malicious cyber activities, which  threaten the safety and security of Singapore  and Singaporeans.   2018 also saw significant progress in enhancing  Singapore’s cybersecurity. We passed and  implemented the Cybersecurity Act, which  provides a legal framework for the oversight and  maintenance of cybersecurity in Singapore. To  nurture a vibrant cybersecurity ecosystem, we  launched initiatives such as the Industry Call for  Innovation, which laid the ground for long-term,  holistic cybersecurity investments, and the   David Koh Commissioner of Cybersecurity and  Chief Executive Cyber Security Agency of Singapore  Smart Nation Scholarship, to support talented  students pursuing a career in cybersecurity. In  addition, the establishment of the $30 million  ASEAN-Singapore Cybersecurity Centre of  Excellence underscores Singapore’s efforts  to build regional cyber capacity and promote  international collaboration.   Singapore marks its Bicentennial  Commemoration in 2019. This journey over the  last 200 years has seen us develop from a small  trading outpost to a global digital hub. As we  advance towards our vision of a Smart Nation,  cybersecurity is a vital prerequisite   and key enabler – the invisible glue that instils  trust and confidence in our digital plans. We  hope this third edition of the Singapore Cyber  Landscape will provide useful lessons from  past incidents, so that we can better prepare  ourselves for the digital future. Let us keep  Singapore’s cyberspace safe   and secure, together.  2 3    DDoS ATTACK PEAKS  JAN  APR  JUL  OCT  FEB  AUG  NOV  MAR  JUN  SEP  DEC  MAY  • APT-attributed malware (nicknamed  ‘Olympic Destroyer’) disrupted Opening  Ceremony of the PyeongChang Winter  Olympic Games  • Ransomware attacks hit Port of San Diego  • Facebook data breach affected    30 million users  • Financial information of 429,000 passengers   stolen in British Airways data breach   • Unauthorised access to more than 200  State Courts electronic case files  • User accounts belonging to academic staff  in four Singapore universities compromised  in cyber-attack  • PageUp malware breach affected 300,000  Careers@Gov portal users  • 72 user accounts in Health Promotion  Board’s HealthHub portal accessed illegally  • Personal particulars of 1.5 million patients  stolen in cyber-attack on SingHealth  • Largest Distributed Denial-of-Service  (DDoS) attack in history on unidentified  US-based service provider  • SamSam ransomware disrupted Atlanta’s  municipal services  • Guest information stolen from 383 million  Marriott International accounts  • Personal details of German   politicians exposed  • Cathay Pacific Airways data breach  affected 9.4 million passengers   CYBER THREATS IN 2018 OVERVIEW OF  RECORD PEAKS OF DISTRIBUTED DENIAL-  OF-SERVICE ATTACKS – A COMPARISON In 2018, the largest Distributed Denial-of- Service (DDoS) attack ever recorded was  conducted using a relatively new method.

This chapter details our observations on some of  these cyber threats, trends, and motivations from  the period of January to December 2018.  INFORMATION  8 9    ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREATS  DISRUPTIONIn the past two editions of the Singapore  Cyber Landscape, we highlighted the  significance and potential impact that  Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)  have on our cyber ecosystem. Often  associated with a nation-state, APT  groups have access to a wealth of  resources and deep expertise to achieve  their objectives, which include causing  disruption, cyber theft for financial gain,  and conducting cyber espionage.  FINANCIAL GAIN  A number of high-profile cyber-attacks  targeting payment systems were  attributed to APTs, resulting in significant  losses to affected financial institutions.  These attacks typically involve tactics,  techniques and procedures (TTPs) such  as phishing e-mails to compromise  employee accounts and gain access  to systems and networks, as well as  technical methods to cover the attackers’  tracks. In June 2018, attackers breached  the SWIFT payment system at the Bank  of Chile and the Cosmos Bank, siphoning  off US$10 million and US$13.5 million  respectively, through fraudulent wire  transfer requests. These attacks were  likely conducted by the same APT group.  APT groups may choose to target  prominent, highly-visible international  events with the aim of disrupting them to  draw attention. The Opening Ceremony  of the PyeongChang Winter Olympic  Games in February 2018 was one such  example. The attack, attributed to an  Asia-based APT group, disrupted Internet  access and telecasts, and shut down  websites covering the event.   Another type of APT attack seeks to  disrupt operations. Shamoon, a type  of wiper malware associated with an  APT group based in the Middle East,  is designed to wipe data and render  endpoints and servers unbootable. This  prevents the targeted organisation from  conducting business as usual. First seen  in 2012 in the energy industry, it re- emerged in December 2018, affecting  a number of organisations across many  industries in the Middle East.  CYBER ESPIONAGE  APT groups are known for conducting  information gathering and cyber  espionage. Information gathered can be  useful for intelligence purposes, and/or  give countries a competitive advantage  over rivals during state negotiations.  One such example was a watering hole1  campaign active in the last quarter of 2018  that compromised several government  and media websites in Vietnam and  Cambodia. These websites were used to  infect visitors with spying malware. This  attack was attributed to an Asia-based  APT group that cybersecurity experts  had identified as being behind several  espionage and spear-phishing campaigns  targeting Southeast Asian countries.   1  A watering hole attack is a type of cyber-attack targeting a particular organisation, where malware is delivered from websites  that are regularly visited by the organisation’s members and infects its systems.  10 11  CHAPTER 1 SPOTLIGHT ON CYBER THREATS    WEBSITE DEFACEMENTS  CSA detected 605 cases of website  defacement in Singapore in 2018, a  70 per cent decrease from 2,040 in  2017. These websites belong to a range  of organisations – from government  agencies, businesses, and media  companies. Two Singapore Government  websites were among those defaced.  While most affected websites belong to  Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs),  larger organisations were also hit.   For example, the Singapore website  of a major Japanese advertising firm  was compromised and replaced by a  message “Sec == ‘0’” in January 2018.  A spike in defacements observed in  November 2018 was likely caused by  an attacker exploiting vulnerabilities in  an unpatched web server. 101 websites  belonging to various businesses hosted  on this server were compromised  by the same attacker in a single  day. Defacements are indicative of  vulnerabilities present in a website’s  underlying infrastructure. This may be  a harbinger of more damaging cyber- attacks, such as hosting malicious  content on the website or using it as a  platform to launch attacks.  Defacements usually take place when  unpatched/ outdated websites and their  hosting servers are attacked. Common  methods of intrusion include Structured  Query Language (SQL) injections,   2  “[SingCERT] Alert on WordPress 4.9.7 Security Release,” SingCERT Advisories & Alerts, 12 July 2018,  https://www.csa.gov.sg/singcert/news/advisories-alerts/alert-on-wordpress-4-9-7-security-release.  1,750Year 2016  Year 2017  Year 2018  2,040  605  WEBSITE DEFACEMENTS (2016 – 2018)  NO.

Websites published on the WordPress platform  remained the most targeted for defacements in  2018, continuing a trend observed since 2016. In  Singapore, over a third of the websites defaced  were built on WordPress. A WordPress file  deletion vulnerability, first disclosed on 26 June  2018 and affecting all versions of WordPress up to  then, could allow an attacker to have full control  over the website. WordPress released an updated  platform version that fixed the vulnerability on 5  July 2018, and SingCERT published an alert a week  later, advising WordPress website owners and web  hosting providers to update to the latest version  immediately.2 However, as of March 2019, about   40 per cent of the defaced WordPress websites  had yet to be patched to the latest version.  Worryingly, 185 of the defaced websites – or about  30 per cent of the cases – were defaced previously.  Re-defacements suggest that website owners  have yet to take appropriate security and patching  measures to protect their websites, even after  being attacked before. The variety of intrusion and  compromise methods underlines the importance  of using stronger login credentials and timely  patching of known vulnerabilities.   3 IN 10 websites were    defaced previously  In January 2018, the  Singapore website of a major  Japanese advertising firm  was compromised, with its  homepage replaced only with  the message “Sec == ‘0’”.  12 13  CHAPTER 1 SPOTLIGHT ON CYBER THREATS  https://www.csa.gov.sg/singcert/news/advisories-alerts/alert-on-wordpress-4-9-7-security-release   16,100 phishing URLs   with a Singapore-link were  observed in 2018, a 30 per  cent decrease from 2017.   Phishing e-mails usually  spoof, or pretend to originate  from, reputable firms and  organisations. Companies in   the banking and financial  services, technology, and file  hosting services made up  almost 90 per cent of spoofed  companies in 2018.   In Singapore, websites of  Government organisations such  as Ministry of Manpower (MOM),  Singapore Police Force (SPF)  and Immigration & Checkpoints  Authority (ICA) were commonly  spoofed to steal personal and  financial data from victims.  Phishing activity typically  increases when major events  occur. Threat actors dupe  victims into opening phishing  e-mails and their attachments   PHISHING URLS  JAN FEB MAR APR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEP OCT NOV DEC  1,879  767  1,526  3,849  812  1,931  1,155  1,867  2,406  553  1,601 1,786  by taking advantage of their  interest in such events. During  the FIFA World Cup tournament  in June 2018, several soccer- themed phishing e-mails  and websites were observed,  targeting sports fans with fake  gifts from FIFA or its sponsors.  Fans who responded to these   NUMBER OF PHISHING URLS WITH A SINGAPORE-LINK OBSERVED IN 2018  COMMONLY SPOOFED ORGANISATIONS IN 2018   TAKING ADVANTAGE   OF “HTTPS”  2,450 phishing URLs   were observed using   “HTTPS” in 2018, a more   than tenfold jump from   just 200 of such URLs in   2017. Using “HTTPS” –    rather than “HTTP” –   lures victims into a false   sense of security, by   having them believe that   they were transacting    on a secure website.  USE OF DYNAMIC DOMAIN  NAME SYSTEM SERVICES  (DDNS) SERVICES  210 URLs were   observed using DDNS  services in 2018, three  times more than in 2017.   Such services enable  malicious URLs to   change their IP   addresses constantly   to evade applications   that block static   malicious IP addresses.  LEVERAGING GENERIC   TOP LEVEL DOMAINS  Domains such as  “.com” (8,100 URLs)  and “.club” (700 URLs)  were commonly abused,  making up more than  half the observations  for 2018. They are  relatively cheap (or  even available for free)  and lack regulation,  allowing threat actors to  constantly create new  malicious URLs.  Users are advised to remain vigilant against  phishing attacks, and to be cautious and verify  the identity of the sender, before clicking on  suspicious URLs.  OK  “giveaways” ended up giving  away their personal information  to cybercriminals. Separately, in  the lead-up to the Democratic  People’s Republic of Korea-USA  Singapore Summit held in June  2018, an intelligence-gathering  campaign targeted South  Koreans with phishing e-mails.   These contained malware  that could be used for  keylogging and executing  malicious commands on  compromised devices.  Increasingly, threat actors  are also using ingenious  tactics to trick individuals  and evade detection.  Some examples include  the use of HTTPS,  Dynamic Domain Name  System (DDNS) services,  and using generic top  level domains:  1st Banking and Financial Services   (e.g. Bank of America)  2nd Technology   (e.g. Microsoft)  3rd File Hosting Services   (e.g. Dropbox)  Bank of America Microsoft  Facebook  Dropbox  PayPal  Amazon  Apple AT&T Alibaba  Google  Yahoo Adobe  Free Mobile France Postmaster  Docusign  GitLab ATB Financial  Chase Bank  Mailbox  DHL  14 15  CHAPTER 1 SPOTLIGHT ON CYBER THREATS    MALWARE Fewer ransomware cases were reported to   CSA in 2018. There were also significantly fewer  Command and Control (C&C) servers observed  in Singapore; however, the number of botnet  drones – compromised computers infected   with malware – remained largely similar.  RANSOMWARE 21 ransomware cases were reported to CSA   in 2018, a decrease from 25 in 2017. Although  the number of reported cases is low, the actual  number of ransomware cases may be higher as   many go unreported. Ransomware affected  systems across multiple industries in Singapore,  such as construction, education, and food and  beverage. While there were no global widespread  campaigns like the WannaCry attacks seen  in 2017, ransomware remains lucrative, and  continues to evolve in sophistication.   GandCrab was described as “one of the most  aggressive forms of ransomware”3 in 2018.   Since its discovery in January 2018, GandCrab  has infected over half a million computers and is  believed to have extorted around US$300 million   3  “The GandCrab Ransomware Mindset,” Check Point Research, 13 March 2018,   https://research.checkpoint.com/gandcrab-ransomware-mindset.  4  On 22 March 2018, the City of Atlanta in the US state of Georgia suffered a ransomware attack which affected several local  government systems and disrupted businesses. Almost US$17 million was reportedly spent in recovery efforts. The ransomware  used in the attack, dubbed ‘SamSam’, was also linked to another ransomware attack on the Port of San Diego in September 2018.  5  Palmer, Danny. “Cybercrime: Ransomware remains a 'key' malware threat says Europol,” ZDNet, 18 September 2018,   https://www.zdnet.com/article/cybercrime-ransomware-remains-a-key-malware-threat-says-europol.  FEATURED TOPIC  Machine learning and data- driven detection systems  are being adopted in  cybersecurity applications  to cope with rapidly evolving  cyber-attacks. However,  threat actors are now  leveraging adversarial  Artificial Intelligence (AI)  technologies to deceive  these systems. One method  of deception involves using  Generative Adversarial  Networks (GANs) to create  new variants from known   ADVERSARIAL AI IN CYBERSECURITY  malware that are able to  bypass malware detectors.  One way to counter this attack  would be to include GAN  samples during re-training,   so that the malware detector  is tuned to identify this class  of mutated samples.  To combat against new cyber- attacks, AI engines constantly  train and update their models.  This adaptive learning  process, however, creates an  opportunity for threat actors   GANDCRAB, THE MONEY- GRABBING RANSOMWARE  GandCrab is offered in the  Dark Web as Ransomware- as-a-Service (RaaS) by  its criminal developers.  Modeled after Software-as- a-Service (SaaS) principles,  cybercriminals without  programming knowledge  would rent such ransomware  for their malicious activities,  and pay the developers by  sharing a portion of   the collected ransoms.   Some characteristics of GandCrab  include: (a) being frequently updated  to evade detection and deletion, (b)  targeting mainly English-speaking  countries, and (c) customisable  ransom demands.   As part of the No More Ransom  initiative, free decryption tools for  later versions of GandCrab are made  available for affected victims to  recover their files. This public-private  cooperation exemplifies the need for  collaboration between government  and industry partners to combat  global cyber threats together.  to poison data used to  train the models and  thus influence decision  boundaries. One method  of defending against  this type of attack  involves processing the  training data to identify  potential adversarial data  manipulation first, before  providing them to train  the AI engines.   in ransom payments. In February 2018, a private  financial institution in Singapore was infected   with GandCrab, when one of its employees   surfed a compromised website and was  prompted to install a ‘font update pack’ for  displaying the website properly.  Ransomware remains a common threat. Europol  has warned that targeted ransomware attacks  which are tailored to specific organisations or  individuals, such as GandCrab and SamSam,4  may become the new normal.5 Organisations  should ensure that their systems are regularly  updated to thwart known ransomware threats.  They should also not make any form of payment  demanded, as there is no certainty they would  get their data back.  16 17  CHAPTER 1 SPOTLIGHT ON CYBER THREATS  https://research.checkpoint.com/gandcrab-ransomware-mindset https://www.zdnet.com/article/cybercrime-ransomware-remains-a-key-malware-threat-says-europol   FEATURED TOPIC  Open ports attract malware infection and may be  used to launch cyber-attacks, such as Distributed  Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS attacks  inundate websites and services with incoming  traffic, causing them to become unavailable. In  February 2018, the two largest DDoS attacks  recorded in history occurred just five days apart  from each other. Unlike large-scale DDoS attacks  that usually employ malware-driven botnets, these  two attacks stemmed from servers where specific  ports were left open unnecessarily.6   The first attack peaked at 1.35 Tbps and targeted  the developer platform, GitHub. The peak was 30  per cent higher than the previous record set by the  attack targeting Dyn in 2016. The second attack  targeted a US-based service provider, and set the  current peak record of 1.7 Tbps.  If users must utilise open ports for their work, they  should always safeguard them by avoiding default  credentials, and close the open ports promptly  when not in use.

WannaCryConfickerGamarue GamutMirai Others  0%  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70%  80%  90%  100%  DECNOVOCTSEPAUGJULJUNMAYAPRMARFEBJAN  COMMAND AND CONTROL SERVERS AND BOTNET DRONES  On average, nearly 2,900 botnet drones with  Singapore IP addresses were observed daily.7  About 470 malware variants were detected,  but the top five malware observed – Gamarue,  Conficker, Mirai, Wannacry, and Gamut –  accounted for over half of observed infections,  echoing trends observed in previous years.  These are not new malware; Conficker, in  particular, dates back to 2008.  The top malware, Gamarue, steals personal  information and can also function as a  medium to distribute other malicious  programs. Although Gamarue’s infrastructure  was largely dismantled in an international  operation in December 2017, efforts to  wipe it out completely had been slow and  challenging,8 and Gamarue had continued  to infect systems throughout 2018.9 The  persistence of Gamarue infections into 2018   suggests that many users have yet to patch  their devices, or use antivirus software, to  prevent infections. This is also the likely  explanation for how WannaCry – the  ransomware that wrecked havoc across the  globe in 2017 that can now be easily detected  by antivirus software – continued to persist on  local systems and computers.   Separately, the Mirai malware had been linked  to botnet campaigns targeting unpatched  Internet of Things (IoT) devices. A number  of malicious campaigns are increasingly  leveraging open-source Mirai malware –  shared openly on the Internet – to conduct  brute-force attacks with common usernames  and passwords. The observations indicate  that many users do not change default login  credentials of their smart devices.  On average, five common malware accounted for over half the daily infections in 2018.  SingCERT is responsible for  the prevention, detection and  resolution of cybersecurity  incidents in Singapore, acting  on information provided  by government agencies,  international counterparts and  the public. When SingCERT  receives information regarding  C&C servers hosted in Singapore,  the team first confirms the  locations of the servers, and   then asks the relevant agencies  such as the Info-communications  Media Development Authority  (IMDA) or relevant abuse team of  the local hosting providers to take  them down and restore legitimate  services. When the hosting  provider is located overseas,  SingCERT collaborates with  the relevant foreign Computer  Emergency Response Teams  (CERTs) to do the same.  18 19  CHAPTER 1 SPOTLIGHT ON CYBER THREATS  https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/andromeda-botnet-still-infects-pcs-africa-asia https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/10/old-dog-new-tricks-analysing-new-rtf_15.html   CHAPTER 2  TARGET.SG   Singapore has been, and will continue to be, the  target of cyber-attacks by Advanced Persistent  Threat groups and other threat actors. This  chapter offers insights and practical lessons from  cyber-attacks that affected different segments  of Singapore in 2018, and how we can learn from  them to strengthen our collective cybersecurity.   20 21    CYBER-ATTACK ON SINGHEALTH CASE STUDY  There was, however, no evidence that the  data had been tampered with or deleted.  No clinical services were disrupted, and  patient care remained uncompromised.  The Committee of Inquiry (COI) into the  cyber-attack on SingHealth’s database  system established that the cyber- attack was the work of a skilled and  sophisticated actor, which bore the  characteristics of an Advanced   Persistent Threat (APT) group. The  COI found that the attacker was well- resourced, and had used advanced  techniques and tools to target the  SingHealth patient database and illegally  exfiltrate patient data. The attacker was  persistent, evaded detection for a long  time, and even re-entered the network  after being detected.  WHAT HAPPENED?   The attacker gained initial access to SingHealth’s IT  network around August 2017, by infecting front end  workstations, most likely through phishing attacks.  After lying dormant for several months, the attacker  moved laterally through the network between  December 2017 and June 2018, compromising  additional endpoints, servers and user accounts.   From May 2018, the attacker made multiple  unsuccessful attempts to connect to SingHealth’s  patient database system. On 26 June 2018, the  attacker obtained credentials to the database, and  began querying and exfiltrating patient records the  following day.  On 4 July 2018, an IT administrator at Integrated  Health Information Systems (IHiS), the IT agency  serving the public healthcare sector including  SingHealth, noticed suspicious queries made on the  database. The suspicious queries were terminated  by IHiS’s IT administrators, and measures were put  in place to prevent further queries from being made.   On 10 July 2018, the cyber incident was escalated  to the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA),  SingHealth’s senior management, the Ministry of  Health (MOH), and Ministry of Health Holdings  (MOHH). CSA’s National Cyber Incident Response  Team (NCIRT) was immediately deployed on site to  work with IHiS to carry out joint investigations and  remediation. They took steps to contain the threat,  eliminate the attacker’s footholds, and prevent  recurrence of the attack.   In 2018, SingHealth’s network  was the target of a deliberate  and well-planned cyber-attack.  The scale of this cyber-attack was  unprecedented. The personal  particulars of 1.5 million patients  and the outpatient dispensed  medication records of 160,000 of  them were illegally accessed and  copied. Prime Minister Lee Hsien  Loong’s records were specifically  and repeatedly targeted.  TARGET.GOV.SG  Even as we do our best to secure our systems,   it is a matter of when, not if, our systems are breached.    The cyber-attack on SingHealth is a reminder for us to do  better in our cybersecurity efforts, together as a nation.  – Mr David Koh, Commissioner of Cybersecurity and Chief Executive CSA,  emphasising the need for collective cybersecurity  22 23  CHAPTER 2 TARGET.SG    RECOMMENDATIONS  MADE BY THE COI  INTO SINGHEALTH  The COI made 16 recommendations relating to  strategic and operational measures to strengthen  the cybersecurity posture of SingHealth and IHiS.  These recommendations are generally applicable to  all organisations responsible for large databases of  personal data. Some key actions that all organisations  must consider implementing are as follows:  Include cybersecurity as  part of the organisation’s  risk management, with  deliberations and decisions  on balancing cybersecurity  and trade-offs (e.g. cost,  operational requirements)  based on unique business  considerations (e.g. patient  safety in the case of the public  healthcare sector) managed at  the senior level of leadership.  Develop cyber incident  response plans for various  scenarios, and test and  update them regularly  by conducting realistic  exercises and simulations.  Provide all staff with  training to build awareness  on the best cyber hygiene  practices, and cultivate  an organisational culture  where cybersecurity is  everyone’s responsibility.  Adopt multiple defences,  such as encryption,  firewalls and robust data- access practices, to layers  of security measures, to  better prevent, detect and  respond to cyber incidents.  Train and equip all  staff to recognise and  respond to cybersecurity  incidents, and to report  these incidents in a  timely manner.  Carry out comprehensive  and regular checks and  audits to identify gaps in   the design of and compliance  with policies, processes and  procedures, and to ensure  that these gaps are remedied  according to plan.  FEATURED TOPIC  To build a secure and resilient Smart  Nation, the Government’s approach to  cybersecurity is underpinned by two key  principles. First, we adopt a ‘defence- in-depth’ strategy, with multiple layers  of cyber defence to impede attackers.  These layers of defence cascade from the  perimeter to within the systems. Given  enough time and resources, sophisticated  and determined attackers may eventually  find their way into the system. The  layered defence approach will enable  security teams to detect any breach and  respond swiftly. Second, we enhance our  system defence on three fronts – People,  Processes and Technology. In terms of  People and Processes, the Government  is developing a stronger cybersecurity  culture across the Public Service, as well as   STRENGTHEN GOVERNMENT ICT SYSTEMS tapping on technology to support its IT staff  and automate cybersecurity tasks, such as  patch management. In terms of Technology,  the Government will continue to build up  the defence and resilience of its systems,  while implementing measures to better  detect and respond to cyber threats.  The Government can more effectively  defend our systems if we involve the global  and local communities of cyber defenders  to identify vulnerabilities and strengthen  the Government’s ICT systems. For example,  the Government Technology Agency  of Singapore (GovTech) and CSA are  partnering local and overseas cybersecurity  communities on a Government Bug Bounty  Programme (GBBP) to help search and  uncover vulnerabilities in our system.  CSA also coordinated national  efforts to mitigate the risk of a  similar attack affecting other  Critical Information Infrastructure  (CII) systems, by sharing threat  intelligence with CII owners and  instructing them to undertake  relevant security measures.   In view of further malicious  activities detected on the  SingHealth network on 19 July  2018, Internet Surfing Separation  (ISS) was temporarily imposed   on SingHealth’s IT systems on   20 July 2018. As a precautionary  measure, temporary ISS was    also implemented for IT  systems in other unaffected  public healthcare clusters  (National Healthcare Group and  National University Healthcare  System) on 22 July 2018. The  Government also paused the  rollout of new Government  ICT systems from 20 July to  3 August 2018. During the  pause, a review of its existing  cybersecurity measures was  conducted. Although there was  no evidence of Government ICT  systems being compromised in  this attack, additional measures   on critical Government systems  were introduced to detect  and respond more quickly to  cybersecurity threats.   SingHealth began contacting the  affected after the Government  announced the news of the  cyber-attack on 20 July 2018.  Concurrently, SingCERT also  issued advisories on precautions  that organisations and  members of the public could  take, in anticipation of potential  opportunistic attacks.  2  5  3  6  1  4  24 25  CHAPTER 2 TARGET.SG  https://www.csa.gov.sg/news/press-releases/govtech-and-csa-partner-cybersecurity-community-on-government-bug-bounty-programme https://www.csa.gov.sg/news/press-releases/govtech-and-csa-partner-cybersecurity-community-on-government-bug-bounty-programme https://www.csa.gov.sg/news/press-releases/press-statement-on-the-government-lifting-the-pause-on-new-ict-systems https://www.csa.gov.sg/news/press-releases/press-statement-on-the-government-lifting-the-pause-on-new-ict-systems https://www.csa.gov.sg/news/press-releases/press-statement-on-the-government-lifting-the-pause-on-new-ict-systems https://www.csa.gov.sg/singcert/news/advisories-alerts/measures-for-protecting-customers-personal-data https://www.csa.gov.sg/singcert/news/advisories-alerts/protecting-your-personal-data-2018   CYBER-ATTACK ON UNIVERSITIES CASE STUDY  WHAT HAPPENED?  In April 2018, CSA received  information that there was a  breach of user account credentials  at various universities in Singapore.  Further investigations revealed  that at least 52 accounts from four  universities – NTU, NUS, Singapore  Management University (SMU),  and Singapore University of  Technology and Design (SUTD) –   had been compromised.  Unsuspecting victims received  spear phishing e-mails that  directed them to a credential  harvesting website, which closely   FOLLOW-UP ACTION  The affected universities  reset the passwords of  all users, and scanned  computers and networks  for signs of further  compromise. SingCERT  sent out advisories to  alert all users about the  incident, and heighten  their vigilance against  similar attacks and other  potential cyber threats.  resembled the web portals of the  universities. These portals were  made to look as if the victims had  accidentally logged out of their  accounts and prompted them to  enter their login credentials.   The login credentials of the  victims were later used to gain  unauthorised access to the  online libraries of the universities,  in order to obtain research  publications of staff members  across various research fields and  academic disciplines.  UNIVERSITY  Threat actors target academic institutions for a variety  of reasons. These include stealing sensitive research  information, and using them as stepping stones to gain  access to high security systems and networks.   In 2017, the National University of Singapore (NUS)   and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) were hit  by sophisticated cyber-attacks that were assessed  to be the work of APTs. These incidents highlight  the need for academic institutions to stay vigilant  constantly and strengthen their cybersecurity  defences, as part of measures to protect their  intellectual property.  TARGET.EDU.SG  26 27  CHAPTER 2 TARGET.SG    TARGET.ORG.SG  Organisations are frequently targeted by threat actors, most   often to steal private and personal information from their  databases. As more Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) go  digital, business e-mail impersonation scams are expected to   grow in tandem. The Singapore Police Force observed 378  business e-mail impersonation scams in 2018, up from 332 cases   in 2017. In total, businesses in Singapore suffered losses of close   to S$58 million in 2018, an increase of about 31 per cent from 2017.  CRYPTO-JACKING CASE STUDY  FEATURED TOPIC  Cybersecurity firms have observed a  shift in modus operandi from traditional  ransomware to crypto-mining, as mining  cryptocurrency becomes more profitable  than other criminal business models.  Internet of Things (IoT) devices have also  emerged as a potential attack vector  that may be abused by cybercriminals.  ADB.Miner, a Monero crypto-mining  botnet which borrowed scanning code  from Mirai, was found in February  2018 targeting Android-based devices.  Another Monero crypto-mining botnet,  Smominru, utilises the ETERNALBLUE 11  exploit and has since infected more than  500,000 computers worldwide.  UNAUTHORISED CRYPTO-MINING  BECOMING MORE PREVALENT   In January 2018, security company  Sucuri discovered a campaign where  over 2,000 WordPress websites were  compromised by a malicious script. This  script delivered crypto-mining and  keylogging malware to devices. Users  would experience a decline in computing  performance of their devices when they  visit these compromised websites, whose  malware in turn harness the computing  power to mine cryptocurrencies. Sensitive  information such as payment details  would also be captured by the malware.  WHAT HAPPENED?   In January 2018, SingCERT received  information that a training institute’s web  servers had been infected by malware.  Four of the institute’s web servers were later  found to be infected by a crypto-mining  malware. No other suspicious activity was  detected, although the infected web servers  were observed communicating to Internet  Protocol (IP) addresses associated with   crypto-mining operations.  SingCERT later discovered that the institute’s  web server software had not been patched to  the latest versions, leading to its subsequent  compromise. The attacker exploited these  vulnerabilities to hijack the systems and  discreetly link the web servers to a crypto- mining pool. The cryptocurrency produced  was then transferred to a cryptocurrency  wallet for storage. The attacker remains  unknown due to the anonymous nature of   the encrypted wallet.  FOLLOW-UP ACTION  SingCERT provided technical assistance to the  organisation to investigate and understand  the root cause and potential impact of the  incident. SingCERT also worked together with  the organisation to restore all compromised web  servers to their last known serviceable state.  All organisations and businesses should manage  their cybersecurity risks appropriately. These  include ensuring that all systems are regularly  updated and patched for known vulnerabilities,  and educating employees on the importance of  verifying important email requests with business  partners first, before responding to them. The  public may refer to the SingCERT alert published  on 9 November 2017 for measures to counter the  rising crypto-jacking threat.10  10  “[SingCERT] Alert on Browser-based Digital Currency Mining,” SingCERT Advisories & Alerts, 9 November 2017,   https://www.csa.gov.sg/singcert/news/advisories-alerts/alert-on-browser-based-digital-currency-mining.  11  ETERNALBLUE is an exploit which leverages a vulnerability in Microsoft’s Server Message Block (SMB). SMB is a protocol used  by computers to share access to files and appliances over a network.  28 29  CHAPTER 2 TARGET.SG  https://www.csa.gov.sg/singcert/news/advisories-alerts/alert-on-browser-based-digital-currency-mining   TARGET.YOU.SG  Many individuals continue to lack  cybersecurity awareness and  practise poor cyber hygiene.  According to the Singapore Police Force,  there were 1,204 cases investigated under  the Computer Misuse Act (CMA)12 in 2018,  a 40 per cent increase from 2017. Some  of these cases were a result of victims  who were not alert to phishing e-mails  intended to steal their sensitive personal  information such as passwords and credit  card details.  All individuals should protect themselves  from cyber threats proactively, and  practise good cyber hygiene habits at all  times. These include checking for signs  of phishing before clicking on unknown  links or opening attachments in suspicious  e-mails, installing computer protection  software (i.e. anti-virus, anti-spyware/ malware, and firewall) and keeping  them updated, and enabling Two-Factor  Authentication (2FA) where possible.  Separately, online scams continued to  be a concern. There were about 2,125  e-commerce scams reported in 2018,  with victims losing a total of about S$1.9  million. 70 per cent of such scams took  place on e-commerce platform Carousell,  and involved electronic products and  tickets to events and attractions. It is  important for all individuals to exercise  caution towards unrealistic bargains for  merchandise on e-commerce platforms   to avoid falling prey to such scams.  WHAT HAPPENED?  In July 2018, a member of the  public sought SingCERT’s help  after receiving a threatening  e-mail. The e-mail claimed  that the victim’s computer had  been infected with malware,  and demanded payment in  exchange for not exposing  video clips of the victim in  compromising situations,  allegedly recorded with the  computer’s own web camera.  To substantiate the threat,  the e-mail also contained the  victim’s e-mail password.   FOLLOW-UP ACTION  SingCERT advised the victim to change all passwords associated  with the compromised e-mail account immediately, enable  two-factor authentication for the e-mail account if possible, and  not to make any form of payment. As a precautionary measure,  SingCERT also recommended performing anti-virus scans on all  the victim’s computing devices.  It was later determined that  the e-mail represented a new  form of extortion scam that  surfaced recently. The victim’s  e-mail address and password  were likely exposed in a  previous data breach – where  login credentials of affected  individuals were leaked – and  not obtained through malware  that had compromised the  victim’s computer, as the  scammer had claimed.     NEARLY@SCAMMED.COM CASE STUDY  As our cyber threat surface increases, potential  points of vulnerability will become commonplace.   All individuals need to play a conscious role in  creating a safe and secure cyberspace.  – Dr Shashi Jayakumar, Senior Fellow, S Rajaratnam School of  International Studies (RSIS), and Head, Centre of Excellence   for National Security and Executive Coordinator, Future Issues  and Technology, highlighting individuals’ role in cybersecurity  12  The Computer Misuse Act (CMA) replaces the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act  (CMCA) when the Cybersecurity Act came into force on 31 August 2018.  30 31  CHAPTER 2 TARGET.SG    CHAPTER 3  SINGAPORE’S  CYBERSECURITY  STRATEGY –  DEVELOPMENTS  IN 2018 Launched by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the  2016 Singapore International Cyber Week, Singapore’s  Cybersecurity Strategy sets out Singapore’s cybersecurity  vision, goals and priorities to create a resilient and trusted  cyberspace. It is only with a safe and trusted cyberspace that  we can fully realise the benefits of technology, and secure a  better future for Singaporeans.  This chapter looks back on some key milestones of the  Strategy in 2018.   The Strategy comprises four pillars:  Pillar One: Building a Resilient Infrastructure  Pillar Two:  Creating a Safer Cyberspace  Pillar Three:  Developing a Vibrant Cybersecurity Ecosystem  Pillar Four:  Strengthening International Partnerships  32 33    CSA has been coordinating the work to realise Singapore’s  Cybersecurity Strategy since it was launched in 2016. This  chapter provides some of the highlights and achievements  across the four pillars of the Strategy in 2018.  The first pillar aims to secure our  digitally-enabled economy and society,  with emphasis on the Government’s  partnership with the private sector  and the cybersecurity community to  strengthen the resilience of our Critical  Information Infrastructure (CII).  Cybersecurity is a collective  responsibility of the Government,  businesses, individuals and the  community. The second pillar looks  at engaging businesses and the  public to collectively build a safer  and more secure cyberspace.  Cybersecurity is both a security  imperative and an economic  opportunity. The third pillar  focuses on developing a vibrant  cybersecurity ecosystem. This  includes building a pipeline of  talent and a vibrant industry.  Cyber threats are borderless.   Strong international collaboration in  cybersecurity is necessary to combat  the threats in cyberspace. The fourth  pillar emphasises the strengthening of  international partnerships and creating  opportunities for collaboration.

Under the  programme, the Readiness Maturity  Index (RMI) Framework evaluates the  cybersecurity maturity of CII sectors  delivering essential services, and   allows Sector Leads to build cyber  capabilities and resilience against  evolving cyber threats.  The maturity of a CII sector is measured  based on respective CII owners’  attributes in the RMI Framework. As of  2018, all 11 CII sectors have attained a  maturity level of “measurable”, which  means that they have demonstrated  governance, management oversight,  formalised policies, assigned  responsibilities, and training of people,   with consistent and measurable  outcomes. CSA will continue to  develop appropriate cybersecurity  metrics beyond the RMI framework.  Since its formation, CSA  has been conducting  sector-specific Exercise  CyberArk (XCA) to ensure  readiness of all CII sectors  in defending against  increasingly sophisticated  cyber-threats. In 2018,  over 300 participants  from the Media, Aviation,  and Maritime sectors took  part in XCA on separate  occasions to review,  exercise and validate  their cyber defence  capabilities and incident  response plans. The  4-month planning and  development cycle for  each run of the exercise  culminated in a 2-day  Table-Top Exercise (TTX),  where participants were   BUILDING A RESILIENT INFRASTRUCTURE PILLAR ONE:  Participants  from the  maritime sector  being briefed  at the opening  address for  Exercise  CyberArk  in July 2018.

PSA remains fully committed towards strengthening the capabilities and  resilience of our people, processes and platforms against cyber threats, to   ensure the continuity of global trade and realising the “Internet of Logistics”.  – Mr Ong Kim Pong, Regional CEO of PSA Southeast Asia,   on contributing to cybersecurity in Singapore’s maritime sector  FEATURED TOPIC  CYBERSECURITY ACT: THE JOURNEY The Cybersecurity Bill was passed in Parliament on 5 February 2018 and came into  force on 31 August 2018. Extensive public consultations were carried out by CSA and  the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) in the drafting of the Act. This  included closed-door consultations with key stakeholders, ranging from Government  agencies, potential CII owners, industry associations and cybersecurity professionals, as  well as an open public consultation from 10 July to 24 August 2017.  The Cybersecurity Act establishes a legal framework for the oversight and maintenance  of national cybersecurity in Singapore. Its four key objectives are to:   A key feature of the Act is the appointment of a Commissioner of Cybersecurity who  is empowered by the Act to oversee all aspects of cybersecurity in Singapore. The  Commissioner is assisted by Assistant Commissioners of Cybersecurity, appointed from  the respective sectors, who provide the deep domain knowledge and expertise. The  Cybersecurity Act provides the Commissioner and his supporting cybersecurity officers  with an important regulatory instrument and statutory powers with which to strengthen  Singapore’s cybersecurity and combat cyber threats.  Strengthen the  protection of CII  against cyber-attacks.  Authorise CSA to  prevent and respond to  cybersecurity threats  and incidents.  Establish a framework  for sharing cyber- security information.  Establish a light-touch  licensing framework for  cybersecurity service  providers (to come into  force at a later date).  CONDUCTING CYBERSECURITY EXERCISES FOR CII SECTORS  put through a series of  scenarios that gradually  built up towards a cyber- crisis. Simulated media  conferences were then  conducted to validate  the sectors’ crisis  communication processes.  Besides the sector-specific  XCA, CSA also conducts  a national-level, multi- sectoral exercise –   Exercise Cyber Star (XCS) –   to validate the National  Cyber Crisis Management  System. Two runs of XCS  have been conducted to  date, with the third one  planned for 2019.  36 37  CHAPTER 3 SINGAPORE’S CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY – DEVELOPMENTS IN 2018  https://www.csa.gov.sg/legislation/cybersecurity-act https://www.csa.gov.sg/news/press-releases/close-of-public-consultation   FEATURED TOPIC  NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY  AWARENESS CAMPAIGN  In May 2018, CSA launched the second  campaign, Cyber Tips 4 You. The  campaign identified four cyber tips for  the public to adopt:  CREATING A SAFER CYBERSPACE PILLAR TWO:  The four tips were presented in various  broadcast and print formats, including  radio channels, bus stops and MRT  stations. Members of the public were  also invited to attend a café-inspired  event, Cybersecurity Awareness For  Everyone (CAFÉ), to learn how to create  strong and memorable passwords.  About 12,000 visitors attended the two- day launch event held at Bedok Mall.  Starting from November 2018, a Cyber  Savvy Machine Pop-Up, featuring a Cyber  Savvy vending machine and information  panels, will make its rounds to one public  library each month over a period of one year.  Library-goers can test their cybersecurity  knowledge by attempting a quiz on the  machine and win a small gift in the process.  Supporting the outreach effort are students  from Nanyang Polytechnic, who will help to  spread cybersecurity messages at the library  on selected days. They will also showcase a   “Cyber Savvy game”, which they developed  with CSA, in the respective libraries.  CYBERGREEN  CyberGreen aims to research and  aggregate open source information  to measure and create awareness of  the cyber health status of a country.

FEATURED TOPIC  Through R&D, DSO National Laboratories developed  the DSO Crypto Chip to protect Singapore’s sensitive  communications and information from potential  adversaries. Its small size and low power consumption13  allow it to be used on space- and power-constrained  systems, while meeting the challenging demands of high  throughput and security. The chip incorporates DSO’s  unique protection mechanism, which destroys all secret  data when tampered. This would render the chip useless.  SECURING OUR COMMUNICATIONS –   DSO CRYPTO CHIP  CSA implemented the Internet  Hygiene Rating and Benchmarking  (IHRB) tool for CII Sector Leads and  owners in 2018. The tool incorporates  a management-friendly dashboard  that improves an organisation’s  cybersecurity situational awareness,  and encourages regular self-checks  by benchmarking against entities in  the same or similar industries. It also  enhances the organisation’s Internet  hygiene level through the constant   review of ratings based on industry- specific threats and trends.  All CII Sector Leads and owners are  given access to the IHRB for their  continuous internal monitoring.  Through this data-driven security  performance rating, Sector Leads and  owners are able to create a common  benchmark for comparison, enabling  them to come up with proactive  policies to improve their cybersecurity.  Response Teams (CERTs) to carry  out remediation and mitigation  efforts proactively.   In 2018, the platform added more  scanning locations and enhanced  the risk protocols matrix. It also  provided better visualisations and  allowed countries to compare their  state of cyber health with others.  38 39  CHAPTER 3 SINGAPORE’S CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY – DEVELOPMENTS IN 2018  https://www.csa.gov.sg/news/press-releases/csa-launches-second-national-cybersecurity-awareness-campaign https://www.csa.gov.sg/news/news-articles/travelling-cyber-savvy-machine-pop-up-at-a-public-library-near-you https://www.csa.gov.sg/news/news-articles/travelling-cyber-savvy-machine-pop-up-at-a-public-library-near-you https://www.dso.org.sg/research/information   FEATURED TOPIC  INNOVATION CYBERSECURITY  ECOSYSTEM @ BLOCK71  In March 2018, CSA and the Info-communications Media Development  Authority (IMDA) supported the establishment of the Innovation  Cybersecurity Ecosystem at Block71 (ICE71), for three key programmes:  1. ICE71 Inspire – A bootcamp targeting the academia and industry  to deepen appreciation for entrepreneurship, provide networking  opportunities, and enable potential entrepreneurs to get valuable  insights from cyber and innovation experts.  2. ICE71 Accelerate – An accelerator programme for early-stage  start-ups to gain access to talent, mentors, funding and local  ecosystem events.  3. ICE71 Scale – To provide access to complimentary working space,  testing facilities, regional markets and corporate support services  for start-ups.   In less than a year, ICE71 has organised a total of 40 events and reached  out to more than 50,000 members of the public. Its programmes have  also engaged some 200 mentors who have helped guide the start-ups  in their go-to-market strategies.  DEVELOPING A VIBRANT CYBERSECURITY ECOSYSTEM PILLAR THREE:  ENCOURAGING INDUSTRY INNOVATION AND BUILDING ADVANCED CAPABILITIES THROUGH R&D  CSA works with Government agencies, universities, research institutes, and industry  to encourage innovation for next-generation solutions to meet the needs of local and  international markets. Efforts in 2018 included:  14  They include Ascendas-Singbridge, PacificLight Power, Singapore LNG Corporation, Singapore Press Holdings, and   SMRT Corporation.  15  The Common Criteria product assurance certification, or ISO/IEC 15408, is the de facto standard for cybersecurity product  certification around the world.  16  In 2018, the NCR secured additional S$50 million of funding till 2020 to focus on four areas – cloud security, cyber forensic and  assurance, applications security and edge computing, and artificial intelligence for cybersecurity.  a. Lean LaunchPad Programme (LLP)  Cybersecurity Track. CSA and the  National Research Foundation (NRF)  supported the LLP Cybersecurity Track, a  10-week experiential learning programme  to equip cybersecurity researchers and  young start-ups with the necessary  networks, tools, and market validation   to bring their inventions to market.  b. Industry Call for Innovation. To  catalyse the development of innovative  cybersecurity solutions and adoption by  end users, CSA initiated an Industry Call  for Innovation in 2018. CSA collaborated  with industry14 to consolidate their cyber  needs into challenge statements. The  Call drew more than 70 proposals from  industry solution providers to develop  solutions for 10 challenge statements.  c. Establishing National Satellites of  Excellence (NSoEs). Anchored in local  universities, the NSoEs were established  to build and consolidate local research  strengths in domains of national interest.  Their research focuses on Trustworthy  Software Systems, Mobile Systems  Security & Cloud Security, and Design  Science and Technologies for Secure  Critical Infrastructure.  d. Singapore Common Criteria Scheme.  Singapore attained the status of a  Common Criteria15 Certificate Authorising  Nation in January 2019. With this, local  developers need not send their product  overseas for certification, saving time and  costs. This increases the potential of IT- security products produced in Singapore  for export, strengthens Singapore’s  competitiveness in the global cybersecurity  market, and attracts global evaluation  and testing laboratories to base their  operations in Singapore.  e. National Cybersecurity R&D Programme  (NCR). Together with NRF, CSA chairs  the NCR to fund projects16 that seeks to  improve the trustworthiness of cyber  infrastructure with emphasis on security,  resilience, and usability.

FEATURED TOPIC  In 2017, the National Cyber Security Centre of The Netherlands (NCSC- NL) together with CSA conducted a landscape study to identify gaps in  Internet of Things (IoT) security standards and technology. The findings  were refined into a set of working initiatives for IoT security that were  jointly proposed by Singapore and The Netherlands at the Annual Meeting  of the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise (GFCE), co-branded with SICW’s  IoT Security Roundtable, during SICW 2018. The initiatives aimed to lead  and galvanise global efforts in creating a safer and more secure IoT.  In the initial phase of the IoT Security Initiative, NCSC-NL and CSA agreed  to prioritise the efforts on three most critical areas, namely, Certification  and Testing, Supply Chain Security, and Unique Device Identities.  GALVANISING GLOBAL EFFORTS  Affairs (UNODA) on an online training  course to promote understanding  and implementation of agreements  reached by the UNGGE, and a UN- Singapore Cyber Programme to build  awareness of cyber norms and cyber  scenario policy planning in ASEAN  Member States.  FEATURED TOPIC  ENHANCING CAPACITY   AND CAPABILITIES IN   CYBERSECURITY TOGETHER Singapore will launch the S$30 million  ASEAN-Singapore Cybersecurity Centre  of Excellence (ASCCE) in 2019, an  extension of the S$10 million ASEAN  Cyber Capacity Programme that has  been contributing to the enhancement  of ASEAN’s cybersecurity capabilities in  both the technical and policy aspects. The  ASCCE will complement existing initiatives,  such as the ASEAN-Japan Cybersecurity  Capacity Building Centre in Thailand. It will  focus on strengthening ASEAN Member  States’ cyber strategy development,  legislation and research capabilities,  increasing technical expertise and incident  response skills of national CERTs in the  region. The ASCCE will also promote CERT- to-CERT open-source information sharing.   In April 2018, under Singapore’s   ASEAN Chairmanship, a first-ever ASEAN  Leaders’ Statement on Cybersecurity  Cooperation was adopted at the 32nd  ASEAN Summit. Singapore has worked  closely with ASEAN Member States,  industry partners and international  organisations such as the INTERPOL  Global Complex for Innovation to follow  up on tasks set by ASEAN Leaders.   Singapore hosted the annual ASEAN  Ministerial Conference on Cybersecurity  (AMCC) over the past three years to  bring together Ministers from all ASEAN  Member States who are responsible for  ICT and cybersecurity issues, including  the ASEAN Secretary-General. We  helped to draft the ASEAN Cybersecurity  Cooperation Strategy, which was adopted  in March 2017 and provides a blueprint  for coordination of cybersecurity capacity  building efforts. Participants at the 3rd  AMCC in September 2018 agreed to  subscribe in-principle to the 11 voluntary,  non-binding norms recommended in  the 2015 Report of the United Nations  Group of Governmental Experts on  Developments in the Field of Information  and Telecommunications in the Context  of International Security (UNGGE). They  also agreed to focus on regional capacity  building in implementing these norms.  Singapore has consistently advocated for the international community to build  consensus and develop a rules- and norms-based international order in cyberspace,  where its users can remain safe and secure. Singapore stands ready to work with all   parties toward closer international cooperation in the cyber and digital sphere.  – Mr S. Iswaran, Minister for Communications and Information, and Minister-in-Charge  of Cybersecurity, on Singapore’s efforts in building a safe and secure cyberspace  44 45  CHAPTER 3 SINGAPORE’S CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY – DEVELOPMENTS IN 2018  https://www.csa.gov.sg/news/press-releases/sicw-2018---highlights-and-testimonials https://www.csa.gov.sg/~/media/csa/documents/amcc/factsheet_accp.ashx https://www.csa.gov.sg/~/media/csa/documents/amcc/factsheet_accp.ashx https://jaif.asean.org/support/project-brief/asean-japan-cybersecurity-capacity-building-centre.html https://jaif.asean.org/support/project-brief/asean-japan-cybersecurity-capacity-building-centre.html https://asean.org/asean-leaders-statement-on-cybersecurity-cooperation/ https://asean.org/asean-leaders-statement-on-cybersecurity-cooperation/ https://asean.org/asean-leaders-statement-on-cybersecurity-cooperation/ https://www.csa.gov.sg/news/press-releases/amcc-2018 https://www.csa.gov.sg/news/press-releases/amcc-2018   0  0  0 110  1  1  1 0  0 1 1  MORE FREQUENT  DATA BREACHES  MORE DISRUPTIVE  ATTACKS AGAINST   THE CLOUD  GREATER RISKS FOR  SMART BUILDINGS  AND CONNECTED   SYSTEMS  ARTIFICIAL   INTELLIGENCE –   DOUBLE-EDGED   SWORD  INCREASED THREAT  TO GLOBAL    SUPPLY CHAINS  BIOMETRIC DATA  MORE VALUABLE TO   THREAT ACTORS  1 2 3 4 5 6  Data has become the  most valued ‘commodity’   in cyberspace, which  means cybercriminals will  try even harder to breach   computer databases –  especially those that store  large amounts of private  and personal information.  As buildings and factories  become ‘smarter’ – through  the proliferation of Internet  of Things (IoT) devices and  connected industrial control  systems (ICS) – the risk of   them being attacked to hold  their owners to ransom, or   exploited to spread malware  or conduct DDoS attacks,   also increases.  Threat actors will focus on  disrupting supply chains   which have become  highly interconnected   and automated. Industries  dominated by a few   companies are especially  vulnerable, as problems in  one stage of production  may potentially lead to a  breakdown in the entire   supply chain.  Artificial Intelligence (AI)  will be a double-edged   sword for cybersecurity – it  can significantly enhance  the capabilities of security   systems, such as in anomaly  detection and response.  However, threat actors  can also leverage AI to   search for vulnerabilities  in computer systems, and  create ‘smarter’ malware.  With more databases hosted  in the cloud, threat actors  will be on the lookout for  potential vulnerabilities in  cloud infrastructure. While  their primary goal remains   data theft, threat actors  will also try to exploit cloud  services for other malicious   aims, such as to amplify  Distributed Denial-of-Service   (DDoS) attacks.  As biometric authentication  becomes increasingly   common, threat actors will  shift to target and manipulate  biometric data, to build virtual  identities and gain access to   personal information.  What would the next few years portend for  cybersecurity? The combination of technological  advancements and our transition into ever higher levels  of connectivity means that cyber threats will become  even more targeted, sophisticated and deceptive.

The IoT has been an industry  buzzword for years. As we become  increasingly reliant on interconnected  devices in every aspect of our lives,  there lies the concomitant need to  protect potentially billions of them  from intrusions and interference that  could compromise personal privacy or  threaten public safety.  In recent years, massive IoT botnets  such as Mirai, Hajime and Persirai have  shown themselves to be capable of  globally destructive attacks. A report  released by cybersecurity firm F5 Labs  last year stated that Singapore has  constantly appeared in the top five   19  Boddy, Sara and Shattuck, Justin. “The Hunt for IoT: The Growth and Evolution of Thingbots Ensures Chaos,” F5 Labs –  Threat Analysis Report, 13 March 2018, https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/the-hunt-for-iot-the-growth-and- evolution-of-thingbots-ensures-chaos.  destinations for IoT attacks19. There are  also privacy concerns when IoT devices  are being targeted, with the Police  having received reports of victims  finding their IP cameras compromised  and sometimes manipulated to film in   a particular direction.  It has never been more crucial to  secure this interconnected world that  we live in. For a start, every stakeholder  must play their role in ensuring basic  security mistakes – such as open ports,  default credentials, and data sent  without encryption – are excised from  IoT equipment.  48 49    LOOKING AHEAD ANTICIPATED TRENDS  https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/the-hunt-for-iot-the-growth-and-evolution-of-thingbots-ensures-chaos https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/the-hunt-for-iot-the-growth-and-evolution-of-thingbots-ensures-chaos   GLOSSARY  Term Definition  Advanced Persistent  Threat (APT)  An attack in which perpetrators successfully gain access to a targeted system,  and stay undetected for a long period of time to exfiltrate, modify, or destroy  critical data. APTs can also refer to the advanced, and often state-linked or  state-sponsored threat actors that conduct extended campaigns, such as  cyber espionage.  Attack Surface Referring to all vulnerable resources of a system, or the sum of the points  through which an attacker could try to enter an environment.  Bot/Botnet An automated software program used to carry out specific tasks. A botnet is a  network of compromised computers infected with malicious bots, controlled as  a group without the owners' knowledge.  Brute-force attack A trial-and-error method which involves trying various combinations of  usernames and passwords repetitively to gain access into a computer system  or website.  Command and control  (C&C) servers  Centralised devices operated by attackers to maintain communications with  compromised systems (known as botnets) within a target network.  Critical Information  Infrastructure (CII)  The computer or computer system necessary for the continuous delivery of an  essential service, which the loss or compromise thereof will have a debilitating  effect on the availability of the essential services in Singapore.  Cryptocurrency A form of digital token secured by cryptography and can be used as a medium  of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value. Used synonymously with  digital or virtual currency. Examples include Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin.  Crypto-jacking The unauthorized use of a computer or computer system by cybercriminals to  mine cryptocurrency.  Cybercrime Refers to cyber-extortion, online cheating cases, and offences under the  Computer Misuse Act (CMA) such as unauthorised access of computer material  and unauthorised use of computer service.  Cyberspace The complex environment resulting from the interaction of people, software  and services on the Internet by means of technology devices and networks  connected to it, which does not exist in any physical form.  Singapore’s cyberspace includes domain names with “.SG” or Singapore- mentions, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses used in Singapore, and Internet  Service Providers (ISPs) located here.  Term Definition  Dark Web A section of the Internet only accessible through software that allows users  to remain anonymous or untraceable. The Dark Web is part of the Deep Web.  The Deep Web encompasses web resources that search engines like Google  and Yahoo cannot find, such as legitimate but private resources (e.g. e-mail), or  public resources behind a paywall or login wall (e.g. paid journal subscriptions).  Data Breach The unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification,  disposal or similar risks of personal data/ information in an organisation's  possession or under its control.   Denial of   Service (DoS) /  Distributed DoS (DDoS)  Where an attacker attempts to prevent legitimate users from accessing  information or services online. The most common and obvious type of DoS  attack occurs when an attacker \"floods\" a network with information. In a  distributed DoS attack, an attacker takes unauthorised control of multiple  computers, which may be harnessed as a botnet, to launch a DoS attack.  Hacktivists An individual or group who wants to undermine the reputation or destabilise  the operations of an entity, or to publicise their political or social agenda and  gain recognition, usually by hacking an organisation's website.  Industrial Control  Systems (ICS)  ICS belong to a class of operational technology (OT) systems used in nearly  every industrial sector to monitor, control and automate industrial operations  and processes.   Internet of Things (IoT) The vast network of everyday objects, like baby monitors, printers, televisions,  and autonomous vehicles that are connected to the Internet.  Keylogging The use of a software to record every keystroke that is made by a user on  a computing device. It is usually done covertly for malicious intent, such as  gaining knowledge of passwords.   Malware Malicious software intended to perform unauthorised processes that will have  adverse impact on the security of a computer system. E.g. virus, worm, Trojan  horse, spyware and adware.  Personal Data /  Information  Data which, on its own (e.g. full name, NRIC number) or in combination with  other available data (e.g. medical or educational information, can be used to  distinguish or trace an individual’s identity.  Phishing A common technique used by threat actors to trick people (typically   through e-mails) into divulging personal information, transferring money,   or installing malware.  Ransomware Malware that encrypts files on a victim's device, rendering them unusable  until a ransom is paid, usually in the form of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency.  It may spread through phishing e-mails that contain malicious attachments or  links, or malicious pop-ups that appear when users access unsafe websites.  Spoofing Tricking computer systems or other users by hiding or faking one’s   true identity. Commonly spoofed targets include e-mails, IP addresses,   and websites.  50 51    Cyber Security Agency of Singapore  Website:   www.csa.gov.sg  General enquiries/feedback:  contact@csa.gov.sg  GoSafeOnline  Website:   www.csa.gov.sg/gosafeonline  General enquiries/feedback:  gosafeonline@csa.gov.sg  SingCERT  Hotline for incident reporting:   (+65) 6323 5052  E-mail for incident reporting:  singcert@csa.gov.sg  ScamAlert  Contact anti-scam helpline:   (+65) 1800 722 6688  Visit ScamAlert website:  www.scamalert.sg  If you have any feedback on this publication,  or wish to find out more about Singapore’s   efforts in cybersecurity, please visit the  following websites or contact us:  If you wish to report a cybersecurity incident,  please contact:  If you wish to seek scam-related advice:  52  https://www.csa.gov.sg mailto:contact%40csa.gov.sg?subject= https://www.csa.gov.sg/gosafeonline mailto:gosafeonline%40csa.gov.sg?subject= mailto:singcert%40csa.gov.sg?subject= https://www.scamalert.sg",

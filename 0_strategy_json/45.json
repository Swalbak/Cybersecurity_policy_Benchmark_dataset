Currently, innovative transformations are happening in many organizations especially in the area of moving business operations and services online. By extension, the pervasive use of mobile applications, fintech solutions and automation have also impacted positively on businesses around the world. This goes to suggests that as long as our critical infrastructure continues to connect to computers and information networks, we will inevitably continue to rely on them to deliver services. In recent years, Cybersecurity is increasing its significance due to the overwhelming use of devices which require the use of internet. This development has implications for criminal exploitation of information systems. In an attempt to address the cybercrime challenge and continue to remain proactive in national response, the Gambia government has embarked on measures designed to facilitate ICT integration into all sectors of Gambian economy. For this to be realized, safety and security should be central in national development initiatives. The formulation of the draft Gambia Cyber Security Strategy and Action plan 2016 is a positive step and a long-term measure for protecting the country from cyber related security risks. The initiative ushered in a call for the development of a national cyber security policy and strategic Action plan. This will ultimately pave the way for full implementation of the objectives and goals set in the policy. Page 6 of 112 GAMBIA NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2020-2024 The purpose of this Strategic Plan is to build Gambia’s capability to prevent, protect, detect, respond and manage cyber threats against information systems, critical infrastructures and services. By extension, establish and strengthen the organizational policy and institutional foundations for cyber infrastructure protection across all sectors. It would be also useful in identifying loopholes, inadequacies and other necessities that must be address by government and the private sector in order to adequately meet the challenges ahead. Page 7 of 112 GAMBIA NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2020-2024 1. INTRODUCTION Being an entity of numerous opportunities, the cyberspace is a promising avenue for transforming and strengthening national economies into a knowledge-based society. However, criminal misuse of cyber space is a serious challenge and threat to our information systems, services and critical infrastructures. It is precisely because of this phenomenon, critical infrastructure protection should be an important component of Gambia’s national security program. This National Cyber Security Plan will serve as a guide to protect the nation’s information systems, critical infrastructures and Gambia’s Cyberspace in general. It is a working plan envisaged to eventually generate a platform for coordination, cooperation and collaboration between the public and private sectors. It also envisions the harmonization of national cyber security policies and programs. The National Cyber Security Strategy and Action Plan shall be the cornerstone of the country’s cyber security policy. Page 8 of 112 GAMBIA NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2020-2024 2. NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY This national Cyber security strategy provides guidance on the development of a national cyber-security ecosystem. This includes legal, regulatory and institutional framework, building cyber-security capacity and capabilities and development of standards and guidelines to: (i) Ensure that critical ICT systems and infrastructure in public and private sectors are protected and made resilient. (ii) Foster adoption of security standards and guidelines within Government and the private sector. The draft National Cyber Security strategy 2016 came as a result of several consultations and workshops conducted by MOICI-PURA in collaboration with international partners (Bird & Bird – Civipol, Expertise France and CMM Oxford) among others. The successful outcome of these engagements ushered in the draft National Cybersecurity Strategy Formulation and Action Plan 2016. This strategy outlines Gambia’s Vision, Mission for Cyber security and ways to improve or calibrate the Cyber security posture. This initiative primarily seeks to address the national cybersecurity threats against information systems, and critical infrastructures and services. While the proposed strategy focuses on the nature and characteristics of information and communication technology, the important physical aspects and dimensions of critical infrastructure protection including measures to respond to challenges of cyber threats were considered. To address cyber security awareness challenge, the involvement of civil society to help raise awareness, establish and promote cybersecurity education and Training and to build national capacity and capabilities all forms an integral part of the Gambia’s strategic cybersecurity goals etc. This provides a holistic approach and direction to cyber security measures from strategic, tactical to operational aspects of Cyber security. Page 9 of 112 GAMBIA NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2020-2024 As a global challenge, Cyber security demands both domestic and international solutions. Given the shared nature of vulnerabilities, the national cyber security strategy would need strong partnership between public and private sectors. In this endeavor, the Strategy and Action Plan creates a coherent vision to ensuring that The Gambia cyberspace is secure through collective efforts of all stakeholders (i.e. government, private sector, civil society, citizens and international) cooperation and collaboration. To this end, GoTG is committed to collaborate with regional and international partner in creating solutions to address the Cyber security challenges. 2.1 Vision To provide trusted, secure and resilient cyberspace for the Government, corporate businesses and citizenry to further enhance socioeconomic development of the people through ICT transformations. 2.2 Mission To develop and deliver effective Cyber security capacity, services and infrastructure that instills confidence in Gambian cyberspace. 2.3 Strategic Goals For the vision to be achieved, the Government of The Gambia aimed to achieve the following strategic goals: • Identify and manage the critical information infrastructure of The Gambia • Develop and enhance Cyber security-related capacity and infrastructure • Strengthen legal, regulatory frameworks. • Promote awareness, information sharing and collaboration on cyber security. • Ensure continuous improvement of the safety of vulnerable groups in cyberspace, especially the safety of children.

Currently, innovative transformations are happening   in many organizations especially in the area of moving business operations   and services online. By extension, the pervasive use of mobile applications,   fintech solutions and automation have also impacted positively on businesses   around the world.   This goes to suggests that as long as our critical infrastructure continues to   connect to computers and information networks, we will inevitably continue   to rely on them to deliver services. In recent years, Cybersecurity is increasing   its significance due to the overwhelming use of devices which require the use   of internet. This development has implications for criminal exploitation of   information systems.   In an attempt to address the cybercrime challenge and continue to remain   proactive in national response, the Gambia government has embarked on   measures designed to facilitate ICT integration into all sectors of Gambian   economy. For this to be realized, safety and security should be central in   national development initiatives.   The formulation of the draft Gambia Cyber Security Strategy and Action plan   2016 is a positive step and a long-term measure for protecting the country   from cyber related security risks. The initiative ushered in a call for the   development of a national cyber security policy and strategic Action plan.    This will ultimately pave the way for full implementation of the objectives and   goals set in the policy.     Page 6  of  112   GAMBIA NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2020-2024    The purpose of this Strategic Plan is to build Gambia’s capability to prevent,   protect, detect, respond and manage cyber threats against information   systems, critical infrastructures and services. By extension, establish and   strengthen the organizational policy and institutional foundations for cyber   infrastructure protection across all sectors. It would be also useful in   identifying loopholes, inadequacies and other necessities that must be   address by government and the private sector in order to adequately meet the   challenges ahead.     Page 7  of  112   GAMBIA NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2020-2024    1. INTRODUCTION     Being an entity of numerous opportunities, the cyberspace is a promising   avenue for transforming and strengthening national economies into a   knowledge-based society. However, criminal misuse of cyber space is a   serious challenge and threat to our information systems, services and critical   infrastructures. It is precisely because of this phenomenon, critical   infrastructure protection should be an important component of Gambia’s   national security program.   This National Cyber Security Plan will serve as a guide to protect the nation’s   information systems, critical infrastructures and Gambia’s Cyberspace in   general. It is a working plan envisaged to eventually generate a platform for   coordination, cooperation and collaboration between the public and private   sectors. It also envisions the harmonization of national cyber security policies   and programs. The National Cyber Security Strategy and Action Plan shall be   the cornerstone of the country’s cyber security policy.     Page 8  of  112   GAMBIA NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2020-2024    2. NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY     This national Cyber security strategy provides guidance on the development   of a national cyber-security ecosystem. This includes legal, regulatory and   institutional framework, building cyber-security capacity and capabilities and   development of standards and guidelines to:   (i) Ensure that critical ICT systems and infrastructure in public and   private sectors are protected and made resilient.   (ii) Foster adoption of security standards and guidelines within Government   and the private sector.   The draft National Cyber Security strategy 2016 came as a result of several   consultations and workshops conducted by MOICI-PURA in collaboration   with international partners (Bird & Bird – Civipol, Expertise France and CMM   Oxford) among others. The successful outcome of these engagements   ushered in the draft National Cybersecurity Strategy Formulation and Action   Plan 2016. This strategy outlines Gambia’s Vision, Mission for Cyber security   and ways to improve or calibrate the Cyber security posture. This initiative   primarily seeks to address the national cybersecurity threats against   information systems, and critical infrastructures and services.   While the proposed strategy focuses on the nature and characteristics of   information and communication technology, the important physical aspects   and dimensions of critical infrastructure protection including measures to   respond to challenges of cyber threats were considered. To address cyber   security awareness challenge, the involvement of civil society to help raise   awareness, establish and promote cybersecurity education and Training and   to build national capacity and capabilities all forms an integral part of the   Gambia’s strategic cybersecurity goals etc. This provides a holistic approach   and direction to cyber security measures from strategic, tactical to   operational aspects of Cyber security.     Page 9  of  112   GAMBIA NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2020-2024    As a global challenge, Cyber security demands both domestic and   international solutions. Given the shared nature of vulnerabilities, the   national cyber security strategy would need strong partnership between   public and private sectors. In this endeavor, the Strategy and Action Plan   creates a coherent vision to ensuring that The Gambia cyberspace is secure   through collective efforts of all stakeholders (i.e. government, private sector,   civil society, citizens and international) cooperation and collaboration. To this   end, GoTG is committed to collaborate with regional and international partner   in creating solutions to address the Cyber security challenges.   2.1 Vision     To provide trusted, secure and resilient cyberspace for the Government,   corporate businesses and citizenry to further enhance socioeconomic   development of the people through ICT transformations.   2.2 Mission     To develop and deliver effective Cyber security capacity, services and   infrastructure that instills confidence in Gambian cyberspace.   2.3 Strategic Goals     For the vision to be achieved, the Government of The Gambia aimed to   achieve the following strategic goals:   • Identify and manage the critical information infrastructure of The   Gambia   • Develop and enhance Cyber security-related capacity and   infrastructure   • Strengthen legal, regulatory frameworks.   • Promote awareness, information sharing and collaboration on cyber   security.   • Ensure continuous improvement of the safety of vulnerable groups in   cyberspace, especially the safety of children.     Page 10 GAMBIA NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2020-2024    • Enhance and coordinate the fight against all forms of cybercrime   • Promote the use of cyberspace to drive social and economic   development     3. STRATEGIC PLAN     This Plan is designed to provide direction on the implementation of the   strategic goals and specific objectives in line with national policy priorities.   The plan outlines a framework for organizing and prioritizing efforts to   manage cyber security risks in the Gambian cyberspace.   The draft Action Plan further identifies specific initiatives, roles, and   responsibilities of key stakeholders with deliverables, timeline and indicators   for measuring progress on the implementation of the national cybersecurity   strategy. This Strategy and Action Plan shall be the cornerstone of the   Gambia’s cyber security policy.   3.1 KEY ELEMENTS FOR A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY1     To secure the Gambian cyberspace demands the provision of adequate   protection to all ICT systems, networks and critical infrastructure. The   challenge is the lack of technology specific skills most systems owners and   operators lack hence the need for cybersecurity products and services. The   success of this cybersecurity strategy is based on the following six elements:   1. People and entities mobilized to secure each ICT System   2. People and entities in capacity to provide cyber security technology   and services   3. The GM-CSIRT to operate the national Cybersecurity Centre   4. The Gambia Police Force and Justice to fight cybercrime   5.

DIMENSION 1: ESTABLISHING NATIONAL RISK ASSESSMENT      Strategic Goal 1: Identify and Manage Risks to Critical Information  Infrastructure of The Gambia.   The protection of critical information infrastructure (CIIs), calls for   collaboration of all relevant stakeholders - public and private institutions that   own or operate the information infrastructure which supports the functioning   of the Gambian society. The Government of The Gambia (GoTG) will work    with all relevant stakeholders to identify, understand the vulnerabilities and   Cyber security posture of The Gambia’s information infrastructure CIIs.   The Government will also work with relevant stakeholders to establish   measures that will address current and future cyber threats and risks to the   national information infrastructure, and to drive improvements where   necessary.     6.1 STRATEGY 1: UNDERSTANDING RISK     The most important strategy in protecting the national critical cyber   infrastructures is to first understand the nature of threats to Gambia’s   cyberspace. This strategy would involve continuing threat assessment.     Page 15  of  112   GAMBIA NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN 2020-2024     This will also include assessing the vulnerabilities, protective measures being   implemented and the significance of potential targets. This strategy also   entails the need for a Cyber security, and Institutional and Policy Build-Up.   Every strategy has corresponding programs to be undertaken.   6.2 PROGRAMME 1: NATIONAL THREAT ASSESSMENT     6.2.1 Strategic Goal 1: To Conduct National Assessment     This initiative consist two primary specific objectives:     A.

SUMMARY Cybersecurity Impacts many actors within the public domain, including policymakers, the private sector, law enforcement, academia and civil society; therefore, a multi-stakeholder approach was used In the development of this Strategy. Cybersecurity risks! in this regard, should therefore be analyzed within a broader context that also encompasses legal, economic and social factors, contributing to a better management of cybersecurity threats and decision-making. Technology is changing exponentially every day, and the threats surrounding these technologies are becoming Increasingly sophisticated. As our connectivity and dependence on Internet-based platforms and services Increase, so do our vulnerabilities and exposure to cyber threats, While this growth has brought numerous opportunities for many nations, cyber threats have equally evolved in recent years. This reality, therefore, requires the development of public policies that seek to ensure an open and safe internet for all Developed through amulti-stakeholder approach, through the establishmentof an Inter-institutional Cybersecurity Task Force, the National Cybersecurity Strategy of Belize seeks to establish a vision to enhance the cybersecurity posture of Belize. Considering existing national plans and the level of connectivity of the nation, a tiered approach was used to develop concrete and measurable actions that can be taken to advance the capability of the nation to address cyber threats, As such, In the development of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, the level of connectivity to the Internet, as well as, the volume of cybercrimes that are committed in Belize were considered, These variables were also used to determine the scope of the problem, existing cybersecurity gaps, capacities and opportunities for public-private synergies in Belize. In terms of connectivity, there has been a steady growth in the level of Internet penetration and connectivity 2 The more connected people become the more avenues are open for cyberattacks. As of 2018, the Internet penetration rate of Belize was recorded as being over 50% of the population, an increase of over 40% since 2000. With respect to cybercrime, the Police Information Technology and Cyber Unit (PITCU) the Belize Police Department (BPD) manages the investigations of cyber-related crimes, as well as, those felonies that involve electronic evidence. The PITCU has investigated cases of phishing, credit card and ATM fraud, as well as, other crimes that involve electronic evidence, including drug trafficking. They have also received reports of cyberbullying, revenge porn and identity theft. The PITCU holds a partnership with the Internet Watch Foundation, which facilitates the international reporting and investigation of cases of child pornography’ National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 Acknowledging the evolving dynamics of the cybersecurity landscape in Belize, the strategy addresses three priorities pillars and includes actionable objectives to be realized over a period of three (3) years: Figure 1- Areas of Priority Develop a National Legal Framework to address Cybersecurity Threats Develop Capacity for Incident Response and Critical Infrastructure Protection Areas of Priorities Implement measures to support Education, Awareness and Workforce Policy Development in Cybersecurity It is essential to consider who or what entity will manage the inter-institutional relationships of Belize’s cybersecurity landscape, act as a national and international point of contact to facilitate cooperation, provide an advisory role in the development of programmatic interventions, and perhaps most importantly, coordinate the execution, evaluation and reporting of the strategy’s action plan. As such, this Strategy recommends, that a National Cybersecurity Coordinator, under the auspices of the Ministry of National Security be appointed for the coordination of the implementation of actions identified in this Strategy. Finally, the Strategy recognizes the need to undertake a review of its achievements within eighteen (18) months of its approval. National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 It is without a doubt that the fourth industrial revolution is here. In the words of Professor Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum: “This Fourth Industrial Revolution is, however, fundamentally different. It is characterised by a range of new technologies that are fusing the physical, digital and biological worlds, impacting all disciplines, economies and industries, and even challenging ideas about what it means to be human. The resulting shifts and disruptions mean that we live in a time of great promise and great peril.\" The Internet as a shared global resource encapsulates unimaginable possibilities, As we seek to Improve the standard of living of our people, we must harness the potential of this tool to capitalize on the opportunities in the digital economy. However, this cannot be pursued In a vacuum, as securing our engagement online from the onset is a critical first step In ensuring we retain value in whatever digital investments are made. Why would | say this? Cyberspace has also become the fifth domain, along with air, sea, land and space, requiring defence. With the increased frequency and sophistication of malicious cyber activities, as a developing nationwe cannot afford to be complacent. In today’s digital age, everyone should care about cybersecurity, With the advancement in mobile technology for example, many Belizeans are engaged online. Personal information on social media sites such as phone number, email address, home address, and credit/debit card numbers and other Information like photos aind opinions, etc. are being shared. Aside from social media sites, people share their details for business reasons, and many have no idea how their Information would be used, Further, another challenge in this area is the global shortage of cybersecurity experts, and Belize is no exception. With the above in ming, the strategic lines of action articulated in this document demonstrate, among other things, two main concepts We as a Government recognize our cybersecurity gaps and challenges BUT at the same time, we recognize that everything cannot be all fixed with a stroke of a pen and the articulation of this document, therefore, we have identified three (3) key priority areas to start our journey of building resiliency and protecting the Belizean people. National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 2. We also recognize that ‘no man is an island’ and this must be a national effort. Relying on, while cultivating our own homegrown talent, we will face this challenge recognizing the need to institutionalize processes that will improve our overall cyber hygiene. | must conclude by stating that this National Cybersecurity Strategy demonstrates a commitment to strengthening Belize’s capabilities and national coordination to mitigate the impact of cyber threats. It also recognizes the importance of having a strategic vision to address Cybersecurity. | implore all Belizeans to embrace this new digital era with a consciousness that the protection of the Internet is a shared resource. On behalf of the Government and people of Belize, | take this opportunity to thank everyone that was engaged in the development process and contributed their time, knowledge and talent to make this national cybersecurity framework possible.

PRINCIPLES A comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity is paramount to keep pace with emerging technologies and more sophisticated threats. Cybersecurity capacity should not only include the protection of networks and systems, but also take into account the people that rely more and more on Internet-enabled devices to conduct basic tasks. In that regard the following principles have guided the development of the Strategy and will further guide its implementation. Respect for and the promotion of fundamental rights This Strategy recognizes that human rights apply online, as well as offline, and that cybersecurity and human rights are mutually reinforcing. Thus this Strategy protects and promotes fundamental rights and freedoms such as the right to privacy, freedom of expression, freedom of association, freedom of assembly among others, in addition to being in line with Part Il of the Constitution of Belize and the international instruments to which Belize is party to. Government Led Recognizing that the Government is one of the largest consumers of information technology services, it commits to driving the objectives of this Strategy by adopting best practices in its operations and lead by example in the implementation of the Strategy’s objectives. National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 Risk based approach With the understanding of the importance of Critical Infrastructure to the welfare of Belize, the Strategy seeks to mitigate cybersecurity risks to acceptable levels by encouraging the combination of cost benefit, acceptable risk and other qualitative and quantitative approaches with the desired end result of the protection of Belizean people and economy. Shared responsibility Cybersecurity affects everyone and as a result it is a shared responsibility for all to exercise cybersecurity best practices. Targeted awareness raising initiatives will be implemented through the mobilization and partnership with civil society, academia and other interest groups across Belize, to enable and empower end-users to keep themselves and their organizations safer online. Fostering an environment for economic growth and innovation Recognizing the importance of innovation and business development to our national economy, a cyber-environment that is safe and conducive to such development will be fostered. International Cooperation The age-old statement ‘no-man is an island’ has become such a relevant concept in this digital era. The need for comprehensive stakeholder cooperation has never been greater than it is today. This Strategy focuses on the need to leverage international partnerships to investigate criminal activities, build capacity and protect Belize’s cyberspace. National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 This Strategy was developed in collaboration with the Government and stakeholders, to address cybersecurity threats facing Belize, 80 as to provide guidance onkey actions to be taken to improve Belize’s overall preparedness and responsiveness to these threats. This Strategy outlines the principles and long-term goals that will form the basis and overall direction for the planning and development of the national cybersecurity posture, including @ plan of action outlining various roles and responsibilities for implementation. Cybersecurity impacts many actors such as, policy-makers, private sector, law enforcement, academia, and civil society, therefore a multistakeholder approach was used In the development of this Strategy. Cybersecurity risks® In this regard, should therefore be analyzed within a broader context that also encompasses legal, economic and social factors, contributing to a better management of cybersecurity threats and decision-making. Technology is changing exponentially every day, and the threats surrounding these technologies are becoming Increasingly sophisticated. Our growing connectivity and dependence on Internet-based platforms and services has significantly increased our exposure to cyber threats, While this growth has brought numerous opportunities for many nations, cyber threats have equally evolved in recent years. This therefore, requires the development of public policies that seek to ensure an open and safe Intemetfor all. In order to mitigate the impact of these threats, a structural change around cybersecurity is imperative, However, this structural change is only possible with national coordination and intemational cooperation, as well as with the active participation of different actors of society working in tandem. Globally, there is no one fix for these ever-evolving cyber threats, and governments recognize the need for collaboration and cooperation among states, ais well as all national cyber actors including the private sector, NGOs, academia, and citizens as @ part of the solution. To compound these issues, the trans-border nature of the Internet requires strategic thinking, not only in how we adopt technological solutions for the creation of more efficient services, but also in how we protect them. National Context Similarly, the implementation of cybersecurity measures takes into account many other aspects of a nation’s economic and developmental goals and plans. Therefore, in the development of the Strategy, there was a recognition that cybersecurity considerations cannot be taken in isolation but must be considered in the wider context of other policy decisions and national initiatives such as the National Sustainable Tourism Master Plan 2030®, the National Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy 2016-2019’, among others. The graphic below illustrates some of considerations and policies that were taken into account during the development of this Strategy: Figure 2 - Cybersecurity National Policies (National Security and Defence Strategy, Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy] National Coordination (Inter-governmental information sharing, national Incident Relevant Stakeholders response capability] (Government, Private Sector, Civil Society, Executive Branch, Academia] Critical [Information] Infrastructure Protection ; ; Legislative Framework (Mutual Legal Assistance, Cybercrime, Intellectual Property Rights] @ Horizon 2030: The National Development Framework for Belize The Horizon 2030° vision, goals and strategies arose out of an analysis of the current socio- economic situation of Belize, informed by a broad consultation process and review of existing technical and policy studies. The framework included specific vision statements from stakeholders including ‘Belizeans are capable of using state of the art technology which they incorporate into productive enterprise[s].’ Listed among five important cross cutting issues was a need to invest in education and a review of the education system to assess its strength and weaknesses and the development of a long term investment plan. This review, as stated in Horizon 2030, would define the human resources that are critical to closing the resource gaps identified. This approach is critical especially in the field of cybersecurity as it has been reported in several fora that there is a global cybersecurity skills gap, of which Belize is no exception. The gap in Cybersecurity jobs are expected to reach 1.8 million by 2022, up 20% from 1.5 million in 2015, according to the Center for Cyber Safety and Education’. National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 e@ National Security and Defence Strategy 2017-2020\" The vision of the NSDS is for a Belize “of peace and tranquility, where citizens live in harmony with the natural environment and enjoy a high quality of life. Belizeans are an energetic, resourceful and independent people looking after their own development in a sustainable way”. Having established itself on three main pillars, namely: 1. Maintain the Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity of Belize; 2. Reduce Local and Transnational Crimes; 3. Provide the necessary environment for a prosperous and stable Belize, the NSDS encompasses all factors identified to be essential to the security, stability and prosperity of Belize and the protection of the geopolitical space of Belize as defined by the Belize Constitution. As a part of the strategic objectives the NSDS states that as an effort to reduce such occurrences and the resulting harm to Belize’s sustainable development aspirations, there will be a provision of basic equipment and capacity to effectively manage and control Belize’s land, sea, air, and cyber space (emphasis added). As a nation we recognize cyberspace as a territory for protection. The NSDS further states that ‘in order to build public consensus, multilateral cooperation, and public-private partnerships to defeat transnational organized crime and local gangs, we aim to build new partnerships with industry, private sector, academia, civil society and non-governmental organizations to combat these networks that operate in the illicit and licit worlds[as well as] further international norms against tolerating or sponsoring crime in all its forms, including in cyberspace especially as it relates to prostitution and sexual abuse’(emphasis added). This is position is not a unique approach as many nations have recognized cyberspace as the fifth domain, and as a nation we will continue to extend our resources to protecting the all the borders of Belize, which is among the reasons for the development of strategic approach to cybersecurity efforts. @Belize’s Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy (GSDS) 2016-2019 Flowing from Horizon 2030, the GSDS is a strategic plan that places sustainable development as a priority while striving to bring economic, social and environmental policies into balance. The GSDS is based on the principles of sustainable development, and on three notable drivers that are common to successful developing countries: a proactive role for the state, tapping into global markets, and innovative social policy\". Among the Critical Success Factors for the GSDS, they identified CSF1, “Optimal National Income and Investment,” and included as an action to ‘Build institutional capacity to encourage technological adaptation and innovation while also taking into account climate change resilience considerations’. This line of action encourages the adoption of technology to improve efficiency, productivity and competitiveness. As stated in the GSDS, Capacity development processes will target the technical skills needed to facilitate government's efforts to encourage innovation and imitation. Notably, while technology will continue to revolutionize the way we do business, broader and wider-spread use of technology will also bring its vulnerabilities. Therefore the National Cybersecurity Strategy is designed to guide our nation to think of cybersecurity as an automatic consideration for any investment that involves technology. _ National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 Baseline Assessment It is imperative when designing a strategy at the national level that an assessment is undertaken to ensure, not only that the right areas of focus are identified, but also to determine what is being done well and where the deficiencies lie. As such, in the development of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, the level of connectivity to the Internet was consider to determine the scope of the problem, cybersecurity capacities that exists was measured and finally, the volume of cybercrimes that are committed in Belize was taken into account. In terms of connectivity, there has been a steady growth in the level of Internet penetration and connectivity”. The more connected people become the more avenues that open for opportunities for cyberattacks. As of 2018, the Internet penetration rate of Belize was recorded as being over 50% of the population, an increase of over 40% since 2000 (See Table).

Ensuring an understanding of ‘whatis at risk’ helps to shape prioritization and resourcing for implementation. Additionally, to measure existing capabilities to address the threats, in 2018, the Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) assessment was undertaken, and the results indicated that Belize, since it was last applied in 2016, was still between a start-up and a formative level of maturity in regards to cybersecurity along the five dimensions of capacities that were assessed. Thus, indicating the need for the development of this comprehensive framework. National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 With the ever increasing growth in connectivity, the dependence on Internet-based platforms has grown simultaneously, along with increased exposure to cyber related crimes. Despite the development and deployment of sophisticated cyber security solutions, patches, and updates, there has been a continuous increase in the number of cyber-attacks globally. For example, in 2018, a series of attacks from a group called ‘Magecart’ took place. This group was responsible for publicized breaches, including Ticketmaster and Feedify. With this, in addition to the recent spate of ransomware attacks on other targets such as FedEx, San Francisco's light-rail network, and Britain’s Notional Health Service, it is clear that the frequency and complexity of attacks have increased. An undeniable fact, is that many notions and organizations are struggling to keep pace with cybercriminal activities. The costs of cybercrime have been estimated to have quadrupled since 2015, reaching $2.1 trillion by the end of 2019 and outpacing spending on cybersecurity by over 16 times\". Gartner forecasts that industry spend in 2018 will reach $93 billion, as traditional security measures such as firewalls and anti-virus software prove to be inadequate’s. Cybersecurity hasnow become an increasing partof the national diclogue in Belize, with discussions to address this issue being staged among different sectors of the country. Over the pustfew years, several government agencies have also been working in order to address cybersecurity. Since 2014, the Ministry of National Security has been working on coordinating this at the national level and had organized a Cybersecurity Ad Hoc Committee, made up of multiple stakeholders, including academia and the private sector, to work together on building awareness about cybersecurity and cybercrime in Belize. Since then an inter-institutional cybersecurity task force, led by the PUC, NSCS, CITO and comprising a cross section of national stakeholders (both public and private sector, academia and civil society groups) was established in 2018 and was instrumental to the development of this Strategy. Cybercrime The Police Information Technology and Cyber Unit (PITCU) of Belize Police Department (BPD) manages the investigations of cyber-related crimes, as well as those felonies thatinvolve electronic evidence. The PITCU has investigated cases of phishing, credit card and ATM fraud, as well as other crimes that involve electronic evidence, including drug trafficking. The PITCU have also reported that they have received reports of cyberbullying, revenge porn and identity theft. In terms of some international collaboration to counter cybercriminal activities, the PITCU holds a partnership with the Internet Watch Foundation in order to report cases of child pornography’®. Below is a summary of cybercrimes recorded over the last five years. ‘% per annum Growth Table 2 CyberCrimes 2013 to 2018 Crimes committed through technology** Crimes targeting technology, etc.* Total # Incidents Year Incidents Incidents 2013 521 80 601 2014 663 116 779 29.62% 2015 713 166 879 12.84% 2016 818 145 963 9.56% 2017 773 118 891 -7.48% 2018 768 136 904 1.46% * For example cellphones, computers, note books, theft, damage, virus etc. ** For example, social engineering, phishing, texts, emails, etc. Figure 4 = Growth of Cybercrime - 5 year period CyberCrimes 2013 to 2018 2020 2015 ~ - = Pa = 2010 ~~ = 2005 @ 1995 1990 0 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 As recent as August 2018, it was reported that there were phishing scams targeting the Belizean Public’. Given the prevalence of theft of mobile devices in Belize, PITCU has been paying close attention because many cyber-related crimes are being executed through stolen devices. Legislative Framework Given that there is no comprehensive criminal legislation that strictly address cybercrime, the prosecution of these crimes have been difficult. Currently, Belize has several legislations that relate to cybercrime’: the Telecommunications Act-CAP. 229 and 2298S\", the Electronic Evidence Act-CAP. 95:017°, the Electronic Transactions Act-CAP. 29:01\"', the Intellectual Property Act, the Interception of Communications Act CAP. 229:01” and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act- CAP. 103:0173. With this legislative gap, there is a great need for the development of a comprehensive cybercrime bill that is tailored to the reality of Belize. Critical Infrastructure Cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure are a reality. These threats goes well beyond the risk of an information breach or an unavailable information system, but potentially impacts the lives of our citizens should critical infrastructure be impacted. There is a need to begin the dialogue among key stakeholders, which may include but not limited to ministries and other entities with responsibility for energy, food security, banking and finance, communication, transportation, health and security. For instance, the protection of our democracy as a nation is paramount and in this digital age, the digital assets supporting our democratic processes could be considered a critical infrastructure, given the destabilizing impact on society that could occur if they are rendered inoperable or unreliable. This is critical as Latin American and Caribbean region is not insusceptible to cyber-attacks. In 2015, the OAS and Trend Micro released a report” which highlighted the reality regarding attacks that negatively impact the critical infrastructure of the region. According to the Report, 44 percent of respondents reported being aware of different types of destructive attacks, while 40 percent said they had experienced attempts to shutdown cybernetic systems. In 2018, an updated report?® was released in collaboration with Microsoft, which indicated that 69 percent of respondents indicated they have noticed an increase in the number of attacks to their computer systems and/ or networks over the last 12 months, and 57 percent of the respondents indicated they did not have a dedicated budget for cybersecurity measures, even though in 59 percent of those respondents with a dedicated budget, indicated that their budgets have increased within the last year. This kind of data emphasizes the need to ensure that Critical Infrastructure is addressed directly because of the risk if left unattended. National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 PRIORITY AREAS oe aes Taking into account the state of cybersecurity readiness of Belize and the developmental goals for the coming years, this Strategy has identified three areas of priority which will be focused on for the next four years. The aim of these priority areas is to build the capacity of Belize to better address cybersecurity threats. Each area identified will include specific activities that address gaps such as the capability to identify and respond to cyber incidents. The other aim is to increase the overall awareness of not only government personnel on threats and tools needed to counter them but the general citizenry. Additionally, recognizing the need to have a comprehensive legislative framework in place, the Strategy outlines critical steps that can be taken to better enable the legislative posture of Belize to address cybercrime as a security risk. The following diagram summarizes the areas identified as priority for the Strategy.

This collaboration between and sense of ownership by stakeholders, can take into account all the various areas that impact the successful implementation of the Strategy, this includes sourcing technical capability, budget, talent recruitment, international cooperation. Collaboration and information sharing should be mutually beneficial for all and take into account the objectives the Strategy is aiming to achieve. The diagram below outlines all the various factors that should be taken into account for the implementation and monitoring of the Strategy. Human Resources SMART objectives Risk-Based Technical Capability International Assistance Allocation Governance Structure The incredibly complex challenges inherent to cybersecurity require a whole- of-nation approach guided by multiple agencies, partners and stakeholders . A Governance structure, therefore, is needed for the identification of roles and responsibilities and overall responsibility for the implementation of the areas of priorities identified in this document, as well as related national cybersecurity initiatives. This Strategy recognizes the need to take into account existing governance frameworks, for example, in relation to the areas identified that may require legislative changes, the responsible institutional actors will prepare and submit accordingly (i.e. the Office of the Attorney General and Office of the Solicitor General respectively). It is essential in this regard to consider who will manage inter-institutional relationships, act as a national and international point of contact, communicate and provide an advisory role in general regulations, follow-up and evaluation of measures. As such this Strategy recommends, that a National Cybersecurity Coordinator, under the auspices of the Ministry of National Security be appointed for the coordination of the implementation of actions identified in this Strategy. As a consultative body, the Inter-institutional Cybersecurity Task Force that was established for the development of the Strategy, should also be called upon on a periodic basis to provide advice on the areas of priorities identified in relation to their primary areas of responsibilities. Evaluation and Review Finally, metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the objectives and activities articulated in this Strategy are needed and as such an evaluation of the Strategy will be undertaken eighteen (18) months after its approval. National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023 PN > Areas of Priority The realization of the strategic vision of this Strategy will be based on the strategic objectives below. These objectives and activities have been developed by identifying the most important focal points and articulating a timeline within which they should be completed, broken down as follows: ¢ Short-Term: 6 months ¢ Medium-Term: 1 year ¢ Long-Term: 2 years Area of Priority 1: Develop the National Legal Framework to adequately address cybersecurity threats This component contemplates the review of the existing legal framework that impacts cybersecurity initiatives including legislation related to digital evidence, data protection, etc., with the goal of providing procedural tools for investigators and prosecutors of digital related crimes. Additionally, this priority recognizes the need to provide tools to end-users.

Therefore, they need to be informed about the severe consequences that may arise from just one mistake. Additionally, the cybersecurity workforce is a diverse group of practitioners who govern, design, defend, analyze, administer, operate, and maintain the data, systems, and networks, therefore building a pool of talent in Belize, will serve to benefit the country as technology advances. This component seeks to raise the level of national awareness as well, on key cybersecurity issues and focuses on specific messaging for targeted audiences. The importance of security awareness training in government cannot be overemphasized. Just as awareness training in the health sector can help improve the standard of living and avoid certain diseases, so security awareness mitigate consequences of cyber incidents. By promoting an awareness of digital rights, recognizing that this issue, if treated as a human right is a concern for everyone, efforts will be made to build campaigns to help the public understand that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. 7 Objectives: Coordinating Institutions: Initiatives and policies that supports the Lead: Ministry with responsibility for Education and development of a cybersecurity workforce defend, Technology analyze, administer and maintain the data, Partners: Belize Chamber of Commerce and systems, and networks developed Industry, University of Belize Association of Computing Machinery Student Chapter Activities: 1.1 Review existing workforce development Timeline: frameworks such as the National Initiative for Long Term Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework to identify specialty areas, work roles, tasks, and knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to develop a national cybersecurity workforce survey 1.2 Undertake a cybersecurity workforce study using the survey to determine skills gap needed at the national level 1.3 Undertake consultation with universities including University of Belize and the University of the West Indies, to identify specific course curriculum needed based on cybersecurity workforce study results and create a national training catalog of cybersecurity related courses available nationally 1.4 Develop a national training/workforce development plan that leverages on existing educational of-ferings (certificates, degrees, etc.) and incorporates gaps identified in the cybersecurity workforce study National Cybersecurity Strategy -

Belize comparative table 2016 and 2018 In that regard the Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) was implemented in 2016 and again in 2018 for Belize. The assessment tool is used to measure the level of maturity of a nation in regards to cybersecurity across five different dimensions (see sidebar “Dimensions of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model”.) Each dimension provides several indicators of cyber capacity (an average of 10 indicators per dimension) in order for a nation to understand the stage of maturity in each specific consideration. These indicators are measured across five levels of maturity: Start-up, Formative, Established, Strategic and Dynamic. The stages of maturity vary from an initial stage of maturity where a nation may have just begun to consider cybersecurity, through to a dynamic stage where a nation is able to quickly adapt to changes in the cybersecurity landscape, by balancing threat, vulnerability, risk, economic strategy or changing international needs, while at the same time improving its posture and readiness to face new threats. Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy Identifying whether countries have comprehensive national cybersecurity policies that identify stakeholders’ roles, responsibilities in order to ensure a coordinate and cohesive cybersecurity framework including their cyber defense outlook. Cyber Culture and Society Understanding the different mind-sets in terms of cybersecurity (government, private sector and society), identifying national cybersecurity awareness campaigns and privacy policies, as well as how is the level of trust in the use of online services (e-government and e-commerce). Cybersecurity Education, Training, and Skills Identifying the availability of training and education in cybersecurity and the availability of skilled labor force in this field. Legal and Regulatory Frameworks Legislation related to information and communications technologies (ICT), privacy, human rights, data protection, as well as substantive and procedural cybercrime law. Standards, Organizations and Technologies The adoption of standards, the presence of incident response teams and command and control centers, national infrastructure resilience, critical national infrastructure protection, crisis management, cybersecurity insurance, and digital redundancy.

SUMMARY       Cybersecurity Impacts many actors within the public domain, including policymakers, the private  sector, law enforcement, academia and civil society; therefore, a multi-stakeholder approach  was used In the development of this Strategy. Cybersecurity risks! in this regard, should therefore  be analyzed within a broader context that also encompasses legal, economic and social factors,  contributing to a better management of cybersecurity threats and decision-making. Technology  is changing exponentially every day, and the threats surrounding these technologies are becoming  Increasingly sophisticated. As our connectivity and dependence on Internet-based platforms and  services Increase, so do our vulnerabilities and exposure to cyber threats, While this growth has  brought numerous opportunities for many nations, cyber threats have equally evolved in recent  years. This reality, therefore, requires the development of public policies that seek to ensure an  open and safe internet for all   Developed through amulti-stakeholder approach, through the establishmentof an Inter-institutional  Cybersecurity Task Force, the National Cybersecurity Strategy of Belize seeks to establish a vision  to enhance the cybersecurity posture of Belize. Considering existing national plans and the level  of connectivity of the nation, a tiered approach was used to develop concrete and measurable  actions that can be taken to advance the capability of the nation to address cyber threats, As such,  In the development of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, the level of connectivity to the Internet,  as well as, the volume of cybercrimes that are committed in Belize were considered, These variables  were also used to determine the scope of the problem, existing cybersecurity gaps, capacities and  opportunities for public-private synergies in Belize.   In terms of connectivity, there has been a steady growth in the level of Internet penetration and  connectivity 2 The more connected people become the more avenues are open for cyberattacks. As  of 2018, the Internet penetration rate of Belize was recorded as being over 50% of the population, an  increase of over 40% since 2000. With respect to cybercrime, the Police Information Technology and  Cyber Unit (PITCU) the Belize Police Department (BPD) manages the investigations of cyber-related  crimes, as well as, those felonies that involve electronic evidence. The PITCU has investigated cases  of phishing, credit card and ATM fraud, as well as, other crimes that involve electronic evidence,  including drug trafficking. They have also received reports of cyberbullying, revenge porn and  identity theft. The PITCU holds a partnership with the Internet Watch Foundation, which facilitates  the international reporting and investigation of cases of child pornography’   National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023         Acknowledging the evolving dynamics of the cybersecurity landscape in Belize, the strategy   addresses three priorities pillars and includes actionable objectives to be realized over a period of   three (3) years:   Figure 1- Areas of Priority   Develop a National  Legal Framework to  address Cybersecurity  Threats                    Develop Capacity for  Incident Response  and Critical   Infrastructure Protection   Areas of  Priorities   Implement measures  to support Education,  Awareness and Workforce  Policy Development in  Cybersecurity   It is essential to consider who or what entity will manage the inter-institutional relationships of   Belize’s cybersecurity landscape, act as a national and international point of contact to facilitate   cooperation, provide an advisory role in the development of programmatic interventions, and   perhaps most importantly, coordinate the execution, evaluation and reporting of the strategy’s   action plan. As such, this Strategy recommends, that a National Cybersecurity Coordinator,   under the auspices of the Ministry of National Security be appointed for the coordination of the   implementation of actions identified in this Strategy.   Finally, the Strategy recognizes the need to undertake a review of its achievements within eighteen   (18) months of its approval.   National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023          It is without a doubt that the fourth industrial revolution is here. In the words of Professor Klaus  Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum:   “This Fourth Industrial Revolution is, however, fundamentally different. It is characterised by a range  of new technologies that are fusing the physical, digital and biological worlds, impacting all disciplines,  economies and industries, and even challenging ideas about what it means to be human. The resulting  shifts and disruptions mean that we live in a time of great promise and great peril.\"   The Internet as a shared global resource encapsulates unimaginable possibilities, As we seek to  Improve the standard of living of our people, we must harness the potential of this tool to capitalize  on the opportunities in the digital economy. However, this cannot be pursued In a vacuum, as  securing our engagement online from the onset is a critical first step In ensuring we retain value in  whatever digital investments are made.   Why would | say this? Cyberspace has also become the fifth domain, along with air, sea, land and  space, requiring defence. With the increased frequency and sophistication of malicious cyber  activities, as a developing nationwe cannot afford to be complacent. In today’s digital age, everyone  should care about cybersecurity, With the advancement in mobile technology for example, many  Belizeans are engaged online. Personal information on social media sites such as phone number,  email address, home address, and credit/debit card numbers and other Information like photos  aind opinions, etc. are being shared. Aside from social media sites, people share their details for  business reasons, and many have no idea how their Information would be used, Further, another  challenge in this area is the global shortage of cybersecurity experts, and Belize is no exception.   With the above in ming, the strategic lines of action articulated in this document demonstrate,  among other things, two main concepts   We as a Government recognize our cybersecurity gaps and challenges BUT at the same  time, we recognize that everything cannot be all fixed with a stroke of a pen and the  articulation of this document, therefore, we have identified three (3) key priority areas to  start our journey of building resiliency and protecting the Belizean people.   National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023      2. We also recognize that ‘no man is an island’ and this must be a national effort. Relying   on, while cultivating our own homegrown talent, we will face this challenge recognizing the   need to institutionalize processes that will improve our overall cyber hygiene.   | must conclude by stating that this National Cybersecurity Strategy demonstrates a commitment   to strengthening Belize’s capabilities and national coordination to mitigate the impact of cyber   threats. It also recognizes the importance of having a strategic vision to address Cybersecurity.   | implore all Belizeans to embrace this new digital era with a consciousness that the protection   of the Internet is a shared resource. On behalf of the Government and people of Belize, | take this   opportunity to thank everyone that was engaged in the development process and contributed their   time, knowledge and talent to make this national cybersecurity framework possible.

PRINCIPLES  A comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity is paramount to keep pace with emerging   technologies and more sophisticated threats. Cybersecurity capacity should not only include the   protection of networks and systems, but also take into account the people that rely more and more   on Internet-enabled devices to conduct basic tasks. In that regard the following principles have   guided the development of the Strategy and will further guide its implementation.   Respect for and the promotion of fundamental rights       This Strategy recognizes that human rights apply online, as well as offline, and that cybersecurity   and human rights are mutually reinforcing. Thus this Strategy protects and promotes fundamental   rights and freedoms such as the right to privacy, freedom of expression, freedom of association,   freedom of assembly among others, in addition to being in line with Part Il of the Constitution of   Belize and the international instruments to which Belize is party to.   Government Led       Recognizing that the Government is one of the largest consumers of information technology   services, it commits to driving the objectives of this Strategy by adopting best practices in its   operations and lead by example in the implementation of the Strategy’s objectives.   National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023    Risk based approach      With the understanding of the importance of Critical Infrastructure to the welfare of Belize,   the Strategy seeks to mitigate cybersecurity risks to acceptable levels by encouraging the   combination of cost benefit, acceptable risk and other qualitative and quantitative approaches   with the desired end result of the protection of Belizean people and economy.   Shared responsibility      Cybersecurity affects everyone and as a result it is a shared responsibility for all to exercise   cybersecurity best practices. Targeted awareness raising initiatives will be implemented through   the mobilization and partnership with civil society, academia and other interest groups across   Belize, to enable and empower end-users to keep themselves and their organizations safer online.   Fostering an environment for economic growth and innovation      Recognizing the importance of innovation and business development to our national economy, a   cyber-environment that is safe and conducive to such development will be fostered.   International Cooperation      The age-old statement ‘no-man is an island’ has become such a relevant concept in this digital   era. The need for comprehensive stakeholder cooperation has never been greater than it is today.   This Strategy focuses on the need to leverage international partnerships to investigate criminal   activities, build capacity and protect Belize’s cyberspace.   National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023          This Strategy was developed in collaboration with the Government and stakeholders, to address  cybersecurity threats facing Belize, 80 as to provide guidance onkey actions to be taken to improve  Belize’s overall preparedness and responsiveness to these threats. This Strategy outlines the  principles and long-term goals that will form the basis and overall direction for the planning and  development of the national cybersecurity posture, including @ plan of action outlining various  roles and responsibilities for implementation.   Cybersecurity impacts many actors such as, policy-makers, private sector, law enforcement,  academia, and civil society, therefore a multistakeholder approach was used In the development  of this Strategy. Cybersecurity risks® In this regard, should therefore be analyzed within a  broader context that also encompasses legal, economic and social factors, contributing to a  better management of cybersecurity threats and decision-making. Technology is changing  exponentially every day, and the threats surrounding these technologies are becoming  Increasingly sophisticated. Our growing connectivity and dependence on Internet-based  platforms and services has significantly increased our exposure to cyber threats, While this growth  has brought numerous opportunities for many nations, cyber threats have equally evolved in  recent years. This therefore, requires the development of public policies that seek to ensure an  open and safe Intemetfor all. In order to mitigate the impact of these threats, a structural change  around cybersecurity is imperative, However, this structural change is only possible with national  coordination and intemational cooperation, as well as with the active participation of different  actors of society working in tandem. Globally, there is no one fix for these ever-evolving cyber  threats, and governments recognize the need for collaboration and cooperation among states,  ais well as all national cyber actors including the private sector, NGOs, academia, and citizens as  @ part of the solution. To compound these issues, the trans-border nature of the Internet requires  strategic thinking, not only in how we adopt technological solutions for the creation of more  efficient services, but also in how we protect them.        National Context      Similarly, the implementation of cybersecurity measures takes into account many other aspects   of a nation’s economic and developmental goals and plans. Therefore, in the development of the   Strategy, there was a recognition that cybersecurity considerations cannot be taken in isolation but   must be considered in the wider context of other policy decisions and national initiatives such as the   National Sustainable Tourism Master Plan 2030®, the National Growth and Sustainable Development   Strategy 2016-2019’, among others. The graphic below illustrates some of considerations and   policies that were taken into account during the development of this Strategy:   Figure 2 - Cybersecurity   National Policies  (National Security and  Defence Strategy, Growth and   Sustainable Development Strategy]        National Coordination  (Inter-governmental   information sharing,   national Incident Relevant Stakeholders  response capability] (Government, Private Sector,   Civil Society, Executive   Branch, Academia]   Critical [Information]   Infrastructure Protection ; ;  Legislative Framework  (Mutual Legal Assistance,   Cybercrime, Intellectual   Property Rights]   @ Horizon 2030: The National Development Framework for Belize       The Horizon 2030° vision, goals and strategies arose out of an analysis of the current socio-   economic situation of Belize, informed by a broad consultation process and review of existing   technical and policy studies. The framework included specific vision statements from   stakeholders including ‘Belizeans are capable of using state of the art technology which they   incorporate into productive enterprise[s].’ Listed among five important cross cutting issues   was a need to invest in education and a review of the education system to assess its strength   and weaknesses and the development of a long term investment plan. This review, as stated   in Horizon 2030, would define the human resources that are critical to closing the resource   gaps identified. This approach is critical especially in the field of cybersecurity as it has been   reported in several fora that there is a global cybersecurity skills gap, of which Belize is no   exception. The gap in Cybersecurity jobs are expected to reach 1.8 million by 2022, up 20%   from 1.5 million in 2015, according to the Center for Cyber Safety and Education’.   National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023         e@ National Security and Defence Strategy 2017-2020\"       The vision of the NSDS is for a Belize “of peace and tranquility, where citizens live in harmony with   the natural environment and enjoy a high quality of life. Belizeans are an energetic, resourceful   and independent people looking after their own development in a sustainable way”. Having   established itself on three main pillars, namely: 1. Maintain the Sovereignty and Territorial   Integrity of Belize; 2. Reduce Local and Transnational Crimes; 3. Provide the necessary   environment for a prosperous and stable Belize, the NSDS encompasses all factors identified   to be essential to the security, stability and prosperity of Belize and the protection of the   geopolitical space of Belize as defined by the Belize Constitution. As a part of the strategic   objectives the NSDS states that as an effort to reduce such occurrences and the resulting   harm to Belize’s sustainable development aspirations, there will be a provision of basic   equipment and capacity to effectively manage and control Belize’s land, sea, air, and cyber   space (emphasis added). As a nation we recognize cyberspace as a territory for protection.   The NSDS further states that ‘in order to build public consensus, multilateral cooperation,   and public-private partnerships to defeat transnational organized crime and local gangs,   we aim to build new partnerships with industry, private sector, academia, civil society and   non-governmental organizations to combat these networks that operate in the illicit and   licit worlds...[as well as] ..further international norms against tolerating or sponsoring crime   in all its forms, including in cyberspace especially as it relates to prostitution and sexual   abuse’(emphasis added). This is position is not a unique approach as many nations have  recognized cyberspace as the fifth domain, and as a nation we will continue to extend our   resources to protecting the all the borders of Belize, which is among the reasons for the   development of strategic approach to cybersecurity efforts.   @Belize’s Growth and Sustainable Development Strategy (GSDS) 2016-2019       Flowing from Horizon 2030, the GSDS is a strategic plan that places sustainable development   as a priority while striving to bring economic, social and environmental policies into balance.   The GSDS is based on the principles of sustainable development, and on three notable   drivers that are common to successful developing countries: a proactive role for the state,   tapping into global markets, and innovative social policy\". Among the Critical Success   Factors for the GSDS, they identified CSF1, “Optimal National Income and Investment,” and   included as an action to ‘Build institutional capacity to encourage technological adaptation   and innovation while also taking into account climate change resilience considerations’.   This line of action encourages the adoption of technology to improve efficiency, productivity   and competitiveness. As stated in the GSDS, Capacity development processes will target   the technical skills needed to facilitate government's efforts to encourage innovation and   imitation. Notably, while technology will continue to revolutionize the way we do business,   broader and wider-spread use of technology will also bring its vulnerabilities. Therefore the   National Cybersecurity Strategy is designed to guide our nation to think of cybersecurity as   an automatic consideration for any investment that involves technology.   _ National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023      Baseline Assessment       It is imperative when designing a strategy at the national level that an assessment is undertaken   to ensure, not only that the right areas of focus are identified, but also to determine what is being   done well and where the deficiencies lie. As such, in the development of the National Cybersecurity   Strategy, the level of connectivity to the Internet was consider to determine the scope of the problem,   cybersecurity capacities that exists was measured and finally, the volume of cybercrimes that are   committed in Belize was taken into account.   In terms of connectivity, there has been a steady growth in the level of Internet penetration and   connectivity”. The more connected people become the more avenues that open for opportunities   for cyberattacks. As of 2018, the Internet penetration rate of Belize was recorded as being over 50%   of the population, an increase of over 40% since 2000 (See Table).   Table 1       sxe) elul(ola loyal ee Cc   2000 245,800 15,000 6.10%   2005 291,904 35,000 12.00%   2008 301,270 32,000 10.60%   2012 327,19 74,700 22.80%   2013 340,844 108,048 31.70%   2018 382,444 200,020 52.30%   Source: World Bank and ITU   The primary goal of information such as this is to implement measures to reduce risk. Ensuring an   understanding of ‘whatis at risk’ helps to shape prioritization and resourcing for implementation.   Additionally, to measure existing capabilities to address the threats, in 2018, the Cybersecurity   Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) assessment was undertaken, and the results   indicated that Belize, since it was last applied in 2016, was still between a start-up and a formative   level of maturity in regards to cybersecurity along the five dimensions of capacities that were   assessed. Thus, indicating the need for the development of this comprehensive framework.   National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023          With the ever increasing growth in connectivity, the dependence on Internet-based platforms  has grown simultaneously, along with increased exposure to cyber related crimes. Despite the  development and deployment of sophisticated cyber security solutions, patches, and updates,  there has been a continuous increase in the number of cyber-attacks globally. For example, in  2018, a series of attacks from a group called ‘Magecart’ took place. This group was responsible  for publicized breaches, including Ticketmaster and Feedify. With this, in addition to the recent  spate of ransomware attacks on other targets such as FedEx, San Francisco's light-rail network,  and Britain’s Notional Health Service, it is clear that the frequency and complexity of attacks  have increased.   An undeniable fact, is that many notions and organizations are struggling to keep pace with  cybercriminal activities. The costs of cybercrime have been estimated to have quadrupled since  2015, reaching $2.1 trillion by the end of 2019 and outpacing spending on cybersecurity by over 16  times\". Gartner forecasts that industry spend in 2018 will reach $93 billion, as traditional security  measures such as firewalls and anti-virus software prove to be inadequate’s.       Cybersecurity hasnow become an increasing partof the national diclogue in Belize, with discussions  to address this issue being staged among different sectors of the country. Over the pustfew years,  several government agencies have also been working in order to address cybersecurity. Since 2014,  the Ministry of National Security has been working on coordinating this at the national level and  had organized a Cybersecurity Ad Hoc Committee, made up of multiple stakeholders, including  academia and the private sector, to work together on building awareness about cybersecurity  and cybercrime in Belize. Since then an inter-institutional cybersecurity task force, led by the PUC,  NSCS, CITO and comprising a cross section of national stakeholders (both public and private  sector, academia and civil society groups) was established in 2018 and was instrumental to the  development of this Strategy.          Cybercrime      The Police Information Technology and Cyber Unit (PITCU) of Belize Police Department (BPD)   manages the investigations of cyber-related crimes, as well as those felonies thatinvolve electronic   evidence. The PITCU has investigated cases of phishing, credit card and ATM fraud, as well as other   crimes that involve electronic evidence, including drug trafficking. The PITCU have also reported   that they have received reports of cyberbullying, revenge porn and identity theft. In terms of some   international collaboration to counter cybercriminal activities, the PITCU holds a partnership with   the Internet Watch Foundation in order to report cases of child pornography’®. Below is a summary   of cybercrimes recorded over the last five years.   ‘% per  annum   Growth   Table 2                          CyberCrimes 2013 to 2018                              Crimes committed  through   technology**               Crimes targeting  technology, etc.*              Total #   Incidents           Year Incidents Incidents   2013 521 80 601   2014 663 116 779 29.62%   2015 713 166 879 12.84%   2016 818 145 963 9.56%   2017 773 118 891 -7.48%   2018 768 136 904 1.46%   * For example cellphones, computers, note books, theft, damage, virus etc.   ** For example, social engineering, phishing, texts, emails, etc.   Figure 4 = Growth of Cybercrime - 5 year period   CyberCrimes 2013 to 2018   2020     2015    ~ - =   Pa =     2010 ~~ =   2005 @     1995     1990                   0   2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019       National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023      As recent as August 2018, it was reported that there were phishing scams targeting the Belizean   Public’. Given the prevalence of theft of mobile devices in Belize, PITCU has been paying close   attention because many cyber-related crimes are being executed through stolen devices.   Legislative Framework      Given that there is no comprehensive criminal legislation that strictly address cybercrime, the   prosecution of these crimes have been difficult. Currently, Belize has several legislations that relate   to cybercrime’: the Telecommunications Act-CAP. 229 and 2298S\", the Electronic Evidence Act-CAP.   95:017°, the Electronic Transactions Act-CAP. 29:01\"', the Intellectual Property Act, the Interception of   Communications Act CAP. 229:01” and the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act- CAP.   103:0173. With this legislative gap, there is a great need for the development of a comprehensive   cybercrime bill that is tailored to the reality of Belize.   Critical Infrastructure       Cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure are a reality. These threats goes well beyond the risk   of an information breach or an unavailable information system, but potentially impacts the lives   of our citizens should critical infrastructure be impacted. There is a need to begin the dialogue   among key stakeholders, which may include but not limited to ministries and other entities with   responsibility for energy, food security, banking and finance, communication, transportation,   health and security. For instance, the protection of our democracy as a nation is paramount and   in this digital age, the digital assets supporting our democratic processes could be considered   a critical infrastructure, given the destabilizing impact on society that could occur if they are   rendered inoperable or unreliable.   This is critical as Latin American and Caribbean region is not insusceptible to cyber-attacks. In   2015, the OAS and Trend Micro released a report” which highlighted the reality regarding attacks   that negatively impact the critical infrastructure of the region. According to the Report, 44 percent   of respondents reported being aware of different types of destructive attacks, while 40 percent   said they had experienced attempts to shutdown cybernetic systems. In 2018, an updated report?®   was released in collaboration with Microsoft, which indicated that 69 percent of respondents   indicated they have noticed an increase in the number of attacks to their computer systems and/   or networks over the last 12 months, and 57 percent of the respondents indicated they did not have   a dedicated budget for cybersecurity measures, even though in 59 percent of those respondents   with a dedicated budget, indicated that their budgets have increased within the last year. This kind   of data emphasizes the need to ensure that Critical Infrastructure is addressed directly because of   the risk if left unattended.   National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023                 PRIORITY AREAS  <a =>   oe                      aes       Taking into account the state of cybersecurity readiness of Belize and the developmental goals for   the coming years, this Strategy has identified three areas of priority which will be focused on for the   next four years. The aim of these priority areas is to build the capacity of Belize to better address   cybersecurity threats. Each area identified will include specific activities that address gaps such   as the capability to identify and respond to cyber incidents. The other aim is to increase the overall   awareness of not only government personnel on threats and tools needed to counter them but   the general citizenry. Additionally, recognizing the need to have a comprehensive legislative   framework in place, the Strategy outlines critical steps that can be taken to better enable the   legislative posture of Belize to address cybercrime as a security risk.   The following diagram summarizes the areas identified as priority for the Strategy.   National  Cybersecurity   Strategy   J t                Develop a   national capacity  Legal Framework for incident response  (development of and critical information   legislation and human infrastructure protection   resources to detect, Cercle aaa of  investigate and National Incident   eNKereYeLU Ke) Reponse capabilities  and sectoral   CIRTs)   vie  Multi-stakeholder   Partnership   Workforce   Development,   Education and   awareness in   cybersecurity  (development of courses   relevant to digital  economy and society   awareness of  threats)             National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023      on   aes    Effective implementation can only be achieved if a governance and monitoring process that   takes into account all stakeholders, their competencies and contributions is implemented. This   collaboration between and sense of ownership by stakeholders, can take into account all the   various areas that impact the successful implementation of the Strategy, this includes sourcing   technical capability, budget, talent recruitment, international cooperation. Collaboration and   information sharing should be mutually beneficial for all and take into account the objectives the   Strategy is aiming to achieve. The diagram below outlines all the various factors that should be   taken into account for the implementation and monitoring of the Strategy.   Human  Resources   SMART  objectives Risk-Based   Technical  Capability                                             International  Assistance Allocation        Governance Structure       The incredibly complex challenges inherent to cybersecurity require a whole- of-nation   approach guided by multiple agencies, partners and stakeholders . A Governance structure,   therefore, is needed for the identification of roles and responsibilities and overall responsibility   for the implementation of the areas of priorities identified in this document, as well as related   national cybersecurity initiatives. This Strategy recognizes the need to take into account existing   governance frameworks, for example, in relation to the areas identified that may require legislative   changes, the responsible institutional actors will prepare and submit accordingly (i.e. the Office of   the Attorney General and Office of the Solicitor General respectively).   It is essential in this regard to consider who will manage inter-institutional relationships, act as a   national and international point of contact, communicate and provide an advisory role in general   regulations, follow-up and evaluation of measures. As such this Strategy recommends, that a   National Cybersecurity Coordinator, under the auspices of the Ministry of National Security be   appointed for the coordination of the implementation of actions identified in this Strategy. As   a consultative body, the Inter-institutional Cybersecurity Task Force that was established for the   development of the Strategy, should also be called upon on a periodic basis to provide advice on   the areas of priorities identified in relation to their primary areas of responsibilities.   Evaluation and Review       Finally, metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the objectives and activities articulated in this   Strategy are needed and as such an evaluation of the Strategy will be undertaken eighteen (18)  months after its approval.   National Cybersecurity Strategy - Towards A Secure Cyberspace 2020-2023                    PN >   Areas of Priority      The realization of the strategic vision of this Strategy will be based on the strategic objectives   below.

Therefore,   they need to be informed about the severe consequences that may arise from just one mistake.   Additionally, the cybersecurity workforce is a diverse group of practitioners who govern, design,   defend, analyze, administer, operate, and maintain the data, systems, and networks, therefore   building a pool of talent in Belize, will serve to benefit the country as technology advances. This   component seeks to raise the level of national awareness as well, on key cybersecurity issues and   focuses on specific messaging for targeted audiences. The importance of security awareness   training in government cannot be overemphasized. Just as awareness training in the health sector   can help improve the standard of living and avoid certain diseases, so security awareness mitigate   consequences of cyber incidents. By promoting an awareness of digital rights, recognizing that this   issue, if treated as a human right is a concern for everyone, efforts will be made to build campaigns   to help the public understand that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility.   7 Objectives: Coordinating Institutions:  Initiatives and policies that supports the Lead: Ministry with responsibility for Education and   development of a cybersecurity workforce defend, Technology   analyze, administer and maintain the data, Partners: Belize Chamber of Commerce and   systems, and networks developed Industry, University of Belize Association of   Computing Machinery Student Chapter   Activities:  1.1 Review existing workforce development Timeline:   frameworks such as the National Initiative for Long Term   Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity   Workforce Framework to identify specialty   areas, work roles, tasks, and knowledge, skills,   and abilities needed to develop a national   cybersecurity workforce survey   1.2 Undertake a cybersecurity workforce study   using the survey to determine skills gap needed   at the national level   1.3 Undertake consultation with universities   including University of Belize and the University   of the West Indies, to identify specific course   curriculum needed based on cybersecurity   workforce study results and create a national   training catalog of cybersecurity related courses   available nationally   1.4 Develop a national training/workforce   development plan that leverages on existing   educational of-ferings (certificates, degrees,   etc.) and incorporates gaps identified in the   cybersecurity workforce study   National Cybersecurity Strategy -

Belize  comparative table 2016 and 2018      In that regard the Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM) was implemented in   2016 and again in 2018 for Belize. The assessment tool is used to measure the level of maturity of a   nation in regards to cybersecurity across five different dimensions (see sidebar “Dimensions of the   Cybersecurity Maturity Model”.) Each dimension provides several indicators of cyber capacity (an   average of 10 indicators per dimension) in order for a nation to understand the stage of maturity in   each specific consideration. These indicators are measured across five levels of maturity: Start-up,   Formative, Established, Strategic and Dynamic. The stages of maturity vary from an initial stage of   maturity where a nation may have just begun to consider cybersecurity, through to a dynamic stage   where a nation is able to quickly adapt to changes in the cybersecurity landscape, by balancing   threat, vulnerability, risk, economic strategy or changing international needs, while at the same time   improving its posture and readiness to face new threats.   Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy Identifying whether countries have comprehensive national   cybersecurity policies that identify stakeholders’ roles, responsibilities in order to ensure a coordinate   and cohesive cybersecurity framework including their cyber defense outlook.   Cyber Culture and Society Understanding the different mind-sets in terms of cybersecurity   (government, private sector and society), identifying national cybersecurity awareness campaigns   and privacy policies, as well as how is the level of trust in the use of online services (e-government and   e-commerce).   Cybersecurity Education, Training, and Skills Identifying the availability of training and education in   cybersecurity and the availability of skilled labor force in this field.   Legal and Regulatory Frameworks Legislation related to information and communications technologies   (ICT), privacy, human rights, data protection, as well as substantive and procedural cybercrime law.   Standards, Organizations and Technologies The adoption of standards, the presence of incident   response teams and command and control centers, national infrastructure resilience, critical national   infrastructure protection, crisis management, cybersecurity insurance, and digital redundancy.

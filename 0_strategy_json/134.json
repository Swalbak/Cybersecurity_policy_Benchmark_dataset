Instantaneous communications, transactions, and access to information keep our economies growing, infrastructure operating, governments working and people in touch. Technology will continue to fundamentally change the way we live, work and relate to one another. The borderless nature of cyberspace means international cyber issues present opportunities and challenges for all Australians, every day. Digital trade, cyber-enabled intellectual property theft, technology for development and operations to influence elections are some of the ways cyber affairs permeate our international conversations. The 2016 Cyber Security Strategy committed to expanding on how Australia will attain global responsibility and influence in cyberspace. Now, more than ever, we must engage with the international community as exciting possibilities emerge, critical debates unfold and global rules are agreed. Australia’s first International Cyber Engagement Strategy states Australia’s comprehensive international cyber affairs agenda. It sets a clear vision of Australia’s interests and objectives in cyberspace over the next three years. Reflecting Australia’s broad view of cyber affairs, this Strategy establishes a whole-of-Government approach across seven key themes: Digital Trade, Cyber Security, Cybercrime, International Security, Internet Governance & Cooperation, Human Rights & Democracy Online and Technology for Development. The Strategy is supported by a practical action plan. The Foreign Policy White Paper, currently under development, will reiterate our understanding of the significant and growing importance of cyber issues to Australia’s foreign policy. It will also chart a course to position Australia for opportunity, while managing the risks of our increasingly interconnected world. Our international cyber engagement protects Australians and promotes our interests. It positions us to harness opportunities and increase our cyber resilience. An open, free and secure Internet drives economic growth, enhances our national security and fosters international stability. 5 FOREIGN MINISTER’S FOREwORd Australia remains committed to a peaceful online environment. The activities of states in cyberspace have implications for us all. Cyberspace is not an ungoverned space. Just like in the physical domains, states have rights but they also have obligations. Existing international law applies to states’ conduct in cyberspace, complemented by agreed norms of responsible state behaviour. Increasingly, states are testing the boundaries of what is and isn’t acceptable in cyberspace. Australia will cooperate with its international partners to deter, mitigate and attribute malicious cyber activity by criminals, state actors and their proxies, including those that seek to interfere in the internal democratic processes of states. Australia’s cyber affairs agenda is global in perspective and regional in focus. As a responsible contributor to the international community, we have a platform to engage on cyber policy issues within global forums. Strong participation in global cyber cooperation efforts benefits Australia’s national and economic interests. It also positions Australia to take a leading international role in shaping the future of cyberspace. The Indo-Pacific region presents significant digital opportunities and complex cyber challenges. It is home to some of the most advanced digital economies as well as countries whose digital development is still in its early stages. It is here, in the Indo-Pacific, that Australia can best leverage our cyber capacity building resources to support and open, free and secure Internet. Digital technologies are profound enablers of sustainable development and economic growth. Australia will work to improve connectivity and access to the Internet across the Indo-Pacific. We will encourage the use of resilient development-enabling technologies for egovernance and digital delivery of services. We will also support entrepreneurship, help develop a digital ready workforce and promote our region’s further integration into the global market place. This Strategy sets out Australia’s plan to promote confidence in the online environment, increase economic opportunities, reduce losses attributable to cybercrime, minimise the risks of strategic miscalculation in cyberspace, promote multi-stakeholder Internet governance, protect human rights online and deliver sustainable development outcomes. I look forward to engaging with governments at home and abroad, the private sector, civil society and academia to enhance the prosperity and security of Australia, our region, and the world. The Hon Julie Bishop MP Minister for Foreign Affairs 4 October 2017 6 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY Introduction by the Ambassador for Cyber Affairs Cyber affairs play a significant role in Australia’s international relations with other countries. While once a technical niche issue, cyber affairs is now a strategic international policy issue. Thanks to cyberspace, the connections between governments, businesses, communities and individuals are more complex than ever before. As the complexity of cyberspace grows, it demands increased international attention, cooperation and creativity. This Strategy sets an ambitious agenda across the full spectrum of cyber affairs. Framing Australia’s international cyber interests through this comprehensive lens empowers us to see the big picture of the dynamic cyber landscape. Australia’s interests in cyberspace are diverse and interconnected: from capturing the economic prosperity promised by digital trade and technology enabled-development, to securing Australia from the threat of cybercriminals and preserving stability in cyberspace. Growth of disruptive business models supported by digital technologies present exciting opportunities for Australian businesses. Government and the private sector therefore have a mutual responsibility and interest in maximising the opportunities and mitigating the risks of the online world. Australia’s vision of an open, free and secure cyberspace and our ambitions across the broad spectrum of cyber affairs are impossible to achieve alone. All of our efforts, both globally and regionally, will be delivered in partnership. We will combine the unique and complementary skills of other countries, the private sector, civil society and the research community. International cyber issues are constantly evolving and Australia’s approach to international cyber engagement must reflect this. Frequent review of Australia’s approach to cyber affairs will ensure Australia continues to adopt the most effective means to achieve our goals in cyberspace. Harnessing the opportunities of the digital age and mitigating risks is a shared challenge and a shared responsibility. My team and I look forward to working with you to advance and protect our collective interests in cyberspace.

Through comprehensive and coordinated engagement on cyber affairs, we will maximise opportunities for economic growth and prosperity through digital trade. Australia will cooperate internationally to reduce the risk of cybercrime and promote peace and stability in cyberspace. We will advocate for multi-stakeholder Internet governance and respect for human rights and democratic principles online. We will partner to foster good cyber security practices and encourage the use of digital technologies to achieve sustainable development, particularly in our region. The digital technology revolution is fundamentally a story of prosperity. Increasingly, cyberspace acts as an economic enabler. Connectivity helps improve productivity and provides customers and the private sector with greater access to the global marketplace. Shaping an enabling environment for digital trade will deliver increased prosperity for Australia and enhance realisation of economic opportunity globally. This progress is only possible if underpinned by sound cyber security. The spread of digital technologies creates profound economic opportunities but, at the same time, creates new vulnerabilities. Individuals, the private sector and governments around the world face an evolving array of cyber threats. Governments and the private sector working together to develop a strong cyber security posture is an essential prerequisite to ensuring we can all safely capitalise on the benefits of increasing connectivity. As part of this effort, Australia will encourage innovative cyber security solutions and deliver world leading cyber security advice. Improving cyber security is an important way of mitigating the risk of cybercrime. Left unchecked, criminal use of the Internet threatens to undermine the economic opportunity offered by the digital domain. Like cyberspace, cybercrime is not confined by geographic borders. 10 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY As such, Australian individuals, the private sector and government can be exposed to threats emanating from other countries. Working collaboratively with international partners and helping countries in our region improve their capacity to address cybercrime will improve prevention and prosecution of cybercrime worldwide. It is not only criminals who threaten the online environment. Developments in cyberspace have created a new arena in which states can exert influence. The increasingly complex nature of the international landscape means that more and more actors now pursue strategic goals in the digital domain; some challenging the international rules-based order in the process. Australia is committed to a peaceful and stable cyberspace. We will cooperate with international partners to deter and respond to malicious cyber activity that endangers international peace, security and stability. Reaffirming the application of international law to cyberspace, adhering to norms of responsible behaviour in cyberspace and implementing confidence-building measures will shape cyberspace as a landscape for international cooperation and mutual benefit. The private sector, civil society, academia, individuals and government are all important stakeholders in cyberspace. A multi-stakeholder approach to Internet governance, which places all stakeholders on an equal footing in Internet governance debates, best facilitates an open, free and secure Internet. Better multi-stakeholder cooperation domestically, regionally and internationally will preserve decentralised control of the Internet, allowing all voices to be heard when decisions over the policy and technical management of the Internet are made. The promotion and protection of human rights and democratic principles online is crucial; human rights apply online as they do offline. The Internet itself has provided an unparalleled opportunity for online democratic participation and the promotion, protection and fulfilment of human rights. This contributes to lasting peace, security, freedom and dignity for all. Governments, the private sector, civil society and academia must continue to work together to uphold and defend human rights online, just as they do offline. Beyond the realisation of human rights, connectivity and the uptake of digital technologies also act as a profound enabler of sustainable development and inclusive economic growth. Innovative uses of technology, entrepreneurial activities and the digital upskilling of workforces have seen economies transform and societies make great leaps in development. However, dividends of the digital age are currently not evenly experienced. Increasing connectivity and harnessing digital technologies safely will accelerate the attainment of sustainable development objectives, especially in regions, countries and populations where digital journeys are only just beginning. Australia’s International Cyber Engagement Strategy addresses the full breadth of these issues, from trade to cybercrime, from international security to international cooperation, and from human rights to sustainable development. Australia has adopted a comprehensive and coordinated approach to cyber affairs. We will achieve our objectives in cyberspace through cooperation, creative partnerships and practical action. 11 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY DIGITAL TRADE AUSTRALIA’S GOAL: Maximise the opportunity for economic growth and prosperity through digital trade TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, AUSTRALIA wILL: Shape an enabling environment for digital trade, including through trade agreements, harmonisation of standards, and implementation of trade facilitation measures Promote trade and investment opportunities for Australian digital goods and services Digital technologies and the Internet are key drivers of economic growth and innovation. The digital economy has shifted from a niche sector to an essential part of the economy. The line between traditional goods and digital goods is blurring. The Internet makes it easier for consumers and businesses to trade goods, services and information around the world. Digital trade is not just about buying and selling goods and services online, it is also the transmission of information and data across borders. It relies on the use of digital technologies to facilitate trade and improve productivity, for example through simplified customs procedures. While flows of information and data may not always be for profit, they are essential enablers of digital trade. Nowhere is the potential for digital trade greater than in our region. For the first time, in 2017 more than 50 per cent of global Internet users were located in the Indo-Pacific. Yet, only 46.4 per cent of households in the Indo-Pacific were connected to the Internet in 2016, so there are vast untapped opportunities for digital trade. Successfully harnessing this opportunity promises economic growth for countries in the region as well as new market opportunities for Australian businesses. However, this potential can only be realised if countries cooperate to establish an enabling environment for digital trade. Governments must work with the private sector and consumer groups to ensure digital trade policies and norms and rules foster economic growth and security. This work must be practical, evidence-based and consensus driven. It should be coupled with international efforts to expand participation in digital trade across the Indo-Pacific, which will grow markets for Australian businesses and broaden economic development opportunities for all. 13 dIGITAL TRAdE Shape an enabling environment for digital trade Australia is committed to actively shaping global rule-making on digital trade. Australia will advocate for global rules that support digitisation of trade-related practices, build trust and confidence in the online environment, and reduce barriers to digital trade. Global trade rules should support existing global and regional norms, principles and guidelines. This includes those developed through the United Nations (UN), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the G20, APEC, and international standards-setting bodies such as the International Organisation for Standardisation. Australia engages in these multilateral forums to cooperate on practical steps that promote digital trade, sharing best practice, and addressing emerging policy issues. ENABLE GREATER ACCESS TO GLOBAL MARKETS AND A MORE CERTAIN REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT In addition to influencing trade rules through key international forums, Australia has included ‘electronic commerce’ chapters in 10 of its 11 concluded free trade agreements. Australia is currently pursuing commitments on digital trade in our bilateral negotiations with Indonesia, Hong Kong and Peru, and with countries participating in the negotiations for a Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and the Trade in Services Agreement. International rules that facilitate the free flow of information and data across borders are also important for promoting digital trade. Data flows now have generated a greater impact on global gross domestic product growth than the global trade in goods. As customs duties on electronic transmissions may restrict the growth of online trade, Australia is committed to a permanent moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions. dIGITAL TRAdE IN THE wORLd TRAdE ORGANIZATION The World Trade Organization (WTO) is the key multilateral organisation governing international trade. Through its membership, Australia pursues commitments that improve market access for businesses and increase consumer choice, including in digital trade. Australia supports crucial WTO agreements on goods, services and intellectual property, including the Agreement on Trade Facilitation (TFA). Australia also supports the adoption of agreements that encourage WTO members to take on further digital trade and trade facilitation commitments. These include the WTO Information Technology Agreement (ITA) and the Telecommunications Reference Paper. 14 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY Australia promotes trade enabling rules and the free flow of information. But we recognise the importance of allowing governments to respond to legitimate public policy concerns, including consumer and privacy protections. Australia encourages international partners to do so transparently and with appropriate consultation (see Support Transparency and Evidence-based Policy Positions, page 20). TABLE 1: This table outlines some of the key provisions Australia pursues in its trade agreements to enable digital trade. These objectives are general, may change in specific negotiations and are negotiated in the context that we are able to accommodate our policy sensitivities, including in regard to health, environment, consumer and privacy protections, and security. Provision Description Paperless trading Countries should provide for online availability of import and export documentation and electronic submission of those documents Electronic authentication Countries should not deny a signature on the basis it is in electronic form, and should adopt a flexible approach to authentication technologies Online consumer protection Countries should provide the same protections for online consumers as they do for any other consumer Online protection of personal information Countries should adopt or maintain a legal framework to protect the personal information of electronic commerce users from unauthorised disclosure Unsolicited commercial electronic messages (spam) Countries should adopt or maintain measures to allow consumers to opt out of receiving unwanted commercial messages (for example email and SMS) from various sources and to provide that businesses only send such messages with the expressed or inferred consent of the consumer with the source of the messages identified Customs duties on electronic transmissions Countries should continue the practice of not applying customs duties to electronic transmissions Domestic regulatory frameworks / domestic electronic transaction frameworks Countries should adopt or maintain legal frameworks consistent with the principles of the UN Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on Electronic Commerce (1996) and the UN Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts (2005) 15 dIGITAL TRAdE Provision Description Localisation of computing facilities Countries should not require businesses operating in their territory to locate computing facilities (including computer servers and storage devices for processing or storing information for commercial use) within the country’s borders Cross-border transfer of information by electronic means Countries should allow cross-border transfers of information by electronic means Disclosure of source code Countries should not require the transfer of or access to mass-market software source code as a condition for the import, distribution, sale or use of software Cooperation Governments should cooperate on areas of mutual interest in digital trade including on cyber security matters Elimination of customs duties on technological products Countries should eliminate customs duties on technological business and consumer products through participation in the Information Technology Agreement, or products covered by that agreement Trade facilitation commitments Countries should continue to implement commitments made in the Trade Facilitation Agreement and endeavour to build on those commitments to ensure the efficient movement of goods across borders Commitments on performance requirements Countries should not require technological transfers as a condition of investing in another country 16 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY AUSTRALIA WILL: 1.01 Advocate for further digital trade liberalisation and facilitation through free trade agreements and participation in the WTO, OECD, APEC and G20 HARMONISE STANDARDS An enabling environment for digital trade requires clear standards. Australia’s interests in the development of standards is discussed in the Cyber Security chapter. However, developing these standards in isolation will not achieve the desired outcome. Standards need to be harmonised between countries to improve the conditions for global digital trade by making it easier to do business across borders. Just like global trade rules, international standards need to be industry-led and technology-neutral. In particular, Australia supports the development of globally interoperable Internet standards and associated reference architecture, as well as ISO 27000 Information Security Management Systems standards. To reduce the need for burdensome regulation, Australia also supports increased cooperation between national standards bodies and regulatory agencies across the Indo-Pacific. Australia will further reduce barriers to trade by proactively harmonising standards and promoting international trade across the Indo-Pacific. AUSTRALIA WILL: 1.02 Support capacity building projects in the Indo‑Pacific to encourage the harmonisation of international standards for digital goods, building trust and confidence in digital trade 17 dIGITAL TRAdE TRADE FACILITATION Australia supports practices that improve the efficiency of trade conducted electronically, including through the use of digital technologies, such as paperless trading and electronic authentication (see Table 1, page 15). Australia will continue to support trade facilitation in key international forums. This includes exploring the trade-enabling and cost reduction potential of emerging technologies such as Blockchain. Australia also recognises that strong cyber security builds trust in cyberspace and facilitates digital trade. AUSTRALIA WILL: 1.03 Oppose barriers to digital trade and advocate for implementation of the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement through bilateral representations and involvement with WTO committees and councils, APEC and the G20 1.04 Design and trial an electronic Secure Trade Lane with New Zealand to provide benefits for trusted traders in both countries SUPPORT REGULATORY COOPERATION Regulators are responsible for ensuring fairness and transparency in markets and establishing an enabling environment for digital innovation. Cooperation between regulators is important for supporting digital trade. It can build trust and overcome uncertainty and other barriers to the growth of digital trade. Regulatory cooperation in the financial technology sector is already underway and has yielded early successes (see International Efforts of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, page 19). 18 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS OF THE AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES ANd INVESTMENTS COMMISSION (ASIC) Within the Financial Technology (FinTech) sector, ASIC has formal innovator business referral arrangements with its counterparts in the United Kingdom, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan and Hong Kong. ASIC also has information sharing agreements with Kenya’s Capital Markets Authority and ASIC’s Indonesian counterpart, Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK). These agreements enhance Australian capacity building programs in the region, specifically the Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Economic Governance, through direct regulator-to-regulator transfer of knowledge and experience. ASIC has also provided assistance via multilateral programs such as the Mekong Business Initiative and the APEC Financial Regulators Training Initiative, and through direct participation in the inaugural FinTech Regulation Bootcamp held in Singapore in October 2016. AUSTRALIA WILL: 1.05 Promote regulatory cooperation and coherence through Australia’s bilateral exchanges, the Australian free trade agreement agenda, Aid for Trade activities, as well as engagement in APEC and G20 19 dIGITAL TRAdE SUPPORT TRANSPARENCY AND EVIDENCE-BASED POLICY POSITIONS Australia is committed to leading by example on stakeholder consultation and transparency in policy-making. Appropriate multi-stakeholder consultations help ensure well-targeted policy responses to the challenges and opportunities of digitisation. Australia will continue to hold regular consultations with industry on digital trade and invite submissions from the private sector when developing new digital trade rules. Similarly, Australia encourages other countries to consult with businesses when developing new trade laws and policies. More work needs to be done to accurately measure digital trade. Understanding the current uptake of digital technologies by micro, small and medium enterprises, and the barriers to their digital participation, will better inform policy. Australia is committed to working towards internationally consistent and robust measurement of digital trade. AUSTRALIA WILL: 1.06 Support public‑private engagement on emerging digital trade issues in multilateral forums, including the Business 20 and the APEC Business Advisory Council 1.07 Support the G20, OECD and other international research to improve digital trade measurement and develop policy responses 1.08 Encourage transparency from bilateral partners on domestic legislation that could restrict trade, including through cyber policy dialogues 20 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY Promote trade and investment opportunities for Australian digital goods and services Australia actively promotes its digital goods and services internationally to maximise opportunities for Australian businesses in the booming global digital economy. To attract foreign investment, Australia leverages its global reputation as a trusted and secure place to do business, with robust domestic safeguards, a well-developed services economy and a quality education system. To maximise international digital trade opportunities for Australian businesses, Australia will develop a whole-of-Government digital economy strategy, led by the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science. Austrade will also create a practical guide for Australian companies exporting in the digital economy. These documents will be developed in close consultation with the private sector. PRIVATE SECTOR ENGAGEMENT ON dIGITAL TRAdE The private sector is at the centre of Australia’s digital trade efforts. To inform Australia’s digital trade promotional activities, the Australian Government will consult closely with the private sector. In addition to consulting with large multi-nationals through APEC and the G20, the Ambassador for Cyber Affairs will establish industry consultations and workshops, including an Industry Advisory Group focused on Australia’s international cyber engagement (see the Comprehensive and Coordinated Cyber Affairs chapter). AUSTRALIA WILL: 1.09 Develop a guide to exporting in the digital economy, providing practical advice for maximising international opportunities for Australian businesses 1.10 Develop a national digital economy strategy, which will position Australia to embrace the opportunities presented by digital trade 21 dIGITAL TRAdE CYBER SECURITY AUSTRALIA’S GOAL: A strong and resilient cyber security posture for Australia, the Indo-Pacific and the global community TO ACHIEVE THIS AUSTRALIA wILL: Maintain strong cyber security relationships with international partners Encourage innovative cyber security solutions and deliver world leading cyber security advice Develop regional cyber security capability Promote Australia’s cyber security industry Cyber security provides the foundation for the achievement of Australia’s entire cyber affairs agenda. Cyber security is an important theme of every part of this Strategy. This chapter addresses the specific activities that Australia undertakes internationally to achieve a strong and resilient cyber security posture for Australia, the Indo-Pacific and the global community. The objective of strong cyber security is to enable access to online information by individuals, governments and businesses, while ensuring the information and the systems that underpin it are protected from unauthorised access, removal or change. This increases the trust and confidence of users, which will underpin continued investment in innovative technologies, driving continued economic growth. Australia cannot act in isolation. Collaborative networks with international partners are critical to combatting global threats. Cyber security is strengthened by a dynamic domestic cyber security industry that is active internationally. This in turn will help grow Australia as a hub for international cyber security research and education. Australia’s trusted international relationships will foster a readiness to share information and best practice, and cooperate to solve technical problems. CYBER SECURITY Cyber security encapsulates measures relating to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of information that is processed, stored and communicated by electronic or similar means. 23 CYBER SECURITY Maintain strong relationships with international partners Engaging internationally to strengthen the collective cyber security of Australia, the Indo-Pacific and the broader global community is a key objective for Australia. The global nature of the Internet means that cyber threats emerging anywhere in the world can impact Australia. Our international engagement will seek to build Australia’s knowledge and capabilities and to enhance the cyber security posture of international partners, particularly those with extensive economic, diplomatic and social links with Australia. By improving the cyber security of our partners, we strengthen our own cyber defences. Sharing cyber security information with international partners builds strong collective understanding of threats. It also improves our combined ability to prevent, detect, analyse, respond, mitigate and recover from cyber security threats and incidents. Building trusted international cyber security threat sharing networks gives Australia and our partners the best possible chance of staying ahead of malicious actors. Through the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), Australia engages with international cyber security organisations, law enforcement agencies and industry partners. This cooperatively develops our collective cyber resilience, and assists law enforcement agencies to investigate cybercrimes. Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) and cyber security centres around the world work to protect and respond to incidents affecting systems of national interest. Partners are able to build a trusted community where indicators of compromise and threat information are shared – preferably automatically. This ensures that all members of trusted information sharing networks are well-placed to take informed actions in their respective domestic contexts. This cooperation is framed by Australia’s suite of cyber policy dialogues with a range of international partners including China, India, Indonesia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea. THE AUSTRALIAN CYBER SECURITY CENTRE’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT EFFORTS The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) brings together cyber security capabilities across the Australian Government to enable a more complete understanding of sophisticated cyber threats, facilitate faster and more effective response to significant cyber incidents, and foster better interaction between government and industry partners. The ACSC engages with international partner organisations to share cyber threat information, to cooperate on operational responses to major cyber incidents and to work collaboratively on best practice mitigations. 24 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY Australia has established cyber security information sharing arrangements with a variety of strategic international partners across the public sector, private sector and research communities. These include bilateral agreements and memoranda of understanding, engagement between intelligence agencies, national cyber security centres, industry bodies, cyber security researchers, and participation in regional and international forums. Australia will continue to strengthen and expand our network of strategic information sharing partners, both providing and receiving information to enhance the cyber security posture of Australia and the cyber security of our international partners. The establishment of Joint Cyber Security Centres and the relocation of the ACSC to a new purpose-built facility will facilitate improved collaboration and more integrated partnerships. The ACSC through CERT Australia, Australia’s national CERT, works closely with industry partners to protect domestic critical infrastructure and other systems of national interest. To facilitate this, CERT Australia has a number of key operational level relationships with bilateral partners and multilateral forums. Australia’s international CERT relationships enable the trusted sharing of threat information and the joint development of tools and techniques to prevent, detect, analyse, respond, mitigate and recover from cyber incidents. This global CERT network supports the ACSC’s capability to respond to cyber incidents and assists domestic industry partners to take proactive cyber security measures. CERT Australia is committed to strengthening and expanding its network of CERT relationships in the Indo-Pacific and more broadly to secure Australia’s critical infrastructure and other systems of national interest. Australia is committed to participating in coordinated global efforts to strengthen global CERT capacity – both sharing our expertise and learning from others. While the structure, mandates and constituencies of national CERTs may differ, they also have many commonalities. They are operationally focused and staffed by cyber security professionals with the technical expertise to respond to cyber incidents. A key role for a national CERT is to be a main operational point of contact during an international cyber incident, assisting in the conduct of coordinated incident response. International collaboration at this technical operationally focused level ensures the ACSC can perform incident response activities in Australia quickly and effectively. 25 CYBER SECURITY ASIA PACIFIC COMPUTER EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM The Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT) is a grouping of leading and national CERTs and Computer Security Incident Response Teams dedicated to the protection of national infrastructure in the Asia Pacific. It is just one example of economies collaborating to build collective incident response capability in order to prevent, detect, analyse, respond, mitigate and recover from cyber incidents. APCERT has an operational focus with objectives to help create a safe and reliable cyberspace in the Asia Pacific through global collaboration. CERT Australia currently chairs the APCERT Steering Committee and, with the other APCERT members, participates in an annual APCERT drill and other capacity building activities. AUSTRALIA WILL: 2.01 Strengthen and expand Australia’s strategic international cyber security information sharing partners and trusted networks 2.02 Strengthen and expand Australia’s network of CERT relationships, especially in the Indo‑Pacific 2.03 Be a prominent contributor to the APCERT community 26 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY Encourage innovative cyber security solutions and deliver world leading cyber security advice ENCOURAGE INNOVATIVE CYBER SECURITY SOLUTIONS Increasing connectivity, and the proliferation of devices connected to the Internet (the Internet of Things), highlights the importance of security as a fundamental driver in the design and delivery of information communication and technology (ICT) products, systems and services. Australians use digital products and services from all over the world. There is still much work to be done internationally to promote the development of ICT products, systems and services that are secure by design. Cyber security experts in the ACSC engage with the leading innovators and technical experts in the ICT vendor community to share expertise. ACSC experts also promote cyber security as a fundamental element in the design of new products, systems and services. These partnerships inform cyber security technical advice produced by the ACSC, as well as improving the cyber security functionality within new products, systems and services. Australia will continue the evaluation of the security of ICT products through the Australasian Information Security Evaluation Program’s involvement in the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement (ISO/IEC 15408 Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation). We will also support the efforts of standards bodies, including work by Standards Australia (see below) on the ISO/IEC 27000 series of information security standards. STANdARdS AUSTRALIA The development and application of international standards play a key role in improving the quality and cyber security of digital products, systems and services across the globe, and assist in protecting governments, business and consumers alike. Standards Australia, as a member of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), contributes to developing international standards. These standards are designed to enhance the security of information technology systems, networks and critical online infrastructures. This work is carried out through ISO’s Technical Committees (TCs) and Joint Technical Committees (JTCs). Australia’s contribution in this area includes leading development of international standards for ISO/TC 307 Blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies. We also work with other ISO/IEC JTC One members on cloud computing and distributed platforms and information technology security techniques. 27 CYBER SECURITY DELIVER WORLD LEADING CYBER SECURITY ADVICE Australia produces world leading cyber security advice and best practice, which, if implemented, enhances the cyber security of individuals, businesses and governments. This includes the Information Security Manual, Strategies to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents and its Essential Eight, as well as the Stay Smart Online guidelines for small businesses and individuals. THE AUSTRALIAN SIGNALS dIRECTORATE’S ESSENTIAL EIGHT ASD has developed the Essential Eight strategies to mitigate cyber security incidents. This framework provides helpful practices that organisations can implement in their everyday operations to improve their cyber security. Through its international cyber security engagement and partnerships with the private sector, Australia will promote the adoption of best practice cyber security advice to raise the bar for international cyber security, enhancing the cyber resilience of our international partners. As a first step, Australia will translate and publish ASD’s Essential Eight mitigation strategies and its companion documents into the official languages of the 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). AUSTRALIA WILL: 2.04 Promote cyber security as a fundamental input to the design and delivery of information and communication technologies products, systems and services 2.05 Support the development of international standards that improve cyber security and encourage harmonisation of standards for digital products 2.06 Publish translations of ASD’s Essential Eight strategies and companion implementation documents in the official languages of ASEAN members 28 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY Develop regional cyber security capability Australia is committed to assisting partners in the Indo-Pacific develop their capacity to address cyber threats, strengthen cyber security and combat cybercrime through the Cyber Cooperation Program (see the Comprehensive & Coordinated Cyber Affairs chapter). Increasing connectivity in the Indo-Pacific is a force for significant social and economic development and inclusion. However, increased connectivity also has the potential to expose the region to increased threats from malicious cyber actors. Recognising the importance of cyber resilience, and with the understanding that not every country in our region has the capacity to establish a cyber security capability such as a national CERT, Australia will work with our Pacific neighbours to establish a Pacific Cyber Security Operational Network (PaCSON). The PaCSON network will consist of technical experts from respective governments across the Pacific, and will be supported by other partners including not-for-profit organisations and academia. PaCSON will establish operational cyber security points of contact. It will empower members to share cyber security threat information; provide opportunities for technical experts to share tools, techniques and ideas; and be an enabler of cooperation and collaboration, particularly if a cyber security incident affects the region. Further, it is envisaged that PaCSON will provide members with a toolkit for cyber security incident response and assist with cyber security awareness raising activities across the Pacific. AUSTRALIA WILL: 2.07 Work with regional partners in the Pacific to establish PaCSON 29 CYBER SECURITY Promote Australia’s cyber security industry EXPORT AUSTRALIAN CYBER SECURITY SOLUTIONS Australia is committed to growing a vibrant cyber security sector in response to the increasing domestic and regional demand for cyber security solutions. Australia has designated the cyber security sector as a key sector for export promotion. We are committed to increasing the number of Australian cyber security companies operating successfully in global markets. Australia is collaborating with private sector partners, including the Australian Cyber Security Growth Network (AustCyber), to develop a deeper understanding of Australian cyber security capabilities and market demands. AustCyber, an industry-led not-for-profit company, is part of the Australian Government’s $250 million Industry Growth Centres Initiative and the 2016 Cyber Security Strategy. It plays a key role in supporting the development of national cyber security capability by helping Australia’s cyber security sector overcome challenges to innovation, productivity and growth. There are particular sectors where Australia already has comparative advantages in cyber security capability, which are described in Australia’s Cyber Security Sector Competitiveness Plan. To promote these sectors, Australia will proactively identify opportunities in key overseas markets, lead trade delegations to these key markets, and encourage the use of Landing Pads (see below). Australia supports the responsible export of cyber security solutions. To help promote responsible export worldwide, Australia actively supports international export control regimes such as the Wassenaar Arrangement. To help foster cyber innovation and good cyber security practice, Australia has led the discussion with Wassenaar Participating States to ease export restrictions on cyber security technology for defensive purposes. LANdING PAdS As part of the National Innovation and Science Agenda, Austrade has established five Landing Pads in Berlin, San Francisco, Shanghai, Singapore and Tel Aviv. Landing Pads provide market-ready Australian start-ups/scale-ups with access to some of the world’s most renowned innovation and start-up ecosystems. Participating start-ups/scale-ups have a short-term operational base for up to 90 days, where they will benefit from Austrade’s global network of contacts and tailored business development assistance. The Landing Pads are situated in leading co-working spaces in each location. Austrade is conducting a pilot program focused on cyber security start-ups and scale-ups in the San Francisco Landing Pad from January to April 2018. This activity is designed to build on the success of the Australian cyber security mission to San Francisco Bay Area in February 2017. 30 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY ATTRACT FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT TO AUSTRALIA’S CYBER SECURITY SECTOR Producing world-class cyber security research is one of Australia’s national science and research priorities, as set out in the National Innovation and Science Agenda. We will continue to promote Australia as a location of choice for global cyber security companies looking to establish a base in the Indo-Pacific, and as a leading centre for cyber education and research. Australia has identified cyber security and related digital technologies as a target sector for attracting investment. As part of its strategy to promote, attract and facilitate productive foreign direct investment, the Australian Government will continue to work collaboratively with state and territory governments to provide qualified potential investors with information on the Australian business and regulatory environment, market intelligence and investment opportunities, and advice on government programs and approval processes. Australia will work through AustCyber to showcase our cyber security industry capabilities through an Australian Cyber Week. Annual workshops will follow thereafter to agree priority areas of focus in line with annual updates to Australia’s Cyber Security Sector Competitiveness Plan. AUSTRALIA WILL: 2.08 Showcase Australia’s cyber security capabilities to international customers and investors, including through delivery of an annual Australian Cyber Week 2.09 Promote and encourage cyber security start‑ups through Landing Pads 2.10 Partner with the private sector to host a workshop to co‑design how Australia promotes its cyber security industry internationally 31 CYBER SECURITY CYBERCRIME AUSTRALIA’S GOAL: Stronger cybercrime prevention, prosecution and cooperation, with a particular focus on the Indo-Pacific TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, AUSTRALIA wILL: Raise cybercrime awareness in the Indo-Pacific Assist Indo-Pacific countries to strengthen their cybercrime legislation Deliver cybercrime law enforcement and prosecution capacity building in the Indo-Pacific Enhance diplomatic dialogue and international information sharing on cybercrime Australia’s economic prosperity and high adoption of technology mean we will remain an attractive target for cybercriminals in coming years. Cybercriminals are constantly adapting and evolving their techniques to exploit new technologies and defeat network defences. This tests the capacity of law enforcement agencies to adapt and respond. Australia will remain vigilant to the changing cybercrime threat environment in order to safeguard our economic interests. As the volume and sophistication of cybercrime continues to grow, so too do its costs. It has been estimated that up to US$1.02 trillion in global economic growth will not be realised if we allow cybercrime to undermine public confidence in the digital domain. Addressing cybercrime in our region will create a safer commercial environment in which businesses can grow. CYBERCRIME Cybercrime is a low-risk, high-return criminal enterprise in which individuals and groups of actors leverage cyberspace for financial gain or other malicious ends. In Australia, the term cybercrime refers to crimes directed at computers, such as illegally modifying electronic data or seeking a ransom to unlock a computer affected by malicious software. It also includes crimes where computers facilitate an existing offence, such as online fraud or online child sex offences. 33 CYBERCRIME The vast majority of cybercrime targeting Australia originates overseas. Cybercrime is a global threat, but our region is particularly vulnerable. Countries in the region lose a third more business revenue to cybercrime than those in the European Union or North America. Collectively, our region is only as resilient as our weakest link. Cybercriminals look to exploit the vulnerabilities of states in the early stages of developing the legislative and technical capabilities needed to fight cybercrime. These cybercrime safe havens are countries through or from which malicious cyber actors can conduct criminal operations with a very low risk of being identified, arrested, investigated, extradited or prosecuted. In 2016, more than half of the world’s netizens were found in the Indo-Pacific. But only 1.8 billion of the region’s 4.1 billion people are yet online. This digital potential combined with the spread of ICT infrastructure and smart phone technology will produce a growing target audience for cybercriminals to exploit. It is in Australia’s interest to help our neighbours improve their ability to prevent and respond to cybercrime. Doing so will underpin regional economic growth and create a safer environment in which Australian businesses can prosper. Cybercriminals operate globally, so Australia will respond in kind. We will deepen bilateral, regional and global partnerships to increase cooperation and build our collective capacity to combat this threat. Cybercrime is a shared challenge and Australia encourages other countries to take an active role in initiatives that address this international issue. Collaborative efforts to shut down safe havens complement Australia’s ongoing national efforts to protect Australians from the harm of cybercriminals. The 2016 Cyber Security Strategy committed the Government to enhance Australia’s ability to respond to cyber security threats, including cybercrime. In 2017, the Government directed the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) to use its offensive cyber capabilities to disrupt, degrade, deny and deter organised offshore cybercriminals. This capability is subject to stringent oversight, and consistent with domestic law and our obligations under international law. Strong cyber defences and law enforcement measures will continue to sit at the forefront of our response to cybercrime threats. Australia embraces a comprehensive strategy of strong cyber defences, regional capacity building and national law enforcement efforts in its fight against cybercrime. 34 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY Raise cybercrime awareness in the Indo-Pacific Individuals are at risk of falling victim to cybercrime if they don’t understand online risks and the techniques used by cybercriminals. For this reason, public education, awareness and the development of basic cyber skills is a fundamental building block in the prevention of cybercrime, and an essential first step in undermining the success of cybercriminals in our region. Increasing connectivity in the Indo-Pacific means that our region is home to a vast number of first-time Internet users. As these new users come online, it is important that they are equipped with the awareness needed to enjoy the benefits of the Internet safely. Cyber security education is necessary to inform people of good cyber security practices, such as avoiding the use of pirated software that cybercriminals can exploit to gain access to personal devices. Australia is committed to improving cybercrime awareness levels in our region. Cyber Safety Pasifika (CSP) is a cyber safety and cybercrime education program led by the Australian Federal Police (AFP). CSP delivers cyber awareness to Pacific Island countries, including Tonga, Nauru, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. CSP provides cybercrime awareness materials and ‘train-the-trainer’ initiatives to ensure Pacific communities are equipped to identify cybercrime risks and engage safely online. Thanks to a 2017 program update, there are now 13 police officers from nine Pacific countries ready to train their colleagues and deliver up to date cybercrime education curriculums to schools and community groups across the region. PRIVATE SECTOR ENGAGEMENT ON CYBERCRIME AwARENESS RAISING The private sector has an important role to play in raising cybercrime awareness. Australian companies doing business around the region are well placed to contribute their good reputation, invaluable networks of contacts and contextual understanding to the effort. Australia will create public-private partnerships focused on improving regional awareness of cybercrime risks. This will not only be an important force multiplier but will also reinforce the message that cybercrime is a joint challenge that government and business must address together. AUSTRALIA WILL: 3.01 Deliver cybercrime awareness training across the Indo‑Pacific through public‑private partnerships and the refreshed Cyber Safety Pasifika program 35 CYBERCRIME Assist Indo-Pacific countries to strengthen their cybercrime legislation Raising public awareness will not prevent all cybercrime. Another effective way to respond to cybercrime is through a combination of stronger domestic legislative frameworks within countries and greater harmonisation of cybercrime legislation between countries. Australia is committed to working with partners in the region to help strengthen their legal frameworks to address cybercrime. Robust cybercrime legal frameworks increase the risk of prosecution for would-be cybercriminals. Strengthening cybercrime legislation raises the cost of ‘business’ for cybercriminals and is an important way of preventing cybercrime safe havens in our region. Similarly, Australia advocates for the harmonisation of legal frameworks – that is, having similar conduct criminalised in all jurisdictions – to facilitate international cooperation on cybercrime. This ensures that criminals cannot evade justice by simply crossing borders. THE BUDAPEST CONVENTION Australia has been a party to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (the Budapest Convention) since 2013. It is a valuable mechanism to strengthen international cooperation on cybercrime, particularly through its provisions on mutual legal assistance. Countries are able to work together more effectively on trans-border investigations and prosecutions when domestic legal and law enforcement operational frameworks are harmonised in line with the provisions of the Budapest Convention. Reciprocal arrangements such as mutual legal assistance and intelligence sharing continue to be a critical mechanism for combatting cybercrime. Australia is keen to work with other countries to streamline these processes. Australia works with countries in the region interested in acceding to the Budapest Convention by helping them achieve the required legislative reform. For example, substantial support from the Attorney-General’s Department contributed to Tonga’s recent accession to the Convention (see Supporting Stronger Cyber Crime Legislation in Tonga, page 37). Australia will actively participate in the development of an Additional Protocol to the Budapest Convention on trans-border access to information. The Protocol will further articulate cooperation requirements between jurisdictions on providing access to electronic information, within appropriate conditions and safeguards. This will facilitate more effective mutual legal assistance through direct cooperation with service providers and between judicial authorities, joint investigation frameworks, and development of emergency assistance procedures. Australia is a member of the Drafting Group for the establishment of the Additional Protocol. 36 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY SUPPORTING STRONGER CYBERCRIME LEGISLATION IN TONGA Australia worked closely with Tonga to strengthen its legislative capacity to respond to cybercrime threats and meet the obligations of the Budapest Convention by: • facilitating a gap analysis of Tonga’s legislation against the requirements of the Budapest Convention with an official from Tonga’s Attorney General’s Office (AGO) in 2014 through the Pacific Legal Policy Development Twinning Program; • working with Tonga’s AGO to draft a Computer Crimes Bill that ensured Tonga’s legislation met its obligations under the Budapest Convention; and • assisting Tonga’s AGO with its consultations on the new Computer Crimes Bill prior to its introduction to Parliament during 2017. Assisted by this collaboration, on 9 May 2017 Tonga became the first Pacific Island country to accede to the Budapest Convention. Tonga’s experience and new legislative framework will provide a valuable model for other countries in the region. PACIFIC ISLANDS LAW OFFICERS’ NETWORK Australia is also helping regional neighbours strengthen their cybercrime legislation by working with the Pacific Islands Law Officers’ Network (PILON). PILON is a network of senior law officers from across the region that addresses law and justice issues common to Pacific countries. PILON’s Strategic Plan 2016–2018 recognises cybercrime as a priority legal issue. Through the network, Australia advocates for the broad adoption of the Pacific Forensic Model Provisions, which provide a consistent framework for the collection and use of electronic evidence. Australia will support future PILON activities in this area, building on its funding of the Pacific Cybercrime Workshop held in Tonga during May 2017 in partnership with PILON, the Tongan Government, and the Council of Europe. This initiative is complemented by the 2017 expansion of Cyber Safety Pasifika (CSP). The program now includes legislation and policy development activities, with Australia working in partnership with PILON and the Pacific Islands Chiefs of Police. Australia will also support the Council of Europe’s Global Action on Cybercrime Extended capacity building project (GLACY+) and Cybercrime@Octopus project that supports the adoption and implementation of the Budapest Convention in the Indo-Pacific. 37 CYBERCRIME AUSTRALIA WILL: 3.02 Promote the Budapest Convention as a best practice model for legislative responses to cybercrime and support accession to the Convention across the Indo‑Pacific 3.03 Be active in the negotiation of an Additional Protocol to the Budapest Convention on trans‑border access to information 3.04 Work with PILON to help strengthen cybercrime legislation in the region 38 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY Deliver cybercrime law enforcement and prosecution capacity building in the Indo-Pacific Cybercrime legislation is not effective without the ability to enforce it. Australia is safer when countries in our region have the capacity to respond to cybercrime. Australia is committed to increasing the capacity of Indo-Pacific law enforcement agencies, prosecutors and judges. The capacity of countries to investigate and prosecute cybercrime varies greatly in the Indo-Pacific. While some are leading in high-tech policing, others have only a nascent capability. Australia is working to close that gap. Through its recently expanded Cyber Safety Pasifika (CSP) program, the AFP is actively partnering with law enforcement agencies in the region to enhance their capacity to address cybercrime. In partnership with the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Legal Attaché Office in Canberra, the AFP coordinated a pilot three-day Cyber Investigations Skills Course for multiple Pacific Island countries in March 2017. The pilot, held in Brisbane, equipped 20 participating officers with basic cyber investigation skills including open source intelligence techniques. Through CSP, the AFP will continue to enhance the skills of Pacific police officers to manage cybercrime investigations. The AFP also delivers cyber capacity building in the region through its support for the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation (see below). JAKARTA CENTRE FOR LAw ENFORCEMENT COOPERATION (JCLEC) The JCLEC is a not-for-profit social enterprise in Semarang, Indonesia, jointly owned by the Indonesian National Police (INP) and the Australian Federal Police (AFP). The centre is supported by a broad range of public sector, civil society and private sector entities from across the world. The JCLEC supports global collaborative efforts to minimise the community harm caused by transnational crime and terrorism. Since 2004, the JCLEC has facilitated 56 cybercrime capacity building activities for over 1,000 international participants. This has included courses on computer forensics, cybercrime and social media investigations, intelligence gathering and covert online engagement. Workshops delivered by the AFP at the centre have elevated INP’s capacity to identify, extract and report on electronic evidence. This new digital forensic investigation capability means that direct operational exchanges can take place between INP and AFP leads. 39 CYBERCRIME In addition to skilled law enforcement, a country’s prosecution and judiciary need to be equipped to address cybercrime cases effectively. Working together with multilateral partners such as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the Council of Europe, Australia will support the delivery of cybercrime training courses for prosecutors and judges in Indo-Pacific countries (see Cybercrime Capacity Building with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)). In so doing, Australia will deliver a comprehensive cybercrime capacity building program to the region, tackling cybercrime from awareness, legislation, law enforcement, and prosecution perspectives. CYBERCRIME CAPACITY BUILdING wITH THE UNITEd NATIONS OFFICE ON dRUGS ANd CRIME (UNOdC) Australia provided funding for UNODC cybercrime capacity building in Southeast Asia. The five-day training course was delivered in Bangkok during October 2016 to around 30 judges, prosecutors and investigators. The course was aimed towards ASEAN member countries, including Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. The training focused on cybercrime investigation and prosecution (including ‘darknet’ and hidden web services), hacking, device imaging, handling/using electronic evidence and online child sexual exploitation case investigation. AUSTRALIA WILL: 3.05 Provide cybercrime training to law enforcement officers, prosecutors and judges across the Indo‑Pacific 40 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY Enhance diplomatic dialogue and international information sharing on cybercrime Australia is committed to collaborating with international partners to fight cybercrime collectively. Working together at the diplomatic and operational levels is critical to ensuring that cybercriminals have limited opportunities to exploit cyberspace for malicious purposes. DIPLOMATIC DIALOGUE High-level diplomatic engagement between Australia and its international partners on cybercrime helps generate common understanding and facilitate closer cooperation between counterparts. Cybercrime discussions are prioritised in Australia’s diplomatic engagements. Cybercrime was made a permanent agenda item for the Australia-Indonesia Ministerial Council on Law and Security in February 2017, and was a prominent agenda item at the first Australia-China High Level Security Dialogue in April 2017. Australia also engages actively on the issue in multilateral contexts such as the Pacific Islands Forum, ASEAN Regional Forum and East Asia Summit. Australia and China ‘will work together to counter malicious cyber actors, Internet distribution of child sex abuse material, e-mail scams and other transnational cybercrime activities, as well as to identify through consultation key incidents and carry out joint law enforcements’. Joint Statement Australia-China High-Level Security Dialogue, Sydney 2017 PRIVATE SECTOR ENGAGEMENT IN INTERNATIONAL dIALOGUE ON CYBERCRIME The international and multi-stakeholder nature of cyberspace necessitates broad engagement with global and private sector partners in the fight against cybercrime. The Ambassador for Cyber Affairs will lead delegations to participate in international public-private sector conversations, for example the 2017 INTERPOL World Conference in Singapore. These opportunities promote Australia’s cyber security industry and its positive contribution to the global fight against cybercrime. 41 CYBERCRIME INFORMATION SHARING AND OPERATIONAL COLLABORATION Australia complements its high-level diplomatic efforts with cybercrime threat information sharing and cooperation between international counterparts. This enables Australia and our partners to build a stronger threat picture of cybercriminal identities and methodologies, as well as share best practice mitigation. Australia deploys individuals to partner countries around the globe to deepen information sharing links. The Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC) has established two key working-level cyber partnerships. An ACIC Cybercrime Analyst is posted at the FBI International Cyber Crime Coordination Cell in the United States. Another is posted at the National Cybercrime Unit at the United Kingdom’s National Crime Authority. These deployments enhance ACIC’s ability to attribute real world identities to cybercriminals and develop strategic and operational intelligence products on cybercrime threats. Similarly, the AFP has established dedicated cybercrime liaison positions based in the United States and United Kingdom. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) recently established a Cyber Operations team. This team focuses on the financial aspects of transnational cyber-enabled crime, tracking criminal financial transactions that occur online. The team harnesses established relationships with AUSTRAC partner agencies, FinTech partners and international networks, and develops new relationships with industry. AUSTRAC will continue to collaborate with partner Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) and participate in international forums, including the Egmont Group of FIUs, to build its capacity to produce financial intelligence on virtual currencies and cybercrime. Australia engages strongly with multilateral law enforcement information sharing networks such as INTERPOL and EUROPOL. The INTERPOL National Central Bureau Canberra, hosted by the AFP, is a conduit for the sharing of cybercrime information and intelligence with law enforcement agencies in the 190 INTERPOL member countries. The INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation in Singapore also hosts an AFP Cybercrime Investigator in a leadership role. EUROPOL, an intelligence focused support platform for law enforcement, hosts the European Cyber Crime Centre in The Hague in the Netherlands. Australia seconds an AFP Investigator to the centre, which targets technology-enabled serious crime and cyber disruption. The AFP also has a dedicated Cybercrime Liaison Officer based within the EUROPOL Joint Cybercrime Action Task Force. These secondees provide expert support to international efforts, as well as sourcing cybercrime threat information for Australian agencies on a regular basis. Australia also participates in practical cybercrime cooperation mechanisms such as the International Cyber Crime Operations Summit (ICCOS). This initiative aims to degrade high-level cybercrime capabilities through information sharing and operational collaboration. The ICCOS membership 42 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY includes Australia, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, Germany, Netherlands, France and EUROPOL. The collaborative group was responsible for the takedown of the Avalanche cybercriminal infrastructure in December 2016, judged to be the largest and most successful international operation of its kind to date. The Five Eyes Law Enforcement Group Cyber Crime Working Group, held in conjunction with the ICCOS, is another framework through which Australia cooperates on cybercrime. Through the group, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and Australia share operating pictures and best practice approaches, maximise resources and act as an operational force multiplier in the fight against cybercrime. AUSTRALIA WILL: 3.06 Seek further opportunities to participate in strategic‑level engagement on combatting transnational cybercrime 3.07 Share cybercrime threat information and enhance operational collaboration with international partners to fight transnational cybercrime 43 CYBERCRIME INTERNATIONAL SECURITY & CYBERSPACE AUSTRALIA’S GOAL: A stable and peaceful online environment TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL AUSTRALIA wILL: Set clear expectations for state behaviour in cyberspace Implement practical confidence building measures to prevent conflict Deter and respond to unacceptable behaviour in cyberspace The history of international security and warfare reflects the history of technological innovation. Today, cyberspace is an increasingly important area for cooperation and competition between states. As the strategic significance of cyberspace increases, more groups will try to exert power through it. Likewise, as dependence on global ICT networks increases, the potential costs of disruption are large, and growing. Malicious activity in cyberspace has the potential to threaten international peace, security and stability. A large scale cyber attack on critical infrastructure would have severe implications for international security. However, international peace, security and stability could be equally threatened by the cumulative effect of repeated low-level malicious online behaviour. It is the scale and effect of the activity, not necessarily the actor, means or method that determine its malicious nature. Australia is committed to a peaceful and stable cyberspace. We recognise that, as more and more states seek to exert power through cyberspace, there is increased potential for activities in this domain to lead to misperception, miscalculation, escalation and, in the most extreme cases, conflict between states. Australia will be stronger when we manage these risks in cooperation with international partners. Australia seeks a more mature and transparent conversation about what states are doing in cyberspace. In the face of clear evidence to the contrary, it is no longer plausible to simply deny that states are active in cyberspace. Recognition that states have legitimate rights to develop and use cyber capabilities must go hand in hand with recognition that states are obliged to ensure their use of cyber capabilities accords with international law and norms of acceptable behaviour. Acknowledgement that states are developing cyber capabilities does not contradict Australia’s commitment to maintaining a peaceful and stable online environment. Rather, acknowledging the existence of these capabilities fosters the understanding that, just like in the physical domains, states’ activities in cyberspace do not occur in a vacuum. States have rights, but they also have obligations. Good progress has been made in delineating the boundaries of what is and isn’t acceptable behaviour by states in cyberspace. But some states are testing, and even crossing, those boundaries. It is important that there are consequences for those who act contrary to this consensus. 45 INTERNATIONAL SECURITY & CYBERSPACE The 2016 Presidential Election in the United States focused the world’s attention on the potential for cyber-enabled information operations to interfere with processes underpinning democracy. Such actions have particular implications for connected, open and democratic societies like Australia. This behaviour is unacceptable. We will guard against attempts to use such measures to interfere in Australia’s domestic affairs or undermine our institutions. More broadly, Australia will cooperate with international partners to deter and respond to malicious cyber activity that endangers international peace, security and stability. In parallel to Australia’s engagement in international security and cyberspace, the Government is enhancing cooperation with international partners to detect and limit terrorist and other misuse of the Internet as a tool to recruit and radicalise. International efforts in this regard are led by Australia’s Ambassador for Counter-Terrorism in close cooperation with the Attorney-General’s Department’s Countering Violent Extremism Centre. 46 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY Set clear expectations for state behaviour in cyberspace International law has developed over centuries. It comprises rules and principles that, inter alia, govern relations between states. While the domain may be comparatively new, the rules are not. International law applies in cyberspace. The unique attributes of cyberspace mean that existing international law can be usefully complemented by agreed norms of behaviour. Alongside states’ international legal obligations, these non-binding norms establish clear expectations of proper state behaviour in cyberspace. INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLIES TO CYBERSPACE As observed above, international law applies to states’ conduct in cyberspace just as it applies to states’ conduct in the physical domains. The existing international legal framework helps reduce the risk of conflict by articulating clear obligations for how states interact. In some instances, it is useful to clarify how particular rules, principles and bodies of international law apply to states’ conduct in cyberspace. Much of the hard work is already done, but this continues to be a work in progress – particularly as digital technologies continue to evolve at a rapid pace. CYBER ATTACK The Australian Government defines cyber attack as a deliberate act through cyberspace to manipulate, disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy computers or networks, or the information resident on them, with the effect of seriously compromising national security, stability or economic prosperity. This definition was developed in 2011 after extensive policy and legal consultation. It was subsequently used to affirm that the provisions of the ANZUS Treaty allow Australia and the United States to consult each other in the event of a cyber attack on either party. 47 INTERNATIONAL SECURITY & CYBERSPACE Australia reaffirms that the United Nations (UN) Charter applies in its entirety to state actions in cyberspace, including the prohibition on the use of force (Article 2(4)), the peaceful settlement of disputes (Article 33), and the inherent right of states to act in individual or collective self-defence in response to an armed attack (Article 51). The international law on state responsibility applies to cyber operations, including the availability of the doctrine of countermeasures in response to internationally wrongful acts. The cumulative reports of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Communication Technologies in the Context of International Security (UN Group of Governmental Experts) have contributed to our collective understanding of how international law applies to states’ conduct in cyberspace. The Tallinn Manuals are also an important academic contribution to international legal dialogue in this area. Australia encourages states to continue to exchange views on how particular rules and principles of international law apply to state conduct in cyberspace. This will facilitate the development of deeper understandings and expectations – not just among states, but also within the private sector, civil society and academia. AUSTRALIA WILL: 4.01 Periodically publish Australia’s position on the application of relevant international law to state conduct in cyberspace (the first such publication is at Annex A) INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ANd THE PRIVATE SECTOR The stability of cyberspace benefits the private sector and governments, and our interests in maintaining a peaceful online environment are complementary. A significant proportion of the world’s Internet infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector. This means the private sector is well placed to contribute to discussions on the practicality of norms, and champion their implementation. 48 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY SUPPORT ROBUST NORMS OF RESPONSIBLE STATE BEHAVIOUR IN CYBERSPACE Norms establish clear expectations of behaviour in specific circumstances by specific groups. By signalling acceptable behaviour of states in cyberspace, norms promote predictability, stability and security. Norms must be developed consistent with international law. Shared understandings of responsible behaviour also provide the basis for the international community to respond when these shared expectations are not met. Understanding of and adherence to norms by states increases the predictability of state actions, thereby reducing the risk of misunderstandings that could lead to conflict. The 2015 Report of the UN Group of Governmental Experts set out 11 such norms (see Annex B). Also in 2015, G20 leaders agreed that ‘no country should conduct or support ICT-enabled theft of intellectual property, including state secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or the commercial sector.’ Australia affirms its commitment to act in accordance with these norms. Australia and China ‘agreed to support the work of the UN Group of Governmental Experts and to act in accordance with its reports…Australia and China agreed not to conduct or support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, trade secrets or confidential business information with the intent of obtaining competitive advantage.’ Joint Statement Australia-China High-Level Security Dialogue, Sydney, 2017 Australia engages in multi-agency cyber policy and cyber security dialogues with countries including Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom and the United States. These dialogues are an opportunity to deepen understanding of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace and foster cooperation to deter and respond to malicious cyber activities. 49 INTERNATIONAL SECURITY & CYBERSPACE AUSTRALIA WILL: 4.02 Facilitate advanced policy development and promote informed public discussion on acceptable state behaviour in cyberspace through engagement with academics and experts in this field 4.03 Seek high‑level reaffirmations from states that they will act in accordance with international law and identified norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace 4.04 Partner with countries in the Indo‑Pacific to advance our combined understanding of how international law and norms of responsible state behaviour apply in cyberspace through bilateral engagement and regional and multilateral forums 50 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY Implement practical confidence building measures to prevent conflict Australia is committed to taking practical action to support international peace and security. Confidence building measures foster trust between states to prevent misunderstandings that could lead to conflict. They include transparency measures, risk reduction measures and cooperative measures. Confidence building measures are one of the most important tools in our diplomatic toolkit. Australia is committed to implementing these measures to maintain a peaceful and stable online environment. Australia will look for opportunities for practical cooperation on cyber issues with ASEAN partners. Working together to harness the opportunities and address the shared challenges of cyberspace will be a key theme of the Australia-ASEAN Special Summit in March 2018. RISK REDUCTION MEASURES Risk reduction measures build confidence in states’ capacity to collaborate to respond to specific instances of malicious cyber activity without escalation to conflict. An example of a risk reduction measure could be the development of a database of regional policy and diplomatic points of contact for use in the event of a cyber incident. Knowing who to call in times of tension reduces the risk of miscommunication and, in turn, this reduces the risk of escalation to conflict. The very act of compiling the directory of contacts can be a confidence building measure in and of itself. A lot of good work has already been done in this field. A number of different bodies have identified practical confidence building measures that increase stability and reduce risk, including the UN Group of Governmental Experts, the ASEAN Regional Forum, the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe and the Organization of American States. The task now is to move from identifying risk reduction measures to operationalising them. In doing so, Australia will prioritise measures which have the greatest impact on reducing risk to international peace and security. Our focus will be on putting in place measures that enable states to cooperate in situations of tension or crisis. 51 INTERNATIONAL SECURITY & CYBERSPACE AUSTRALIA WILL: 4.05 Develop a framework to exchange policy and diplomatic contacts, including bilaterally, to facilitate communication in times of crisis or tension arising from significant cyber incidents that have the potential to threaten international peace, security and stability 4.06 Work with regional organisations to conduct risk reduction workshops to enhance our capacity to manage and respond to cyber incidents that threaten international peace, security and stability, including exercising national and regional responses to severe cyber incidents TRANSPARENCY MEASURES Transparency measures provide insight into states’ activities. They reduce the risk of miscommunication as well as the likelihood of overreaction. Australia’s 2016 Cyber Security Strategy, the 2016 Defence White Paper, the forthcoming Foreign Policy White Paper and this Strategy are all examples of transparency measures. Other examples include cyber policy dialogues, sharing Australia’s national cyber governance structures (including cyber incident management arrangements), and outlining Australia’s position on how international law applies to state conduct in cyberspace. Another area where Australia encourages greater candidness is in relation to the military use of offensive cyber capabilities. Just as more and more states are embracing the opportunities of cyberspace to improve service delivery and drive economic growth, it is unsurprising that more and more states are exploring military applications of cyberspace. In and of itself this is not a concern – provided that states acknowledge that military activities in cyberspace are governed by the same sets of rules as military activities in the physical domains. These rules, developed over centuries, restrict and regulate unacceptable conduct. Australia recognises that, just like other military capabilities, some details of cyber capabilities and operations will need to remain classified. By way of analogy, Australia is transparent about the rules that govern the use of conventional capabilities such as missiles on our warships; however, we do not discuss the specifics of the capability, nor would we reveal details of particular operations. We will take the same approach to discussing cyber capabilities. Acknowledgement of these capabilities does not contradict our commitment to a stable and peaceful online environment. Instead it fosters the understanding that states’ activities in cyberspace have limitations and obligations, just as they do in the physical domains (see Conduct and Authorisation of Offensive Cyber Capability in Support of Military Operations, page 55).52 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY COOPERATIVE MEASURES Cooperative measures promote collaboration between states based on a mutual commitment to improve cyber resilience and reinforce a peaceful and stable online environment. Cooperative measures could include exchanging information on best practices in responding to cyber incidents or capacity building programs like Australia’s new Cyber Cooperation Program (see the Comprehensive & Coordinated Cyber Affairs chapter). Australia’s Cyber Cooperation Program facilitates the development of comprehensive, forward-leaning policies, legislative frameworks and cyber governance institutions to empower regional partners to safely embrace the benefits of connectivity. It will also provide opportunities for Australia to learn and adopt emerging best practices to strengthen our own cyber policy and security measures. Development of robust cyber policy and well-resourced cyber governance institutions will mean that the collective capacity of states to respond to cyber incidents is enhanced, messaging to potential adversaries is consistent and security is strengthened overall. It will also empower Indo-Pacific states to participate in international discussions about the future of cyberspace in an inclusive manner. AUSTRALIA WILL: 4.07 Hold cyber policy dialogues to discuss and work with partners to achieve priority goals on international cyber issues, including international law, norms of responsible state behaviour and confidence building measures 4.08 Foster recognition through diplomatic outreach and defence engagement that military offensive cyber capabilities are subject to the same limitations and obligations as any other military capability 53 INTERNATIONAL SECURITY & CYBERSPACE Deter and respond to unacceptable behaviour in cyberspace The international community has made good progress delineating the boundaries of what is and isn’t acceptable behaviour in cyberspace – but some states are testing those boundaries. Like many others, Australia is concerned by the increased willingness of states and non-state actors to pursue their objectives by undertaking malicious cyber activities contrary to international law and identified norms of responsible state behaviour. Having established a firm foundation of international law and norms, the international community must now ensure there are effective consequences for those who act contrary to this consensus. Australia is committed to countering, deterring and discouraging malicious cyber activity, especially by states and their proxies. We will work with partners to strengthen global responses to unacceptable behaviour in cyberspace. An architecture for cooperation amongst states is needed. This includes mechanisms to respond to unacceptable behaviour in cyberspace in a timely and agile manner, within the existing framework of international law. Achieving this cooperation requires creative thinking to build a flexible range of existing and novel response tools, and a nimble coordination mechanism to implement them effectively. Australia’s responses to malicious cyber activity could comprise law enforcement or diplomatic, economic or military measures as appropriate for the circumstances. This could include, but is not restricted to, offensive cyber capabilities that disrupt, deny or degrade the computers or computer networks of adversaries. Regardless of the context, Australia’s response would be proportionate to the circumstances of the incident, would comply with domestic law, and be consistent with our support for the rules-based international order and our obligations under international law. Attribution of malicious activity is necessary to enable a range of response options. Depending on the seriousness and nature of an incident, Australia has the capability to attribute malicious cyber activity in a timely manner to several levels of granularity – ranging from the broad category of adversary through to specific states and individuals. Australia’s strong cyber security posture underpins our ability to deter and respond to serious incidents and unacceptable behaviour in cyberspace. It ensures that Australia can discourage, detect, respond to, and contain malicious cyber activity. 54 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY CONdUCT ANd AUTHORISATION OF OFFENSIVE CYBER CAPABILITY IN SUPPORT OF MILITARY OPERATIONS Australian offensive cyber capabilities are held by the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD). Australian offensive cyber operations are conducted by ASD personnel. Offensive cyber operations in support of Australian Defence Force (ADF) operations are planned and executed by ASD and Joint Operations Command under direction of the Chief of Joint Operations. All operations are conducted in accordance with international law and domestic law, including the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995 and the Intelligence Services Act 2001. Like any other military capability, use of this offensive cyber capability in support of military operations is governed by ADF Rules of Engagement (ROE). ROE are informed by and consistent with domestic and international law, including the Law of Armed Conflict (International Humanitarian Law). Offensive cyber capabilities are also subject to ASD’s existing legislative and oversight framework, including independent oversight by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. The 2016 Cyber Security Strategy and the 2016 Defence White Paper boosted Australia’s cyber security capabilities. Australia is strengthening the Australian Cyber Security Centre, establishing a multi-layered national cyber threat sharing network. The Australian Defence Force’s (ADF) Information Warfare Division will shape the development of ADF cyberspace capabilities to secure and protect ADF networks and systems, and support the integration of cyber capabilities into ADF operations. Australia has also established the Critical Infrastructure Centre to work cooperatively with owners and operators to manage the complex and evolving national security risks from foreign involvement in Australia’s critical infrastructure. The centre develops risk assessments to support Government decision-making on foreign investment in assets that may affect national security. Australia’s overall goal is to harden our networks, deter unacceptable behaviour in cyberspace, and promote an open, free and secure online environment. AUSTRALIA WILL: 4.09 Review Australia’s range of options to deter and respond to unacceptable behaviour in cyberspace, especially those involving state actors and their proxies 4.10 Undertake diplomatic action to support an international cooperative architecture that promotes stability, and responds to and deters unacceptable behaviour in cyberspace 55 INTERNATIONAL SECURITY & CYBERSPACE INTERNET GOVERNANCE & COOPERATION AUSTRALIA’S GOAL: An open, free and secure Internet, achieved through a multi- stakeholder approach to Internet governance and cooperation TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, AUSTRALIA wILL: Advocate for a multi-stakeholder approach to Internet governance that is inclusive, consensus-based, transparent and accountable Oppose efforts to bring the management of the Internet under government control Raise awareness across the Indo-Pacific of Internet governance issues and encourage engagement of regional partners in Internet governance and cooperation discussions The Internet is a network of networks. A suite of technical protocols and an array of communications technologies give the Internet its form. This ecosystem of technologies, on which the Internet depends, has evolved over time to maintain and improve the security, stability and resilience of the Internet. The governance of this ecosystem is an international issue, with implications for us all. Multi-stakeholder Internet governance underpins the open, free and secure nature of the Internet, on which our economies and societies rely. OPEN, FREE ANd SECURE CYBERSPACE An open cyberspace is interoperable across borders and accessible to all; it facilitates unrestricted participation and the free flow of information, driving inclusive online collaboration, innovation and growth. A free cyberspace means people are not burdened by undue restrictions on their access to and use of cyberspace; and their human rights are protected online as they are offline so that cyberspace remains a vibrant force for economic, social and cultural development. A secure cyberspace is safe, reliable and resilient; it fosters an environment of trust so that individuals, businesses and governments can engage online with confidence and realise the opportunities and minimise the risks of the digital age. 57 INTERNET GOVERNANCE & COOPERATION Reflecting its collaborative development, governance of the Internet is shaped by a multi-stakeholder approach. This approach allows the private sector, academia, technical experts, civil society and governments to contribute equally to discussions on the policy and technical management of the Internet. The multi-stakeholder approach is a proven model for responding to complex policy and technical challenges associated with the development of the Internet. These policy challenges include security concerns, consumer protection, maintaining legitimate competition and the management of cross-border data flows. However, the multi-stakeholder model of Internet governance cannot be taken for granted. As the strategic importance of cyberspace increases, so too will strategic competition over its future development. MULTI-STAKEHOLdER APPROACH TO INTERNET GOVERNANCE The multi-stakeholder approach to Internet governance is a decentralised governance model that places individuals, industry, non-commercial interests and government on an equal level. The multi-stakeholder approach allows for community-based policy-making. 58 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY Advocate for a multi-stakeholder approach to Internet governance Australia is a strong supporter of an open, free and secure Internet, and advocates for policy settings that support this position. The multi-stakeholder approach recognises that all stakeholders have a valuable contribution to make. Importantly, and by its very design, the multi-stakeholder approach prevents any group (including governments) from exerting undue influence over the future of the Internet. The multi-stakeholder approach offers a set of tools and practices that allow diverse stakeholders to participate alongside each other, share ideas, and develop consensus-based policy in the interest of all users of the Internet. Multi-stakeholder consultations and discussions on the Internet’s technical and policy frameworks are conducted at international, regional and national levels through Internet governance forums. Australia will continue to ensure that its contributions in these forums are centred on well-reasoned policy positions. We will also continue to work in close coordination with the private sector, academia, technical experts and civil society. Australia is committed to negotiating in good faith to reach consensus with other countries and non-government stakeholders about the Internet’s policy settings. KEY INTERNATIONAL FORUMS Australia will continue its engagement in key international multi-stakeholder organisations and forums. This includes the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and global and regional Internet Governance Forums (IGFs). ICANN is responsible for coordinating the global domain name system and is the major decision-making forum within the current Internet governance framework. The global IGF provides a platform for discussion of Internet-related public policy issues and idea sharing around maximising opportunities and minimising challenges associated with the Internet. 59 INTERNET GOVERNANCE & COOPERATION STRENGTHEN AUSTRALIA’S DOMESTIC MULTI-STAKEHOLDER COOPERATION Australia is committed to strengthening domestic multi-stakeholder mechanisms for Internet governance and cooperation. We are committed to consulting with a wide range of both government and non-government stakeholders domestically, regionally and internationally to develop public policy positions across the full spectrum of cyber affairs. Consultation with the local Internet community has identified a need for more opportunities for multi-stakeholder discussion in Australia on cyber policy issues, in particular Internet governance and cooperation. Australia will support annual community-led Internet governance dialogues run by a voluntary steering committee with focused and topical agendas. These dialogues will include government and non-government stakeholders including consumer groups, technical experts, private sector stakeholders (such as registries and hosting providers) and, critically, users of the Internet. Better multi-stakeholder cooperation in Australia will help inform the positions of all Internet stakeholders, including the Government. This will contribute to coordinated Internet governance efforts domestically and internationally. PRIVATE SECTOR ENGAGEMENT Australia will continue to work closely with private sector partners to ensure their voice is represented in international discussions on the future of the Internet. Most of the infrastructure on which the Internet runs is owned or managed by the private sector. The private sector has also largely driven the innovation at the heart of the Internet’s success. Therefore, including the perspective of the private sector is critical to the longer term growth and sustainability of the digital ecosystem. 60 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY NET NEUTRALITY Australia is a strong advocate of an open and competitive Internet. Internationally, there has been a focus on telecommunications companies gaining commercial advantage by giving priority to certain types of data, or data from certain sources, rather than applying the principle of ‘net neutrality’, that is: treating all data equally. Concerns about net neutrality have not been as prominent in Australia as in other countries because our market structure fosters strong retail competition and provides significant consumer choice. This allows consumers who are dissatisfied with their provider to take their business elsewhere. In the absence of a demonstrated problem, Australia has taken the view that regulation on net neutrality is unnecessary. Our telecommunications regulations, in addition to our general competition law – the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 – provide mechanisms to address competition concerns. Australia supports measures that deal with anti-competitive conduct in the supply of services on the Internet. Anti-competitive conduct on the Internet includes blocking websites, intentionally slowing bandwidth speeds (bandwidth throttling) and, in some circumstances, data prioritisation. These practices can disadvantage certain businesses, such as over the top service providers and content providers. However, care needs to be taken to ensure that legitimate competitive conduct and traffic management practices aren’t prevented. Transparency around traffic management practices can help assure customers in this regard. AUSTRALIA WILL: 5.01 Advocate for an open, free and secure Internet, underpinned by a multi‑stakeholder approach to Internet governance and cooperation 5.02 Support an annual community‑led Australian Internet governance and cooperation forum 5.03 Outline Australia’s strong commitment to fostering fair and effective competition online, emphasising a preference for general competition law 61 INTERNET GOVERNANCE & COOPERATION Oppose efforts to bring the management of the Internet under government control Australia recognises that there is an appropriate role for governments to play in Internet governance, but it is not one of control. Some states pursue a state-centred model of Internet governance in response to new public policy challenges raised by the advent of the Internet. A state-centred model of Internet governance would restrict and fragment the network, inhibit innovation and constrain the enormous potential of the Internet. States should resist policy responses that put at risk an open, free and secure cyberspace. Australia opposes moves to bring governance and technical management of the Internet under the control of governments or into the United Nations (UN) system, for example within the UN International Telecommunications Union. Instead, Australia advocates for the improvement of existing mechanisms of multi-stakeholder governance. This approach will ensure that governance of the Internet remains inclusive, consensus-based, transparent and accountable. This will be particularly important as the Internet continues to evolve and support a range of emerging technologies. Governance of the Internet of Things, rules for the use of data, and privacy and trust online are all issues demanding a collaborative approach to Internet governance. AUSTRALIA WILL: 5.04 Oppose efforts to bring the management of the Internet under government control 62 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY Raise awareness of Internet governance issues across the Indo-Pacific Australia is working to foster closer engagement with our neighbours in the Indo-Pacific on Internet governance issues so that we can work together to shape the Internet of the future. Australia will provide practical support for Indo-Pacific countries to engage in international Internet governance and cooperation discourse. Australia will continue to build relationships with regional Internet governance stakeholders and coordinate our policy positions with others in the region. Australia will also support regional Internet governance forums, workshops and events. We will explore opportunities to collaborate with private sector stakeholders to achieve greater awareness of, and interest in, Internet governance issues across the region. Internationally, Australia seeks to raise awareness among international stakeholders about the unique Internet governance and cooperation challenges faced by Indo-Pacific countries. AUSTRALIA WILL: 5.05 Build the capacity of Indo‑Pacific partners to engage in regional and international discussion on Internet governance and cooperation 63 INTERNET GOVERNANCE & COOPERATION HUMAN RIGHTS & DEMOCRACY ONLINE AUSTRALIA’S GOAL: Human rights apply online as they do offline TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, AUSTRALIA wILL: Advocate for the protection of human rights and democratic principles online Support international efforts to promote and protect human rights online Ensure respect for and protection of human rights and democratic principles online are considered in all Australian aid projects with digital technology components Cyberspace has provided an unparalleled opportunity for democratic participation around the world, as well as the global promotion, protection and fulfilment of human rights. Democratic debate on policy and ideas takes place online just as it does offline. The Internet has empowered individuals across the globe to have their voices heard and has equipped governments to better respond to citizens’ needs. Australia encourages states to make full use of online tools to strengthen democratic processes. However, the decentralised and largely unregulated nature of online conversations leaves democratic processes vulnerable to malicious interference. Cyber-enabled influence operations during elections can undermine democratic processes. This has the potential to fundamentally distort political debate and democratic outcomes. Human rights apply online just as they do offline. The Internet provides important platforms for freedom of expression and freedom of association. Instantaneous communication via the Internet helps raise awareness of human rights entitlements and human rights abuses. Stories and images of human rights abuses can be shared instantly across the world, inflicting significant reputational damage on perpetrators. This assists government authorities, non-government organisations and other stakeholders to hold human rights violators to account. Some countries deny human rights online. In some countries, people are increasingly subject to undue restrictions on and contraventions of their rights. Illicit monitoring and targeted hacking, the arrest and intimidation of online activists, content censorship and Internet shutdowns are just some of the approaches taken to restrict human rights online. These measures are regularly employed under the pretext of national security, but are often vehicles for states to maintain political control and economic advantage. 65 HUMAN RIGHTS & dEMOCRACY ONLINE Advocate for the protection of human rights and democratic principles online An open, free and secure cyberspace allows human rights and democratic principles to be exercised online. Australia’s commitment to human rights underpins our engagement with the international community. Australia is a committed supporter of human rights and democracy, both online and offline. Australia believes that the universal protection and promotion of human rights and democratic principles online is vital to achieve lasting peace, security, freedom and dignity for all. Of particular relevance in cyberspace are the right to freedom of expression, the right to freedom of association, and the protection against arbitrary interference with privacy. Each of these rights are enshrined in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Australia is committed to seeing freedom of expression protected online, just as it is offline. Australia condemns politically motivated Internet censorship, Internet shutdowns, illicit monitoring, targeted hacking, and the arrest and intimidation of online activists, journalists and others. KEY INTERNATIONAL FORUMS Australia’s support for human rights online has been articulated through a number of United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council and UN General Assembly resolutions and statements, and by virtue of its membership of the Freedom Online Coalition. Australia is seeking a seat on the Human Rights Council for the 2018–2020 term, and the right to freedom of expression is a key element of our campaign pledges. This reflects Australia’s commitment to ongoing promotion and protection of human rights, both online and offline. 66 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY An open, free and secure cyberspace also strengthens social, cultural and political rights by facilitating greater connectivity and engagement within and between populations. Attempts to circumscribe and restrict use of the Internet impinges on these rights. Australia will use bilateral and international engagement to raise concerns about impermissible restrictions on human rights online. We will also raise concerns about cyber-enabled interference in democratic processes. Australia will couple advocacy with capacity building programs in the Indo-Pacific, which will raise awareness among regional governments of human rights obligations online and offline. Also important is equipping law enforcement agencies with the capacity to detect human rights abuses online, disrupt these abuses and safeguard against future abuses. Australia will also encourage and support partner countries to engage in international forums that work to protect human rights online. PRIVATE SECTOR ENGAGEMENT Australia will demonstrate our commitment to the United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Australia consults regularly with the private sector on human rights and has established a multi-stakeholder advisory group on businesses and human rights. Australia will use these mechanisms to discuss human rights and democracy online. AUSTRALIA WILL: 6.01 Advocate to uphold and protect human rights and democratic freedoms online 6.02 Share concerns about, and aim to prevent, undue restrictions of human rights online as well as cyber‑enabled interference in democratic processes 6.03 Fund capacity building in the Indo‑Pacific to raise awareness of states’ human rights obligations online 67 HUMAN RIGHTS & dEMOCRACY ONLINE Support international efforts to promote and protect human rights online Non-government organisations play a vital role in the protection of human rights and democratic freedoms online. These organisations often have broad civil society networks and are acutely aware of the challenges facing human rights defenders in the digital environment. In addition to its international human rights advocacy efforts, Australia will provide financial support to international organisations protecting human rights and democratic freedoms online, such as the Freedom Online Coalition and Digital Defenders Partnership (see below). FREEdOM ONLINE COALITION ANd dIGITAL dEFENdERS PARTNERSHIP The Freedom Online Coalition is a group of 30 member governments, including Australia, which work together to support Internet freedom and protect human rights online. The Freedom Online Coalition’s founding declaration commits to the principle that the human rights people have offline, enjoy the same protection online. Coalition members share information on violations of human rights online and coordinate diplomatic efforts to eliminate measures that curtail human rights online. The Coalition also provides a platform for multi-stakeholder engagement on human rights online, including with the private sector. In support of this effort, the Digital Defenders Partnership, which emerged from the Freedom Online Conference in Kenya in 2012, provides grants that support defenders of human rights online, including non-government organisations, civil society, journalists and media organisations. AUSTRALIA WILL: 6.04 Support non‑government organisations that defend human rights online 68 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY Ensure respect for and protection of human rights and democratic principles online Increased connectivity and access to the Internet can bring many benefits. However, increased connectivity also increases the possibility for misuse of the Internet to restrict human rights and opportunities for democratic participation. To guard against this, Australia will ensure respect for and protection of human rights online is included in Australian development assistance programs that include digital technology components. Australia will encourage governments and non-government organisations to ensure that technology and cyberspace are used in accordance with human rights obligations. AUSTRALIA WILL: 6.05 Provide guidance to ensure that human rights online are protected in Australian aid and non‑government projects with digital technology components 69 HUMAN RIGHTS & dEMOCRACY ONLINE TECHNOLOGY FOR DEVELOPMENT AUSTRALIA’S GOAL: Digital technologies are used to achieve sustainable development and inclusive economic growth in the Indo-Pacific TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, AUSTRALIA wILL: Improve connectivity and access to the Internet across the Indo-Pacific, in collaboration with international organisations, regional governments and the private sector Encourage the use of resilient development-enabling technologies for e-governance and the digital delivery of services Support entrepreneurship, digital skills and integration into the global marketplace Digital technologies are profound enablers of sustainable development and inclusive economic growth. The spread of the Internet and digital technologies has facilitated greater connectivity, reducing physical and functional barriers between people, businesses and governments. The United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognises digital technologies as vital to ending poverty, expanding access to quality education, achieving gender equality and social inclusion, promoting inclusive economic growth, improving health outcomes and supporting cross-sectoral innovation. Connectivity varies greatly across the world, meaning that the socio-economic opportunities of the digital age are not evenly experienced. The Indo-Pacific is highly diverse, comprising of developed, emerging and least developed economies, each at a different point in their digital journey. The Indo-Pacific is home to countries with some of the highest, and fastest growing, connectivity rates. In many ways, the Indo-Pacific is at the forefront of the world’s digital revolution. Many Indo-Pacific countries are global leaders in digital economics, cyber security, the production and global exportation of new technologies, and other cyber-related areas. The region is already the largest contributor to the world’s digital markets and, by 2020, will contribute $1.4 trillion to global e-commerce. However, the Indo-Pacific is also home to some of the world’s least connected countries, where Internet penetration still sits in single digits and digital opportunities are yet to be fully harnessed. Digitally enabled development must take into account inter-regional differences in connectivity and digital readiness. Digital divides across the Indo-Pacific are the product of several factors. In some countries, insufficient financial resources and challenging topography complicate the establishment of essential communication infrastructure. In others, low literacy rates, limited technical skills, socio-cultural constraints, unaffordable service costs or unreliable electricity supply undermine access to, and use of, digital technologies. Access limitations are particularly stark for women and girls, older persons, people with disabilities, indigenous, ethnic and religious minorities, rural populations and the poor. Australia is committed to working bilaterally, regionally and multilaterally to bridge digital divides across the Indo-Pacific. Australia is also committed to encouraging innovative uses of digital technologies to support sustainable and inclusive development. ‘Information Communication Technologies can be an engine for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. They can power this global undertaking.’ United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, December 2015 71 TECHNOLOGY FOR dEVELOPMENT Improve connectivity and access to the Internet across the Indo-Pacific Internet access is a prerequisite for the effective operation of most digital technologies. Connectivity is therefore a fundamental requirement for technology-enabled development. Australia will contribute to international efforts to improve connectivity and Internet access across the Indo-Pacific. This is a task of enormous social and economic importance: estimates suggest that for every 10 per cent increase in broadband Internet penetration, a country could increase its Gross Domestic Product growth by 1.4 per cent. To facilitate increased connectivity, countries must have the necessary infrastructure. This includes submarine cables, satellites, cross-border fibre connections, cellular data services, Internet Exchange Points, and other emerging infrastructure technologies. Connectivity also fundamentally relies upon the availability, affordability and reliability of electricity supply. Australian support for digital communications infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific is bringing connectivity to hundreds of thousands of people in some of the most remote places on earth. Australia contributed technical expertise and financial resources (in partnership with the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank) to lay a fibre-optic submarine cable connecting Samoa and Fiji. This has facilitated improved Internet access at more affordable prices. Australia has also supported projects to enhance mobile coverage in the Solomon Islands and Kiribati. In 2017–18, Australia will support the laying of a new submarine cable that will provide faster and more stable Internet connectivity to the Republic of Palau. PRIVATE SECTOR ENGAGEMENT The challenge of building adequate legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks across the Indo-Pacific will require collaboration with private sector stakeholders including telecommunications service providers and partners in the financial sector. 72 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY To make use of this base infrastructure, Internet services and Internet-enabled devices must be affordable and operate at sufficient speeds. Telecommunications market monopolies and high input costs present a significant barrier to ubiquitous Internet access. In order to improve affordability of access, it is essential to have in place the appropriate regulatory, legal and institutional frameworks. These frameworks enhance trust in Internet enabled infrastructure and services, facilitate digital trade, and help protect users and service providers. As a competitive free market economy with well-established regulatory, legal and institutional structures, Australia has shared best practice and has continued the development of telecommunications policy and regulatory approaches with regional partners. This has occurred through our involvement in regional forums such as the APEC Telecommunications and Information Working Group and through bilateral exchanges (see Vanuatu’s Regulatory Environment Supporting Greater Connectivity, page 74). ENABLING ACCESS TO THE INTERNET The private sector plays a crucial role in enabling access to the Internet. Most of the base infrastructure used for Internet access and connectivity is maintained and operated by the private sector. This infrastructure generates new markets for companies and digital products and services, while underpinning socio-economic development in those markets. 73 TECHNOLOGY FOR dEVELOPMENT VANUATU’S REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT SUPPORTING GREATER CONNECTIVITY The Australian Aid program, Governance for Growth (GFG), supported liberalisation of Vanuatu’s telecommunications sector. The program provided assistance to the government to break the monopoly held by Telecom Vanuatu Limited, in part through establishing the Office of the Telecommunications and Radio Communications Regulator. This led to the introduction of Digicel as an alternative telecommunications service provider. As a result, mobile penetration has increased from 27 per cent of Vanuatu’s population in 2008 to over 80 per cent in 2016. The GFG program also assisted the Vanuatu Government to establish the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO). In 2014, the OGCIO developed a Universal Access Policy, which compels telecommunications service providers to expand coverage to 98% of the country by 1 January 2018. This has contributed to a significant increase in availability and affordability of broadband Internet services throughout Vanuatu. AUSTRALIA WILL: 7.01 Partner with international organisations, regional governments, development banks and the private sector to improve Internet accessibility in the Indo‑Pacific 7.02 Work with partner countries in the Indo‑Pacific to develop domestic regulatory, legal and institutional frameworks that support competitive telecommunications sectors 7.03 Promote digital inclusion across the Indo‑Pacific through educational programs, leadership initiatives and strategic partnerships 74 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY Encourage the use of resilient development- enabling technologies The role of digital technologies as enablers of development is expanding. Inclusive access to digital technologies is critical to ensure that all individuals can more readily enjoy the benefits of increasingly digital societies. E-GOVERNANCE AND DIGITAL DELIVERY OF SERVICES Access to digital information and services empowers individuals. It opens new channels through which people can engage financially, socially and politically. Increasingly, core services including banking and finance, education and healthcare are most effectively accessed using digital technologies (see The Tupaia Initiative and Digital Delivery of Services, page 76). E-governance – the delivery of government services through online platforms – can improve administration processes, service delivery, government accountability and transparency. Australia recognises the transformative role that digital technologies play in increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of government services. Beyond this, digital technologies also provide alternative solutions to challenges. Australia has played a role in enhancing school attendance and educational outcomes across the region by providing digital reporting and lesson-planning tools to teachers and schools. Australia has contributed to the empowerment of women and girls in the region through deploying technology and training to young women, enhancing their digital inclusion and financial independence. ‘By reducing information costs, digital technologies greatly lower the cost of economic and social transactions for firms, individuals, and the public sector. They promote innovation when transaction costs fall to essentially zero. They boost efficiency as existing activities and services become cheaper, quicker, or more convenient. And they increase inclusion as people get access to services that previously were out of reach.’ Digital Dividends, The World Bank, 2016. 75 TECHNOLOGY FOR dEVELOPMENT THE TUPAIA INITIATIVE ANd dIGITAL dELIVERY OF SERVICES Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s innovationXchange is investing an initial $2 million in a collaboration with software providers to transform the availability of medical supply information across the Pacific Islands. This investment will supply partner governments with an easy to use digital dashboard showing real time essential medical supply information. Health planners and other key decision-makers within local health systems will know where their medical supplies are stored and frontline nursing and pharmaceutical staff will be able to place and track their orders, enhancing availability of medical supplies in the areas where they are needed most. INNOVATIVE USES OF TECHNOLOGY FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION Engagement in the formal financial sector is a catalyst for inclusive economic growth and sustainable development. It is difficult to pinpoint exact numbers of people in the Indo-Pacific who do not engage the services of a bank or similar financial institution, but the numbers are significant. We know that over 400 million people in Southeast Asia alone remain ‘unbanked’. Increased participation by the APEC region in the formal financial sector will increase the region’s economic contribution from $17 billion to $52 billion by 2030. New technologies give rise to new opportunities for financial inclusion. Formalising banking by increasing access to online and mobile banking and e-financing arrangements (such as Government-to-Person digital payment systems in the Indo-Pacific) will reduce administration costs for governments and businesses, make savings more secure and increase financial inclusion, especially for women and girls and people living in rural and remote areas. As current co-chair of the G20 Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion Subgroup on Markets and Payment Systems (alongside Mexico), Australia is engaged in promoting digital payment systems and providing secure, cost-effective digital financial services and products. The Subgroup’s Guidance Note on Building Inclusive Digital Ecosystems has been a key outcome of Australia’s 2017 co-chairmanship. This Guidance Note supports the implementation of inclusive digital payment systems and the provision of safe, cost-effective digital financial services and products. 76 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY PRIVATE SECTOR ENGAGEMENT Alongside government, the private sector has an important stake in the digital inclusion of countries and populations across the Indo-Pacific. Financial institutions and service providers are increasingly using digital technologies to enhance delivery of their financial products and services. CYBER SECURITY FOR RESILIENT TECHNOLOGY-ENABLED DEVELOPMENT Greater connectivity has the potential to facilitate sustainable and inclusive development. However, it also brings new threats. Poor cyber security practices and low cybercrime awareness can undermine trust in cyberspace, reducing the dividends of digital technologies. Conversely, trust in the online environment sustains and extends the development-enabling capacity of digital technologies. Australian development projects will take into account the long-term security and resilience of technologies. This will support the safety and privacy of users and build trust in online systems. Technologies that are known to be resilient to threats, and that are trusted by users, will have greater impact on development outcomes. AUSTRALIA WILL: 7.04 Work with partner governments, the private sector and financial institutions across the Indo‑Pacific to promote e‑governance, online service delivery and innovative uses of technology for enhanced economic opportunity and sustainable development 7.05 Provide guidance to ensure that digital technologies used or provided in Australian aid and non‑government projects are safe and resilient 77 TECHNOLOGY FOR dEVELOPMENT Support entrepreneurship, digital skills and integration into the global marketplace The introduction of new digital technologies will continue to act as a catalyst for development, but technological advancements can also disrupt traditional economic and labour markets. Innovative uses of technology by individuals, entrepreneurs, governments and businesses can harness digital disruption for good, upskilling workers and integrating people and economies into the global marketplace. Australia is committed to bridging digital divides within and between countries in the region by bolstering entrepreneurship, digital-ready workforces and inclusive digital trade. ENCOURAGING INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP Innovation and entrepreneurship are critical factors in sustaining an open, free and secure cyberspace. Innovators develop new ways for people to participate and collaborate online. Entrepreneurs take new ideas forward and enhance access to and use of the Internet. Together, these activities ensure that cyberspace remains an ever-evolving force for inclusive economic growth and sustainable development. Australia supports public-private innovation challenges that search for innovative and entrepreneurial solutions to development challenges across the region (see CSIRO ON Prime Accelerator Program). Australia’s Ambassador for Cyber Affairs will host a Technology for Development Challenge for entrepreneurs and start-ups from Australia and the Indo-Pacific to find innovative technology-based solutions to regional development challenges. CSIRO ON PRIME ACCELERATOR PROGRAM CSIRO’s ON Prime Accelerator Program is working with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to explore ways in which technologies that have the potential to deliver gains in connectivity, online service delivery and data collection across the Indo-Pacific can be maximised. ON Prime is an entry level, part-time pre-accelerator that helps teams validate their research through a process of customer discovery and market validation, and discover a real world application for it. Going forward, the aim is to encourage teams with research in this space to discover the value of their work and maximize their potential impact. 78 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY AUSTRALIA WILL: 7.06 Work with public and private sector partners to encourage businesses and entrepreneurs to find solutions to regional development challenges using innovative technologies DIGITAL-READY WORKFORCES In order to realise the potential of the digital age, populations must be digitally skilled. Some countries in the Indo-Pacific have highly skilled digital-ready workforces. In many others, however, digital literacy and skills vary greatly among working populations. An absence of digital skills and technical expertise holds people back from participating fully in the digital economy. As technology becomes increasingly available, demand for digitally literate workers will continue to expand. In order to prepare populations for increasingly digitalised jobs, schools, universities and training programs for working age and older persons must equip people with digital skills. In addition to traditional education, agile approaches to bridging skills gaps are needed across the region. Governments and businesses have a shared and growing need to work together in this area to build up digital-ready workforces. Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s innovationXchange is working with private sector and university partners to source solutions to digital skills shortages across the region. Grant funding will be awarded to project proposals that will upskill Indo-Pacific populations, especially young people, women and girls, and people with disabilities. Digitally skilled populations will themselves become catalysts for inclusive economic growth and sustainable development. Groups previously underrepresented in the digital landscape will gain the skills needed to access jobs, expanded economic opportunities, information, government services and social engagement online. 79 TECHNOLOGY FOR dEVELOPMENT AUSTRALIA WILL: 7.07 Partner with regional governments, multilateral forums and educational institutions to build digital‑ready workforces and support digital upskilling across the Indo‑Pacific INTEGRATION INTO THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE Through its ongoing Aid for Trade program, Australia helps individuals, businesses and economies integrate into the global marketplace. Encouraging growth of digital trade delivers particular benefits to small businesses, women and girls, low-income groups, indigenous, ethnic and religious minorities, and others. Australia has committed $10 million to multilateral programs that assist developing countries to undertake trade facilitation reform. This includes the World Bank’s Trade Facilitation Support Program, World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement Facility, and the Global Alliance for Trade Facilitation. In 2015, Australia endorsed the G20 Digital Economy Development and Cooperation Initiative, which seeks to improve digital trade outcomes, including for developing countries and vulnerable groups. AUSTRALIA WILL: 7.08 Support new technologies and tools for developing countries to facilitate trade, including improvements in policy and customs practices and better access to trade finance 7.09 Focus Australian Aid for Trade efforts on connecting small businesses and women entrepreneurs in developing countries to digital economy opportunities and global supply chains 80 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY SHAPING INCLUSIVE FINANCE TRANSFORMATIONS IN ASEAN Australia’s ASEAN and Mekong regional aid program is supporting increased participation in digital trade. For example, the Shaping Inclusive Finance Transformations in ASEAN investment (SHIFT, $9.9 million, 2014–2018, implemented by the United Nations Capital Development Fund - UNCDF), is developing innovative digital services to help low-income women and men access financial services. SHIFT supported development of LienVietPostBank’s new e-wallet. This offers the full array of low-cost banking services via a client’s smartphone, supporting low-income people in Vietnam gain financial independence and growing a new market for financial services. 81 TECHNOLOGY FOR dEVELOPMENT COMPREHENSIVE & COORDINATED CYBER AFFAIRS AUSTRALIA’S GOAL: Australia pursues a comprehensive & coordinated cyber affairs agenda TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, AUSTRALIA wILL: Enhance understanding of Australia’s comprehensive cyber affairs agenda Increase funding for Australia’s international cyber engagement activities Coordinate and prioritise Australia’s international cyber engagement activities The digital age presents a diverse range of opportunities and challenges for Australia. This Strategy captures the breadth of Australia’s agenda for cyber affairs through its seven thematic chapters: Digital Trade, Cyber Security, Cybercrime, International Security & Cyberspace, Internet Governance & Cooperation, Human Rights & Democracy Online and Technology for Development. The borderless nature of cyberspace means that the capacity and behaviour of other states, the private sector, civil society and individuals can affect Australia’s cyber interests. Cyber diplomacy and outreach is essential to promoting and protecting Australia’s national security, foreign policy, economic and trade interests, as well as our development objectives. Australia’s various cyber interests are all deeply interconnected. For example, increased internet penetration resulting from development projects promotes inclusive economic growth, while helping more people get online in the Indo-Pacific boosts our regional economy, creating new opportunities for Australia’s private sector to market their digital goods and services. Australia will work closely with international partners, both in the Indo-Pacific and across the globe, to pursue our cyber affairs agenda. Reflecting differing levels of connectivity and digital development in the region, our partners offer varying opportunities for engagement and collaboration. Some countries with particular expertise and capabilities will be key partners in the practical delivery of Australia’s cyber affairs agenda, while others will be key beneficiaries. As our neighbours become more connected, Australia will partner to build their technical, legislative and institutional capacity to fight cybercrime. This will not only preserve our neighbours’ economic growth, but also prevent the creation of cybercrime safe havens that could be used to target Australians. Such capacity building also equips countries to participate more constructively in international discussions on the future of cyberspace. At the same time, investing in capacity building and improving international collaboration on shared cyber challenges helps to ensure that Australia and Australians can enjoy the benefits of cyberspace, while mitigating the risks. 83 COMPREHENSIVE & COORdINATEd CYBER AFFAIRS In different combinations, Australia’s cyber interests either reinforce each other or require conscious balancing. For example, overcoming barriers to development and successfully addressing cybercrime both improve the performance of the digital economy. In contrast, pursuing digital development without addressing the risk of cybercrime could be counterproductive. Similarly, chasing absolute security without considering the benefits of digital trade could lead to missed opportunities. Australia will reconcile the complex relations between these various factors by pursuing a comprehensive and coordinated approach to cyber affairs. In recognising the significance of cyber affairs to our national interest, Australia will increase the understanding, funding and coordination of our international cyber engagement. Greater resources and a harmonised approach to international cyber engagement will ensure Australia achieves its goals in cyberspace. Collaborating and cooperating with the private sector, civil society, academia and other governments will be vital to ensure that Australia’s fundamental objective of an open, free and secure Internet is achieved. 84 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY Enhance understanding of Australia’s comprehensive cyber affairs agenda Cyber issues cut across almost all areas of Australia’s international engagement. The prominence of these issues will continue to grow as global connectivity and technology uptake continue to increase. In acknowledgement of this, Australia will work to improve understanding of its comprehensive international cyber agenda amongst all stakeholders, both domestic and international. Australia embraces a holistic idea of ‘cyber capacity’. This includes a state’s ability to: ensure people’s rights online; achieve economic growth through digital trade; combat cybercrime; and engage in conversations about Internet governance and international security in cyberspace. Australia will bring conversations concerning development assistance and cyber security capacity together, reconciling the goals, priorities and terminology discussed. Similarly, cyber capacity building will encompass important elements beyond purely technical training, including policy and legislation, education and infrastructure. FIGURE 1: Australia’s interconnected cyber affairs interests 85 COMPREHENSIVE & COORdINATEd CYBER AFFAIRS This Strategy conveys Australia’s comprehensive cyber affairs vision to the international community. This vision will be reinforced through Australia’s ongoing diplomatic engagements, and will also be promoted to domestic stakeholders through regular consultation across the Australian Government and industry. In order to deliver Australia’s comprehensive cyber affairs agenda internationally, Australia needs those who represent the country to be equipped with an in-depth understanding of international cyber issues and Australia’s interests in cyberspace. Australia will develop a Cyber Affairs Curriculum for its Diplomatic Academy. Courses will provide Australia’s international representatives from across government with a detailed view of our cyber affairs agenda. The material will cover Australia’s national security, foreign policy, economic and trade interests, and legal and development objectives regarding the Internet and cyberspace. ‘Workshops in a box’ – curriculums that can be delivered to representatives already on international postings – will further disseminate cyber affairs awareness. This will ensure that Australia’s international cyber affairs agenda is not only comprehensive in concept, but also broad in stewardship. Empowering the people at the forefront of Australia’s international cyber engagement will be the foundation of Australia’s coordinated approach to cyber affairs. AUSTRALIA WILL: 8.01 Promote Australia’s comprehensive vision of cyber affairs through ongoing diplomatic engagement 8.02 Create a Cyber Affairs Curriculum for Australia’s international representatives through DFAT’s Diplomatic Academy 86 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY Increase funding for Australia’s international cyber engagement activities Australia’s newly established Cyber Cooperation Program, announced by the Foreign Minister in May 2016, is designed to boost the resources behind Australia’s cyber capacity building efforts. Projects funded by the Program will encompass the full spectrum of cyber affairs, whether that be raising the bar of cyber security, cybercrime capacity building, or pursuing economic and development goals. While introduced with an initial investment of $1 million per year over four years, in recognition of the growing importance of this field, the Government has supplemented this funding with an additional $10 million over three years, taking the total investment to $14 million. This additional investment ensures that the priorities outlined in this Strategy can be delivered through practical action. The Indo-Pacific will be the focus area of the Program’s projects. This is where our capacity building efforts will have the greatest impact and translate most directly into gains for Australia. Australia will work with partners who have a well-established capability and complementary objectives. In this way, we will harness the existing capacity of the Indo-Pacific to deliver greater outcomes to the region as a whole, including to those countries who are at the beginning of their digital journey. Australia will actively seek creative partnering opportunities with governments around the world and with civil society, academia and the private sector. Our combined resources, networks and expertise will be a force multiplier in pursuit of shared goals. The Cyber Cooperation Program will provide the support for many of the new international cyber engagement activities in the Strategy. AUSTRALIA WILL: 8.03 Fund new international cyber engagement projects in the Indo‑Pacific through the Cyber Cooperation Program 87 COMPREHENSIVE & COORdINATEd CYBER AFFAIRS Coordinate and prioritise Australia’s international cyber engagement The breadth of Australia’s comprehensive cyber affairs agenda means that there are many stakeholders across government who promote and safeguard Australia’s international interests in cyberspace. The growing profile of these issues and Australia’s increasing investment means it is becoming even more important to ensure that all of Australia’s international cyber activities are effectively coordinated. The Ambassador for Cyber Affairs will coordinate and prioritise Australia’s international cyber engagement across the full spectrum of international cyber affairs. Recognising that important work is already going on across Government, the Ambassador for Cyber Affairs will convene a quarterly whole-of-Government International Cyber Engagement Group. The Group will bring together all Government representatives with a stake in Australia’s cyber affairs. This will help amplify the visibility of existing efforts, increase useful cross-departmental collaborations, avoid duplications of effort, and ensure an overarching direction and prioritisation. As foreshadowed in the Digital Trade chapter, Australia will engage with a new dedicated private sector advisory body that will consult directly with the Government on international cyber issues. The Industry Advisory Group will provide the practical framework for Australia’s public-private partnership on cyber issues and ensure that the Government collaborates with the private sector in pursuit of its cyber affairs agenda. By adopting a comprehensive approach, boosting funding and increasing coordination of international cyber engagement across Government, civil society, academia and the private sector, Australia will ensure its prosperity and security in cyberspace. AUSTRALIA WILL: 8.04 Establish a quarterly whole‑of‑Government meeting, convened by the Ambassador for Cyber Affairs, to coordinate and prioritise Australia’s international cyber activities 8.05 Establish an Industry Advisory Group that meets biannually to facilitate public‑private collaboration on Australia’s international cyber engagement 88 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY ANNEXES Annex A: Australia’s position on how international law applies to state conduct in cyberspace Existing international law provides the framework for state behaviour in cyberspace. This includes, where applicable, the law regarding the use of force, international humanitarian law (IHL), international human rights law, and international law regarding state responsibility. In this respect, Australia notes that the centrality of international law and its application to states’ use of cyberspace was affirmed in 2013 in the consensus report of the third United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UNGGE) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, which was chaired by Australia, and reaffirmed in the 2015 report of the UNGGE. However, Australia recognises that activities conducted in cyberspace raise new challenges for the application of international law, including issues of sovereignty, attribution and jurisdiction, given that different actors engage in a range of cyber activities which may cross multiple national borders. This annex sets out Australia’s views on these issues. 1. The United Nations Charter and the law on the use of force ( jus ad bellum) apply to activities conducted in cyberspace. The Charter of the United Nations requires states to seek peaceful settlements of disputes. This obligation extends to cyberspace and requires states to resolve cyber incidents peacefully without escalation or resort to the threat or use of force. This requirement does not impinge upon a state’s inherent right to act in individual or collective self-defence in response to an armed attack, which applies equally in the cyber domain as it does in the physical realm. In determining whether a cyber attack, or any other cyber activity, constitutes a use of force, states should consider whether the activity’s scale and effects are comparable to traditional kinetic operations that rise to the level of use of force under international law. This involves a consideration of the intended or reasonably expected direct and indirect consequences of the cyber attack, including for example whether the cyber activity could reasonably be expected to cause serious or extensive (‘scale’) damage or destruction (‘effects’) to life, or injury or death to persons, or result in damage to the victim state’s objects, critical infrastructure and/ or functioning. 2. For cyber operations constituting or occurring within the context of an international or non-international armed conflict, the relevant international humanitarian law ( jus in bello) will apply to the conduct of these cyber activities. International humanitarian law (IHL) (including the principles of humanity, necessity, proportionality and distinction) applies to cyber operations within an armed conflict. The IHL principle of proportionality prohibits the launching of an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or 90 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. The IHL principle of military necessity states that a combatant is justified in using those measures, not forbidden by international law, which are indispensable for securing complete submission of an enemy at the soonest moment. The principle cannot be used to justify actions prohibited by law, as the means to achieve victory are not unlimited. The IHL principle of distinction seeks to ensure that only legitimate military objects are attacked. Distinction has two components. The first, relating to personnel, seeks to maintain the distinction between combatants and non-combatants or military and civilian personnel. The second component distinguishes between legitimate military targets and civilian objects. All Australian military capabilities are employed in line with approved targeting procedures. Cyber operations are no different. Australian targeting procedures comply with the requirements of IHL and trained legal officers provide decision-makers with advice to ensure that Australia satisfies its obligations under international law and its domestic legal requirements. For example, Australia considers that, if a cyber operation rises to the same threshold as that of a kinetic ‘attack under IHL’, the rules governing such attacks during armed conflict will apply to those kinds of cyber operations. 3. For cyber activities taking place outside of armed conflict, general principles of international law, including the law on state responsibility, apply. It is a longstanding rule of international law that, if a state acts in violation of an international obligation, and that violation is attributable to the state, that state will be responsible for the violation. The customary international law on state responsibility, much of which is reflected in the International Law Commission’s Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, apply to state behaviour in cyberspace. To the extent that a state enjoys the right to exercise sovereignty over objects and activities within its territory, it necessarily shoulders corresponding responsibilities to ensure those objects and activities are not used to harm other states. In this context, we note it may not be reasonable to expect (or even possible for) a state to prevent all malicious use of ICT infrastructure located within its territory. However, in Australia’s view, if a state is aware of an internationally wrongful act originating from or routed through its territory, and it has the ability to put an end to the harmful activity, that state should take reasonable steps to do so consistent with international law. If a state is a victim of malicious cyber activity which is attributable to a perpetrator state, the victim state may be able to take countermeasures against the perpetrator state, under certain circumstances. However, countermeasures that amount to a use of force are not permissible. Any use of countermeasures involving cyberspace must be proportionate. It is acknowledged that this raises challenges in identifying and assessing direct and indirect effects of malicious cyber activity, in order to gauge a proportionate response. The purpose of countermeasures is to compel the other party to desist in the ongoing unlawful conduct. 91 ANNEXES Annex B: Norms for the responsible behaviour of states in cyberspace From the report of the 2015 UN Group of Government Experts on Development in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (A/70/174). (a) Consistent with the purposes of the United Nations, including to maintain international peace and security, States should cooperate in developing and applying measures to increase stability and security in the use of ICTs and to prevent ICT practices that are acknowledged to be harmful or that may pose threats to international peace and security; (b) In case of ICT incidents, States should consider all relevant information, including the larger context of the event, the challenges of attribution in the ICT environment and the nature and extent of the consequences; (c) States should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs; (d) States should consider how best to cooperate to exchange information, assist each other, prosecute terrorist and criminal use of ICTs and implement other cooperative measures to address such threats. States may need to consider whether new measures need to be developed in this respect; (e) States, in ensuring the secure use of ICTs, should respect Human Rights Council resolutions 20/8 and 26/13 on the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet, as well as General Assembly resolutions 68/167 and 69/166 on the right to privacy in the digital age, to guarantee full respect for human rights, including the right to freedom of expression; (f) A State should not conduct or knowingly support ICT activity contrary to its obligations under international law that intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs the use and operation of critical infrastructure to provide services to the public; (g) States should take appropriate measures to protect their critical infrastructure from ICT threats, taking into account General Assembly resolution 58/199 on the creation of a global culture of cybersecurity and the protection of critical information infrastructures, and other relevant resolutions; (h) States should respond to appropriate requests for assistance by another State whose critical infrastructure is subject to malicious ICT acts. States should also respond to appropriate requests to mitigate malicious ICT activity aimed at the critical infrastructure of another State emanating from their territory, taking into account due regard for sovereignty; 92 AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY (i) States should take reasonable steps to ensure the integrity of the supply chain so that end users can have confidence in the security of ICT products. States should seek to prevent the proliferation of malicious ICT tools and techniques and the use of harmful hidden functions; (j) States should encourage responsible reporting of ICT vulnerabilities and share associated information on available remedies to such vulnerabilities to limit and possibly eliminate potential threats to ICTs and ICT-dependent infrastructure; (k) States should not conduct or knowingly support activity to harm the information systems of the authorized emergency response teams (sometimes known as computer emergency response teams or cybersecurity incident response teams) of another State. A State should not use authorized emergency response teams to engage in malicious international activity. 93 ANNEXES Annex C: International cyber engagement strategy action plan DIGITAL TRADE

Instantaneous  communications, transactions, and access  to information keep our economies  growing, infrastructure operating,  governments working and people in touch.  Technology will continue to fundamentally change the  way we live, work and relate to one another.  The borderless nature of cyberspace  means international cyber issues present  opportunities and challenges for all  Australians, every day.  Digital trade, cyber-enabled intellectual  property theft, technology for  development and operations to  influence elections are some of the  ways cyber affairs permeate our  international conversations.  The 2016 Cyber Security Strategy  committed to expanding on how  Australia will attain global responsibility  and influence in cyberspace.  Now, more than ever, we must engage  with the international community as  exciting possibilities emerge, critical  debates unfold and global rules  are agreed.  Australia’s first International Cyber  Engagement Strategy states Australia’s  comprehensive international cyber  affairs agenda.  It sets a clear vision of  Australia’s interests and objectives in  cyberspace over the next three years.   Reflecting Australia’s broad view of  cyber affairs, this Strategy establishes a  whole-of-Government approach across  seven key themes: Digital Trade, Cyber  Security, Cybercrime, International  Security, Internet Governance &  Cooperation, Human Rights &  Democracy Online and Technology for  Development. The Strategy is supported  by a practical action plan.  The Foreign Policy White Paper, currently  under development, will reiterate our  understanding of the significant and  growing importance of cyber issues  to Australia’s foreign policy. It will also  chart a course to position Australia for  opportunity, while managing the risks of  our increasingly interconnected world.  Our international cyber engagement  protects Australians and promotes our  interests. It positions us to harness  opportunities and increase our cyber  resilience. An open, free and secure  Internet drives economic growth,  enhances our national security and  fosters international stability.  5  FOREIGN MINISTER’S FOREwORd    Australia remains committed to a  peaceful online environment.  The activities of states in cyberspace  have implications for us all. Cyberspace  is not an ungoverned space. Just like in  the physical domains, states have rights  but they also have obligations. Existing  international law applies to states’  conduct in cyberspace, complemented  by agreed norms of responsible  state behaviour.  Increasingly, states are testing the  boundaries of what is and isn’t  acceptable in cyberspace. Australia  will cooperate with its international  partners to deter, mitigate and attribute  malicious cyber activity by criminals,  state actors and their proxies, including  those that seek to interfere in the internal  democratic processes of states.  Australia’s cyber affairs agenda is global  in perspective and regional in focus.   As a responsible contributor to the  international community, we have a  platform to engage on cyber policy  issues within global forums. Strong  participation in global cyber cooperation  efforts benefits Australia’s national and  economic interests. It also positions  Australia to take a leading international  role in shaping the future of cyberspace.  The Indo-Pacific region presents  significant digital opportunities and  complex cyber challenges. It is home  to some of the most advanced digital  economies as well as countries whose  digital development is still in its early  stages. It is here, in the Indo-Pacific, that  Australia can best leverage our cyber  capacity building resources to support  and open, free and secure Internet.  Digital technologies are profound  enablers of sustainable development  and economic growth.  Australia will work to improve  connectivity and access to the  Internet across the Indo-Pacific.  We will encourage the use of resilient  development-enabling technologies  for egovernance and digital delivery  of services. We will also support  entrepreneurship, help develop a  digital ready workforce and promote  our region’s further integration into the  global market place.   This Strategy sets out Australia’s  plan to promote confidence in  the online environment, increase  economic opportunities, reduce losses  attributable to cybercrime, minimise  the risks of strategic miscalculation in  cyberspace, promote multi-stakeholder  Internet governance, protect human  rights online and deliver sustainable  development outcomes.  I look forward to engaging with  governments at home and abroad, the  private sector, civil society and academia  to enhance the prosperity and security of  Australia, our region, and the world.   The Hon Julie Bishop MP  Minister for Foreign Affairs  4 October 2017  6  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    Introduction by the  Ambassador for Cyber Affairs  Cyber affairs play a significant role in  Australia’s international relations with  other countries. While once a technical  niche issue, cyber affairs is now a strategic  international policy issue.   Thanks to cyberspace, the connections  between governments, businesses,  communities and individuals are more  complex than ever before.  As the complexity of cyberspace grows,  it demands increased international  attention, cooperation and creativity.  This Strategy sets an ambitious agenda  across the full spectrum of cyber affairs.  Framing Australia’s international cyber  interests through this comprehensive  lens empowers us to see the big picture  of the dynamic cyber landscape.  Australia’s interests in cyberspace  are diverse and interconnected: from  capturing the economic prosperity  promised by digital trade and  technology enabled-development,  to securing Australia from the threat of  cybercriminals and preserving stability  in cyberspace.  Growth of disruptive business models  supported by digital technologies  present exciting opportunities for  Australian businesses. Government  and the private sector therefore have  a mutual responsibility and interest  in maximising the opportunities and  mitigating the risks of the online world.  Australia’s vision of an open, free and  secure cyberspace and our ambitions   across the broad spectrum of cyber  affairs are impossible to achieve  alone. All of our efforts, both globally  and regionally, will be delivered in  partnership. We will combine the unique  and complementary skills of other  countries, the private sector, civil society  and the research community.  International cyber issues are constantly  evolving and Australia’s approach to  international cyber engagement must  reflect this. Frequent review of Australia’s  approach to cyber affairs will ensure  Australia continues to adopt the most  effective means to achieve our goals  in cyberspace.  Harnessing the opportunities of the  digital age and mitigating risks is a shared  challenge and a shared responsibility.  My team and I look forward to working  with you to advance and protect our  collective interests in cyberspace.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Australia’s international cyber engagement champions  an open, free and secure cyberspace. Through  comprehensive and coordinated engagement on cyber  affairs, we will maximise opportunities for economic  growth and prosperity through digital trade. Australia will  cooperate internationally to reduce the risk of cybercrime  and promote peace and stability in cyberspace. We will  advocate for multi-stakeholder Internet governance and  respect for human rights and democratic principles online.  We will partner to foster good cyber security practices  and encourage the use of digital technologies to achieve  sustainable development, particularly in our region.  The digital technology revolution is  fundamentally a story of prosperity.  Increasingly, cyberspace acts as an  economic enabler. Connectivity helps  improve productivity and provides  customers and the private sector  with greater access to the global  marketplace. Shaping an enabling  environment for digital trade will deliver  increased prosperity for Australia  and enhance realisation of economic  opportunity globally.  This progress is only possible if  underpinned by sound cyber security.  The spread of digital technologies  creates profound economic opportunities  but, at the same time, creates new  vulnerabilities. Individuals, the private  sector and governments around the   world face an evolving array of cyber  threats. Governments and the private  sector working together to develop  a strong cyber security posture is an  essential prerequisite to ensuring we  can all safely capitalise on the benefits  of increasing connectivity. As part of this  effort, Australia will encourage innovative  cyber security solutions and deliver  world leading cyber security advice.  Improving cyber security is an important  way of mitigating the risk of cybercrime.  Left unchecked, criminal use of the  Internet threatens to undermine the  economic opportunity offered by  the digital domain. Like cyberspace,  cybercrime is not confined by  geographic borders.  10  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    As such, Australian individuals, the  private sector and government can be  exposed to threats emanating from  other countries. Working collaboratively  with international partners and helping  countries in our region improve their  capacity to address cybercrime will  improve prevention and prosecution of  cybercrime worldwide.  It is not only criminals who threaten the  online environment. Developments in  cyberspace have created a new arena  in which states can exert influence.  The increasingly complex nature of the  international landscape means that  more and more actors now pursue  strategic goals in the digital domain;  some challenging the international  rules-based order in the process.  Australia is committed to a peaceful and  stable cyberspace. We will cooperate  with international partners to deter  and respond to malicious cyber activity  that endangers international peace,  security and stability. Reaffirming  the application of international law  to cyberspace, adhering to norms of  responsible behaviour in cyberspace  and implementing confidence-building  measures will shape cyberspace as a  landscape for international cooperation  and mutual benefit.  The private sector, civil society,  academia, individuals and government  are all important stakeholders in  cyberspace. A multi-stakeholder  approach to Internet governance, which  places all stakeholders on an equal  footing in Internet governance debates,  best facilitates an open, free and secure  Internet. Better multi-stakeholder  cooperation domestically, regionally  and internationally will preserve  decentralised control of the Internet,  allowing all voices to be heard when   decisions over the policy and technical  management of the Internet are made.  The promotion and protection of human  rights and democratic principles online  is crucial; human rights apply online as  they do offline. The Internet itself has  provided an unparalleled opportunity  for online democratic participation and  the promotion, protection and fulfilment  of human rights. This contributes to  lasting peace, security, freedom and  dignity for all. Governments, the private  sector, civil society and academia must  continue to work together to uphold and  defend human rights online, just as they  do offline.  Beyond the realisation of human rights,  connectivity and the uptake of digital  technologies also act as a profound  enabler of sustainable development and  inclusive economic growth. Innovative  uses of technology, entrepreneurial  activities and the digital upskilling  of workforces have seen economies  transform and societies make great leaps  in development. However, dividends of  the digital age are currently not evenly  experienced. Increasing connectivity and  harnessing digital technologies safely will  accelerate the attainment of sustainable  development objectives, especially in  regions, countries and populations where  digital journeys are only just beginning.  Australia’s International Cyber  Engagement Strategy addresses the  full breadth of these issues, from trade  to cybercrime, from international  security to international cooperation,  and from human rights to sustainable  development. Australia has adopted  a comprehensive and coordinated  approach to cyber affairs. We will achieve  our objectives in cyberspace through  cooperation, creative partnerships and  practical action.  11  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY    DIGITAL TRADE  AUSTRALIA’S GOAL:  Maximise the opportunity for  economic growth and prosperity  through digital trade  TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, AUSTRALIA wILL:  Shape an enabling environment for digital trade, including  through trade agreements, harmonisation of standards,  and implementation of trade facilitation measures  Promote trade and investment opportunities for  Australian digital goods and services    Digital technologies and the Internet are key drivers of  economic growth and innovation. The digital economy  has shifted from a niche sector to an essential part of  the economy. The line between traditional goods and  digital goods is blurring. The Internet makes it easier for  consumers and businesses to trade goods, services and  information around the world.  Digital trade is not just about buying and  selling goods and services online, it is  also the transmission of information and  data across borders. It relies on the use  of digital technologies to facilitate trade  and improve productivity, for example  through simplified customs procedures.  While flows of information and data  may not always be for profit, they are  essential enablers of digital trade.  Nowhere is the potential for digital trade  greater than in our region. For the first  time, in 2017 more than 50 per cent of  global Internet users were located in  the Indo-Pacific. Yet, only 46.4 per cent  of households in the Indo-Pacific were  connected to the Internet in 2016, so  there are vast untapped opportunities  for digital trade. Successfully harnessing  this opportunity promises economic  growth for countries in the region as  well as new market opportunities for  Australian businesses.  However, this potential can only be  realised if countries cooperate to  establish an enabling environment for  digital trade. Governments must work  with the private sector and consumer  groups to ensure digital trade policies  and norms and rules foster economic  growth and security. This work must  be practical, evidence-based and  consensus driven. It should be coupled  with international efforts to expand  participation in digital trade across the  Indo-Pacific, which will grow markets  for Australian businesses and broaden  economic development opportunities  for all.  13  dIGITAL TRAdE    Shape an enabling environment for digital trade Australia is committed to actively  shaping global rule-making on digital  trade. Australia will advocate for global  rules that support digitisation of  trade-related practices, build trust and  confidence in the online environment,  and reduce barriers to digital trade.  Global trade rules should support  existing global and regional norms,  principles and guidelines. This  includes those developed through the   United Nations (UN), the World Trade  Organization (WTO), the Organisation for  Economic Cooperation and Development  (OECD), the G20, APEC, and international  standards-setting bodies such as  the International Organisation for  Standardisation. Australia engages in  these multilateral forums to cooperate on  practical steps that promote digital trade,  sharing best practice, and addressing  emerging policy issues.  ENABLE GREATER ACCESS TO GLOBAL MARKETS AND A MORE CERTAIN  REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT  In addition to influencing trade rules  through key international forums,  Australia has included ‘electronic  commerce’ chapters in 10 of its 11  concluded free trade agreements.  Australia is currently pursuing  commitments on digital trade in our  bilateral negotiations with Indonesia,  Hong Kong and Peru, and with countries  participating in the negotiations for  a Regional Comprehensive Economic  Partnership and the Trade in  Services Agreement.  International rules that facilitate the  free flow of information and data across  borders are also important for promoting  digital trade. Data flows now have  generated a greater impact on global  gross domestic product growth than  the global trade in goods. As customs  duties on electronic transmissions may  restrict the growth of online trade,  Australia is committed to a permanent  moratorium on customs duties on  electronic transmissions.  dIGITAL TRAdE IN THE wORLd TRAdE ORGANIZATION  The World Trade Organization (WTO) is the key multilateral organisation governing  international trade. Through its membership, Australia pursues commitments that  improve market access for businesses and increase consumer choice, including in  digital trade. Australia supports crucial WTO agreements on goods, services and  intellectual property, including the Agreement on Trade Facilitation (TFA). Australia also  supports the adoption of agreements that encourage WTO members to take on further  digital trade and trade facilitation commitments. These include the WTO Information  Technology Agreement (ITA) and the Telecommunications Reference Paper.   14  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    Australia promotes trade enabling rules  and the free flow of information. But we  recognise the importance of allowing  governments to respond to legitimate  public policy concerns, including  consumer and privacy protections.   Australia encourages international  partners to do so transparently and with  appropriate consultation (see Support  Transparency and Evidence-based Policy  Positions, page 20).  TABLE 1: This table outlines some of the key provisions Australia pursues in its trade  agreements to enable digital trade. These objectives are general, may change in specific  negotiations and are negotiated in the context that we are able to accommodate our  policy sensitivities, including in regard to health, environment, consumer and privacy  protections, and security.  Provision Description   Paperless trading Countries should provide for online availability of  import and export documentation and electronic  submission of those documents  Electronic authentication Countries should not deny a signature on the basis  it is in electronic form, and should adopt a flexible  approach to authentication technologies  Online consumer  protection  Countries should provide the same protections for  online consumers as they do for any other consumer  Online protection of  personal information  Countries should adopt or maintain a legal framework  to protect the personal information of electronic  commerce users from unauthorised disclosure  Unsolicited commercial  electronic messages  (spam)  Countries should adopt or maintain measures to  allow consumers to opt out of receiving unwanted  commercial messages (for example email and SMS)  from various sources and to provide that businesses  only send such messages with the expressed or  inferred consent of the consumer with the source of  the messages identified  Customs duties on  electronic transmissions  Countries should continue the practice of not applying  customs duties to electronic transmissions  Domestic regulatory  frameworks / domestic  electronic transaction  frameworks  Countries should adopt or maintain legal frameworks  consistent with the principles of the UN Commission  on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) Model Law on  Electronic Commerce (1996) and the UN Convention on  the Use of Electronic Communications in International  Contracts (2005)   15  dIGITAL TRAdE    Provision Description   Localisation of computing  facilities  Countries should not require businesses operating in  their territory to locate computing facilities (including  computer servers and storage devices for processing  or storing information for commercial use) within the  country’s borders  Cross-border transfer of  information by electronic  means  Countries should allow cross-border transfers of  information by electronic means  Disclosure of source code Countries should not require the transfer of or access  to mass-market software source code as a condition  for the import, distribution, sale or use of software   Cooperation Governments should cooperate on areas of mutual  interest in digital trade including on cyber security  matters  Elimination of customs  duties on technological  products  Countries should eliminate customs duties on  technological business and consumer products  through participation in the Information Technology  Agreement, or products covered by that agreement  Trade facilitation  commitments  Countries should continue to implement commitments  made in the Trade Facilitation Agreement and  endeavour to build on those commitments to ensure  the efficient movement of goods across borders  Commitments  on performance  requirements  Countries should not require technological transfers as  a condition of investing in another country  16  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    AUSTRALIA WILL:  1.01  Advocate for further digital trade liberalisation and facilitation through free  trade agreements and participation in the WTO, OECD, APEC and G20  HARMONISE STANDARDS  An enabling environment for digital  trade requires clear standards.  Australia’s interests in the development  of standards is discussed in the Cyber  Security chapter. However, developing  these standards in isolation will not  achieve the desired outcome. Standards  need to be harmonised between  countries to improve the conditions for  global digital trade by making it easier to  do business across borders.  Just like global trade rules, international  standards need to be industry-led  and technology-neutral. In particular,   Australia supports the development of  globally interoperable Internet standards  and associated reference architecture,  as well as ISO 27000 Information Security  Management Systems standards.  To reduce the need for burdensome  regulation, Australia also supports  increased cooperation between national  standards bodies and regulatory  agencies across the Indo-Pacific.  Australia will further reduce barriers  to trade by proactively harmonising  standards and promoting international  trade across the Indo-Pacific.  AUSTRALIA WILL:  1.02  Support capacity building projects in the Indo‑Pacific to encourage the  harmonisation of international standards for digital goods, building trust  and confidence in digital trade  17  dIGITAL TRAdE    TRADE FACILITATION  Australia supports practices that improve  the efficiency of trade conducted  electronically, including through the use  of digital technologies, such as paperless  trading and electronic authentication  (see Table 1, page 15). Australia will  continue to support trade facilitation in   key international forums. This includes  exploring the trade-enabling and  cost reduction potential of emerging  technologies such as Blockchain.  Australia also recognises that strong  cyber security builds trust in cyberspace  and facilitates digital trade.  AUSTRALIA WILL:  1.03  Oppose barriers to digital trade and advocate for implementation of the  WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement through bilateral representations and  involvement with WTO committees and councils, APEC and the G20  1.04  Design and trial an electronic Secure Trade Lane with New Zealand to  provide benefits for trusted traders in both countries  SUPPORT REGULATORY COOPERATION  Regulators are responsible for ensuring  fairness and transparency in markets and  establishing an enabling environment for  digital innovation. Cooperation between  regulators is important for supporting  digital trade. It can build trust and  overcome uncertainty and other barriers   to the growth of digital trade. Regulatory  cooperation in the financial technology  sector is already underway and has  yielded early successes (see International  Efforts of the Australian Securities and  Investment Commission, page 19).  18  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS OF THE AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES ANd  INVESTMENTS COMMISSION (ASIC)  Within the Financial Technology (FinTech) sector, ASIC has formal innovator business  referral arrangements with its counterparts in the United Kingdom, Singapore, Malaysia,  Japan and Hong Kong. ASIC also has information sharing agreements with Kenya’s  Capital Markets Authority and ASIC’s Indonesian counterpart, Otoritas Jasa Keuangan  (OJK). These agreements enhance Australian capacity building programs in the region,  specifically the Australia-Indonesia Partnership for Economic Governance, through direct  regulator-to-regulator transfer of knowledge and experience. ASIC has also provided  assistance via multilateral programs such as the Mekong Business Initiative and the APEC  Financial Regulators Training Initiative, and through direct participation in the inaugural  FinTech Regulation Bootcamp held in Singapore in October 2016.  AUSTRALIA WILL:  1.05  Promote regulatory cooperation and coherence through Australia’s bilateral  exchanges, the Australian free trade agreement agenda, Aid for Trade  activities, as well as engagement in APEC and G20  19  dIGITAL TRAdE    SUPPORT TRANSPARENCY AND EVIDENCE-BASED POLICY POSITIONS  Australia is committed to leading by  example on stakeholder consultation  and transparency in policy-making.  Appropriate multi-stakeholder  consultations help ensure well-targeted  policy responses to the challenges  and opportunities of digitisation.  Australia will continue to hold regular  consultations with industry on digital  trade and invite submissions from the  private sector when developing new  digital trade rules. Similarly, Australia  encourages other countries to consult   with businesses when developing new  trade laws and policies.  More work needs to be done to  accurately measure digital trade.  Understanding the current uptake of  digital technologies by micro, small and  medium enterprises, and the barriers  to their digital participation, will better  inform policy. Australia is committed  to working towards internationally  consistent and robust measurement of  digital trade.  AUSTRALIA WILL:  1.06  Support public‑private engagement on emerging digital trade issues in  multilateral forums, including the Business 20 and the APEC Business  Advisory Council  1.07  Support the G20, OECD and other international research to improve digital  trade measurement and develop policy responses  1.08  Encourage transparency from bilateral partners on domestic legislation that  could restrict trade, including through cyber policy dialogues  20  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    Promote trade and investment opportunities  for Australian digital goods and services  Australia actively promotes its digital  goods and services internationally to  maximise opportunities for Australian  businesses in the booming global  digital economy. To attract foreign  investment, Australia leverages its global  reputation as a trusted and secure place  to do business, with robust domestic  safeguards, a well-developed services  economy and a quality education system.  To maximise international digital  trade opportunities for Australian  businesses, Australia will develop a  whole-of-Government digital economy  strategy, led by the Department of  Industry, Innovation and Science.  Austrade will also create a practical guide  for Australian companies exporting in the  digital economy. These documents will  be developed in close consultation with  the private sector.  PRIVATE SECTOR ENGAGEMENT ON dIGITAL TRAdE  The private sector is at the centre of Australia’s digital trade efforts. To inform  Australia’s digital trade promotional activities, the Australian Government will consult  closely with the private sector. In addition to consulting with large multi-nationals  through APEC and the G20, the Ambassador for Cyber Affairs will establish industry  consultations and workshops, including an Industry Advisory Group focused on  Australia’s international cyber engagement (see the Comprehensive and Coordinated  Cyber Affairs chapter).   AUSTRALIA WILL:  1.09  Develop a guide to exporting in the digital economy, providing practical  advice for maximising international opportunities for Australian businesses  1.10  Develop a national digital economy strategy, which will position Australia to  embrace the opportunities presented by digital trade  21  dIGITAL TRAdE    CYBER SECURITY  AUSTRALIA’S GOAL:  A strong and resilient cyber  security posture for Australia,  the Indo-Pacific and the global  community  TO ACHIEVE THIS AUSTRALIA wILL:  Maintain strong cyber security relationships with  international partners  Encourage innovative cyber security solutions and  deliver world leading cyber security advice  Develop regional cyber security capability  Promote Australia’s cyber security industry    Cyber security provides the foundation for the  achievement of Australia’s entire cyber affairs agenda.  Cyber security is an important theme of every part of this  Strategy. This chapter addresses the specific activities  that Australia undertakes internationally to achieve a  strong and resilient cyber security posture for Australia,  the Indo-Pacific and the global community.  The objective of strong cyber security is  to enable access to online information  by individuals, governments and  businesses, while ensuring the  information and the systems that  underpin it are protected from  unauthorised access, removal or change.  This increases the trust and confidence  of users, which will underpin continued  investment in innovative technologies,  driving continued economic growth.  Australia cannot act in isolation.  Collaborative networks with international  partners are critical to combatting global  threats. Cyber security is strengthened  by a dynamic domestic cyber security  industry that is active internationally.  This in turn will help grow Australia as  a hub for international cyber security  research and education. Australia’s  trusted international relationships will  foster a readiness to share information  and best practice, and cooperate to solve  technical problems.  CYBER SECURITY  Cyber security encapsulates measures relating to the confidentiality, availability and  integrity of information that is processed, stored and communicated by electronic or  similar means.  23  CYBER SECURITY    Maintain strong relationships with  international partners  Engaging internationally to strengthen  the collective cyber security of Australia,  the Indo-Pacific and the broader  global community is a key objective  for Australia. The global nature of the  Internet means that cyber threats  emerging anywhere in the world can  impact Australia. Our international  engagement will seek to build Australia’s  knowledge and capabilities and to  enhance the cyber security posture of  international partners, particularly those  with extensive economic, diplomatic and  social links with Australia. By improving  the cyber security of our partners, we  strengthen our own cyber defences.  Sharing cyber security information with  international partners builds strong  collective understanding of threats.  It also improves our combined ability  to prevent, detect, analyse, respond,  mitigate and recover from cyber security  threats and incidents. Building trusted  international cyber security threat  sharing networks gives Australia and  our partners the best possible chance of  staying ahead of malicious actors.  Through the Australian Cyber Security  Centre (ACSC), Australia engages  with international cyber security  organisations, law enforcement agencies  and industry partners. This cooperatively  develops our collective cyber resilience,  and assists law enforcement agencies to  investigate cybercrimes.  Computer Emergency Response Teams  (CERTs) and cyber security centres  around the world work to protect and  respond to incidents affecting systems  of national interest. Partners are able  to build a trusted community where  indicators of compromise and threat  information are shared – preferably  automatically. This ensures that all  members of trusted information sharing  networks are well-placed to take  informed actions in their respective  domestic contexts.  This cooperation is framed by Australia’s  suite of cyber policy dialogues with  a range of international partners  including China, India, Indonesia, Japan,  New Zealand and South Korea.  THE AUSTRALIAN CYBER SECURITY CENTRE’S INTERNATIONAL  CYBER ENGAGEMENT EFFORTS  The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) brings together cyber security capabilities  across the Australian Government to enable a more complete understanding of  sophisticated cyber threats, facilitate faster and more effective response to significant  cyber incidents, and foster better interaction between government and industry  partners. The ACSC engages with international partner organisations to share cyber  threat information, to cooperate on operational responses to major cyber incidents  and to work collaboratively on best practice mitigations.   24  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    Australia has established cyber security  information sharing arrangements with a  variety of strategic international partners  across the public sector, private sector  and research communities. These include  bilateral agreements and memoranda of  understanding, engagement between  intelligence agencies, national cyber  security centres, industry bodies, cyber  security researchers, and participation in  regional and international forums.  Australia will continue to strengthen  and expand our network of strategic  information sharing partners, both  providing and receiving information to  enhance the cyber security posture of  Australia and the cyber security of our  international partners. The establishment  of Joint Cyber Security Centres and  the relocation of the ACSC to a new  purpose-built facility will facilitate  improved collaboration and more  integrated partnerships.  The ACSC through CERT Australia,  Australia’s national CERT, works closely  with industry partners to protect  domestic critical infrastructure and  other systems of national interest.  To facilitate this, CERT Australia has  a number of key operational level  relationships with bilateral partners  and multilateral forums. Australia’s  international CERT relationships enable  the trusted sharing of threat information  and the joint development of tools   and techniques to prevent, detect,  analyse, respond, mitigate and recover  from cyber incidents. This global CERT  network supports the ACSC’s capability  to respond to cyber incidents and assists  domestic industry partners to take  proactive cyber security measures.  CERT Australia is committed to  strengthening and expanding its  network of CERT relationships in the  Indo-Pacific and more broadly to secure  Australia’s critical infrastructure and  other systems of national interest.  Australia is committed to participating in  coordinated global efforts to strengthen  global CERT capacity – both sharing our  expertise and learning from others.  While the structure, mandates and  constituencies of national CERTs  may differ, they also have many  commonalities. They are operationally  focused and staffed by cyber security  professionals with the technical  expertise to respond to cyber incidents.  A key role for a national CERT is to be  a main operational point of contact  during an international cyber incident,  assisting in the conduct of coordinated  incident response.  International collaboration at this  technical operationally focused level  ensures the ACSC can perform incident  response activities in Australia quickly  and effectively.  25  CYBER SECURITY    ASIA PACIFIC COMPUTER EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM  The Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT) is a grouping  of leading and national CERTs and Computer Security Incident Response Teams  dedicated to the protection of national infrastructure in the Asia Pacific. It is just one  example of economies collaborating to build collective incident response capability in  order to prevent, detect, analyse, respond, mitigate and recover from cyber incidents.  APCERT has an operational focus with objectives to help create a safe and reliable  cyberspace in the Asia Pacific through global collaboration. CERT Australia currently  chairs the APCERT Steering Committee and, with the other APCERT members,  participates in an annual APCERT drill and other capacity building activities.  AUSTRALIA WILL:  2.01  Strengthen and expand Australia’s strategic international cyber security  information sharing partners and trusted networks  2.02  Strengthen and expand Australia’s network of CERT relationships, especially  in the Indo‑Pacific  2.03  Be a prominent contributor to the APCERT community  26  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    Encourage innovative cyber security solutions  and deliver world leading cyber security advice  ENCOURAGE INNOVATIVE CYBER SECURITY SOLUTIONS  Increasing connectivity, and the  proliferation of devices connected to  the Internet (the Internet of Things),  highlights the importance of security as  a fundamental driver in the design and  delivery of information communication  and technology (ICT) products, systems  and services. Australians use digital  products and services from all over the  world. There is still much work to be  done internationally to promote the  development of ICT products, systems  and services that are secure by design.  Cyber security experts in the ACSC  engage with the leading innovators  and technical experts in the ICT vendor  community to share expertise. ACSC  experts also promote cyber security as  a fundamental element in the design of   new products, systems and services.  These partnerships inform cyber security  technical advice produced by the ACSC,  as well as improving the cyber security  functionality within new products,  systems and services.  Australia will continue the evaluation  of the security of ICT products through  the Australasian Information Security  Evaluation Program’s involvement  in the Common Criteria Recognition  Arrangement (ISO/IEC 15408 Common  Criteria for Information Technology  Security Evaluation). We will also support  the efforts of standards bodies, including  work by Standards Australia (see  below) on the ISO/IEC 27000 series of  information security standards.  STANdARdS AUSTRALIA  The development and application of international standards play a key role in improving the  quality and cyber security of digital products, systems and services across the globe, and  assist in protecting governments, business and consumers alike.   Standards Australia, as a member of the International Organization for Standardization  (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), contributes to developing  international standards. These standards are designed to enhance the security of information  technology systems, networks and critical online infrastructures. This work is carried out  through ISO’s Technical Committees (TCs) and Joint Technical Committees (JTCs).  Australia’s contribution in this area includes leading development of international standards  for ISO/TC 307 Blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies. We also work with other  ISO/IEC JTC One members on cloud computing and distributed platforms and information  technology security techniques.  27  CYBER SECURITY    DELIVER WORLD LEADING CYBER SECURITY ADVICE  Australia produces world leading cyber  security advice and best practice, which,  if implemented, enhances the cyber  security of individuals, businesses  and governments. This includes the   Information Security Manual, Strategies  to Mitigate Cyber Security Incidents  and its Essential Eight, as well as the  Stay Smart Online guidelines for small  businesses and individuals.  THE AUSTRALIAN SIGNALS dIRECTORATE’S ESSENTIAL EIGHT  ASD has developed the Essential Eight strategies to mitigate cyber security incidents.  This framework provides helpful practices that organisations can implement in their  everyday operations to improve their cyber security.  Through its international cyber security  engagement and partnerships with the  private sector, Australia will promote the  adoption of best practice cyber security  advice to raise the bar for international  cyber security, enhancing the cyber  resilience of our international partners.   As a first step, Australia will translate and  publish ASD’s Essential Eight mitigation  strategies and its companion documents  into the official languages of the 10  member states of the Association of  Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).  AUSTRALIA WILL:  2.04  Promote cyber security as a fundamental input to the design and delivery  of information and communication technologies products, systems and  services  2.05  Support the development of international standards that improve cyber  security and encourage harmonisation of standards for digital products  2.06  Publish translations of ASD’s Essential Eight strategies and companion  implementation documents in the official languages of ASEAN members  28  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    Develop regional cyber security capability Australia is committed to assisting  partners in the Indo-Pacific develop  their capacity to address cyber  threats, strengthen cyber security  and combat cybercrime through the  Cyber Cooperation Program (see the  Comprehensive & Coordinated Cyber  Affairs chapter). Increasing connectivity  in the Indo-Pacific is a force for significant  social and economic development  and inclusion. However, increased  connectivity also has the potential to  expose the region to increased threats  from malicious cyber actors.  Recognising the importance of cyber  resilience, and with the understanding  that not every country in our region  has the capacity to establish a cyber  security capability such as a national  CERT, Australia will work with our Pacific   neighbours to establish a Pacific Cyber  Security Operational Network (PaCSON).  The PaCSON network will consist of  technical experts from respective  governments across the Pacific, and  will be supported by other partners  including not-for-profit organisations  and academia. PaCSON will establish  operational cyber security points of  contact. It will empower members to  share cyber security threat information;  provide opportunities for technical  experts to share tools, techniques and  ideas; and be an enabler of cooperation  and collaboration, particularly if a cyber  security incident affects the region.  Further, it is envisaged that PaCSON will  provide members with a toolkit for cyber  security incident response and assist  with cyber security awareness raising  activities across the Pacific.  AUSTRALIA WILL:  2.07  Work with regional partners in the Pacific to establish PaCSON  29  CYBER SECURITY    Promote Australia’s cyber security industry  EXPORT AUSTRALIAN CYBER SECURITY SOLUTIONS  Australia is committed to growing a  vibrant cyber security sector in response  to the increasing domestic and regional  demand for cyber security solutions.  Australia has designated the cyber  security sector as a key sector for  export promotion. We are committed  to increasing the number of Australian  cyber security companies operating  successfully in global markets.  Australia is collaborating with  private sector partners, including the  Australian Cyber Security Growth  Network (AustCyber), to develop a  deeper understanding of Australian  cyber security capabilities and market  demands. AustCyber, an industry-led  not-for-profit company, is part of the  Australian Government’s $250 million  Industry Growth Centres Initiative and  the 2016 Cyber Security Strategy. It plays  a key role in supporting the development  of national cyber security capability by  helping Australia’s cyber security sector   overcome challenges to innovation,  productivity and growth.  There are particular sectors where  Australia already has comparative  advantages in cyber security capability,  which are described in Australia’s Cyber  Security Sector Competitiveness Plan.  To promote these sectors, Australia will  proactively identify opportunities in key  overseas markets, lead trade delegations  to these key markets, and encourage the  use of Landing Pads (see below).  Australia supports the responsible export  of cyber security solutions. To help  promote responsible export worldwide,  Australia actively supports international  export control regimes such as the  Wassenaar Arrangement. To help foster  cyber innovation and good cyber security  practice, Australia has led the discussion  with Wassenaar Participating States to  ease export restrictions on cyber security  technology for defensive purposes.  LANdING PAdS  As part of the National Innovation and Science Agenda, Austrade has established five  Landing Pads in Berlin, San Francisco, Shanghai, Singapore and Tel Aviv. Landing Pads  provide market-ready Australian start-ups/scale-ups with access to some of the world’s most  renowned innovation and start-up ecosystems. Participating start-ups/scale-ups have a  short-term operational base for up to 90 days, where they will benefit from Austrade’s global  network of contacts and tailored business development assistance. The Landing Pads are  situated in leading co-working spaces in each location.   Austrade is conducting a pilot program focused on cyber security start-ups and scale-ups in the  San Francisco Landing Pad from January to April 2018. This activity is designed to build on the  success of the Australian cyber security mission to San Francisco Bay Area in February 2017.   30  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    ATTRACT FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT TO AUSTRALIA’S CYBER  SECURITY SECTOR  Producing world-class cyber security  research is one of Australia’s national  science and research priorities, as set out  in the National Innovation and Science  Agenda. We will continue to promote  Australia as a location of choice for global  cyber security companies looking to  establish a base in the Indo-Pacific, and  as a leading centre for cyber education  and research.  Australia has identified cyber security  and related digital technologies as a  target sector for attracting investment.  As part of its strategy to promote, attract  and facilitate productive foreign direct  investment, the Australian Government   will continue to work collaboratively  with state and territory governments  to provide qualified potential investors  with information on the Australian  business and regulatory environment,  market intelligence and investment  opportunities, and advice on government  programs and approval processes.  Australia will work through AustCyber  to showcase our cyber security industry  capabilities through an Australian  Cyber Week. Annual workshops will  follow thereafter to agree priority areas  of focus in line with annual updates  to Australia’s Cyber Security Sector  Competitiveness Plan.  AUSTRALIA WILL:  2.08  Showcase Australia’s cyber security capabilities to international customers  and investors, including through delivery of an annual Australian Cyber Week  2.09  Promote and encourage cyber security start‑ups through Landing Pads  2.10  Partner with the private sector to host a workshop to co‑design how  Australia promotes its cyber security industry internationally  31  CYBER SECURITY    CYBERCRIME  AUSTRALIA’S GOAL:  Stronger cybercrime prevention,  prosecution and cooperation,  with a particular focus on the  Indo-Pacific  TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, AUSTRALIA wILL:  Raise cybercrime awareness in the Indo-Pacific  Assist Indo-Pacific countries to strengthen their  cybercrime legislation  Deliver cybercrime law enforcement and prosecution  capacity building in the Indo-Pacific  Enhance diplomatic dialogue and international  information sharing on cybercrime    Australia’s economic prosperity and high adoption of  technology mean we will remain an attractive target  for cybercriminals in coming years. Cybercriminals are  constantly adapting and evolving their techniques to  exploit new technologies and defeat network defences.  This tests the capacity of law enforcement agencies to  adapt and respond. Australia will remain vigilant to the  changing cybercrime threat environment in order to  safeguard our economic interests.  As the volume and sophistication of  cybercrime continues to grow, so too  do its costs. It has been estimated  that up to US$1.02 trillion in global  economic growth will not be realised   if we allow cybercrime to undermine  public confidence in the digital domain.  Addressing cybercrime in our region will  create a safer commercial environment in  which businesses can grow.  CYBERCRIME  Cybercrime is a low-risk, high-return criminal enterprise in which individuals and  groups of actors leverage cyberspace for financial gain or other malicious ends.  In Australia, the term cybercrime refers to crimes directed at computers, such as  illegally modifying electronic data or seeking a ransom to unlock a computer affected  by malicious software. It also includes crimes where computers facilitate an existing  offence, such as online fraud or online child sex offences.  33  CYBERCRIME    The vast majority of cybercrime targeting  Australia originates overseas. Cybercrime  is a global threat, but our region is  particularly vulnerable. Countries in  the region lose a third more business  revenue to cybercrime than those in the  European Union or North America.  Collectively, our region is only as resilient  as our weakest link. Cybercriminals look  to exploit the vulnerabilities of states  in the early stages of developing the  legislative and technical capabilities  needed to fight cybercrime. These  cybercrime safe havens are countries  through or from which malicious cyber  actors can conduct criminal operations  with a very low risk of being identified,  arrested, investigated, extradited  or prosecuted.  In 2016, more than half of the world’s  netizens were found in the Indo-Pacific.  But only 1.8 billion of the region’s  4.1 billion people are yet online. This  digital potential combined with the  spread of ICT infrastructure and smart  phone technology will produce a growing  target audience for cybercriminals to  exploit. It is in Australia’s interest to help  our neighbours improve their ability  to prevent and respond to cybercrime.  Doing so will underpin regional economic  growth and create a safer environment in  which Australian businesses can prosper.  Cybercriminals operate globally, so  Australia will respond in kind. We will  deepen bilateral, regional and global  partnerships to increase cooperation  and build our collective capacity  to combat this threat. Cybercrime  is a shared challenge and Australia  encourages other countries to take an  active role in initiatives that address this  international issue.  Collaborative efforts to shut down safe  havens complement Australia’s ongoing  national efforts to protect Australians  from the harm of cybercriminals. The  2016 Cyber Security Strategy committed  the Government to enhance Australia’s  ability to respond to cyber security  threats, including cybercrime. In 2017,  the Government directed the Australian  Signals Directorate (ASD) to use its  offensive cyber capabilities to disrupt,  degrade, deny and deter organised  offshore cybercriminals. This capability  is subject to stringent oversight, and  consistent with domestic law and  our obligations under international  law. Strong cyber defences and law  enforcement measures will continue to  sit at the forefront of our response to  cybercrime threats.  Australia embraces a comprehensive  strategy of strong cyber defences,  regional capacity building and national  law enforcement efforts in its fight  against cybercrime.  34  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    Raise cybercrime awareness in the Indo-Pacific Individuals are at risk of falling victim  to cybercrime if they don’t understand  online risks and the techniques used  by cybercriminals. For this reason,  public education, awareness and the  development of basic cyber skills is  a fundamental building block in the  prevention of cybercrime, and an  essential first step in undermining the  success of cybercriminals in our region.  Increasing connectivity in the Indo-Pacific  means that our region is home to a vast  number of first-time Internet users.  As these new users come online, it is  important that they are equipped with  the awareness needed to enjoy the  benefits of the Internet safely. Cyber  security education is necessary to inform  people of good cyber security practices,  such as avoiding the use of pirated  software that cybercriminals can exploit  to gain access to personal devices.  Australia is committed to improving  cybercrime awareness levels in our  region. Cyber Safety Pasifika (CSP) is a  cyber safety and cybercrime education  program led by the Australian Federal  Police (AFP). CSP delivers cyber  awareness to Pacific Island countries,  including Tonga, Nauru, Cook Islands,  Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall  Islands, Papua New Guinea, Samoa,  Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.  CSP provides cybercrime awareness  materials and ‘train-the-trainer’ initiatives  to ensure Pacific communities are  equipped to identify cybercrime risks and  engage safely online. Thanks to a 2017  program update, there are now 13 police  officers from nine Pacific countries ready  to train their colleagues and deliver up to  date cybercrime education curriculums  to schools and community groups across  the region.  PRIVATE SECTOR ENGAGEMENT ON CYBERCRIME  AwARENESS RAISING  The private sector has an important role to play in raising cybercrime awareness.  Australian companies doing business around the region are well placed to contribute  their good reputation, invaluable networks of contacts and contextual understanding  to the effort. Australia will create public-private partnerships focused on improving  regional awareness of cybercrime risks. This will not only be an important force  multiplier but will also reinforce the message that cybercrime is a joint challenge that  government and business must address together.   AUSTRALIA WILL:  3.01  Deliver cybercrime awareness training across the Indo‑Pacific through  public‑private partnerships and the refreshed Cyber Safety Pasifika program  35  CYBERCRIME    Assist Indo-Pacific countries to strengthen their  cybercrime legislation  Raising public awareness will not prevent  all cybercrime. Another effective way  to respond to cybercrime is through  a combination of stronger domestic  legislative frameworks within countries  and greater harmonisation of cybercrime  legislation between countries.  Australia is committed to working  with partners in the region to help  strengthen their legal frameworks to  address cybercrime. Robust cybercrime  legal frameworks increase the risk of  prosecution for would-be cybercriminals.   Strengthening cybercrime legislation  raises the cost of ‘business’ for  cybercriminals and is an important way  of preventing cybercrime safe havens in  our region.  Similarly, Australia advocates for the  harmonisation of legal frameworks – that  is, having similar conduct criminalised in  all jurisdictions – to facilitate international  cooperation on cybercrime. This ensures  that criminals cannot evade justice by  simply crossing borders.  THE BUDAPEST CONVENTION  Australia has been a party to the Council  of Europe Convention on Cybercrime  (the Budapest Convention) since 2013. It  is a valuable mechanism to strengthen  international cooperation on cybercrime,  particularly through its provisions on  mutual legal assistance. Countries are  able to work together more effectively  on trans-border investigations and  prosecutions when domestic legal and  law enforcement operational frameworks  are harmonised in line with the  provisions of the Budapest Convention.  Reciprocal arrangements such as mutual  legal assistance and intelligence sharing  continue to be a critical mechanism  for combatting cybercrime. Australia  is keen to work with other countries to  streamline these processes.  Australia works with countries in the  region interested in acceding to the  Budapest Convention by helping them  achieve the required legislative reform.  For example, substantial support from   the Attorney-General’s Department  contributed to Tonga’s recent accession  to the Convention (see Supporting  Stronger Cyber Crime Legislation in  Tonga, page 37).  Australia will actively participate in  the development of an Additional  Protocol to the Budapest Convention  on trans-border access to information.  The Protocol will further articulate  cooperation requirements between  jurisdictions on providing access  to electronic information, within  appropriate conditions and safeguards.  This will facilitate more effective  mutual legal assistance through direct  cooperation with service providers  and between judicial authorities,  joint investigation frameworks, and  development of emergency assistance  procedures. Australia is a member of the  Drafting Group for the establishment of  the Additional Protocol.  36  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    SUPPORTING STRONGER CYBERCRIME LEGISLATION IN TONGA   Australia worked closely with Tonga to strengthen its legislative capacity to respond to  cybercrime threats and meet the obligations of the Budapest Convention by:   • facilitating a gap analysis of Tonga’s legislation against the requirements of the  Budapest Convention with an official from Tonga’s Attorney General’s Office (AGO) in  2014 through the Pacific Legal Policy Development Twinning Program;   • working with Tonga’s AGO to draft a Computer Crimes Bill that ensured Tonga’s  legislation met its obligations under the Budapest Convention; and  • assisting Tonga’s AGO with its consultations on the new Computer Crimes Bill prior to  its introduction to Parliament during 2017.   Assisted by this collaboration, on 9 May 2017 Tonga became the first Pacific Island country to  accede to the Budapest Convention. Tonga’s experience and new legislative framework will  provide a valuable model for other countries in the region.  PACIFIC ISLANDS LAW OFFICERS’ NETWORK  Australia is also helping regional  neighbours strengthen their cybercrime  legislation by working with the Pacific  Islands Law Officers’ Network (PILON).  PILON is a network of senior law officers  from across the region that addresses  law and justice issues common to  Pacific countries. PILON’s Strategic Plan  2016–2018 recognises cybercrime as a  priority legal issue. Through the network,  Australia advocates for the broad  adoption of the Pacific Forensic Model  Provisions, which provide a consistent  framework for the collection and use  of electronic evidence. Australia will  support future PILON activities in this  area, building on its funding of the Pacific  Cybercrime Workshop held in Tonga  during May 2017 in partnership with  PILON, the Tongan Government, and the  Council of Europe.  This initiative is complemented by the  2017 expansion of Cyber Safety Pasifika  (CSP). The program now includes  legislation and policy development  activities, with Australia working in  partnership with PILON and the Pacific  Islands Chiefs of Police.  Australia will also support the Council  of Europe’s Global Action on Cybercrime  Extended capacity building project  (GLACY+) and Cybercrime@Octopus  project that supports the adoption  and implementation of the Budapest  Convention in the Indo-Pacific.  37  CYBERCRIME    AUSTRALIA WILL:  3.02  Promote the Budapest Convention as a best practice model for legislative  responses to cybercrime and support accession to the Convention across  the Indo‑Pacific  3.03  Be active in the negotiation of an Additional Protocol to the Budapest  Convention on trans‑border access to information  3.04  Work with PILON to help strengthen cybercrime legislation in the region  38  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    Deliver cybercrime law enforcement and  prosecution capacity building in the Indo-Pacific  Cybercrime legislation is not effective  without the ability to enforce it. Australia  is safer when countries in our region have  the capacity to respond to cybercrime.  Australia is committed to increasing the  capacity of Indo-Pacific law enforcement  agencies, prosecutors and judges.  The capacity of countries to investigate  and prosecute cybercrime varies greatly  in the Indo-Pacific. While some are  leading in high-tech policing, others have  only a nascent capability. Australia is  working to close that gap.  Through its recently expanded Cyber  Safety Pasifika (CSP) program, the  AFP is actively partnering with law  enforcement agencies in the region   to enhance their capacity to address  cybercrime. In partnership with the  Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI)  Legal Attaché Office in Canberra, the  AFP coordinated a pilot three-day Cyber  Investigations Skills Course for multiple  Pacific Island countries in March 2017.  The pilot, held in Brisbane, equipped 20  participating officers with basic cyber  investigation skills including open source  intelligence techniques. Through CSP,  the AFP will continue to enhance the  skills of Pacific police officers to manage  cybercrime investigations.  The AFP also delivers cyber capacity  building in the region through its  support for the Jakarta Centre for Law  Enforcement Cooperation (see below).  JAKARTA CENTRE FOR LAw ENFORCEMENT COOPERATION (JCLEC)  The JCLEC is a not-for-profit social enterprise in Semarang, Indonesia, jointly owned by  the Indonesian National Police (INP) and the Australian Federal Police (AFP). The centre is  supported by a broad range of public sector, civil society and private sector entities from  across the world. The JCLEC supports global collaborative efforts to minimise the community  harm caused by transnational crime and terrorism.  Since 2004, the JCLEC has facilitated 56 cybercrime capacity building activities for over 1,000  international participants. This has included courses on computer forensics, cybercrime and  social media investigations, intelligence gathering and covert online engagement. Workshops  delivered by the AFP at the centre have elevated INP’s capacity to identify, extract and report  on electronic evidence. This new digital forensic investigation capability means that direct  operational exchanges can take place between INP and AFP leads.  39  CYBERCRIME    In addition to skilled law enforcement,  a country’s prosecution and judiciary  need to be equipped to address  cybercrime cases effectively. Working  together with multilateral partners such  as the United Nations Office on Drugs  and Crime (UNODC) and the Council  of Europe, Australia will support the  delivery of cybercrime training courses  for prosecutors and judges in Indo-Pacific   countries (see Cybercrime Capacity  Building with the United Nations Office  on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)).  In so doing, Australia will deliver a  comprehensive cybercrime capacity  building program to the region,  tackling cybercrime from awareness,  legislation, law enforcement, and  prosecution perspectives.  CYBERCRIME CAPACITY BUILdING wITH THE UNITEd NATIONS  OFFICE ON dRUGS ANd CRIME (UNOdC)  Australia provided funding for UNODC cybercrime capacity building in Southeast Asia. The  five-day training course was delivered in Bangkok during October 2016 to around 30 judges,  prosecutors and investigators. The course was aimed towards ASEAN member countries,  including Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand and  Vietnam. The training focused on cybercrime investigation and prosecution (including  ‘darknet’ and hidden web services), hacking, device imaging, handling/using electronic  evidence and online child sexual exploitation case investigation.   AUSTRALIA WILL:  3.05  Provide cybercrime training to law enforcement officers, prosecutors and  judges across the Indo‑Pacific  40  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    Enhance diplomatic dialogue and international  information sharing on cybercrime  Australia is committed to collaborating  with international partners to fight  cybercrime collectively. Working  together at the diplomatic and   operational levels is critical to ensuring  that cybercriminals have limited  opportunities to exploit cyberspace for  malicious purposes.  DIPLOMATIC DIALOGUE  High-level diplomatic engagement  between Australia and its international  partners on cybercrime helps  generate common understanding  and facilitate closer cooperation  between counterparts. Cybercrime  discussions are prioritised in Australia’s  diplomatic engagements.  Cybercrime was made a permanent  agenda item for the Australia-Indonesia  Ministerial Council on Law and Security  in February 2017, and was a prominent  agenda item at the first Australia-China  High Level Security Dialogue in April 2017.  Australia also engages actively on the  issue in multilateral contexts such as the  Pacific Islands Forum, ASEAN Regional  Forum and East Asia Summit.  Australia and China ‘will  work together to counter  malicious cyber actors, Internet  distribution of child sex abuse  material, e-mail scams and  other transnational cybercrime  activities, as well as to identify  through consultation key  incidents and carry out joint  law enforcements’. Joint Statement Australia-China  High-Level Security Dialogue,  Sydney 2017   PRIVATE SECTOR ENGAGEMENT IN INTERNATIONAL  dIALOGUE ON CYBERCRIME  The international and multi-stakeholder nature of cyberspace necessitates broad  engagement with global and private sector partners in the fight against cybercrime.  The Ambassador for Cyber Affairs will lead delegations to participate in international  public-private sector conversations, for example the 2017 INTERPOL World  Conference in Singapore. These opportunities promote Australia’s cyber security  industry and its positive contribution to the global fight against cybercrime.   41  CYBERCRIME    INFORMATION SHARING AND OPERATIONAL COLLABORATION  Australia complements its high-level  diplomatic efforts with cybercrime  threat information sharing and  cooperation between international  counterparts. This enables Australia and  our partners to build a stronger threat  picture of cybercriminal identities and  methodologies, as well as share best  practice mitigation.  Australia deploys individuals to partner  countries around the globe to deepen  information sharing links. The Australian  Criminal Intelligence Commission (ACIC)  has established two key working-level  cyber partnerships. An ACIC Cybercrime  Analyst is posted at the FBI International  Cyber Crime Coordination Cell in the  United States. Another is posted at the  National Cybercrime Unit at the United  Kingdom’s National Crime Authority.  These deployments enhance ACIC’s  ability to attribute real world identities  to cybercriminals and develop strategic  and operational intelligence products on  cybercrime threats. Similarly, the AFP has  established dedicated cybercrime liaison  positions based in the United States and  United Kingdom.  The Australian Transaction Reports and  Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) recently  established a Cyber Operations team.  This team focuses on the financial  aspects of transnational cyber-enabled  crime, tracking criminal financial  transactions that occur online. The team  harnesses established relationships with  AUSTRAC partner agencies, FinTech  partners and international networks, and  develops new relationships with industry.  AUSTRAC will continue to collaborate  with partner Financial Intelligence Units   (FIUs) and participate in international  forums, including the Egmont Group  of FIUs, to build its capacity to produce  financial intelligence on virtual currencies  and cybercrime.  Australia engages strongly with  multilateral law enforcement information  sharing networks such as INTERPOL  and EUROPOL. The INTERPOL National  Central Bureau Canberra, hosted by  the AFP, is a conduit for the sharing of  cybercrime information and intelligence  with law enforcement agencies in the  190 INTERPOL member countries.  The INTERPOL Global Complex for  Innovation in Singapore also hosts  an AFP Cybercrime Investigator in a  leadership role.  EUROPOL, an intelligence focused  support platform for law enforcement,  hosts the European Cyber Crime Centre  in The Hague in the Netherlands.  Australia seconds an AFP Investigator  to the centre, which targets  technology-enabled serious crime and  cyber disruption. The AFP also has a  dedicated Cybercrime Liaison Officer  based within the EUROPOL Joint  Cybercrime Action Task Force. These  secondees provide expert support to  international efforts, as well as sourcing  cybercrime threat information for  Australian agencies on a regular basis.  Australia also participates in practical  cybercrime cooperation mechanisms  such as the International Cyber Crime  Operations Summit (ICCOS). This  initiative aims to degrade high-level  cybercrime capabilities through  information sharing and operational  collaboration. The ICCOS membership   42  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    includes Australia, the United States,  United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand,  Germany, Netherlands, France and  EUROPOL. The collaborative group was  responsible for the takedown of the  Avalanche cybercriminal infrastructure  in December 2016, judged to be the  largest and most successful international  operation of its kind to date.  The Five Eyes Law Enforcement Group  Cyber Crime Working Group, held in  conjunction with the ICCOS, is another  framework through which Australia  cooperates on cybercrime. Through  the group, the United States, United  Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and  Australia share operating pictures and  best practice approaches, maximise  resources and act as an operational force  multiplier in the fight against cybercrime.  AUSTRALIA WILL:  3.06  Seek further opportunities to participate in strategic‑level engagement on  combatting transnational cybercrime  3.07  Share cybercrime threat information and enhance operational collaboration  with international partners to fight transnational cybercrime  43  CYBERCRIME    INTERNATIONAL  SECURITY & CYBERSPACE  AUSTRALIA’S GOAL:  A stable and peaceful online  environment  TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL AUSTRALIA wILL:  Set clear expectations for state behaviour in cyberspace  Implement practical confidence building measures to  prevent conflict  Deter and respond to unacceptable behaviour in  cyberspace    The history of international security and warfare  reflects the history of technological innovation.  Today, cyberspace is an increasingly important area  for cooperation and competition between states.  As the strategic significance of cyberspace increases,  more groups will try to exert power through it. Likewise,  as dependence on global ICT networks increases,  the potential costs of disruption are large, and growing.  Malicious activity in cyberspace has the  potential to threaten international peace,  security and stability. A large scale cyber  attack on critical infrastructure would  have severe implications for international  security. However, international peace,  security and stability could be equally  threatened by the cumulative effect  of repeated low-level malicious online  behaviour. It is the scale and effect of  the activity, not necessarily the actor,  means or method that determine its  malicious nature.  Australia is committed to a peaceful  and stable cyberspace. We recognise  that, as more and more states seek to  exert power through cyberspace, there  is increased potential for activities in  this domain to lead to misperception,  miscalculation, escalation and, in the  most extreme cases, conflict between  states. Australia will be stronger when  we manage these risks in cooperation  with international partners.  Australia seeks a more mature and  transparent conversation about what  states are doing in cyberspace. In the  face of clear evidence to the contrary,   it is no longer plausible to simply deny  that states are active in cyberspace.  Recognition that states have legitimate  rights to develop and use cyber  capabilities must go hand in hand with  recognition that states are obliged to  ensure their use of cyber capabilities  accords with international law and norms  of acceptable behaviour.  Acknowledgement that states are  developing cyber capabilities does not  contradict Australia’s commitment to  maintaining a peaceful and stable online  environment. Rather, acknowledging the  existence of these capabilities fosters  the understanding that, just like in the  physical domains, states’ activities in  cyberspace do not occur in a vacuum.  States have rights, but they also  have obligations.  Good progress has been made in  delineating the boundaries of what  is and isn’t acceptable behaviour by  states in cyberspace. But some states  are testing, and even crossing, those  boundaries. It is important that there are  consequences for those who act contrary  to this consensus.  45  INTERNATIONAL SECURITY & CYBERSPACE    The 2016 Presidential Election  in the United States focused the  world’s attention on the potential for  cyber-enabled information operations to  interfere with processes underpinning  democracy. Such actions have particular  implications for connected, open and  democratic societies like Australia. This  behaviour is unacceptable. We will guard  against attempts to use such measures  to interfere in Australia’s domestic  affairs or undermine our institutions.  More broadly, Australia will cooperate  with international partners to deter and  respond to malicious cyber activity that   endangers international peace, security  and stability.  In parallel to Australia’s engagement in  international security and cyberspace,  the Government is enhancing  cooperation with international partners  to detect and limit terrorist and other  misuse of the Internet as a tool to recruit  and radicalise. International efforts in this  regard are led by Australia’s Ambassador  for Counter-Terrorism in close  cooperation with the Attorney-General’s  Department’s Countering Violent  Extremism Centre.  46  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    Set clear expectations for state behaviour  in cyberspace  International law has developed over  centuries. It comprises rules and  principles that, inter alia, govern relations  between states. While the domain may  be comparatively new, the rules are not.  International law applies in cyberspace.  The unique attributes of cyberspace  mean that existing international law can  be usefully complemented by agreed  norms of behaviour. Alongside states’  international legal obligations, these  non-binding norms establish clear  expectations of proper state behaviour  in cyberspace.  INTERNATIONAL LAW APPLIES TO CYBERSPACE  As observed above, international law  applies to states’ conduct in cyberspace  just as it applies to states’ conduct  in the physical domains. The existing  international legal framework helps  reduce the risk of conflict by articulating  clear obligations for how states interact.  In some instances, it is useful to clarify  how particular rules, principles and  bodies of international law apply to  states’ conduct in cyberspace. Much  of the hard work is already done, but  this continues to be a work in progress  – particularly as digital technologies  continue to evolve at a rapid pace.  CYBER ATTACK  The Australian Government defines cyber attack as a deliberate act through  cyberspace to manipulate, disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy computers or networks,  or the information resident on them, with the effect of seriously compromising  national security, stability or economic prosperity.  This definition was developed in 2011 after extensive policy and legal consultation.  It was subsequently used to affirm that the provisions of the ANZUS Treaty allow  Australia and the United States to consult each other in the event of a cyber attack on  either party.  47  INTERNATIONAL SECURITY & CYBERSPACE    Australia reaffirms that the United  Nations (UN) Charter applies in its  entirety to state actions in cyberspace,  including the prohibition on the use  of force (Article 2(4)), the peaceful  settlement of disputes (Article 33),  and the inherent right of states to act  in individual or collective self-defence  in response to an armed attack  (Article 51). The international law on  state responsibility applies to cyber  operations, including the availability  of the doctrine of countermeasures  in response to internationally  wrongful acts.  The cumulative reports of the  UN Group of Governmental Experts on  Developments in the Field of Information   and Communication Technologies in  the Context of International Security  (UN Group of Governmental Experts)  have contributed to our collective  understanding of how international law  applies to states’ conduct in cyberspace.  The Tallinn Manuals are also an important  academic contribution to international  legal dialogue in this area.  Australia encourages states to continue  to exchange views on how particular  rules and principles of international law  apply to state conduct in cyberspace.  This will facilitate the development of  deeper understandings and expectations  – not just among states, but also  within the private sector, civil society  and academia.  AUSTRALIA WILL:  4.01  Periodically publish Australia’s position on the application of relevant  international law to state conduct in cyberspace (the first such publication is  at Annex A)  INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ANd THE PRIVATE SECTOR  The stability of cyberspace benefits the private sector and governments, and our  interests in maintaining a peaceful online environment are complementary. A  significant proportion of the world’s Internet infrastructure is owned and operated  by the private sector. This means the private sector is well placed to contribute to  discussions on the practicality of norms, and champion their implementation.   48  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    SUPPORT ROBUST NORMS OF RESPONSIBLE STATE BEHAVIOUR  IN CYBERSPACE  Norms establish clear expectations of  behaviour in specific circumstances by  specific groups. By signalling acceptable  behaviour of states in cyberspace,  norms promote predictability, stability  and security. Norms must be developed  consistent with international law.  Shared understandings of responsible  behaviour also provide the basis for the  international community to respond  when these shared expectations are not  met. Understanding of and adherence  to norms by states increases the  predictability of state actions, thereby  reducing the risk of misunderstandings  that could lead to conflict.  The 2015 Report of the UN Group of  Governmental Experts set out 11 such  norms (see Annex B). Also in 2015, G20  leaders agreed that ‘no country should  conduct or support ICT-enabled theft  of intellectual property, including state  secrets or other confidential business  information, with the intent of providing  competitive advantages to companies or  the commercial sector.’  Australia affirms its commitment to act in  accordance with these norms.  Australia and China ‘agreed to  support the work of the UN  Group of Governmental Experts  and to act in accordance with  its reports…Australia and  China agreed not to conduct  or support cyber-enabled  theft of intellectual property,  trade secrets or confidential  business information with the  intent of obtaining competitive  advantage.’  Joint Statement Australia-China  High-Level Security Dialogue,  Sydney, 2017  Australia engages in multi-agency cyber  policy and cyber security dialogues  with countries including Canada, China,  India, Indonesia, Japan, New Zealand,  the Republic of Korea, the United  Kingdom and the United States. These  dialogues are an opportunity to deepen  understanding of responsible state  behaviour in cyberspace and foster  cooperation to deter and respond to  malicious cyber activities.  49  INTERNATIONAL SECURITY & CYBERSPACE    AUSTRALIA WILL:  4.02  Facilitate advanced policy development and promote informed public  discussion on acceptable state behaviour in cyberspace through  engagement with academics and experts in this field  4.03  Seek high‑level reaffirmations from states that they will act in accordance  with international law and identified norms of responsible state behaviour in  cyberspace  4.04  Partner with countries in the Indo‑Pacific to advance our combined  understanding of how international law and norms of responsible state  behaviour apply in cyberspace through bilateral engagement and regional  and multilateral forums  50  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    Implement practical confidence building  measures to prevent conflict  Australia is committed to taking practical  action to support international peace and  security. Confidence building measures  foster trust between states to prevent  misunderstandings that could lead to  conflict. They include transparency  measures, risk reduction measures  and cooperative measures. Confidence  building measures are one of the most  important tools in our diplomatic toolkit.  Australia is committed to implementing  these measures to maintain a peaceful  and stable online environment.  Australia will look for  opportunities for practical  cooperation on cyber issues  with ASEAN partners. Working  together to harness the  opportunities and address  the shared challenges of  cyberspace will be a key theme  of the Australia-ASEAN Special  Summit in March 2018.  RISK REDUCTION MEASURES  Risk reduction measures build confidence  in states’ capacity to collaborate  to respond to specific instances of  malicious cyber activity without  escalation to conflict.  An example of a risk reduction measure  could be the development of a database  of regional policy and diplomatic points  of contact for use in the event of a  cyber incident. Knowing who to call  in times of tension reduces the risk of  miscommunication and, in turn, this  reduces the risk of escalation to conflict.  The very act of compiling the directory  of contacts can be a confidence building  measure in and of itself.  A lot of good work has already been done  in this field. A number of different bodies  have identified practical confidence  building measures that increase stability  and reduce risk, including the UN Group  of Governmental Experts, the ASEAN  Regional Forum, the Organization for  Security Cooperation in Europe and the  Organization of American States.  The task now is to move from  identifying risk reduction measures  to operationalising them. In doing so,  Australia will prioritise measures which  have the greatest impact on reducing  risk to international peace and security.  Our focus will be on putting in place  measures that enable states to cooperate  in situations of tension or crisis.  51  INTERNATIONAL SECURITY & CYBERSPACE    AUSTRALIA WILL:  4.05  Develop a framework to exchange policy and diplomatic contacts, including  bilaterally, to facilitate communication in times of crisis or tension arising  from significant cyber incidents that have the potential to threaten  international peace, security and stability  4.06  Work with regional organisations to conduct risk reduction workshops  to enhance our capacity to manage and respond to cyber incidents that  threaten international peace, security and stability, including exercising  national and regional responses to severe cyber incidents  TRANSPARENCY MEASURES  Transparency measures provide insight  into states’ activities. They reduce the  risk of miscommunication as well as the  likelihood of overreaction.  Australia’s 2016 Cyber Security Strategy,  the 2016 Defence White Paper, the  forthcoming Foreign Policy White Paper  and this Strategy are all examples of  transparency measures. Other examples  include cyber policy dialogues, sharing  Australia’s national cyber governance  structures (including cyber incident  management arrangements), and  outlining Australia’s position on how  international law applies to state conduct  in cyberspace.  Another area where Australia encourages  greater candidness is in relation to  the military use of offensive cyber  capabilities. Just as more and more  states are embracing the opportunities  of cyberspace to improve service  delivery and drive economic growth,  it is unsurprising that more and more  states are exploring military applications  of cyberspace. In and of itself this is  not a concern – provided that states   acknowledge that military activities in  cyberspace are governed by the same  sets of rules as military activities in the  physical domains. These rules, developed  over centuries, restrict and regulate  unacceptable conduct.  Australia recognises that, just like  other military capabilities, some details  of cyber capabilities and operations  will need to remain classified. By way  of analogy, Australia is transparent  about the rules that govern the use of  conventional capabilities such as missiles  on our warships; however, we do not  discuss the specifics of the capability,  nor would we reveal details of particular  operations. We will take the same  approach to discussing cyber capabilities.  Acknowledgement of these capabilities  does not contradict our commitment to a  stable and peaceful online environment.  Instead it fosters the understanding  that states’ activities in cyberspace  have limitations and obligations, just  as they do in the physical domains (see  Conduct and Authorisation of Offensive  Cyber Capability in Support of Military  Operations, page 55).52  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    COOPERATIVE MEASURES  Cooperative measures promote  collaboration between states based on  a mutual commitment to improve cyber  resilience and reinforce a peaceful and  stable online environment.  Cooperative measures could include  exchanging information on best  practices in responding to cyber  incidents or capacity building programs  like Australia’s new Cyber Cooperation  Program (see the Comprehensive &  Coordinated Cyber Affairs chapter).  Australia’s Cyber Cooperation Program  facilitates the development of  comprehensive, forward-leaning policies,  legislative frameworks and cyber  governance institutions to empower   regional partners to safely embrace  the benefits of connectivity. It will also  provide opportunities for Australia to  learn and adopt emerging best practices  to strengthen our own cyber policy and  security measures.  Development of robust cyber policy  and well-resourced cyber governance  institutions will mean that the collective  capacity of states to respond to cyber  incidents is enhanced, messaging to  potential adversaries is consistent and  security is strengthened overall. It will  also empower Indo-Pacific states to  participate in international discussions  about the future of cyberspace in an  inclusive manner.  AUSTRALIA WILL:  4.07  Hold cyber policy dialogues to discuss and work with partners to achieve  priority goals on international cyber issues, including international law,  norms of responsible state behaviour and confidence building measures  4.08  Foster recognition through diplomatic outreach and defence engagement  that military offensive cyber capabilities are subject to the same limitations  and obligations as any other military capability  53  INTERNATIONAL SECURITY & CYBERSPACE    Deter and respond to unacceptable behaviour  in cyberspace  The international community has  made good progress delineating  the boundaries of what is and isn’t  acceptable behaviour in cyberspace  – but some states are testing those  boundaries. Like many others, Australia  is concerned by the increased willingness  of states and non-state actors to pursue  their objectives by undertaking malicious  cyber activities contrary to international  law and identified norms of responsible  state behaviour.  Having established a firm foundation  of international law and norms, the  international community must now  ensure there are effective consequences  for those who act contrary to this  consensus. Australia is committed to  countering, deterring and discouraging  malicious cyber activity, especially by  states and their proxies. We will work  with partners to strengthen global  responses to unacceptable behaviour  in cyberspace.  An architecture for cooperation  amongst states is needed. This includes  mechanisms to respond to unacceptable  behaviour in cyberspace in a timely  and agile manner, within the existing  framework of international law. Achieving  this cooperation requires creative  thinking to build a flexible range of  existing and novel response tools, and   a nimble coordination mechanism to  implement them effectively.  Australia’s responses to malicious  cyber activity could comprise law  enforcement or diplomatic, economic  or military measures as appropriate for  the circumstances. This could include,  but is not restricted to, offensive  cyber capabilities that disrupt, deny or  degrade the computers or computer  networks of adversaries. Regardless of  the context, Australia’s response would  be proportionate to the circumstances  of the incident, would comply with  domestic law, and be consistent with our  support for the rules-based international  order and our obligations under  international law.  Attribution of malicious activity is  necessary to enable a range of response  options. Depending on the seriousness  and nature of an incident, Australia has  the capability to attribute malicious cyber  activity in a timely manner to several  levels of granularity – ranging from the  broad category of adversary through to  specific states and individuals.  Australia’s strong cyber security  posture underpins our ability to deter  and respond to serious incidents and  unacceptable behaviour in cyberspace.  It ensures that Australia can discourage,  detect, respond to, and contain malicious  cyber activity.  54  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    CONdUCT ANd AUTHORISATION OF OFFENSIVE CYBER  CAPABILITY IN SUPPORT OF MILITARY OPERATIONS Australian offensive cyber capabilities are held by the Australian Signals Directorate  (ASD). Australian offensive cyber operations are conducted by ASD personnel.  Offensive cyber operations in support of Australian Defence Force (ADF) operations  are planned and executed by ASD and Joint Operations Command under direction  of the Chief of Joint Operations. All operations are conducted in accordance with  international law and domestic law, including the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act  1995 and the Intelligence Services Act 2001.   Like any other military capability, use of this offensive cyber capability in support of  military operations is governed by ADF Rules of Engagement (ROE). ROE are informed  by and consistent with domestic and international law, including the Law of Armed  Conflict (International Humanitarian Law). Offensive cyber capabilities are also  subject to ASD’s existing legislative and oversight framework, including independent  oversight by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.  The 2016 Cyber Security Strategy and  the 2016 Defence White Paper boosted  Australia’s cyber security capabilities.  Australia is strengthening the Australian  Cyber Security Centre, establishing  a multi-layered national cyber threat  sharing network. The Australian Defence  Force’s (ADF) Information Warfare  Division will shape the development of  ADF cyberspace capabilities to secure  and protect ADF networks and systems,  and support the integration of cyber  capabilities into ADF operations.  Australia has also established the  Critical Infrastructure Centre to work  cooperatively with owners and operators  to manage the complex and evolving  national security risks from foreign  involvement in Australia’s critical  infrastructure. The centre develops risk  assessments to support Government  decision-making on foreign investment  in assets that may affect national  security. Australia’s overall goal is to  harden our networks, deter  unacceptable behaviour in cyberspace,  and promote an open, free and secure  online environment.  AUSTRALIA WILL:  4.09  Review Australia’s range of options to deter and respond to unacceptable  behaviour in cyberspace, especially those involving state actors and their  proxies  4.10  Undertake diplomatic action to support an international cooperative  architecture that promotes stability, and responds to and deters  unacceptable behaviour in cyberspace 55  INTERNATIONAL SECURITY & CYBERSPACE    INTERNET GOVERNANCE  & COOPERATION  AUSTRALIA’S GOAL:  An open, free and secure Internet,  achieved through a multi- stakeholder approach to Internet  governance and cooperation  TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, AUSTRALIA wILL:  Advocate for a multi-stakeholder approach to Internet  governance that is inclusive, consensus-based,  transparent and accountable  Oppose efforts to bring the management of the  Internet under government control  Raise awareness across the Indo-Pacific of Internet  governance issues and encourage engagement  of regional partners in Internet governance and  cooperation discussions    The Internet is a network of networks. A suite of  technical protocols and an array of communications  technologies give the Internet its form. This ecosystem  of technologies, on which the Internet depends, has  evolved over time to maintain and improve the security,  stability and resilience of the Internet. The governance of  this ecosystem is an international issue, with implications  for us all. Multi-stakeholder Internet governance  underpins the open, free and secure nature of the  Internet, on which our economies and societies rely.  OPEN, FREE ANd SECURE CYBERSPACE  An open cyberspace is interoperable across borders and accessible to all; it facilitates  unrestricted participation and the free flow of information, driving inclusive online  collaboration, innovation and growth.  A free cyberspace means people are not burdened by undue restrictions on their  access to and use of cyberspace; and their human rights are protected online as  they are offline so that cyberspace remains a vibrant force for economic, social and  cultural development.  A secure cyberspace is safe, reliable and resilient; it fosters an environment of trust  so that individuals, businesses and governments can engage online with confidence  and realise the opportunities and minimise the risks of the digital age.   57  INTERNET GOVERNANCE & COOPERATION    Reflecting its collaborative development,  governance of the Internet is shaped  by a multi-stakeholder approach. This  approach allows the private sector,  academia, technical experts, civil  society and governments to contribute  equally to discussions on the policy and  technical management of the Internet.  The multi-stakeholder approach is  a proven model for responding to  complex policy and technical challenges  associated with the development of the   Internet. These policy challenges include  security concerns, consumer protection,  maintaining legitimate competition  and the management of cross-border  data flows.  However, the multi-stakeholder model  of Internet governance cannot be  taken for granted. As the strategic  importance of cyberspace increases, so  too will strategic competition over its  future development.  MULTI-STAKEHOLdER APPROACH TO INTERNET GOVERNANCE  The multi-stakeholder approach to Internet governance is a decentralised governance  model that places individuals, industry, non-commercial interests and government  on an equal level. The multi-stakeholder approach allows for community-based  policy-making.  58  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    Advocate for a multi-stakeholder approach to  Internet governance  Australia is a strong supporter of  an open, free and secure Internet,  and advocates for policy settings  that support this position. The  multi-stakeholder approach recognises  that all stakeholders have a valuable  contribution to make. Importantly, and  by its very design, the multi-stakeholder  approach prevents any group (including  governments) from exerting undue  influence over the future of the Internet.  The multi-stakeholder approach offers  a set of tools and practices that allow  diverse stakeholders to participate  alongside each other, share ideas, and  develop consensus-based policy in the  interest of all users of the Internet.  Multi-stakeholder consultations and  discussions on the Internet’s technical  and policy frameworks are conducted  at international, regional and national  levels through Internet governance  forums. Australia will continue to ensure  that its contributions in these forums  are centred on well-reasoned policy  positions. We will also continue to work  in close coordination with the private  sector, academia, technical experts and  civil society.  Australia is committed to negotiating  in good faith to reach consensus with  other countries and non-government  stakeholders about the Internet’s  policy settings.  KEY INTERNATIONAL FORUMS  Australia will continue its engagement in key international multi-stakeholder  organisations and forums. This includes the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names  and Numbers (ICANN) and global and regional Internet Governance Forums (IGFs).  ICANN is responsible for coordinating the global domain name system and is the  major decision-making forum within the current Internet governance framework.  The global IGF provides a platform for discussion of Internet-related public policy  issues and idea sharing around maximising opportunities and minimising challenges  associated with the Internet.   59  INTERNET GOVERNANCE & COOPERATION    STRENGTHEN AUSTRALIA’S DOMESTIC MULTI-STAKEHOLDER  COOPERATION  Australia is committed to strengthening  domestic multi-stakeholder  mechanisms for Internet governance  and cooperation. We are committed to  consulting with a wide range of both  government and non-government  stakeholders domestically, regionally and  internationally to develop public policy  positions across the full spectrum of  cyber affairs.  Consultation with the local Internet  community has identified a need for  more opportunities for multi-stakeholder  discussion in Australia on cyber policy  issues, in particular Internet governance  and cooperation.  Australia will support annual  community-led Internet governance  dialogues run by a voluntary steering  committee with focused and topical  agendas. These dialogues will include  government and non-government  stakeholders including consumer  groups, technical experts, private sector  stakeholders (such as registries and  hosting providers) and, critically, users of  the Internet.  Better multi-stakeholder cooperation in  Australia will help inform the positions  of all Internet stakeholders, including  the Government. This will contribute to  coordinated Internet governance efforts  domestically and internationally.  PRIVATE SECTOR ENGAGEMENT  Australia will continue to work closely with private sector partners to ensure their  voice is represented in international discussions on the future of the Internet. Most  of the infrastructure on which the Internet runs is owned or managed by the private  sector. The private sector has also largely driven the innovation at the heart of the  Internet’s success. Therefore, including the perspective of the private sector is critical  to the longer term growth and sustainability of the digital ecosystem.   60  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    NET NEUTRALITY  Australia is a strong advocate of  an open and competitive Internet.  Internationally, there has been a focus on  telecommunications companies gaining  commercial advantage by giving priority  to certain types of data, or data from  certain sources, rather than applying  the principle of ‘net neutrality’, that is:  treating all data equally.  Concerns about net neutrality have not  been as prominent in Australia as in other  countries because our market structure  fosters strong retail competition  and provides significant consumer  choice. This allows consumers who are  dissatisfied with their provider to take  their business elsewhere. In the absence  of a demonstrated problem, Australia  has taken the view that regulation  on net neutrality is unnecessary. Our  telecommunications regulations, in   addition to our general competition law  – the Competition and Consumer Act  2010 – provide mechanisms to address  competition concerns.  Australia supports measures that deal  with anti-competitive conduct in the  supply of services on the Internet.  Anti-competitive conduct on the Internet  includes blocking websites, intentionally  slowing bandwidth speeds (bandwidth  throttling) and, in some circumstances,  data prioritisation. These practices can  disadvantage certain businesses, such  as over the top service providers and  content providers.  However, care needs to be taken to  ensure that legitimate competitive  conduct and traffic management  practices aren’t prevented. Transparency  around traffic management practices can  help assure customers in this regard.  AUSTRALIA WILL:  5.01  Advocate for an open, free and secure Internet, underpinned by a  multi‑stakeholder approach to Internet governance and cooperation  5.02  Support an annual community‑led Australian Internet governance and  cooperation forum  5.03  Outline Australia’s strong commitment to fostering fair and effective  competition online, emphasising a preference for general competition law  61  INTERNET GOVERNANCE & COOPERATION    Oppose efforts to bring the management of the  Internet under government control  Australia recognises that there is an  appropriate role for governments to  play in Internet governance, but it is  not one of control. Some states pursue  a state-centred model of Internet  governance in response to new public  policy challenges raised by the advent of  the Internet.  A state-centred model of Internet  governance would restrict and fragment  the network, inhibit innovation and  constrain the enormous potential of  the Internet. States should resist policy  responses that put at risk an open, free  and secure cyberspace.  Australia opposes moves to bring  governance and technical management  of the Internet under the control of   governments or into the United Nations  (UN) system, for example within the  UN International Telecommunications  Union. Instead, Australia advocates  for the improvement of existing  mechanisms of multi-stakeholder  governance. This approach will ensure  that governance of the Internet remains  inclusive, consensus-based, transparent  and accountable.  This will be particularly important  as the Internet continues to evolve  and support a range of emerging  technologies. Governance of the Internet  of Things, rules for the use of data, and  privacy and trust online are all issues  demanding a collaborative approach to  Internet governance.  AUSTRALIA WILL:  5.04  Oppose efforts to bring the management of the Internet under government  control  62  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    Raise awareness of Internet governance issues  across the Indo-Pacific  Australia is working to foster closer  engagement with our neighbours in  the Indo-Pacific on Internet governance  issues so that we can work together to  shape the Internet of the future.  Australia will provide practical support  for Indo-Pacific countries to engage  in international Internet governance  and cooperation discourse. Australia  will continue to build relationships  with regional Internet governance  stakeholders and coordinate our policy  positions with others in the region.  Australia will also support regional  Internet governance forums, workshops  and events. We will explore opportunities  to collaborate with private sector  stakeholders to achieve greater  awareness of, and interest in, Internet  governance issues across the region.  Internationally, Australia seeks to  raise awareness among international  stakeholders about the unique Internet  governance and cooperation challenges  faced by Indo-Pacific countries.  AUSTRALIA WILL:  5.05  Build the capacity of Indo‑Pacific partners to engage in regional and  international discussion on Internet governance and cooperation  63  INTERNET GOVERNANCE & COOPERATION    HUMAN RIGHTS &  DEMOCRACY ONLINE  AUSTRALIA’S GOAL:  Human rights apply online as  they do offline  TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, AUSTRALIA wILL:  Advocate for the protection of human rights and  democratic principles online  Support international efforts to promote and protect  human rights online   Ensure respect for and protection of human rights  and democratic principles online are considered in  all Australian aid projects with digital technology  components    Cyberspace has provided an unparalleled opportunity  for democratic participation around the world, as well  as the global promotion, protection and fulfilment of  human rights.  Democratic debate on policy and ideas  takes place online just as it does offline.  The Internet has empowered individuals  across the globe to have their voices  heard and has equipped governments  to better respond to citizens’ needs.  Australia encourages states to make  full use of online tools to strengthen  democratic processes.  However, the decentralised and  largely unregulated nature of online  conversations leaves democratic  processes vulnerable to malicious  interference. Cyber-enabled influence  operations during elections can  undermine democratic processes.  This has the potential to fundamentally  distort political debate and  democratic outcomes.  Human rights apply online just as  they do offline. The Internet provides  important platforms for freedom of  expression and freedom of association.  Instantaneous communication via the   Internet helps raise awareness of human  rights entitlements and human rights  abuses. Stories and images of human  rights abuses can be shared instantly  across the world, inflicting significant  reputational damage on perpetrators.  This assists government authorities,  non-government organisations and  other stakeholders to hold human rights  violators to account.  Some countries deny human rights  online. In some countries, people are  increasingly subject to undue restrictions  on and contraventions of their rights.  Illicit monitoring and targeted hacking,  the arrest and intimidation of online  activists, content censorship and  Internet shutdowns are just some of  the approaches taken to restrict human  rights online. These measures are  regularly employed under the pretext of  national security, but are often vehicles  for states to maintain political control  and economic advantage.  65  HUMAN RIGHTS & dEMOCRACY ONLINE    Advocate for the protection of human rights  and democratic principles online  An open, free and secure cyberspace  allows human rights and democratic  principles to be exercised online.  Australia’s commitment to human rights  underpins our engagement with the  international community.  Australia is a committed supporter of  human rights and democracy, both online  and offline. Australia believes that the  universal protection and promotion of  human rights and democratic principles  online is vital to achieve lasting peace,  security, freedom and dignity for all.  Of particular relevance in cyberspace are  the right to freedom of expression, the  right to freedom of association, and the  protection against arbitrary interference  with privacy. Each of these rights are  enshrined in the International Covenant  on Civil and Political Rights.  Australia is committed to seeing freedom  of expression protected online, just as it  is offline. Australia condemns politically  motivated Internet censorship, Internet  shutdowns, illicit monitoring, targeted  hacking, and the arrest and intimidation  of online activists, journalists and others.  KEY INTERNATIONAL FORUMS  Australia’s support for human rights online has been articulated through a number  of United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council and UN General Assembly resolutions  and statements, and by virtue of its membership of the Freedom Online Coalition.  Australia is seeking a seat on the Human Rights Council for the 2018–2020 term, and  the right to freedom of expression is a key element of our campaign pledges. This  reflects Australia’s commitment to ongoing promotion and protection of human  rights, both online and offline.  66  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    An open, free and secure cyberspace also  strengthens social, cultural and political  rights by facilitating greater connectivity  and engagement within and between  populations. Attempts to circumscribe  and restrict use of the Internet  impinges on these rights. Australia  will use bilateral and international  engagement to raise concerns about  impermissible restrictions on human  rights online. We will also raise concerns  about cyber-enabled interference in  democratic processes.  Australia will couple advocacy with  capacity building programs in the  Indo-Pacific, which will raise awareness  among regional governments of  human rights obligations online and  offline. Also important is equipping law  enforcement agencies with the capacity  to detect human rights abuses online,  disrupt these abuses and safeguard  against future abuses. Australia will also  encourage and support partner countries  to engage in international forums that  work to protect human rights online.  PRIVATE SECTOR ENGAGEMENT  Australia will demonstrate our commitment to the United Nations (UN) Guiding  Principles on Business and Human Rights. Australia consults regularly with the private  sector on human rights and has established a multi-stakeholder advisory group on  businesses and human rights. Australia will use these mechanisms to discuss human  rights and democracy online.  AUSTRALIA WILL:  6.01  Advocate to uphold and protect human rights and democratic freedoms  online  6.02  Share concerns about, and aim to prevent, undue restrictions of human  rights online as well as cyber‑enabled interference in democratic processes  6.03  Fund capacity building in the Indo‑Pacific to raise awareness of states’  human rights obligations online  67  HUMAN RIGHTS & dEMOCRACY ONLINE    Support international efforts to promote and  protect human rights online  Non-government organisations play  a vital role in the protection of human  rights and democratic freedoms  online. These organisations often  have broad civil society networks and  are acutely aware of the challenges  facing human rights defenders in the  digital environment.  In addition to its international human  rights advocacy efforts, Australia will  provide financial support to international  organisations protecting human rights  and democratic freedoms online, such as  the Freedom Online Coalition and Digital  Defenders Partnership (see below).  FREEdOM ONLINE COALITION ANd dIGITAL dEFENdERS  PARTNERSHIP  The Freedom Online Coalition is a group of 30 member governments, including Australia,  which work together to support Internet freedom and protect human rights online. The  Freedom Online Coalition’s founding declaration commits to the principle that the human  rights people have offline, enjoy the same protection online.  Coalition members share information on violations of human rights online and coordinate  diplomatic efforts to eliminate measures that curtail human rights online. The Coalition also  provides a platform for multi-stakeholder engagement on human rights online, including with  the private sector.  In support of this effort, the Digital Defenders Partnership, which emerged from the Freedom  Online Conference in Kenya in 2012, provides grants that support defenders of human  rights online, including non-government organisations, civil society, journalists and media  organisations.   AUSTRALIA WILL:  6.04  Support non‑government organisations that defend human rights online  68  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    Ensure respect for and protection of human  rights and democratic principles online  Increased connectivity and access to  the Internet can bring many benefits.  However, increased connectivity  also increases the possibility for  misuse of the Internet to restrict  human rights and opportunities for  democratic participation.  To guard against this, Australia will  ensure respect for and protection   of human rights online is included in  Australian development assistance  programs that include digital technology  components. Australia will encourage  governments and non-government  organisations to ensure that technology  and cyberspace are used in accordance  with human rights obligations.  AUSTRALIA WILL:  6.05  Provide guidance to ensure that human rights online are protected in  Australian aid and non‑government projects with digital technology  components  69  HUMAN RIGHTS & dEMOCRACY ONLINE    TECHNOLOGY FOR  DEVELOPMENT   AUSTRALIA’S GOAL:  Digital technologies are used to  achieve sustainable development  and inclusive economic growth in  the Indo-Pacific  TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, AUSTRALIA wILL:  Improve connectivity and access to the Internet  across the Indo-Pacific, in collaboration with  international organisations, regional governments  and the private sector  Encourage the use of resilient development-enabling  technologies for e-governance and the digital delivery  of services  Support entrepreneurship, digital skills and integration  into the global marketplace    Digital technologies are profound enablers of sustainable  development and inclusive economic growth. The spread  of the Internet and digital technologies has facilitated  greater connectivity, reducing physical and functional  barriers between people, businesses and governments.  The United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda  for Sustainable Development recognises  digital technologies as vital to ending  poverty, expanding access to quality  education, achieving gender equality  and social inclusion, promoting  inclusive economic growth, improving  health outcomes and supporting  cross-sectoral innovation.  Connectivity varies greatly across the  world, meaning that the socio-economic  opportunities of the digital age are not  evenly experienced. The Indo-Pacific is  highly diverse, comprising of developed,  emerging and least developed  economies, each at a different point in  their digital journey.  The Indo-Pacific is home to countries  with some of the highest, and fastest  growing, connectivity rates. In many  ways, the Indo-Pacific is at the forefront  of the world’s digital revolution. Many  Indo-Pacific countries are global leaders  in digital economics, cyber security, the  production and global exportation of new  technologies, and other cyber-related  areas. The region is already the largest  contributor to the world’s digital markets  and, by 2020, will contribute $1.4 trillion  to global e-commerce. However, the  Indo-Pacific is also home to some of the  world’s least connected countries, where  Internet penetration still sits in single  digits and digital opportunities are yet  to be fully harnessed. Digitally enabled   development must take into account  inter-regional differences in connectivity  and digital readiness.  Digital divides across the Indo-Pacific are  the product of several factors. In some  countries, insufficient financial resources  and challenging topography complicate  the establishment of essential  communication infrastructure. In others,  low literacy rates, limited technical skills,  socio-cultural constraints, unaffordable  service costs or unreliable electricity  supply undermine access to, and  use of, digital technologies. Access  limitations are particularly stark for  women and girls, older persons, people  with disabilities, indigenous, ethnic and  religious minorities, rural populations and  the poor.  Australia is committed to working  bilaterally, regionally and multilaterally  to bridge digital divides across the  Indo-Pacific. Australia is also committed  to encouraging innovative uses of digital  technologies to support sustainable and  inclusive development.  ‘Information Communication  Technologies can be an engine  for achieving the Sustainable  Development Goals. They can  power this global undertaking.’ United Nations Secretary-General Ban  Ki-moon, December 2015  71  TECHNOLOGY FOR dEVELOPMENT     Improve connectivity and access to the Internet  across the Indo-Pacific  Internet access is a prerequisite  for the effective operation of most  digital technologies. Connectivity is  therefore a fundamental requirement  for technology-enabled development.  Australia will contribute to international  efforts to improve connectivity and  Internet access across the Indo-Pacific.  This is a task of enormous social and  economic importance: estimates  suggest that for every 10 per cent  increase in broadband Internet  penetration, a country could increase  its Gross Domestic Product growth by  1.4 per cent.  To facilitate increased connectivity,  countries must have the necessary  infrastructure. This includes submarine  cables, satellites, cross-border fibre  connections, cellular data services,  Internet Exchange Points, and other  emerging infrastructure technologies.   Connectivity also fundamentally relies  upon the availability, affordability and  reliability of electricity supply.  Australian support for digital  communications infrastructure in the  Indo-Pacific is bringing connectivity to  hundreds of thousands of people in some  of the most remote places on earth.  Australia contributed technical expertise  and financial resources (in partnership  with the World Bank and the Asian  Development Bank) to lay a fibre-optic  submarine cable connecting Samoa  and Fiji. This has facilitated improved  Internet access at more affordable prices.  Australia has also supported projects  to enhance mobile coverage in the  Solomon Islands and Kiribati. In 2017–18,  Australia will support the laying of a new  submarine cable that will provide faster  and more stable Internet connectivity to  the Republic of Palau.  PRIVATE SECTOR ENGAGEMENT  The challenge of building adequate legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks  across the Indo-Pacific will require collaboration with private sector stakeholders  including telecommunications service providers and partners in the financial sector.  72  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    To make use of this base infrastructure,  Internet services and Internet-enabled  devices must be affordable and operate  at sufficient speeds. Telecommunications  market monopolies and high input costs  present a significant barrier to ubiquitous  Internet access. In order to improve  affordability of access, it is essential to  have in place the appropriate regulatory,  legal and institutional frameworks. These  frameworks enhance trust in Internet  enabled infrastructure and services,  facilitate digital trade, and help protect  users and service providers.  As a competitive free market economy  with well-established regulatory, legal  and institutional structures, Australia has  shared best practice and has continued  the development of telecommunications  policy and regulatory approaches  with regional partners. This has  occurred through our involvement  in regional forums such as the APEC  Telecommunications and Information  Working Group and through bilateral  exchanges (see Vanuatu’s Regulatory  Environment Supporting Greater  Connectivity, page 74).  ENABLING ACCESS TO THE INTERNET  The private sector plays a crucial role in enabling access to the Internet. Most of  the base infrastructure used for Internet access and connectivity is maintained  and operated by the private sector. This infrastructure generates new markets for  companies and digital products and services, while underpinning socio-economic  development in those markets.  73  TECHNOLOGY FOR dEVELOPMENT     VANUATU’S REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT SUPPORTING GREATER  CONNECTIVITY  The Australian Aid program, Governance for Growth (GFG), supported liberalisation of  Vanuatu’s telecommunications sector. The program provided assistance to the government  to break the monopoly held by Telecom Vanuatu Limited, in part through establishing the  Office of the Telecommunications and Radio Communications Regulator. This led to the  introduction of Digicel as an alternative telecommunications service provider. As a result,  mobile penetration has increased from 27 per cent of Vanuatu’s population in 2008 to over  80 per cent in 2016.  The GFG program also assisted the Vanuatu Government to establish the Office of the  Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO). In 2014, the OGCIO developed a Universal  Access Policy, which compels telecommunications service providers to expand coverage  to 98% of the country by 1 January 2018. This has contributed to a significant increase in  availability and affordability of broadband Internet services throughout Vanuatu.  AUSTRALIA WILL:  7.01  Partner with international organisations, regional governments,  development banks and the private sector to improve Internet accessibility  in the Indo‑Pacific  7.02  Work with partner countries in the Indo‑Pacific to develop domestic  regulatory, legal and institutional frameworks that support competitive  telecommunications sectors  7.03  Promote digital inclusion across the Indo‑Pacific through educational  programs, leadership initiatives and strategic partnerships  74  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    Encourage the use of resilient development- enabling technologies  The role of digital technologies as  enablers of development is expanding.  Inclusive access to digital technologies  is critical to ensure that all individuals  can more readily enjoy the benefits of  increasingly digital societies.  E-GOVERNANCE AND DIGITAL  DELIVERY OF SERVICES  Access to digital information and  services empowers individuals. It opens  new channels through which people can  engage financially, socially and politically.  Increasingly, core services including  banking and finance, education and  healthcare are most effectively accessed  using digital technologies (see The  Tupaia Initiative and Digital Delivery of  Services, page 76).  E-governance – the delivery of  government services through online   platforms – can improve administration  processes, service delivery, government  accountability and transparency.  Australia recognises the transformative  role that digital technologies play  in increasing the efficiency and  effectiveness of government services.  Beyond this, digital technologies  also provide alternative solutions to  challenges. Australia has played a  role in enhancing school attendance  and educational outcomes across the  region by providing digital reporting  and lesson-planning tools to teachers  and schools. Australia has contributed  to the empowerment of women and  girls in the region through deploying  technology and training to young  women, enhancing their digital inclusion  and financial independence.  ‘By reducing information costs, digital technologies greatly lower the  cost of economic and social transactions for firms, individuals, and  the public sector. They promote innovation when transaction costs  fall to essentially zero. They boost efficiency as existing activities and  services become cheaper, quicker, or more convenient. And they  increase inclusion as people get access to services that previously  were out of reach.’  Digital Dividends, The World Bank, 2016.  75  TECHNOLOGY FOR dEVELOPMENT     THE TUPAIA INITIATIVE ANd dIGITAL dELIVERY OF SERVICES   Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s innovationXchange is investing  an initial $2 million in a collaboration with software providers to transform the  availability of medical supply information across the Pacific Islands. This investment  will supply partner governments with an easy to use digital dashboard showing real  time essential medical supply information.   Health planners and other key decision-makers within local health systems will know  where their medical supplies are stored and frontline nursing and pharmaceutical  staff will be able to place and track their orders, enhancing availability of medical  supplies in the areas where they are needed most.   INNOVATIVE USES OF TECHNOLOGY FOR FINANCIAL INCLUSION  Engagement in the formal financial  sector is a catalyst for inclusive economic  growth and sustainable development.  It is difficult to pinpoint exact numbers  of people in the Indo-Pacific who do  not engage the services of a bank or  similar financial institution, but the  numbers are significant. We know that  over 400 million people in Southeast  Asia alone remain ‘unbanked’. Increased  participation by the APEC region in the  formal financial sector will increase the  region’s economic contribution from  $17 billion to $52 billion by 2030.  New technologies give rise to new  opportunities for financial inclusion.  Formalising banking by increasing  access to online and mobile banking  and e-financing arrangements (such as  Government-to-Person digital payment  systems in the Indo-Pacific) will reduce   administration costs for governments  and businesses, make savings more  secure and increase financial inclusion,  especially for women and girls and  people living in rural and remote areas.  As current co-chair of the G20 Global  Partnership for Financial Inclusion  Subgroup on Markets and Payment  Systems (alongside Mexico), Australia  is engaged in promoting digital  payment systems and providing secure,  cost-effective digital financial services  and products. The Subgroup’s Guidance  Note on Building Inclusive Digital  Ecosystems has been a key outcome  of Australia’s 2017 co-chairmanship.  This Guidance Note supports the  implementation of inclusive digital  payment systems and the provision  of safe, cost-effective digital financial  services and products.  76  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    PRIVATE SECTOR ENGAGEMENT  Alongside government, the private sector has an important stake in the digital  inclusion of countries and populations across the Indo-Pacific. Financial institutions  and service providers are increasingly using digital technologies to enhance delivery  of their financial products and services.  CYBER SECURITY FOR RESILIENT TECHNOLOGY-ENABLED  DEVELOPMENT  Greater connectivity has the potential  to facilitate sustainable and inclusive  development. However, it also brings  new threats. Poor cyber security  practices and low cybercrime awareness  can undermine trust in cyberspace,  reducing the dividends of digital  technologies. Conversely, trust in the  online environment sustains and extends  the development-enabling capacity of  digital technologies.  Australian development projects will  take into account the long-term security  and resilience of technologies. This  will support the safety and privacy of  users and build trust in online systems.  Technologies that are known to be  resilient to threats, and that are trusted  by users, will have greater impact on  development outcomes.  AUSTRALIA WILL:  7.04  Work with partner governments, the private sector and financial institutions  across the Indo‑Pacific to promote e‑governance, online service delivery  and innovative uses of technology for enhanced economic opportunity and  sustainable development  7.05  Provide guidance to ensure that digital technologies used or provided in  Australian aid and non‑government projects are safe and resilient  77  TECHNOLOGY FOR dEVELOPMENT     Support entrepreneurship, digital skills and  integration into the global marketplace  The introduction of new digital  technologies will continue to act  as a catalyst for development, but  technological advancements can also  disrupt traditional economic and labour  markets. Innovative uses of technology  by individuals, entrepreneurs,  governments and businesses can  harness digital disruption for good,   upskilling workers and integrating  people and economies into the global  marketplace. Australia is committed  to bridging digital divides within  and between countries in the region  by bolstering entrepreneurship,  digital-ready workforces and inclusive  digital trade.  ENCOURAGING INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP  Innovation and entrepreneurship  are critical factors in sustaining an  open, free and secure cyberspace.  Innovators develop new ways for  people to participate and collaborate  online. Entrepreneurs take new ideas  forward and enhance access to and  use of the Internet. Together, these  activities ensure that cyberspace  remains an ever-evolving force for  inclusive economic growth and  sustainable development.  Australia supports public-private  innovation challenges that search  for innovative and entrepreneurial  solutions to development challenges  across the region (see CSIRO ON Prime  Accelerator Program). Australia’s  Ambassador for Cyber Affairs will host a  Technology for Development Challenge  for entrepreneurs and start-ups from  Australia and the Indo-Pacific to find  innovative technology-based solutions to  regional development challenges.  CSIRO ON PRIME ACCELERATOR PROGRAM   CSIRO’s ON Prime Accelerator Program is working with the Department of Foreign  Affairs and Trade to explore ways in which technologies that have the potential to  deliver gains in connectivity, online service delivery and data collection across the  Indo-Pacific can be maximised. ON Prime is an entry level, part-time pre-accelerator  that helps teams validate their research through a process of customer discovery and  market validation, and discover a real world application for it. Going forward, the aim  is to encourage teams with research in this space to discover the value of their work  and maximize their potential impact.   78  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    AUSTRALIA WILL:  7.06  Work with public and private sector partners to encourage businesses and  entrepreneurs to find solutions to regional development challenges using  innovative technologies  DIGITAL-READY WORKFORCES  In order to realise the potential of the  digital age, populations must be digitally  skilled. Some countries in the Indo-Pacific  have highly skilled digital-ready  workforces. In many others, however,  digital literacy and skills vary greatly  among working populations. An absence  of digital skills and technical expertise  holds people back from participating fully  in the digital economy.  As technology becomes increasingly  available, demand for digitally literate  workers will continue to expand. In order  to prepare populations for increasingly  digitalised jobs, schools, universities and  training programs for working age and  older persons must equip people with  digital skills. In addition to traditional  education, agile approaches to bridging  skills gaps are needed across the  region. Governments and businesses  have a shared and growing need to   work together in this area to build up  digital-ready workforces.  Australia’s Department of Foreign  Affairs and Trade’s innovationXchange  is working with private sector and  university partners to source solutions  to digital skills shortages across the  region. Grant funding will be awarded  to project proposals that will upskill  Indo-Pacific populations, especially  young people, women and girls, and  people with disabilities.  Digitally skilled populations will  themselves become catalysts for  inclusive economic growth and  sustainable development. Groups  previously underrepresented in the  digital landscape will gain the skills  needed to access jobs, expanded  economic opportunities, information,  government services and social  engagement online.  79  TECHNOLOGY FOR dEVELOPMENT     AUSTRALIA WILL:  7.07  Partner with regional governments, multilateral forums and educational  institutions to build digital‑ready workforces and support digital upskilling  across the Indo‑Pacific  INTEGRATION INTO THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE  Through its ongoing Aid for Trade  program, Australia helps individuals,  businesses and economies integrate  into the global marketplace. Encouraging  growth of digital trade delivers particular  benefits to small businesses, women and  girls, low-income groups, indigenous,  ethnic and religious minorities,  and others.  Australia has committed $10 million  to multilateral programs that assist   developing countries to undertake trade  facilitation reform. This includes the  World Bank’s Trade Facilitation Support  Program, World Trade Organization  (WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement  Facility, and the Global Alliance for Trade  Facilitation. In 2015, Australia endorsed  the G20 Digital Economy Development  and Cooperation Initiative, which seeks  to improve digital trade outcomes,  including for developing countries and  vulnerable groups.  AUSTRALIA WILL:  7.08  Support new technologies and tools for developing countries to facilitate  trade, including improvements in policy and customs practices and better  access to trade finance  7.09  Focus Australian Aid for Trade efforts on connecting small businesses  and women entrepreneurs in developing countries to digital economy  opportunities and global supply chains  80  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    SHAPING INCLUSIVE FINANCE TRANSFORMATIONS IN ASEAN  Australia’s ASEAN and Mekong regional aid program is supporting increased participation  in digital trade. For example, the Shaping Inclusive Finance Transformations in ASEAN  investment (SHIFT, $9.9 million, 2014–2018, implemented by the United Nations  Capital Development Fund - UNCDF), is developing innovative digital services to help  low-income women and men access financial services. SHIFT supported development of  LienVietPostBank’s new e-wallet. This offers the full array of low-cost banking services via a  client’s smartphone, supporting low-income people in Vietnam gain financial independence  and growing a new market for financial services.  81  TECHNOLOGY FOR dEVELOPMENT     COMPREHENSIVE &  COORDINATED CYBER  AFFAIRS  AUSTRALIA’S GOAL:  Australia pursues a   comprehensive & coordinated  cyber affairs agenda  TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, AUSTRALIA wILL:  Enhance understanding of Australia’s comprehensive  cyber affairs agenda  Increase funding for Australia’s international  cyber engagement activities  Coordinate and prioritise Australia’s international  cyber engagement activities    The digital age presents a diverse range of opportunities  and challenges for Australia. This Strategy captures the  breadth of Australia’s agenda for cyber affairs through its  seven thematic chapters: Digital Trade, Cyber Security,  Cybercrime, International Security & Cyberspace, Internet  Governance & Cooperation, Human Rights & Democracy  Online and Technology for Development.  The borderless nature of cyberspace  means that the capacity and behaviour  of other states, the private sector,  civil society and individuals can affect  Australia’s cyber interests. Cyber  diplomacy and outreach is essential to  promoting and protecting Australia’s  national security, foreign policy,  economic and trade interests, as well as  our development objectives.  Australia’s various cyber interests are  all deeply interconnected. For example,  increased internet penetration resulting  from development projects promotes  inclusive economic growth, while helping  more people get online in the Indo-Pacific  boosts our regional economy, creating  new opportunities for Australia’s private  sector to market their digital goods  and services.  Australia will work closely with  international partners, both in the  Indo-Pacific and across the globe,  to pursue our cyber affairs agenda.  Reflecting differing levels of connectivity   and digital development in the region,  our partners offer varying opportunities  for engagement and collaboration. Some  countries with particular expertise and  capabilities will be key partners in the  practical delivery of Australia’s cyber  affairs agenda, while others will be  key beneficiaries.  As our neighbours become more  connected, Australia will partner  to build their technical, legislative  and institutional capacity to fight  cybercrime. This will not only preserve  our neighbours’ economic growth, but  also prevent the creation of cybercrime  safe havens that could be used to target  Australians. Such capacity building  also equips countries to participate  more constructively in international  discussions on the future of cyberspace.  At the same time, investing in capacity  building and improving international  collaboration on shared cyber challenges  helps to ensure that Australia and  Australians can enjoy the benefits of  cyberspace, while mitigating the risks.  83  COMPREHENSIVE & COORdINATEd CYBER AFFAIRS    In different combinations, Australia’s  cyber interests either reinforce each  other or require conscious balancing.  For example, overcoming barriers  to development and successfully  addressing cybercrime both improve the  performance of the digital economy. In  contrast, pursuing digital development  without addressing the risk of cybercrime  could be counterproductive. Similarly,  chasing absolute security without  considering the benefits of digital trade  could lead to missed opportunities.  Australia will reconcile the complex  relations between these various factors  by pursuing a comprehensive and  coordinated approach to cyber affairs.  In recognising the significance of cyber  affairs to our national interest, Australia  will increase the understanding, funding  and coordination of our international  cyber engagement. Greater resources  and a harmonised approach to  international cyber engagement will  ensure Australia achieves its goals  in cyberspace.  Collaborating and cooperating with the  private sector, civil society, academia and  other governments will be vital to ensure  that Australia’s fundamental objective  of an open, free and secure Internet  is achieved.  84  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    Enhance understanding of Australia’s  comprehensive cyber affairs agenda  Cyber issues cut across almost all areas  of Australia’s international engagement.  The prominence of these issues will  continue to grow as global connectivity  and technology uptake continue to  increase. In acknowledgement of  this, Australia will work to improve  understanding of its comprehensive  international cyber agenda amongst  all stakeholders, both domestic  and international.  Australia embraces a holistic idea of  ‘cyber capacity’. This includes a state’s  ability to: ensure people’s rights online;   achieve economic growth through digital  trade; combat cybercrime; and engage in  conversations about Internet governance  and international security in cyberspace.  Australia will bring conversations  concerning development assistance  and cyber security capacity together,  reconciling the goals, priorities and  terminology discussed. Similarly,  cyber capacity building will encompass  important elements beyond purely  technical training, including policy and  legislation, education and infrastructure.  FIGURE 1: Australia’s interconnected cyber affairs interests  85  COMPREHENSIVE & COORdINATEd CYBER AFFAIRS    This Strategy conveys Australia’s  comprehensive cyber affairs vision to the  international community. This vision will  be reinforced through Australia’s ongoing  diplomatic engagements, and will also  be promoted to domestic stakeholders  through regular consultation across the  Australian Government and industry.  In order to deliver Australia’s  comprehensive cyber affairs agenda  internationally, Australia needs those  who represent the country to be  equipped with an in-depth understanding  of international cyber issues and  Australia’s interests in cyberspace.  Australia will develop a Cyber Affairs  Curriculum for its Diplomatic Academy.  Courses will provide Australia’s  international representatives from across   government with a detailed view of  our cyber affairs agenda. The material  will cover Australia’s national security,  foreign policy, economic and trade  interests, and legal and development  objectives regarding the Internet and  cyberspace. ‘Workshops in a box’ –  curriculums that can be delivered to  representatives already on international  postings – will further disseminate cyber  affairs awareness. This will ensure that  Australia’s international cyber affairs  agenda is not only comprehensive in  concept, but also broad in stewardship.  Empowering the people at the forefront  of Australia’s international cyber  engagement will be the foundation of  Australia’s coordinated approach to  cyber affairs.  AUSTRALIA WILL:  8.01  Promote Australia’s comprehensive vision of cyber affairs through ongoing  diplomatic engagement  8.02  Create a Cyber Affairs Curriculum for Australia’s international  representatives through DFAT’s Diplomatic Academy  86  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    Increase funding for Australia’s international  cyber engagement activities  Australia’s newly established Cyber  Cooperation Program, announced by  the Foreign Minister in May 2016, is  designed to boost the resources behind  Australia’s cyber capacity building  efforts. Projects funded by the Program  will encompass the full spectrum of  cyber affairs, whether that be raising  the bar of cyber security, cybercrime  capacity building, or pursuing economic  and development goals.  While introduced with an initial  investment of $1 million per year over  four years, in recognition of the growing  importance of this field, the Government  has supplemented this funding with  an additional $10 million over three  years, taking the total investment to  $14 million. This additional investment  ensures that the priorities outlined in  this Strategy can be delivered through  practical action.  The Indo-Pacific will be the focus area  of the Program’s projects. This is where  our capacity building efforts will have  the greatest impact and translate  most directly into gains for Australia.  Australia will work with partners who  have a well-established capability and  complementary objectives. In this way,  we will harness the existing capacity  of the Indo-Pacific to deliver greater  outcomes to the region as a whole,  including to those countries who are at  the beginning of their digital journey.  Australia will actively seek creative  partnering opportunities with  governments around the world and  with civil society, academia and the  private sector. Our combined resources,  networks and expertise will be a force  multiplier in pursuit of shared goals.  The Cyber Cooperation Program will  provide the support for many of the new  international cyber engagement activities  in the Strategy.  AUSTRALIA WILL:  8.03  Fund new international cyber engagement projects in the Indo‑Pacific  through the Cyber Cooperation Program  87  COMPREHENSIVE & COORdINATEd CYBER AFFAIRS    Coordinate and prioritise Australia’s  international cyber engagement  The breadth of Australia’s comprehensive  cyber affairs agenda means that  there are many stakeholders across  government who promote and safeguard  Australia’s international interests in  cyberspace. The growing profile of  these issues and Australia’s increasing  investment means it is becoming even  more important to ensure that all of  Australia’s international cyber activities  are effectively coordinated.  The Ambassador for Cyber Affairs will  coordinate and prioritise Australia’s  international cyber engagement across  the full spectrum of international  cyber affairs.  Recognising that important  work is already going on across  Government, the Ambassador for  Cyber Affairs will convene a quarterly  whole-of-Government International  Cyber Engagement Group. The Group  will bring together all Government  representatives with a stake in  Australia’s cyber affairs. This will help   amplify the visibility of existing efforts,  increase useful cross-departmental  collaborations, avoid duplications  of effort, and ensure an overarching  direction and prioritisation.  As foreshadowed in the Digital Trade  chapter, Australia will engage with a  new dedicated private sector advisory  body that will consult directly with the  Government on international cyber  issues. The Industry Advisory Group  will provide the practical framework for  Australia’s public-private partnership  on cyber issues and ensure that the  Government collaborates with the  private sector in pursuit of its cyber  affairs agenda.  By adopting a comprehensive approach,  boosting funding and increasing  coordination of international cyber  engagement across Government, civil  society, academia and the private sector,  Australia will ensure its prosperity and  security in cyberspace.  AUSTRALIA WILL:  8.04  Establish a quarterly whole‑of‑Government meeting, convened by the  Ambassador for Cyber Affairs, to coordinate and prioritise Australia’s  international cyber activities  8.05  Establish an Industry Advisory Group that meets biannually to facilitate  public‑private collaboration on Australia’s international cyber engagement  88  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    ANNEXES    Annex A: Australia’s position on how  international law applies to state conduct  in cyberspace  Existing international law provides  the framework for state behaviour  in cyberspace. This includes, where  applicable, the law regarding the use  of force, international humanitarian  law (IHL), international human rights  law, and international law regarding  state responsibility.  In this respect, Australia notes that the  centrality of international law and its  application to states’ use of cyberspace  was affirmed in 2013 in the consensus  report of the third United Nations Group  of Governmental Experts (UNGGE) on  Developments in the Field of Information  and Telecommunications in the Context  of International Security, which was  chaired by Australia, and reaffirmed in  the 2015 report of the UNGGE.  However, Australia recognises that  activities conducted in cyberspace raise  new challenges for the application of  international law, including issues of  sovereignty, attribution and jurisdiction,  given that different actors engage in  a range of cyber activities which may  cross multiple national borders. This  annex sets out Australia’s views on  these issues.  1. The United Nations Charter and  the law on the use of force ( jus ad  bellum) apply to activities conducted  in cyberspace.  The Charter of the United Nations  requires states to seek peaceful  settlements of disputes. This obligation  extends to cyberspace and requires  states to resolve cyber incidents  peacefully without escalation or resort  to the threat or use of force. This   requirement does not impinge upon a  state’s inherent right to act in individual  or collective self-defence in response to  an armed attack, which applies equally  in the cyber domain as it does in the  physical realm.  In determining whether a cyber attack,  or any other cyber activity, constitutes  a use of force, states should consider  whether the activity’s scale and effects  are comparable to traditional kinetic  operations that rise to the level of use  of force under international law. This  involves a consideration of the intended  or reasonably expected direct and  indirect consequences of the cyber  attack, including for example whether  the cyber activity could reasonably be  expected to cause serious or extensive  (‘scale’) damage or destruction (‘effects’)  to life, or injury or death to persons, or  result in damage to the victim state’s  objects, critical infrastructure and/ or functioning.  2. For cyber operations constituting  or occurring within the context of an  international or non-international armed  conflict, the relevant international  humanitarian law ( jus in bello) will apply  to the conduct of these cyber activities.  International humanitarian law (IHL)  (including the principles of humanity,  necessity, proportionality and  distinction) applies to cyber operations  within an armed conflict.  The IHL principle of proportionality  prohibits the launching of an attack  which may be expected to cause  incidental loss of civilian life, injury to  civilians, damage to civilian objects, or 90  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    a combination thereof, which would be  excessive in relation to the concrete and  direct military advantage anticipated.  The IHL principle of military necessity  states that a combatant is justified in  using those measures, not forbidden by  international law, which are indispensable  for securing complete submission of  an enemy at the soonest moment.  The principle cannot be used to justify  actions prohibited by law, as the means  to achieve victory are not unlimited.  The IHL principle of distinction seeks  to ensure that only legitimate military  objects are attacked. Distinction has  two components. The first, relating  to personnel, seeks to maintain the  distinction between combatants and  non-combatants or military and civilian  personnel. The second component  distinguishes between legitimate military  targets and civilian objects.  All Australian military capabilities are  employed in line with approved targeting  procedures. Cyber operations are no  different. Australian targeting procedures  comply with the requirements of IHL  and trained legal officers provide  decision-makers with advice to ensure  that Australia satisfies its obligations  under international law and its domestic  legal requirements.  For example, Australia considers that,  if a cyber operation rises to the same  threshold as that of a kinetic ‘attack  under IHL’, the rules governing such  attacks during armed conflict will apply  to those kinds of cyber operations.  3. For cyber activities taking place  outside of armed conflict, general  principles of international law, including  the law on state responsibility, apply.  It is a longstanding rule of international  law that, if a state acts in violation of   an international obligation, and that  violation is attributable to the state, that  state will be responsible for the violation.  The customary international law on state  responsibility, much of which is reflected  in the International Law Commission’s  Articles on the Responsibility of States for  Internationally Wrongful Acts, apply to  state behaviour in cyberspace.  To the extent that a state enjoys the  right to exercise sovereignty over  objects and activities within its territory,  it necessarily shoulders corresponding  responsibilities to ensure those objects  and activities are not used to harm other  states. In this context, we note it may not  be reasonable to expect (or even possible  for) a state to prevent all malicious use  of ICT infrastructure located within its  territory. However, in Australia’s view,  if a state is aware of an internationally  wrongful act originating from or routed  through its territory, and it has the ability  to put an end to the harmful activity, that  state should take reasonable steps to do  so consistent with international law.  If a state is a victim of malicious cyber  activity which is attributable to a  perpetrator state, the victim state  may be able to take countermeasures  against the perpetrator state, under  certain circumstances. However,  countermeasures that amount to a  use of force are not permissible. Any  use of countermeasures involving  cyberspace must be proportionate.  It is acknowledged that this raises  challenges in identifying and assessing  direct and indirect effects of malicious  cyber activity, in order to gauge a  proportionate response. The purpose  of countermeasures is to compel the  other party to desist in the ongoing  unlawful conduct.  91  ANNEXES    Annex B: Norms for the responsible behaviour  of states in cyberspace  From the report of the 2015 UN Group  of Government Experts on Development  in the Field of Information and  Telecommunications in the Context of  International Security (A/70/174).  (a) Consistent with the purposes of  the United Nations, including to  maintain international peace and  security, States should cooperate in  developing and applying measures  to increase stability and security in  the use of ICTs and to prevent ICT  practices that are acknowledged to  be harmful or that may pose threats  to international peace and security;  (b) In case of ICT incidents, States  should consider all relevant  information, including the larger  context of the event, the challenges  of attribution in the ICT environment  and the nature and extent of  the consequences;  (c) States should not knowingly  allow their territory to be used  for internationally wrongful acts  using ICTs;  (d) States should consider how best to  cooperate to exchange information,  assist each other, prosecute  terrorist and criminal use of ICTs  and implement other cooperative  measures to address such threats.  States may need to consider whether  new measures need to be developed  in this respect;  (e) States, in ensuring the secure use of  ICTs, should respect Human Rights  Council resolutions 20/8 and 26/13  on the promotion, protection and  enjoyment of human rights on the  Internet, as well as General Assembly  resolutions 68/167 and 69/166 on  the right to privacy in the digital age,  to guarantee full respect for human  rights, including the right to freedom  of expression;  (f) A State should not conduct or  knowingly support ICT activity  contrary to its obligations under  international law that intentionally  damages critical infrastructure  or otherwise impairs the use and  operation of critical infrastructure to  provide services to the public;  (g) States should take appropriate  measures to protect their critical  infrastructure from ICT threats,  taking into account General  Assembly resolution 58/199 on  the creation of a global culture of  cybersecurity and the protection of  critical information infrastructures,  and other relevant resolutions;  (h) States should respond to appropriate  requests for assistance by another  State whose critical infrastructure  is subject to malicious ICT acts.  States should also respond to  appropriate requests to mitigate  malicious ICT activity aimed at the  critical infrastructure of another  State emanating from their territory,  taking into account due regard  for sovereignty;  92  AUSTRALIA’S INTERNATIONAL CYBER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY    (i) States should take reasonable  steps to ensure the integrity of the  supply chain so that end users can  have confidence in the security of  ICT products. States should seek to  prevent the proliferation of malicious  ICT tools and techniques and the use  of harmful hidden functions;  (j) States should encourage responsible  reporting of ICT vulnerabilities  and share associated information  on available remedies to such  vulnerabilities to limit and possibly  eliminate potential threats to ICTs  and ICT-dependent infrastructure;  (k) States should not conduct or  knowingly support activity to harm  the information systems of the  authorized emergency response  teams (sometimes known as  computer emergency response  teams or cybersecurity incident  response teams) of another  State. A State should not use  authorized emergency response  teams to engage in malicious  international activity.  93  ANNEXES    Annex C: International cyber engagement  strategy action plan   DIGITAL

ICT is a new significant factor that can propel performance and growth of the Grenada economy. This Strategy and Action Plan represents Grenada's approach to capturing the potentials of these technologies and to utilizing them for sustainable development and the fight against poverty. ICT's allow faster delivery of change in a variety of sectors including distance education, telemedicine, environmental management, trade, and in strengthening the participation of social groups and the creation of new livelihoods. ICT facilitates the reaching and embracing of more people being involved and interacting with greater numbers of the citizens. ICT opens up access to information sources worldwide, promotes networking that transcends the limitations of being a small island. ICT can foster the empowerment of communities, women, youths and socially disadvantaged groups, and helps spread knowledge about \"best practices\" and experiences. ICT is indispensable in realizing the new information society and the national knowledge-based economy. KNOWLEDGE‐BASED ECONOMY  In the Prime Ministers' Millennium Vision delivered on the 31st December 1999, the Honorable Dr Keith Mitchell proposed the acquisition and 5  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha utilization of knowledge as one of the most effective ways of reducing the level of poverty in the domestic economy. The Prime Minister is convinced that Information and Communication Technology must be embraced as a vital tool in the next phase of Grenada's development. \"My government is totally committed to creating an attractive policy and regulatory environment to facilitate the development …of Grenada as a Knowledge Society\" The Government also designated the new decade as the Knowledge Enhancement Decade for Grenada, and set out a series of specific objectives to be achieved within the ten-year period. \"At least fifty percent of our human resources [must be] engaged in high- value knowledge-based activities, including information and communication technology, financial services, education, agriculture, tourism, sport and entertainment\" The Grenada government recognizes that the development of a Knowledge-economy requires the intensification and deepening of the domestic capability for acquisition and utilization of knowledge in all sectors of the economy. Grenada will embrace information and communication technologies and use them as development tools. This Strategy and Action Plan is one more step in the development of Grenada as a knowledge-based economy. 6  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha Executive Summary:  Grenada is an independent state comprising three island: Grenada (120 sq miles), Carriacou (13 sq miles) and Petit Martinique. The capital is the city of St.George, situated on the south western part of the mainland. Grenada experiences a warm tropical climate, with two main seasons. The temperature ranges from 20 to 30 degree centigrade with mean temperature of 25 degree centigrade and annual rain fall of 1380 mm with humidity ranging from 65 to 75 %. The National Strategic Plan will translate the Vision of the Government of Grenada into a set of policies and actions to enable the exploitation of information and communication technologies as a tool of national development. The Plan will seek to put information and communication technologies (ICT) at the centre of Grenada's economic development as a dynamic industry sector in itself, and in support of the development of other sectors of the economy. The Plan should pursue the following objectives • Raise and develop awareness, build vision and generate enthusiasm about the advantageous use of ICT in everyday social and economic life • Design and implement policies to capture information and knowledge for development • Promote and build connectivity and the necessary infrastructure for access to information and development • Build required human and social capacities and institutions, and provide training and education to impart requisite skills • Create new livelihood and employment opportunities; 7  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha • Empower communities and disadvantaged groups, reinforce participatory approaches and good governance and foster networking; • Build a public service that allows and encourages electronic access to public information, and facilitates low-cost electronic transactions with the civil society. The Plan will take a five-year time horizon, and establish the framework for a knowledge-based society as the platform on which to foster, accelerate and sustain long-term economic development. The development of a knowledge-based society will be through training and re-training, and otherwise strengthening of our human resource through the availability of information and through local information technology service industries and technology applications. • Integral to the implementation process will be - • Government's leadership and the commitment of resources • Smart Partnership with key sectors. • The involvement of all stakeholders in the execution and the continuing development of the action plan. • Rigorous pursuit of results within the planned timeframes. The strategy will also seek to attract local and foreign investors through various investment packages and incentives, sufficient workspace with supporting technology infrastructure, as well as a pool of trained workers and professional staff. Potential investors will be aggressively targeted through a focused promotional strategy. 8  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha Collaborative Approach  A collaborative approach will be encouraged for the implementation of the Plan. Private and public sector partnerships will be pursued while benchmarking of international standards. The role of the international community and the Grenadian private sector will also be actively promoted, particularly in terms of the transfer of information, benchmarking and keeping abreast of developments in the sector. The private sector will be urged and encouraged to take over and drive the continuing growth of the sector. Government will encourage the private sector to be a partner in building out infrastructure, in developing our human resource, in providing jobs and in taking on development activities. Government will promote a regional and hemispheric approach to those elements that lend themselves to such cooperation. Human Resource Development   The human resource strategy will seek to produce trained Grenadian suitable for employment across the full range of ICT activities. • Formal and non-formal training • Private sector training initiatives • E-training over a range of training methods • The Physically Challenged. • Scholarship support for talented students. • Development of an appropriate IT Curriculum to inculcate the IT culture at the Primary, Secondary levels, and in private training institutions. • Training of trainers to deliver high end programming curricula. 9  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha Particular attention will be placed on speeding up the generation of higher end jobs by strengthening our capacity to produce persons trained to international standards as programmers, web managers, and other IT technologists. Access of Communities to Technology   It is vital that every parish and community in Grenada have effective access to Information and Communication Technology. Identification of the existing and potential community access nodes will be part of the Plan process. The delivery of distance learning modules for Adult Literacy Education through the Community network would be a major thrust. The Plan will incorporate the promotion of IT awareness, accelerate ease of access, facilitate acquisition of hardware promote is utilization. Specific programs will be implemented to narrow and eliminate the Digital Divide in Grenada society. The introduction of IT in Primary schools will widen the catchments of youth with IT skills and deepen the program already in place in the Secondary schools. Government will bring IT literary training to local communities. During the academic year 2001-02, all Secondary schools Computer labs will be made available for training to citizens after normal schools hours. Adult literacy programs will be intensified The potentials of the Postal System in supporting community development will be harnessed. The Government will encourage and support an action plan for the building of an electronic infrastructure for the Post Offices. The Social Services departments of Government and the NGO's will be mobilized for hands-on development at the village and community levels. The delivery of distance learning modules for Adult Literacy Education through the Community network has already begun and will be 10 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha expanded and accelerated the plan will also address the promotion of e- Commerce and e-Government strategies. Project Management  A central administrative and technical Unit will be established to manage the implementation of the ICT Plan. This requirement is dictated by the critical nature of the Plan, the need to manage the collaboration between Ministries and Agencies with respect to the national IT policy, and the need to maintain efficiencies and the timeframes. 11 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha BUILDING AN INFORMATION SOCIETY IN GRENADA  Prime Minister Dr. Keith Mitchell  VISION  \"My government is totally committed to the development of Grenada as a Knowledge Society by 2010.\" MISSION  To put Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) at the center of Grenada’s social and economic development as a dynamic industry sector in itself, and in support of the development of other sectors of the economy To establish a knowledge-based society as the platform on which to foster, accelerate and sustain long-term social, cultural and economic development. The Government is committed to raising the quality of life in Grenada to the highest attainable levels. In striving for this goal it will actively promote and utilize Information and Communication Technology to the widest possible extent, as a means of strengthening the economy, creating jobs, ensuring social equity and enhancing education and culture. The Government will ensure that all citizens participate in the creation of, and benefit from, the additional social, cultural and economic wealth that will be created. STRATEGY  The Government will create an enabling environment to attract local and foreign investors through appropriate policies, legislation and improved public sector efficiency. 12 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha • The strategic intent of the government is to enable affordable access to global information to all its citizens including disadvantaged persons. • The strategy will seek to pursue a sustainable process of action and review which is based on the synergistic development of: • Education and training to develop human resources in the necessary ICT and business skills; • Use of ICT to expand the horizons and capacity of existing businesses and recruit new business to Grenada; • Deepening the use of ICT in governance to increase its efficiency and transparency in particular in support of 1 and 2 above; • The implementation of a focused promotional strategy, directed at the business and government sectors and civil society Underlying Principles   The following Principles underpin the strategy that the Government will pursue in the achievement of this Mission: • All Grenadians will have the opportunity and the means to participate in the Information Society and the Information Economy irrespective of their financial, social or educational circumstances. • The Government will actively promote the creation of the Information Society and the Information Economy via the provision of transactional on-line e-Government Services. • The Government will provide the necessary policy, institutional and regulatory framework that is required for the successful proliferation of electronic commerce. • Businesses will be encouraged to adopt electronic commerce. 13 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha • The achievement of computer literacy by all sectors of the population will be actively pursued. • The necessary measures will be taken to build up a critical mass of Information Technology specialists that will be required to sustain the growth of the Information Society and the Information Economy. Vision of Grenada in the Information Age  Over the next five years a deep transformation will take place in the Grenada society and economy. This transformation will take place as the Government, in close partnership with the private sector, strives energetically towards the attainment of an Information Society and an Information Economy. The vision is that in a few years the following will be achieved: Service will improve  Citizens will benefit from one-stop, timely, high-quality and easily accessible electronic services provided by both the Public and the Private Sectors. The Government will provide its services over the Internet and citizens will be served at whatever time of day from home or work place, while still opting to utilize traditional service channels if they so desire. Businesses will also offer their services to consumers over the Internet on a 24x7 basis. Accessibility be universal Information and Communication Technology will become fully accessible nationwide; at least 50% of the population will have connection to electronic services, and there will be widespread accessibility to services 14 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha and digital participation in economic, cultural and social life via multiple solutions that Technology now provides. Education will be Universal  The Education and Training system will • Address the formation of a knowledge society trained to take full advantage of the benefits of Information and Communication Technology. • Produce a crop of IT professionals of the highest calibre, and in the numbers required to achieve the transition to an e-Society and a K- Economy. • Promote lifelong education initiatives by the Government in partnership with the private sector, voluntary organizations and other bodies. • All citizens from all walks of life will have the opportunity to participate in the Information Society and Knowledge Economy The Economy will thrive  Grenada businesses will thrive as opportunities are opened to them by way of access to a Global Market and a reduction in internal process costs that result from the adoption of e-Commerce solutions. The widespread demand for comprehensive e-Commerce solutions and Web development will boost the local IT industry. The leap in demand by businesses for e-Commerce solutions and the implementation of e-Government Services will, in turn, generate a sizeable demand for highly skilled IT professionals. This situation will produce a significant amount of high value-added jobs for our youths. The Government will effect all its business-to-business (B2B) transactions electronically, not only in order to optimize its resource utilization, but also to encourage corresponding businesses to take up e-Commerce. B2B 15 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha electronic interaction will become a matter of course throughout the economy. Communications will be of the highest standard and will be  affordable:    The Communications infrastructure will be of the highest standards, giving users high-bandwidth, low cost, reliable and secure access to the Internet, via a host of access channels. The access channels will be used interchangeably and users will be able to interact across diverse electronic channels. Users will have the opportunity to choose among a number of Communications service-providers. The liberalization process in the telecommunications sector will bring about an overall increase in efficiency and quality of service as well as a general lowering of costs and prices to the benefit of the consumer. These improvements will enhance social inclusion as well as increase the competitiveness of the economy. STRATEGIC THRUSTS  Achieving this Vision will entail the collective effort of the forces that make up Grenadian Society and Economy. It will be achieved via a series of strategic thrusts, which will require the Government, in collaboration with the Private sector, to set the scene. The main strategic thrusts will be the following: • The undertaking of a national capacity-building exercise in collaboration with the Private Sector, aimed at the attainment of an Information Society and an Information Economy in Grenada – primarily the: • Development of a legal framework that will regulate and, more significantly, facilitate all forms of electronic interaction. 16 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha • Promotion of the widespread use of the Internet in Grenada. • Promotion of widespread utilization of e-Commerce in Grenadian businesses, and developing the Information industry in Grenada • Provision of IT and Internet education and training to all sectors of the Grenadian society. • Provision of mail and free access to e-Government Services to everyone as the means to accelerate Internet uptake. • Establishment of kiosks in selected sites to allow citizens access to e- government services • Development of a high quality and affordable telecommunications infrastructure. • The establishment of a permanent National Commission that will act as a catalyst for the ongoing development of an Information Society and an Information economy in Grenada. • The implementation of e-Government that will enable the provision of all Public Services on-line.        17 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha  BUILDING THE NATIONAL CAPACITY  INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT  The implementation of the Strategic objectives to bring about the Information Society and Economy in Grenada will require the collective efforts of the Public and Private Sectors. This public-private partnership is necessary to implement e-Government, e-Commerce, and to build the national capacities in information, knowledge, skills and the utilization of digital technologies. The Government will stimulate the development of the Information Society and the Information Economy by providing the regulatory, financial and institutional infrastructure necessary for the creation of the ideal environment, which will in turn bring about the proliferation of electronic interaction. It will encourage the private sector to develop the technical infrastructure at a national and at a micro levels and to develop and adopt e-Commerce solutions. The Private Sector will also have the opportunity to participate actively in several national capacity-building exercises.      THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE:  Government's strategy will be to enable a physical infrastructure architecture encompassing all attributes, and criteria that will allow ICT to be the medium through which Grenada will become a knowledge-based society in the Knowledge enhancement decade. In that regard, it will promote a high quality and affordable Telecommunication Infrastructure. 18 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha In addressing the need for appropriate and reliable Physical infrastructure, the Government commits to the following principles: • We will conform with all internationally accepted standards • Review all options of interconnectivity for all national and international access • We will develop an appropriate infrastructure framework and access to meet the stated objectives consistent with the socio- economic environment • Securing fast and reliable connectivity and value for money by driving through the deregulation process • Our framework will ensure that Grenada is not locked into a single supplier mode • We will provide ease of access through the provision of convenient access points nationally • We will strive to deliver affordable access consistent with our socio economic environment • We will facilitate the development of national infrastructure with the capacity to support the delivery of integrated voice, data, and video • We will continuously track and adapt developments in ICT in line with changing requirements • We will seek strategic partners to facilitate the creation of the various components of the information society • We will build capacity to ensure the delivery of integrated voice, data and video • The infrastructure will have capacity to support distance and on-line teaching and learning 19 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha • We will deploy scaleable technology which will accommodate new requirements as and when needed • The infrastructure will be deployed in such a manner as to possess full e-commerce capabilities, reflecting the need to provide for: • ICT Infrastructure • ICT Industry Development • Modernizing Government • Education and training • Regulation and Legal Infrastructure Mindful of the weaknesses in the current infrastructure, government will undertake action aimed at the following: (a) Filling gaps in Infrastructure   - Reconciling speed with due diligence and transparency of process in licensing new carriers. - Ensuring the availability of wholesale pricing from the incumbent carrier for the new carriers. - Developing local online payment facilities for E-Commerce. - Reclassification where necessary of the import duties on hardware and software to facilitate the development of ICT related business. - Provision of a joint bonded warehousing facility to improve the local distribution network especially for smaller businesses. - Working together with other Caribbean countries through OECS, CARICOM or other joint forums to define common requirements, provide integrated services and establish stronger negotiating positions. (b) Improving interconnectivity of ICT infrastructure  - Negotiating bi-lateral agreements to ensure that voice and data traffic are exchanged within the region and not routed over expensive international bandwidth. Eliminating restrictions to the provision of common regional services such as Roaming, online learning, and e-business developments. (c) Relating infrastructure provision to developing ICT  services  20 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha - Developing a mechanism to provide accurate forecasts of future local market requirements for connectivity so as to give potential suppliers of connectivity an indication of aggregate demand and thus pull through new provision; - Ensuring that the proposed business park/incubator facility has state of the art connectivity as well as 24/7 engineering support. - Ensure that the network servicing the Government of Grenada is scalable and adequately sized to meet current and future needs, especially for e-government and education (d) Developing a High Quality and affordable  Telecommunications Infrastructure  The maximization of existing telecommunications infrastructures and the opening up of competition in the field are important steps in the context of the attainment of the Information Society and Knowledge Economy Allowing the local Cable TV services provider to expand into data services to the public is a logical step both insofar as it concerns the maximization of the national telecommunications infrastructure as well as the opening up of competition in the field. Open competition in the telecommunications field, which is a stated policy direction of Government, will bring prices down and improve the service, thereby making the Internet an affordable and attractive proposition to the wider population. The liberalization of the telecommunications industry in Grenada is therefore critical for the expansion of e-Commerce. This area will now be addressed by the Private Sector, with the Government providing the regulatory environment that is necessary for the effective functioning of the sector. 21 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha DEVELOPING HUMAN RESOURCES EDUCATION AND  TRAINING  The objective is to put Knowledge at the centre of the nation's social and economic development, and secure the development of Grenada as a Knowledge Society. Education is key to this strategy as the backbone of the knowledge society whose social and economic value is already widely accepted. The aim is to use the ICT strategy to accelerate general improvements of basic skills in literacy, numeracy, and in the conduct of business and, as necessary, to deliver particular targeted education packages for current and potential employees. The target will be to reflect world standards and resources configured for local needs. DEVELOPING THE HUMAN RESOURCE CAPACITY    The Government of Grenada has long recognized the strategic importance of Education and training as the principal instrument of economic and social development. Its ICT strategy began by the placing of IT Labs in all the Secondary schools of the nation. This has already 22 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha enabled the significant growth of basic computer literacy and skills among those of school-age population. Government recognizes the need to both widen and deepen this process, and therefore undertakes to pursue the following: • We will provide an enabling environment to facilitate ICT literacy for all citizens • As a priority we will develop programmes to ensure that all Ministers, Permanent Secretaries and other Senior Officers are ICT competent • We will develop and implement an ICT public awareness program to promote the value of the use of ICT in our daily lives. • We will train the government’s workforce in the basic competencies of ICTs • We will train large numbers of persons in the labor force with relevant information technology skills that will contribute to new revenue streams that are ICT enabled • We will provide incentives for businesses to train their workforce with relevant information technology skills that will contribute to new revenue streams that are ICT enabled • We will train all teachers in the use of ICT, and in its integration in the curriculum for teaching and learning • We will ensure that all teachers are provided with a personal computer and access to the internet • We will train large numbers of persons in the labour force with the relevant information technology skills that will contribute to new revenue streams that are ICT enabled • We will encourage the emergence and development of private sector training institutions 23 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha • We will provide suitable programs to upgrade the functional literacy of all our citizens so that they are able to participate fully in the new economy • We will provide an enabling environment to ensure lifelong learning for all citizens • We will provide all our citizens with the basic competencies in the use of ICT • We will train all Teachers in the use of ICT, and ensure its integration into the Curriculum for teaching and learning • We will ensure that all teachers are provided with a personal computer and access to the Internet. The objective is to facilitate teachers having a PC in their homes to develop competencies which will enhance teaching and learning of students in the classroom. • We will establish an Technology Education Task Force to complete the development of an holistic ICT Plan for education and commence its implementation without delay. Teacher Education And Engagement  Teachers are the front line troops in the development of the e-economy in Grenada. They will be accorded the status, facilities and role of key change agents not only in delivering the skills of the next generation, but for their influence over the community. The highest priority must be given to their engagement and support. In this role, efforts would be made to create teachers’ forums and other mechanisms that help generate teacher ownership of the education element of the strategy and set detailed priorities with it. In line with Smart Partnership principles, teachers’ Union leaders will be enlisted firmly behind the strategy, recognizing the key role the K-economy approach gives to education, and the future possibilities for the expansion of the education industry. 24 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha Engaging Civil Society: Open Door Strategy            Schools and libraries will be developed as local resources centers, opening their doors to the community after normal hours for the use of the new technology. They should promote ICT and skills as an enabling tool: empowering individuals and the institutions of civil society to better achieve their current ambitions and broaden their horizons. The open- door institutions should be distinctly branded, with recognizable logos and signage, perhaps as ‘Grenada ICT Strategy Smart Partner’. The open door itself might be adopted as a symbol for the new strategy. This effort will give particular emphasis on: a. Remedial literacy teaching b. Specific Skills development c. Use of School and Community based facilities d. Involvement of NGO's This bottom-up approach should lead to attempts to develop, value and make more visible the cultural and environmental knowledge resident in Grenada itself, and market this as appropriate; The strategy should make special efforts to address the needs of the relatively disadvantaged and socially excluded members of society. This is another strategy element that not only embodies social justice but can help ensure wider recognition and social legitimacy for the initiative as a whole. Delivering Curricular Change  There are enormous opportunities for sharing experiences at a regional level at all stages of this strategy, but particularly in the development of educational provision. Properly structured dialogues involving regional participants may be one of the most cost-effective routes to opening 25 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha doors for individuals and institutions involved in education and training at all levels; However, use of ICT in education is not a panacea. Educational software can be technically smart, but socially impoverished. The changes in teaching method which the new technology typically requires at primary and secondary levels, such as allowing people to progress at their own pace, need to be also socially enhancing. Grenada and the Region need to have a reflective and evaluative rather than purely technocratic approach to managing change in curricula and teaching methods. We should aim at a teaching and learning framework and a network that add local and regional socio-cultural values to support and strengthen curriculum restructuring. At tertiary level the main curricula needs are to ensure that training in ICT reflects changing national standards so as to attract local and international entrepreneurship and capital; and to ensure that it is buttressed by the development of general business skills. Developing a consciousness of world business standards and approaches to maximize markets revenues is a key process in reinvigorating the traditional market sectors. T A Marryshow College, already developing strategic partnerships with UWI and with St George’s University, is well placed to help consolidate local needs, and select, adapt and deliver from international online education and training options in line with national requirements. Smart Partnerships in delivery should seek to also develop partnerships between public and private sector to define and share the cost of effecting specific training requirements geared to investment in jobs and infrastructure. This would include product certification and the kind of 26 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha systems and software engineering support required to underpin any policy initiative on this scale A Regional Educational And Training Role For Grenada  It is disappointing that significant amount of the ICT training for the Region takes place outside the region. This seems to be mainly a function of the lack of regional definition of goals and targets, and the absence of central focus and priority to assign resources to create a regional center of IT competence. Grenada could become the centre for regional IT Training. A strategy for establishing Grenada as a major Hub for education and training in ICT needs to be developed. It would benefit the Region, yield significant local spillovers, and expose the island and its virtual incubator/business park to new business opportunities. Education and Training objectives  The Government, in collaboration with the Private Sector, will accelerate and upgrade those initiatives aimed at providing widespread digital literacy and producing a cohort of IT specialists to satisfy the labour shortage that will inevitably occur. These initiatives will extend beyond the formal education ; and their implementation will involve the Private Sector, the Ministry of Education, other public organizations, community organizations, NGO's, and as many other interested organizations as possible. The envisaged initiatives will develop along the following lines: 27 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha (i) IT literacy in Schools   The Education initiatives in Secondary school has been a success. Those initiatives need to be deepened, and extended to the Primary schools. The original program will be evaluated and refashioned to achieve the specific ends of supplying marketable skills and competence beyond mere literacy. The implementation of widespread Internet access and the increased training of primary and Secondary school Teachers in Internet competences will also characterize the next phase of IT education. (ii) Life‐long learning   There are major segments of the adult population which had had little or no exposure to digital literacy. If they are to be enticed to utilize the new services, relevant initiatives to educate them must be undertaken. Community level training will be intensified and made easily available on a large scale. The use of the schools Lab facilities after normal school hours will be embraced to widen and speed up the process. Basic literacy skills, e-literacy skills, Internet skills, the use of standard software packages will characterize the community level training. (iii) Vocational Training and Certification  The IT literacy and competency training would be stepped up in a focused manner with a view to increasing the chances of employability of the unemployed segment of the population as well as providing digital literacy for those already in employment, thereby ensuring that the workforce will be prepared for the inevitable transformation that it will face in the coming years. Consideration would be given to providing incentives packages to firms that organize IT literacy courses for their own staff. Workers initiatives to 28 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha upgrade their computer skills will also be recognized and supported. The Private Sector institutions that offer Computer training will be encouraged to become more active. Tailored courses could be drawn up and delivered by private sector training firms, following the necessary accreditation. These firms will play a major role in the generation of IT technicians and professionals. Online training will be encouraged and promoted as an effective cost- effective rout to this end. Consideration will be given to adopting European Computer Driving License (ECDL), or its equivalent, as the official minimal requirement for IT literacy. This form of recognition is important as an ever-increasing number of employers, including the Public Service, will be looking for an official certification of IT literacy of their prospective employees. The widespread adoption of the ECDL certification will mean that the local workforce will have certification that is internationally recognized. (iv) Tertiary Education  The Government will target the TA Marryshow Community College as the focal point to spearhead development at this level. The College will be encouraged to look to joint venture approaches with universities aboard as well as the use of on-line teaching as a low cost approach to achieving our target of professional training to the level of internationally accepted competence. (v) Skill Targets  The government will encourage and support of the production of certain priority skills that will be in demand by the New Economy. The various education and training programs in the public and the private sector s will 29 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha target the development of skilled Information Technology workers, including the following: i. Keyboard skills ii. Speech and Marketing skills iii. Transcriptions iv. Programming v. Hardware assembly and maintenance vi. Scanning and digitizing vii. CAD viii. GIS ix. Animation x. Imaging xi. Desktop publishing xii. Database design, development and management xiii. Internet professional skills xiv. Network professionals (design, build, maintain). (vi) Teaching and Training in the Work‐place  Government will encourage and support the private sector efforts to develop ICT competence in the labour force. This could include a.

Links to overseas training and on-line academies (vii) We Will Modernizing The Education Process  In making the classroom relevant to the New Economy, steps will be taken to: o Re-define the content and the role of Education in the New Economy o Update and modernize the Curriculum content o Provide Computer Labs in all schools, and in some classrooms o Network ALL schools and provide system support 30 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha o Develop Electronic Libraries (Website & Links) o Promote and facilitate self-learning and life-long learning o Develop the habit and techniques of research o Teach proper regard for Copyrights and Intellectual Property o Establish a body responsible for Education Technology o Facilitate and support Distance Teaching and Learning REGULATORY AND LEGAL INFRASTRUCTURE  Objects  The objects of building a legal and regulatory infrastructure are: - To enhance the reputation of Grenada as an international e-business centre; - To facilitate electronic transactions on a technology neutral basis by means of reliable electronic records; - To remove uncertainties in conducting transactions electronically with respect to the requirements for documents and for signatures to be in writing; - To promote public confidence in the validity, integrity and reliability of conducting transactions electronically; and - To promote the development of the legal and business infrastructure necessary to implement electronic transactions securely. Regulatory policy  Transactions carried out by electronic means shall be regulated in a manner that: - Permits and encourages the growth of business by electronic means through the operation of free market forces; - Promotes the greatest possible use of industry self-regulation; - Is flexible; and - Is technologically neutral. 31 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha Legislation will be enacted to establish the legal principles for the conduct of e-commerce and the processing of electronic transactions. It would seek to provide a secure legal foundation for the conduct of various forms of electronic transactions, including the use and recognition of digital documentation, and Emails transfers on a technology neutral basis. The proposed legislation would be sufficiently flexible to accommodate new technological developments and leave room for the market to determine the future of e-commerce The legislation would provide significant flexibility, enabling parties to an electronic transaction to tailor a transaction (or series of transactions) to suit their telecommunication, legal or system requirements. An initial omnibus Electronic Transactions Bill will therefore be prepared to provide for: o Electronic Commerce: establishing a secure legal basis for electronic communications, contracts, signatures and transactions, and the establishment of a framework for Certification Authorities and their regulation. o Data Protection: to ensure the protection of data, in order to protect the rights of individuals vis-à-vis personal information. o Computer Misuse: to criminalizes offences relating to the misuse of computers and related paraphernalia. Legal provisions have already been made in the setting up of the offices of the telecommunications regulator with the establishment of ECTEL and the National Telecommunication Regulatory Commission. Some Guidelines for Legislation   32 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha New Legislation would cover major issues such as: 1. Recognition of electronic records ‐ evidentiary weight: Legislation should provide that information would not be denied legal effect, validity, admissibility or enforceability solely on the ground that it is in the form of an electronic record, or that, if such evidence is the best evidence, it will not be denied admissibility on the grounds that it is not in original form. For evidentiary purposes applied criteria should focus on the reliability of the manner in which the electronic record was generated, stored or communicated, the reliability of the manner in which the integrity of the information was maintained, or the manner in which the originator was identified. 2. Writing: Some documents are required or described as a matter of law to be \"in writing\". The legislation must provide that a legal requirement for \"writing\", or a description of something as being \"in writing\", is satisfied by an electronic record if the record is accessible and can be retained for subsequent reference. 3. Original form: Many jurisdictions require individuals or companies to maintain written records. Legislation should establish the minimum requirements for an electronic record to be regarded as the functional equivalent of an original. Where the law requires information to be presented or retained in its original form, an electronic record could be defined to meet that requirement if the integrity of the information can be reliably assured. 4. Signatures: 33 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha It is already acceptable in law that a contract could still be binding even if it is not physically signed. A signature is often only required for evidentiary purposes. The Act provides that an electronic record meets that requirement if the method of identifying the signatory meets certain requirements (i.e. an electronic signature or electronic certificate). 5. Certification Service Providers: The legislation should make provision for authorizing certification service providers to issue accredited certificates that confirm the veracity of an electronic signature. It should recognize certificates and certification service providers for any other jurisdiction. [Insurance companies have a new potential market in the insurance of the liability of such certification service providers if one of their certificates turns out to be wrongly issued, causing loss to those who relied on it. 6. Formation and validity of contracts and acknowledgement: The legal principle of offer and acceptance, developed over many centuries, is one of the basic requirements for the formation of a contract. Legislation would need to provide that an offer and the acceptance of an offer may be expressed by means of an electronic record. It should establish rules of acknowledgment of receipt of an electronic record. 7. Virtual companies Legislation would need to determine whether an offshore company, which merely offers goods and services electronically from a web site hosted in Grenada or transacts business through a server in Grenada, will be regarded as carrying on business in Grenada, and whether that company will be required to apply to the Government for a permit or incorporate a Grenada company; whether an overseas company with 34 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha merely “virtual” presence status can claim to do business in Grenada by using, for example, a Grenada address or Grenadian domain name. 8. Encryption: The legislation must make provision for regulations respecting the lawful acquisition, use, import and export of encryption programs or other encryption methods. The Police must be empowered to seize encryption software. Magistrates/Judges must be empowered to direct persons to provide assistance necessary to decode encrypted information. 9. Liability of intermediaries: The legislation should make provision for clear definition of the liabilities of Internet Service Providers, and others, for information transmitted over the Internet. The legislation may determine that an ISP or other intermediary who acts only as a conduit is not liable for the content of electronic records provided that the intermediary has no actual knowledge or is not aware of facts that would objectively indicate a likelihood of civil or criminal liability in respect of material on the intermediary’s network. 10. Personal data (Data protection): Legislation should make provision for the protection of personal data. Provision should be made for the development of standards relating to personal data. 11. Standards and Code of Conduct Key Principles Standards must be established to guide the quality of transactional behaviour of intermediaries and e-commerce service providers, to protect the name and reputation of Grenada as an international business centre. 35 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha The Standards should apply to intermediaries and e-commerce service providers who are carrying on a trade or business or conducting commercial transactions or services in or from within Grenada, or which are identified with Grenada, and whose transactions or services either themselves take place electronically or which assist others to do so, or which relate to business carried out electronically. Intermediaries and e-commerce service providers shall be required to observe Business Procedures and make every reasonable effort to introduce and maintain systems, procedures and practices which achieve material realization of the Standards Minimum standards for intermediaries and e-commerce service providers would include: (i) Observation of Business Integrity; avoid prohibited and undesirable activities (ii) Knowing the Customer, and not knowingly aid or abet any undesirable activities. (iii) Knowing their Own Business well; informing themselves and exercising good judgments so as not knowingly to render any service in respect of any electronic record or information which contravenes or which ought reasonably to be considered as likely to contravene or already to have contravened the established laws. (iv) Protecting Personal Data, and accordingly respect the privacy, accuracy and security of personal information. (v) Avoiding Abusive Usage; (e.g. not sending bulk unsolicited emails, or seeking unauthorized access to other peoples’ systems or seeking to interrupt other people’s use of electronic communications, or enabling others to do so. 36 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha (vi) Advertising Truthfully; and accordingly not misleading customers as to the nature, quality or purposes of goods or services sold through the business. (vii) Dealing Fairly and Openly with Customers, and accordingly trading and settling with customers in an honest transparent manner which has regard to the reputation of Grenada as an international business centre. (viii) Settling Complaints and Disputes Quickly and Fairly, and accordingly establishing convenient methods of receiving and dealing with complaints and for the swift, convenient and fair settlement of disputes. 37 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha          FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE  The financial system is critical to the growth of the New Economy, to the development of e-Commerce and to the introduction and expansion of electronic methods of payments in Grenada. If the Commercial Banks, Insurance companies and other financial institutions are reluctant to participate in the cutting edge of e-Commerce development in Grenada then it becomes impossible for Country to exploit these new developments, and Grenada will be left behind in the backwaters of under development. Mindful of this the Government will seek to encourage the financial institutions to play a positive, innovative and aggressive role in the emergence of the e-economy in Grenada. The Government therefore proposes to embark on a positive and supportive course of action, including the following: We will encourage and support the establishment of an Association of Bankers in Grenada We will encourage and support the introduction of electronic payment technologies for domestic and foreign purchases We will encourage the development of electronic banking including Internet banking We will encourage and support the development of electronic inter-bank transactions and settlements including \"switching\" and common ATM's We will encourage banks and other financial agencies to provide special and concessionary loan packages to facilitate the purchases of computers by householders of all income groups; and to facilitate Grenada's Small Business sector. 38 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha We will utilize electronic technologies to facilitate and simplify the payments of public servants through the commercial banks We will introduce appropriate legal reforms to encourage and support electronic financial transitions, electronic legal communications and electronic documentation We will commit at least 5% of the National Budget to ICT promotion and development We will approach and negotiate with external agencies for funding and technical assistance for the ICT sector We will encourage foreign private direct investment into the local ICT sector DEVELOPMENT OF ICT INDUSTRY  (a) Key Principles - The vision of ICT is to be used as a tool to enable economic growth and not the exclusive source of that growth. - ICT would be the basis for new business as well as a means to increase the efficiency and marketability of established sectors. Concentrating on the latter in the early stages of the exercise may yield early benefits and will be a route to wider social identification with the policy; - The capital requirements for implementation of ICT for economic growth in Grenada will necessitate creative (Smart) partnerships between government the private sector and other funding sources including civil society. However where tax revenues are expended for that purpose, there should be prior input/output analysis to ensure net positive returns on the investment. - The potential for synergy should be a guiding principle in the identification of entrants and a strong element in promoting Grenada. (b) Fostering Entrepreneurship - For ICT business to flourish it requires a suitable enabling environment as will facilitate business development in general. 39 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha - One specific thrust should be developing business as well as ICT competencies to world-class standards. - Creation of a network to provide continually updated information about the ICT sector in order to enable National and Regional companies to update standards and reach new markets. - Enable the growth of local business through affirmative action measures consistent with WTO agreements. Removal of barriers to entrance should be considered in co-ordination with the development of incentives. - The Smart Partnership concept of “prosper thy neighbour” should underpin the relationships between participants in this new economy. - Use ICT to create a virtual business incubator which would handshake to venture capital, provide business advice, help protect Intellectual Property Rights, audit technology and access markets. (c) Access to Capital - Public/Private (Smart) partnerships may provide funding to jumpstart certain ICT industries, with private sector funding as the preferred source for capital. - In addition to the traditional sources, innovative funding mechanisms such as the existing ICT training loans and the use of Mutual Fund (Unit Trust) arrangements to wider social participation in the new economy, should be explored. (d) Encouraging IT investment by the Private Sector The Government will promote IT investment in the private sector. It will assist and facilitate those businesses that are willing to invest in hardware, software and technical assistance targeted at e-Commerce solutions and web-presence. The existing aids to investment schemes will be fine-tuned to cater for this particular type of investment. In addition, the Government will nurture existing and new IT businesses, whether locally or foreign owned. A special package of incentives will be drawn up with the specific intent of building up this sector. Government recognizes that market forces themselves that will push the growth of the local IT industry as well as the widespread uptake of eCommerce solutions by Grenada businesses. The role of the Government will be to ensure that any barriers and unnecessary regulation that might inhibit such growth are 40 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha removed, and that the necessary aids to investment in this field are readily available. (e) Work Space Infrastructure The establishment of workspace for the provision of jobs has become one of the elements of incentive to attract investors operating in a knife-edge competitive environment. Government will seek to promote the availability of workspace, including factory shells and office buildings. Private sector partners will also be encouraged to invest in developing these facilities. Government will consider positively a joint approach to such ventures. The object will be to encourage the location of such facilities in areas of relevant an advantageous infrastructure, and where there is a catchment of trained and trainable human resource. Advantage will be taken of the existence of available unused structures that lend themselves to easy conversion. Government will consider the provision of such workspace that would allow for economies in the use of shared facilities, infrastructure, and transmission equipment The Grenada Industrial Development Corporation already has active plans for the provision of 20-30,000 square metres of workspace in a location near to the Point Salines international Airport Modernizing Government  Key principles The Government of Grenada has clearly recognized that developing a K- economy in the context of globalization requires an adaptive government, fast on its feet to identify and exploit new opportunities. It also requires increased efficiencies in the provision of public services, to yield new revenue streams within government, and thereby create space for investment in changing priorities. Within the current structure of government, a number of initiatives might be considered that embody the best of the ‘new public sector management’ techniques noticeable 41 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha in Europe and North American in the last decade or so. The principle of separating policy setting and evaluation, on the one hand, from service delivery, on the other, opens the possibility of excising some public services on a case-by-case basis and contracting out their delivery by quasi-independent agencies or public-private partnerships. These models will be actively explored. Like other elements of this strategy, employing ICT to modernize government must express clear utility values which would set criteria for determining the priority for implementation; If the aim of gearing up Grenada’s economy is to be achieved through this strategy, virtually every investment in ICT to achieve efficiency and transparency in public service delivery must be justified by its support to the other objectives set out in this Strategic Plan. Most notable amongst these are the development of e-commerce and the provision of an enabling environment for world-class ICT industry; The implementation of e-Government as a major strategic thrust in the engendering of an Information Society and an Information Economy is vital to the overall national effort of creating the knowledge-based economy in Grenada. Accordingly, the implementation of a modernized e-Government programme will be configured around the following: - As part of the Public Sector Reform programme, - As a means of providing improved quality service to the Public, - In providing cost-effective solutions to several management problems in Government - Lowering costs - Maximizing revenues - Modernizing the level of efficiency in the public sector. 42 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha Government is both a user and a provider of services. In both cases, it is a large and dominant player in the economy. Its roles and impact will be major determinants of the pace of ICT development in Grenada. Government will take the lead to initiate advances in IT by increasing its e- Government services to the population. In doing so the Government will follow the following strategy: - Building e-government presence (Portal and websites) - Thinking big (Plan the full range of service and coverage) - Starting small (start with what can be readily deliverable ) - Scaling up fast (expand the service quickly in response to citizens' demand) The overall goal of the Grenada's e-government strategy will be citizen- centric, focusing on the delivery of improved levels of customer service and enhanced citizen satisfaction. It will begin with information, and quickly graduate to various electronic transactions to meet citizens' demand and readiness. In addition to citizen satisfaction, e-government will focus on efficiency factors, cost reduction and revenue generation.    INSTITUTIONAL & MANAGERIAL INFRASTRUCTURE  The Plan seeks to: 1. Propose leadership/Director for the entire process. 2. Establish a national coordinating advisory council headed by a private sector professional and comprising of private sector, public sector and NGO representatives. This body will report to the Minister of ICT. 43 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha 3. Create the government entity (Central Information Management Agency, CIMA) with the responsibility for the completion of the development of the Plan and to take ownership for its implementation. Amongst others, this body will serve as a secretariat to the national coordinating body and mobilize the national effort in the delivery of the ICT Plan 4. Appoint an executive level director/leader within the new entity with responsibility to deliver the plan. The person should be of high technological and managerial capability and experience. 5. Develop a Budget for the entity for the management, completion and implementation of the strategic ICT Plan 6. Develop a strategy for mobilizing the finance required to implement the national IT programme. The establishment of a technology development/loan fund offers one approach. 7. Identify those aspect of the Plan that requires immediate implementation 8. Conduct national surveys to determine the capital and intellectual stock as it relates to ICT 9. As a matter of urgency establish an Educational Technology Task Force to complete the development of an holistic ICT plan for education and commence its implementation. 10. Establish Technology Evaluation And Procurement Council to interface between government and the vendors of technology systems in the ICT sector. 44 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha PROMOTING UNIVERSAL UPTAKE OF THE INTERNET   A major challenge to the Government in the implementation of the Information Society and K-economy will be the stimulation of the demand for e-Commerce and Public e-Services. The Government will, together with entities in the business sector and in collaboration with the telecommunications carriers and ISP's, and other service providers undertake a concerted Communications Strategy targeted at the take- up of e-Business solutions by businesses; and Internet and e-Commerce usage by individual and corporate citizens. Three potential initiatives will be aimed at promoting the popularization and use of the Internet in Grenada in order to justify e-commerce and e- Government, and to build capacity utilization at a national level. These are: - The dissemination of e-mail on a national scale - The creation of a Grenada Internet Exchange - National Free Grenada Internet The Dissemination of e-mail on a national scale E-mail is considered to be one of the first and fundamental e-services to implement. It is therefore proposed that a national e-mail system be established allowing all citizens to be addressable and reachable in electronic format and to be able to access and utilize an e-mail account. In the context of e-government, the automatic addressability of all potential users of the service would be a major benefit. The availability of a single address which could be used for life would, apart from promoting a strong e-government presence, and encouraging 45 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha e-commerce, would facilitate the adoption of a Certification Authority related to the issuance of qualified certificates vis-à-vis advanced electronic signatures required for access to e-Government services, since each certificate issued to a citizen for the purposes of effecting secure transactions with the e-government service must be associated with a specific e-address. A Common National Database would be required and each person could be automatically allocated an e-address. The e-addresses would be initially marked inactive, and would only become fully active upon completion of a free voluntary registration procedure. The registration procedure should include an opt-in option to additionally list all registered users in a publicly available web-based e-mail directory. The national e-mail system should be available either free of charge or at an low basic cost. The access path should be Internet based, preferably through the use of a web interface, ( although it is envisaged that other alternatives based on a simple dial-up or other mechanisms could be available). It is recommended that the e-address allocated to each person would be a permanent one. Users should be able to easily configure their address to redirect e-mail to any other email address of their choosing. This would allow every person to be contactable at a single address, even if the user were to opt for an alternative commercial Service Provider in the future. The creation of a Grenada National Internet Exchange The lack of a local Grenadian Internet backbone will result in routes to Grenadian sites having to pass over international connections. Expensive, over-subscribed and over-utilised bandwidth will result in poor performance of Grenadian Sites. Good performance is key to the rapid 46 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha uptake of a web-site. It is estimated that if a site does not appear on screen within 8 seconds most users will “click away” It is therefore recommended that a local Internet backbone be established. An Exchange entity could operate as a Hub for all the connections or alternatively a funded consortium could be created. Either solution would enable local traffic to remain within the local network and utilize cheap high bandwidth connections. This would prove beneficial to the uptake of e-Government services and for local e-Business in general. National Free Grenadian Internet A classic chicken-and-egg scenario hinders the uptake of an Internet economy. A strong local presence from Grenada businesses on the Internet will not develop until a critical mass of Internet users is established in order to make the Internet a viable alternative distribution and marketing channel. On the other hand, a critical mass of users will not develop until there is a strong enough local presence and content on the Internet. This would make the use of the Internet an attractive proposition to the public, in that they would be able to access a rich array of relevant and useful local content. The success of e-Government and the e-Economy therefore depend on resolving this issue: on the one hand a critical mass of users must be established, while at the other end suitable and useful content must be provided and published. The development of the Government Site and the eGovernment Services site will provide useful content. However, uptake may still be slow due to the current exceedingly high cost of an Internet connection. 47 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha It is therefore recommended that a National Free Grenadian Internet system be created to supplement the National E-mail System, and give unrestricted Internet access to sites located in Grenada. It is to be clarified that any eventual implementation of a Grenada Internet Service can only come about after the Grenada Internet Exchange would be up and running. Otherwise any access to Grenadian sites would only be possible via international lines. Apart from the slowness of the service, another constraint would be the prohibitive cost entailed in the utilization of international lines. The adoption of the Grenada Internet Exchange would surmount these hurdles, and make the implementation of a National Free Grenada Internet System a realistic proposition. This service could be implemented in two phases: o Phase 1 would establish the service and provide free access to the e-Government site. o Phase 2 would entail introducing various Grenadian sites to the Free Internet Service. The service would be voluntary and subject to prior agreement with the local ISP's. Navigation by users in local sites would be limited to local content and links to international sites would be de-activated. Actual placement of individual sites on the Free Internet Service would be carried out on an individual ISP / site basis so as to filter out any questionable material. It is recommended that a Code of Conduct be drawn up to serve as a policy for the filtered sites. An effective Call Centre service has to be established to help new users in the use of the system. The call centre would operate as a help desk and first line of support. Easy to read leaflets and handbooks would provide an added benefit. The Free National Internet Service, would be a Government-led initiative set at promoting widespread use of the Internet. It is, however, underlined that the Free National Internet Service, should it be taken up, would be an 48 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha initiative that is completely independent of the official e-Government activity, and should be clearly seen to be so. The following funding alternatives will need to be investigated to ensure that the service is maintainable: Government Subsidy Sponsorship: Advertising: Strategic partners: Financial contributions by ISP's: The following access methods seem viable: o Central dialup: A central dialup facility is the most fundamental access service and is mandatory for easy access to all areas of users. o Cable Modems / Set-top boxes: It is estimated that over 10,000 households have access to cable and would be capable of receiving fast cable modem access. Such a service would be distributed with various endpoints. o ASDL / Frame-relay / ISDN for businesses: Businesses may want to benefit from the email and local Internet access facilities. This aspect is important for two reasons: - Businesses are willing to invest in the technology, thus giving employees a window to the portal. - As more businesses go online, the critical mass of users requiring access to businesses will grow exponentially. 49 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha  DEVELOPING ELECTRONIC COMMERCE    Constant technological innovation with respect to Internet access has aided in the expansion of on-line trade, thus enabling larger segments of the population to have the possibility to share in the benefits of on-line commercial transactions and enabling companies – including small and medium sized enterprises – to become part of the process, with an attendant increase in competitiveness and scale. The available indicators show that the greatest impetus to the growth and development of electronic commerce is taking place in the business-to- business sector (B2B). As part of this process, and in relation to the international marketing of goods and services, advances are being made in at least two respects: a) Through the adoption of electronic commerce as a tool for enterprises to market goods and services on the international market, by putting into service web sites/ electronic sites designed for that purpose such as “vertical markets” or “business community” type structures. b) Through the development of technology platforms such as the Internet, which make it possible to address operational aspects of the international marketing of goods and services by digitizing the procedures and documentation involved. It is useful to review some of the advantages and potential benefits of the promotion and introduction of e-commerce in the economic environment. THE IMPACT OF ECOMMERCE ON THE ECONOMY  e-Commerce is the driver of what is termed the New economy. Its exponential growth is spurring Governments to promote its utilization within the respective national economies. The e-Europe Draft Action Plan lists 50 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha the acceleration of e-Commerce within the European Union as a major objective in the immediate future. It is envisaged that the onset of e-Commerce will have significant effects on individual businesses and will result in an aggregate impact on the national economy and, as a result, on society. e-Commerce is not limited the national economy. The key feature of e- Commerce is its ability to transcend national and geographical boundaries. The challenge is for local businesses to retain their domestic markets in the face of external e-Commerce competition, while at the same time gaining a foothold internationally by marketing and selling via e-Commerce. The risks and opportunities to local business emanating from new e-Commerce scenario will vary by business sector and target market, and entrepreneurial drive. Overall, it is reasonable to assume that unless e-Commerce solutions are taken up by local business, the local economy will be at a disadvantage in the face of external e-Commerce competition. This disadvantage will increase over time as external e-Commerce continues to increase. The need for Grenada businesses to maintain the pace with overseas competition is therefore paramount. Another important feature that characterizes e-Commerce is the gains to be had from the streamlining of business processes for higher efficiency and cost effectiveness. In general, business should gain from the transition to e-Commerce via the following positive effects: o A general increase in productivity. o A more streamlined interface between production and sales. o Better stock management, potentially leading to 'just in time' stock management. 51 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha o A significant reduction in distribution costs especially for those products that can be digitized. o A reduction in the costs of after-sales service. o Enhanced advertising and selling in the global market at a lower cost. o An expansion of the IT sector as demand for e-Commerce solutions increase. o Increased turnover for the telecommunications sector as a direct result of the proliferation of e-Commerce. On a sectoral level the impact of e-Commerce will not be uniform. Overall, however it is still envisaged that it is unlikely that such an impact will be negative. The Business Sector should therefore look to e- Commerce as providing an opportunity to thrive rather than a threat to its livelihood. The following are some observations relative to the major sectors of the Economy: (i) Information Technology and Communication The IT industry is a major input and a key enabler to the proliferation of e- Commerce. As such it is reasonable to expect this sector to expand in line with the growth of e-Commerce. It is acknowledged that the sale of IT products is increasingly being carried out by electronic means that bypass traditional intermediaries. It is recognized that there will be the need for a substantial amount of related services that need to be carried out on the field. Strategic alliances with major suppliers of e-Commerce, off-the-shelf solutions, adding value via marketing, customization, installation, support and maintenance of hardware and software will open opportunities for Grenadian enterprises. 52 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha Web development and Internet Service Provision should generate increases in activity as more businesses go on-line. The expansion of e-Commerce is likely to be sustained as more powerful hardware and software are continuously developed. e-Commerce solutions will in turn generate constant demand for improved solutions by businesses that are already utilizing e-Commerce. Communications is another major input sector to e-Commerce. The high increase in demand for e-Commerce solutions are in turn becoming more complex, and therefore require increasingly higher bandwidth. Grenada will need to ensure that the requirements of the economy are satisfied. New technologies and emerging technologies will open new opportunities with far-reaching implications, as e-Commerce becomes accessible via mobile telephony. The same can be said of the developments taking place in digital Television. These technological developments in the communications field will, in turn, fuel the demand for e-Commerce, as it becomes increasingly accessible to the consumer. (ii) Banking, finance and Business Services The financial services sector is an information-intensive industry with an established IT infrastructure. The adoption of e-Commerce in this sector will continue to bring about reductions in operating costs. The local banking system will benefit in that it will not need to expand its existing front-office outlets in order to expand business. The Banks are already somewhat proactive on this front, and the provision of ATM services and telebanking have already eased the pressure on the traditional Branch front-offices. Increased utilization of e-Banking services by clients and bill payments over the Internet, will result in further cost savings to the Banks. Competition will be required to drive the banks to pass on a portion of these savings to consumers in the form of reduced charges. 53 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha It is also likely that Banks will be able to develop the provision of new services for their customer base. The business services sector includes professional services such as architectural services, consulting engineering services, computer services, legal and accounting services and marketing and business management services. These services are characterized by high information content that can be digitized with relative ease, and therefore lend themselves well to the e-Commerce environment. Internal cost savings via streamlining of work processes, as well as savings in cost and time in delivering products to clients, are the main features that render e- Commerce a viable proposition in this sector. From an external perspective, the use of e-Commerce in business services is an increasingly global phenomenon. The adoption of e-Commerce in this sector is therefore necessary both in order to maintain a competitive edge, as well as to be able to gain or increase access to overseas markets. Other professional services such as Real Estate and Employment Services also stand to gain from cost savings by bringing buyers and sellers to interact electronically in the pre-negotiation stages. The audio-visual features that the Internet now offers, make such interaction an additionally feasible and attractive proposition. These can facilitate business by offering such features as virtual tours of real estate for sale, or brief video clips of job-types that are on offer. (iii) Manufacturing In general the e-Commerce offers an excellent opportunity for manufacturing concerns to market and sell their products on the international markets. Manufacturers could possibly reap advantages via the reduction of processing costs, mainly by way of reduction of inventory levels and the speeding up of ordering, delivery and payment processes. 54 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha Further cost savings may be obtained in certain instances from the shortening of the distribution chain, that is by dealing with consumers directly, thereby removing one or more layers of intermediaries. The potential advantages, however, would have to be weighed against potential increases in distribution costs and after-sales servicing, which may in certain cases render direct selling unprofitable. (iv) Tourism and related Services The benefits to the tourism sector will stem from the global exposure that on-line marketing and on-line-booking facilitates. This applies to the hospitality industry as well as ancillary services such as car-hire and excursions. It is nevertheless acknowledged that the success of the local tourist sector to market and sell on-line will depend on a concerted drive to sell Grenada as a tourist destination. (v) Retail In general e Commerce may be seen as a direct competitor with the traditional retail sector. This is more so, however, in areas where products may be digitized and delivered on-line, such as in the case of software or CD's. Direct on-line shopping is likely to reinforce catalogue buying to the detriment of local retailers. It is nevertheless probable that there will still be a preference on the part of the consumer for direct contact with the retailer. However, local retailers can and should avail themselves of the facility of on-line marketing and selling to local consumers. 55 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha The retail sector should look to e-Commerce as a challenge rather than a threat. THE IMPACT OF ECOMMERCE ON SOCIETY  The following are some observations relative to the impact of e- Commerce on Society: (i) Employment It is reasonable to assume that there will be significant shifts in the skills required in this new environment. It is evident that the need for IT and Information management skills will increase in line with the trend currently prevailing in the leading World economies. The recent e-Europe Draft Action plan quotes a current shortfall of 700,000 IT specialists, which is expected to rise to 1.3million by 2003. Grenada's shortage has not been as overt, partly because the intensity of ICT is being stifled by a number of structural factors. The initiatives of the Government in liberalizing the sector will release market forces that will create pressures for greater supply of skills. Labour requirements in other sectors such as the intermediary sector may decline, but may in turn be offset by increased demand for labour in other sectors, which experience increased demand for their goods and services generated by e-Commerce. It is not possible to predict the net effect beyond stating that the demand for IT skills will experience a substantial increase which may, for a time, be beyond the capability of the educational system to meet in adequate numbers. It is worthwhile to 56 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha add that the onset of e-Commerce is generally considered as an opportunity rather than a threat to job creation. “Tele-working” is another area for potential job-creation in of the knowledge-based economy, bringing back into the market the less advantaged groups such as women, older workers and persons with special needs. The proliferation of e-Commerce will render Tele-working a more viable and attractive prospect than it has been to date. (ii) The advantages to the Consumer The consumer is seen to benefit in the new scenario. E-Commerce will bring about greater choice and price reductions due to increased competition and improved production and distribution processes. It should also result in a better quality of life by freeing up quality time that would otherwise be spent traveling and queuing up to obtain a service across the counter. Procurement of public and private sector goods can be made from the comfort of the home potentially on a 24-hour, seven- days-a-week (24x7) basis. The opening up of access to a host of goods is not to be viewed from the narrower viewpoint of tangible goods. The cultural and educational content that will be available on the Internet is another precious resource that will raise the level of knowledge of users. Distance learning has been a feature of education provision for some time but can now be supplied at a much higher quality. Interactivity will also be a very important feature of distance learning in an Internet environment. 57 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha DEVELOPING THE ELECTRONIC COMMERCE SECTOR  The Internet and electronic commerce represent significant social and economic potential for countries of CARICOM and Western Hemisphere. Dynamic national strategies to develop infrastructure, to enhance access, to increase participation in the Internet economy especially for SMEs, and to create the legal foundations for online payments, electronic signatures and certification are critical for the development of e-commerce. At the same time, since e-commerce is inherently borderless and global in scope, measures to enable and promote domestic growth must also be contemplated to allow the effective conduct of e-commerce between countries Government of Grenada has important roles to play with respect to these issues, within the country, within CARICOM, the Americas and globally, which entails cooperation, information dissemination and promotion activities. Government will focus on those critical requirements that will facilitate the development of e-Commerce in Grenada, including access and Infrastructure, Small and Medium Sized enterprises as major beneficiaries of the technologies, Online Payment Systems, Certification and Authentication, Consumer Protection, Intellectual Property Protection, and Online Distribution of content. 58 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha A. ACCESS AND INFRASTRUCTURE While the number of Internet users in the Grenada is growing rapidly, there are still significant segments of the population that do not have ready access to the Internet. The challenge for the government is to encourage the development of a vibrant, high-quality, low-cost telecommunications infrastructure which all citizens have the opportunity to access. Grenada already recognizes the importance of expanding access to the Internet for purposes of economic growth and development. Steps have already been taken to progressively liberalize the telecommunications market; particularly the local telephone service. Government has encouraged and facilitated investment in the development of telecommunications infrastructure, higher penetration and lower prices for consumers and businesses. There is still need to - Acc elerate the granting of new licenses for additional telecommunication and Internet service providers - Stim ulate Internet usage; encourage local content development, and e- commerce - which in turn should stimulate further investment in the e- commerce infrastructure; - Red uce the cost of leased lines used to connect to the Internet backbone by 59 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha allowing competition, and/or by regulating prices set by the dominant operator. - Mak e it cheaper to get and stay on-line, especially through lower per-minute cost or flat rate prices for local service. This would significantly increase both the number of individuals on-line and the time each user spends on- line; In addition to physical networks, the widespread growth of electronic commerce as a means of doing business depends a wide array of factors (i.e. the e-Commerce value- chain) including the existence and accessibility of a range of goods, services and procedures, such as telecommunications services, electronic payment systems, transportation and distribution systems, as well as legal or regulatory factors such as the enforceability of electronic contracts and efficient customs clearance procedures. Access also relies on the existence of adequate levels of digital literacy since the knowledge, skills and familiarity of citizens with computer technologies will determine their ability to take advantage of electronic commerce. Measures to expand digital literacy throughout the population will not only increase the overall growth of e-commerce but also tend to assure a more even distribution of its benefits within society. The government of Grenada therefore places high priority on computer awareness, education and training as a means of promoting access to the networks and technologies related to e-commerce. 60 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha Government will therefore pursue the following to facilitate the development of e-Commerce: 1. Promote vibrant and fair competition: 1.1. Among different levels of telecommunications services (that could be suppliers of telecommunications and computing hardware, telecommunications carriers, telecommunications resellers, and associated services suppliers such as e-commerce services suppliers). 1.2. Among telecommunications services provided through all types of technological means (including wireline, wireless, cable, and satellite technologies). 1.3. In the allocation of fundamental resources such as spectrum and rights-of-way. 1.4. Through oversight by National Telecommunications Regulatory Commission to ensure that no anti-competitive conditions arise. 2. Maintain an independent, effective, fair and transparent oversight body. The National Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (NTRC) and Eastern Caribbean Telecommunication Authority (ECTEL) are critical in setting the tone for the telecommunications market, and will be key in providing regulatory certainty, ensuring non-discriminatory treatment of market participants (both domestic and foreign), and in preventing anti- competitive behavior. This healthy environment will provide the certainty requisite in attracting large investments required for infrastructure development and service provision. 3. Allow the marketplace to decide how to expand the availability of data-capable infrastructure (wire line, wireless, cable, satellite, etc.) able to support electronic commerce applications. As technological platforms converge to a similar set of capabilities, the Government of Grenada would promote competition across communications platforms through technology-neutral regulations. 4. The Government of Grenada will allow the free development of Internet services to continue by avoiding the imposition of regulations that might impede its development. 61 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha 5. Government will support regulatory regimes that permit a broad range of pricing strategies (including un-metered rates, for services used to access the Internet and adopt cost-based approaches to interconnection pricing). 6. Ensure that all information service providers have access to facilities, networks, and network services, (including access to local loop) on a nondiscriminatory and cost-based basis. 7. Take steps to facilitate efficient testing and certification procedures for IT products. 8. Seek to provide access and affordable service to all members of society: 8.1. Administer Universal Service programs for basic telephone service in a transparent, nondiscriminatory, and competitively neutral manner, so as to be no more burdensome than necessary. 8.2. Place governmental information and services online, in order to provide them more efficiently and effectively, and to increase the uptake of information technologies by business and citizens. 8.3. Maximize efforts to bring voice and data services to under-served populations, by coordinating efforts from all social sectors involved. 9. Take steps to improve e-commerce fulfillment, including implementation of the business facilitation measures for express shipments (agreed to at the Toronto Ministerial). 10. Develop a clear, predictable, nondiscriminatory, stable yet flexible legal and regulatory framework, which is conducive to the expansion of access to information and telecommunication technologies. 11. With the support and collaboration of the public and private sector, place a high priority on computer awareness, education, and training as a means of promoting access to the networks and technologies related to e-commerce B. SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED ENTERPRISES Small and medium sized enterprises are an important and dominant part of the national economy, and Grenada can greatly benefit from the 62 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha creativity and entrepreneurship that can come from small businesses. Attractive potential opportunities exist for SMEs in the exploitation of electronic commerce. Both research studies and business experience in other countries indicate that the adoption of electronic commerce will enable SMEs to continue to lead in the development of jobs and growth, and to create new forms of commerce and to improve the standard of living in individual jurisdictions. In many ways, SMEs are in a strong position to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the Internet and e- commerce. They tend to be more flexible, adaptable and quick to respond to new technologies and market opportunities as they lack the management layers and bureaucracies that encumber decision-making. Many SMEs recognize the Internet as a valuable means to promote their product, establish a corporate presence on the Web and provide customer service. But, although the Internet can vastly expand the potential market available to SMEs in Grenada, the challenges of electronic commerce are more acute for SMEs than for larger business enterprises. SMEs' limited resources make them more vulnerable to fraud and failure, and often more reluctant to take on the risks associated with new ventures such as e-commerce. Another challenge facing SMEs' participation in e- commerce is the shortage of trained technical workers who can effectively manage the changing technology and fully tap opportunities to increase efficiency, lower supply costs, and reach new markets. SMEs may be less able to devote resources to attracting and retaining technically qualified workers. Both the private sector and the government, jointly and separately, can assist with policies and programs to help solve the problems of SMEs. 63 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha The Government of Grenada will therefore: 1. Encourage SMEs to familiarize themselves with available electronic commerce tools, by undertaking activities to disseminate information on options, opportunities and challenges and to promote the use of electronic commerce and telecommunication technologies, in order to improve participation in international markets. 2. Continue to cooperate with and encourage the private sector to offer educational opportunities (including via the Internet) and to disseminate information on the advantages and benefits of using new technologies to conduct commercial transactions and to improve overall efficiency and productivity by integrating electronic commerce into business operations. 3. Support cooperation and promote efforts by local business organizations and small and medium sized enterprises to develop Websites where SMEs can network, post information, and exchange ideas about best practices and lessons learned, in order to facilitate investment, job creation, increased competitiveness, and the use of more advanced technologies. 4. Support the search for solutions to the obstacles faced by SMEs in fully utilizing electronic commerce, encouraging companies that provide electronic commerce business services to develop products tailored to the needs of SMEs and to cooperate with these companies to develop and promote SME export portals, affordable and secure payment systems, SME training programs, and regional technical centers. 5. Continue national efforts to make government products and services available via the Internet, helping SMEs to build their Internet skills. C. ONLINE PAYMENT SYSTEMS The availability of effective electronic payment systems is a significant element of electronic commerce, enabling wholesale and retail businesses to move their business-to-business (B2B) and business-to- 64 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha consumer (B2C) marketing and sales onto the web with minimal concerns about completing the financial portion of the transaction. However, the on-line environment presents challenges related to fraud, security risks, consumer protection and privacy protection that should be adequately addressed. In addition, the cross-border supply of payment services raises issues about the standards and roles applicable to domestic payment systems and their interoperability with foreign systems, and about the level of consumer protection available for consumers who make use of foreign payment systems. Grenada (and the CARICOM Region) could benefit from participation in the burgeoning electronic payments markets associated with e- commerce. Today, payment systems based on credit cards are widely perceived to be inadequate, as credit cards are unavailable for many potential e-commerce consumers in Grenada and relatively expensive for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including retailers. Many have identified these issues as contributing to the relatively slow entrance by existing bricks-and-mortar retailers into e-commerce and to the relatively low levels of consumer purchases on the Internet. New technologies for payment are underway in the region that should help address these problems for both business and consumers. For B2C e- commerce, and some SME applications, banks and other e-commerce companies should explore new approaches to supplement traditional methods. These options could include e-commerce charges and payments incorporated into existing utility bills; taking advantage of existing credit relationships, use of debit cards, new payment technologies such as bar code scanning, smart cards, electronic wallets and cellular telephones; prepaid cards with small amounts of purchasing power for 65 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha citizens who lack access to traditional credit. But there is more work to be done. The continued growth in electronic commerce depends significantly upon the development of an efficient and secure cross-border financial services infrastructure. CARICOM Governments, the financial sector and retailers need to look at payment systems that can be used to support e- commerce in the Region if they are to accelerate the growth of e- commerce and broaden its benefits for the Region's citizens. The relationships between financial institutions and their online business customers will become increasingly complex and interdependent. The ability of financial institutions to meet their customers' transactional needs (investment, cash management and foreign exchange needs) as part of online payment support services will be critical to the customer's ability to compete in global e-commerce. Local financial institutions must therefore act with cautious haste if they are not to impede the country's prospects for taking commercial advantage of these new opportunities. The international private sector is responding quickly to develop electronic payment solutions to enable e-commerce. Our local private sector must move with innovative speed to secure a share of the benefits of e-commerce before it is too late. The Government will encourage and support the introduction of effective and secure payment systems. The Government of Grenada also recognizes the advantages of a Regional approach to this matter of payments and will also encourage its development. 66 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha Further, Grenada adopts and incorporates the Regional position accepted in the context of the FTAA. Accordingly, Grenada undertakes and will agree with Regional Governments to: 1. Work cooperatively with Regional Governments, and with the private sector, as electronic payment systems develop, in order to keep apprised of policy implications and to ensure that governmental activities flexibly accommodate the needs of the emerging marketplace. 2. Build on the existing work of governments, the private sector, and international organizations to improve information sharing and cooperation in combating security threats to payments systems, cross-border fraud, illicit financial transactions, and threats to the integrity of the Internet. 3. Examine, with the private sector, online payment systems, with a view to removing possible obstacles to the deployment of alternative online payment methods, thereby accelerating participation in B2B e-commerce, especially by SMEs, and fostering efforts to provide greater access to innovative technologies for Internet purchases by consumers and SMEs without traditional access to credit. 4. Develop policies in conjunction with the private sector that foster flexible, innovative approaches in the development of alternative payment mechanisms. Efforts should be directed at improving the efficiency and lowering the costs while ensuring the security of cross-border payments systems. 5. Cooperate with the private sector, including the Chambers of Industry and Commerce, banking and retail sectors, and NGO's to educate SMEs and retailers about effective e-commerce models in the region and payment technology systems. 6. Stimulate efforts by the financial and retail sectors to develop and to identify websites utilizing secure payment technologies and practices and respecting consumer privacy, and cooperate with the private sector to educate consumers and business and provide them with the information they need to decide whether and how to participate confidently in e-commerce. 67 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha 7. Encourage banks, payment card companies and retailers to work to achieve an appropriate sharing of risk and costs among themselves to promote broader participation in e-commerce by retailers, SMEs, and financial institutions, while protecting consumers from unreasonable liability for fraudulent and unauthorized electronic payment transactions. 8. Support policies and procedures designed to promote transparency in the regulation of payments systems, including standard-setting, the application process, and judicial, arbitral, and/or administrative review. D. CERTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION Authentication technologies help identify parties to electronic business transactions, and provide means by which they can reliably sign documents, assent to transactions, and verify documents' integrity. As such, they play an important role in building user confidence in e- commerce. But technology is not sufficient in and of itself. The development of electronic commerce requires legal recognition, functional equivalence and non-discrimination as regards electronic signatures, as well as technological neutrality in order to avoid locking consumers and businesses into one technology that may not suit their needs and erecting artificial barriers to the development of new technologies. Internationally, companies are increasingly employing authentication methods in electronic markets through closed systems. A closed system is established by a voluntary agreement under private law in which participants specify in advance how they will conduct business, including what method of logging on to the system and signing they will use. 68 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha Through closed systems, participants may access information, utilize services, and engage in transactions. Many closed systems employ electronic agents, computer programs that initiate or respond to messages on behalf of an entity or individual without contemporaneous human participation. In closed systems, mutual trust has already been established between the parties through their agreement. Thus, these agreements can be relied upon to govern the system, provided that the legal rules for e-commerce recognize and enforce private law agreements with respect to authentication methods and other operational aspects of closed systems, including the use of electronic agents. Closed systems constitute the backbone of B2B e-commerce. The Government of Grenada accepts that competition and non- discrimination are important principles in the provision of certification services. Various national approaches to the establishment and governance of certification authorities and their activities can co-exist. These approaches may include varying elements of industry self- regulation and/or governmental regulation. As part of its policy to encourage e-commerce, the government of Grenada will: 69 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha 1. Take steps to identify and remove legal barriers that hinder the recognition of electronic transactions, including recognizing the legal validity of electronic signatures and documents, (taking into consideration the enabling provisions of the 1996 UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce). 2. Make efforts to ensure that its electronic signature legislation is technology-neutral . 3. Ensure the legal validity of electronic records and evidence for use in court and other official proceedings, independently of the authentication and certification technology used. 4. Afford parties to a B2B transaction the freedom to determine by private law agreement the appropriate technological and business methods of authentication and give the parties’ agreement legal effect, including possible means for resolving disputes, without prejudice to applicable public policies. 5. Recognize the importance that the private sector must play in the development and deployment of authentication and certification technologies, and promote the participation of all relevant social sectors in the process of formulation of policies and laws in this area. 6. Make efforts to ensure that laws and regulations do not discriminate against electronic authentication methods, or against national or foreign providers of authentication services, and do not erect barriers to the provision of authentication services by any of them. 7. Work with the private sector to encourage the development and deployment of authentication systems that provide adequate protection against fraud and identity theft, are consistent with respecting individuals' personal privacy, and do not impede use by creating barriers. E. CONSUMER PROTECTION Increasing competition in the global electronic marketplace offers consumers new and substantial benefits, including convenience, access 70 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha to a wider range of goods and services and the ability to gather and compare information online, resulting in the possibility of obtaining reduced transaction costs, and better prices, quality and service. These benefits cannot be fully realized, however, without consumer confidence in domestic and international e-commerce. The key elements for building consumer confidence in electronic commerce include: protection from fraud and from misleading and unfair conduct and commercial practices; respect for consumer privacy; private sector initiatives; global cooperation; consumer and business education, and effective means of dispute resolution. Consumer protection agencies around the world have begun to address the increased need to cooperate in efforts to combat fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair practices on-line. This cooperation has included the sharing of information and experiences, joint action, and coordination. Furthermore, efforts are underway in international fora, such as OECD, APEC, the International Chamber of Commerce, the Hague Conference on Private International Law and the Global Business Dialogue on Electronic Commerce (GBDe) to develop cooperative arrangements and means to protect consumers in the context of cross- border e-commerce. These efforts include private sector recommendations, international guidelines, and public workshops. F. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION The ability to perfectly copy electronic data, to distribute it instantly on a global basis, and the growth of e-commerce raise a number of key issues for holders of intellectual property and governments related to the adequate and effective protection of copyrighted works online. Authors, producers of copyrighted works, and performing artists must be able to 71 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha have confidence that their copyrighted works will be protected online. Legal protection of intellectual property in the online environment preserves incentives for the creation of local content and encourages its world-wide dissemination. Consumers also must have confidence that they can rely on trademarks as trusted indicators of the origin and quality of their on-line purchases. G. ONLINE DISTRIBUTION OF CONTENT The countries of the Hemisphere are among the most active in the world in terms of generating “content” suitable for online distribution. Every day sees a growth in the global reserve of music, film and audiovisual fixations, computer software, training programs, literature, journalism, etc., through contributions resulting from the creative ingenuity and entrepreneurial capacity of the Americas. Ensuring the online distribution of content is an important factor in increasing economic output from electronic commerce, and should be a priority for the governments of CARICOM and the FTAA countries. Currently, the distribution of content through placement on Web sites and subsequent downloading, or through forms of distribution from a single source to multiple users, such as simulcasting, is one of the most active forms of electronic commerce. However, producers of content who work in the countries of the Hemisphere are suffering important economic losses due to the unauthorized distribution and/or use of content by third parties. Grenada is mindful of this and will work at the regional level for a cooperative solution to this problem. 72 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha DEVELOPING e‐GOVERNMENT IN GRENADA      PRINCIPLES OF THE PROPOSED EGOVERNMENT  STRATEGY  The key principles governing the provision of e-Government from the perspective of both a user and a service provider include the following commitments: o e-Government Services should be easy to access in terms of speed, entry points, and multi-channel access. o There has to be full social inclusion and universality of access to e- Government Services, which necessitates ensuring that those persons with special needs or who have affordability or literacy problems are able to access such services with relative ease. o Universality of access shall be ensured by the delivery of e- Government services across multiple channels, which shall not be at the exclusion of conventional channels. o e-Government services shall be easy to use. o The service has to be inexpensive in relation to average disposable incomes and therefore be widely affordable. o Security in terms of authentication, fraud prevention and prevention of unauthorized hacking shall be guaranteed. 73 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha o The government will ensure the legal framework and government policy protect the individual privacy of users and provides security of information and infrastructure. o Any profiling data submitted by users voluntarily, in order to obtain better services from the Government, shall not be used without their prior consent. o e-Government services shall provide a one-stop-shop to the user. o Services shall be focused towards customer needs and not Government requirements. o Users will be able to access the services at all times and on all days (24x7 access). o Assistance to users of the services will be available at all times. o e-Government services provided will be faster, more efficient and effective and of a higher quality than conventional services. Parameters relative to service quality in respect of each service shall be established and made public. o e-Government services shall be more economic and cost-effective than conventional services, thereby ensuring more efficient use of taxpayers' money. o e-Government services shall be consistent in terms of content and quality, across different delivery channels. o e-Government services shall be regulated and facilitated by the appropriate legislative framework. o Mechanisms for feedback and redress shall be available to all users in respect of all services. o Feedback mechanisms shall be used for the engendering of electronic democracy. o The architecture and technology that will be adopted for the implementation of e-services will be scalable and common across delivery channels wherever possible. It will also entail minimal disruption to back-office processes. o Back-office information systems shall be designed with a view to the provision of electronic services to the public. o e-Services shall pass through one central point or Portal. This shall be the Grenada Government Portal. o All services and information residing on the Government Portal shall have an owner that shall be responsible for maintaining the 74 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha currency as well as quality and other standards of the area for which it is responsible. o All services shall be available at all times without fail. Electronic communication shall be speedy and efficient. • There shall be one distinct corporate image of Government as the provider of e-services. INFRASTRUCTURE  FOR ElectRonic GOVERNMENT  The roll-out of information technology within Government requires an information technology framework which is forward looking, consistent and inter-operable. This framework must be based primarily on two major principles: o Information is a shared resource and will, with exceptions necessary to protect individual privacy or legislatively entrenched confidentiality, be made available to all systems with consistency throughout the Public Service - available when necessary, where necessary and in the form necessary. o Information systems will be designed or acquired on the basis of a shared infrastructure which will continue to be designed to be stable, requiring only changes which are necessary for the extension of the network’s capability. The above-mentioned principles are critical for the attainment of e- Government. They promote widespread, albeit controlled, access to and sharing of information, which may be stored within respective ministries and departments. They also advocate the sharing of the same infrastructure with all that this implies in terms of economies of scale, the flexibility of the infrastructure and the inter-operability of systems that reside on it. The infrastructure should grow and be scalable enough to accommodate new technologies as appropriate, without the need to be replaced as a complete entity. 75 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha The opportunities that a Grenada Government Network can provide should be exploited to their optimal possibility in order to ensure the maximum return on the investment made. The attainment of e- Government is one notable way of achieving such a return on investment. Government entities outside of the Public Service, private organizations, third parties and the public in general should have all the facilities to be able to plug into and use the e-Government Services that will reside on the Grenada Government Network. Controlled development of the Grenada Government Network via the creation of secure, sectoral networks for the enablement of e- Government must therefore be actively pursued. Furthermore, opportunities that the Internet provides should also be exploited in order to provide the client with a personalized e-service. To this end, appropriate gateways, interfaces and new services should be designed, developed and installed on the Grenada Government Network in order to facilitate information sharing principles among all parties involved. Thus, the Internet Architecture must have 100% resiliency and fast, dependable performance and sufficient bandwidth and speed. In order to facilitate the capability of the Grenada Government Network, the adoption of advanced telecommunications networking technologies, such as ADSL, and cable modem, data services should be actively pursued by respective service providers. These measures will make for service provision that is more efficient and effective than is currently the case. 76 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha OTHER PUBLIC SERVICE‐WIDE INITIATIVES  Other Service-wide initiatives for the proliferation of e-Government will centre mainly on: - the dissemination and upgrading of e-mail; and - the training of all staff in digital literacy. Dissemination of e-mail The widespread dissemination of e-mail facilities in the Public Service is an important goal to be reached as soon as possible for effective communications both internally as well as with the external environment. Implementation of an e-mail system within the Public Service offers a very positive prospect for efficiency improvement. This should be initiated early. The ultimate target should be that of having e-mail on the desks of all knowledge workers in the Public Service (by 2002). Impediments in the way of widespread use of e-mail should be removed. Widespread training in e-literacy and e-competence The Government should in the first instance set itself the target of training its own staff in basic PC skills, in general competence and Internet usage. Some training has been taking place in the Public service but this has been limited and restricted. The e-literacy programme has to be deepened and widened to embrace all categories of workers. With respect to new entrants, all candidates for the clerical and executive grades of the Public Service should be required to have an established level of Computer competence to be eligible for entry. The establishment of the required entry-standard should be speedily developed. 1.Developing Databases throughout the Public Service 2.Digitizing Public sector Information 3.Training in Data management] 77 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha 4.Training in customer service delivery] 5.CHANGING THE NATURE OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE: ] 6. New phase of Public Sector Reform ]   SPILLOVER EFFECTS OF EGOVERNMENT ON THE  INFORMATION ECONOMY  There are three particular aspects of e-Government that will have a multiplier effect on a national scale. These are: 1. The widespread adoption of e-Commerce solutions in such activities as procurement is widely recognized as being a major lever in firing up the widespread adoption of eCommerce in business. Firms that do business with the Government will be encouraged to utilize the Internet in their transactions. It is reasonable to expect that once the process is set in motion, businesses will be alert to recognize the benefits of participating and the disadvantages of sticking to conventional methods of doing business. With the Government being a major player in the national economy, the overall multiplier effect should make a significant impact on the proliferation of eCommerce. 2. The presence of Government Services on-line will provide precious local content that will fuel consumer demand for Internet usage. This will help create the necessary critical mass of users, which will make the utilization of e-Commerce solutions an attractive proposal to an ever- increasing number of businesses. On the supply side, this upward spiral will in turn generate activity and value added in the IT, ISP and the telecommunications sectors. It is universally acknowledged that rich local content is a major driver of consumer demand. The presence of on-line Government transactional services and information will certainly make a significant contribution to enriching local content. 3. The government will adopt the use of digital signatures and will put in place the supporting legal and regulatory framework to adequately authenticate the identity of the user and the integrity of the transaction. The issue of security is critical and a major stumbling block to the fast dissemination of e-Commerce world-wide. Winning over public trust in effecting transactions electronically will be another key ingredient in the proliferation of on-line service provision and usage and the utilization of the Internet in general. 78 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha   THE SETTING UP OF A PORTAL  Portal Definition All e-Government services will pass through one Portal. A portal is the interface that brings together the user with Government information and services. It is proposed that the Portal Architecture be composed of three tiers, comprising: The Front-end or Clients' interface Middle tier Back end or Back-Office The Front-end will be the Internet-based access channel to the Portal. The Front-end will provide the connectivity and access for customers to common Government information and services. Other access channels, which will not necessarily be Internet based, will also be available and the Portal will be flexible enough as to interface with these channels. The architecture will provide the ability to add new 79 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha access channels without technological constraint or implications on the service delivery architecture. The Grenada Government Web-site will host all Ministry web-sites as well as the e-Government Services site and will reside on the Front-end of the Portal Architecture. The Middle tier contains the Transaction Management System which houses the middleware and provides the common infrastructure to support the transportation of messages and to obtain the appropriate level of authentication and access the services or information. Common information-based services are also housed within the Transaction Management System including, for example, common search facilities to provide information across the range of services contained within the Portal service set. Data protection auditing will also be provided in the Middle Tier to ensure that information relating to specific services is only sent to the appropriate Department to safeguard the rights of the individual. The Back End will provide the connectivity from the departmental systems, including legacy systems, to the Transaction Management System through appropriate interface systems. Portal Characteristics  There will be one Government Portal to which access can be gained via multiple channels. . The e-Government service provisions through the Portal will be characterised by: o Access from a wide range of locations, including the home and workplace, using a range of different access methods. 80 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha o Provision of all interactions with the client, including client expectation management and client help interactions. o 24 hour 7 days a week service. o Seamless one-stop shopping for a range of Government services from multiple Government Departments. The front end of the portal will be responsible for providing the client side experience. o Service delivery on the basis of logical service clusters as perceived by the client. Back-end systems pertaining to different Departments will be virtually integrated by the Portal and will not be visible to the client. o Fast electronic interchange of information. o Increased efficiency through electronic delivery and authorization. o A message passing regime capable of giving different grades of service for traffic with varying priorities. This will be implemented between the e-Government service portal and the back-end systems. o High levels of privacy and security. Data protection principles will be rigorously applied and critical personal information will be hidden from back-end systems in agencies where there is no good reason to pass on this data. o Time-boxed delivery guarantees. o Positive notification of progress. o Ease of use characteristics. Portal Architecture  The Portal architecture must be: o Able to cope with a variety of channels. o Capable of providing access to all Government Back-end services from all delivery channels. o Structured to accommodate different Back Office requirements. o Based on proven, widely available and used technology. o Scalable to accommodate growing and changing usage requirements with cheap incremental increases in size. 81 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha o Structured to integrate new delivery channels. o Equipped to handle digital authorization. o Capable of handling unpredictable volumes of traffic. The Architecture should be able to support the following types of interaction: o Citizen-to-Government, for which the main paradigm should be HTML and forms. These will be converted by the e-public service portal to XML and XSL - based interactions for e-filing, e-lookup, expectation management, etc. o Business-to-government, for which the main paradigm should be XML and XSL data packages and file transfer protocols. o Government-to-business, (e.g. the e-procurement activities of government agencies) for which the main paradigm should be XML and XSL data packages and file transfer protocols. The Portal must also support Government's policies for social inclusion. A range of channels will be provided which will collectively appeal to all sectors of the user community. A common access technology must be provided within the Portal that will provide the flexibility to add channels freely as and when required without impedance from technological constraints. Therefore the portal technology must provide a low cost, easy to implement interface that supports multiple channels. Internet technology provides the solution here. Potential portal delivery channels can be categorized as: o Direct electronic channels, for example Internet access through a customer's PC, interactive television and kiosk. o Voice telephony channels where the customer contacts a Call Centre agent/officer by telephone who is able to communicate with the Portal using a direct electronic channel. o Face-to-Face channels where the customer interacts directly with an agent/officer who is able to communicate with the Portal using a direct electronic channel. o Mobile telephony and other third generation technology. 82 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha Correctly managed, the Architecture should provide: • The ability to integrate new delivery channels. • The means to add new services through the existing delivery channels without major changes to the existing service set of the Back Office legacy systems. • Scalability beyond the capabilities of traditional two tier architectures. Portal Functions  The envisaged setting-up phase of the Portal architecture will entail the identification of specific roles and activities to be carried out by different organizations. A Central Information Management Agency (CIMA) will be responsible for the management of those activities that are farmed out. Three major functions have to be carried out, in terms of designing the Architecture and setting up the related infrastructure: o Assuming overall responsibility for Architecture design and standards. o Drawing up of Architecture Design and standards . o Setting up of the infrastructure relative to the three-tier Architecture. When the architecture becomes operational there will be allocation of distinct roles and responsibilities in respect of the various aspects of its ongoing operations. The nature of responsibilities and expected outcomes will be specified in service-level agreements or contracts. The CIMA will retain overall responsibility for the running of the infrastructure on behalf of the Government, and will generate formal agreements with those entities, whether Government or the private sector, in respect of the running of their particular part of the operations. 83 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha The following is a brief listing of the major functions to be carried out in terms operating the various components of the Portal: o Management and maintenance of the Portal o Hosting and management of the official Web site that will reside on the Portal front-end. o Management of middle-tier and rear-end connectivity components of architecture. o Hosting and maintenance of middleware. Portal Security  The issue of secure on-line transactions is perhaps the most sensitive aspect of e-Government, and the major factor that can make or break the eventual widespread use by the public of on-line Government services. One key aspect of the Portal architecture therefore is the design of the security infrastructure that is integral in maintaining trust and confidence in e-Government. It is therefore proposed that the security features to be adopted will be based on electronic signature technologies (Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)) residing in the middle tier of the architecture. The following are key features that the security aspect of the Portal architecture should address: o Secure authentication and data encryption processes and prevention from unauthorized use. o A multi-step authorization process using private data stored in a PKI- secured personal vault on the e-Government Portal to achieve equivalent levels of information entropy to that provided by the private key used for e-signing. o The super-registration of data by clients, on a voluntary basis, into a personal PKI-protected vault on the e-public service portal for data items such as digital photographs, income details, family details, phone contact 84 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha details, roles in organizations etc. Access by government systems to the data in this vault would be totally under client side control. The super registration process would also be used for PKI registration. o Data protection compliance and multi-step authorization processing, which will be carried out at the eGovernment Portal by using the episode knowledge base and data held in the personal vaults. o Electronic signing of HTML forms of XML or XSL files which are transferred to the e-Government Portal. o Electronic signature requirement for all interactions between the e- Government Portal and back-end systems. o Message digests for all client-side interactions that should be archived to deal with any contract or service delivery issues that might arise later on. PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE  Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is the technology that is currently being adopted worldwide for the provision of on-line security and personal authentication. Public Key Infrastructure may be defined as the entire set of policies, processes, server platforms, software, and workstations used for the purpose of administering certificates and keys. Public Key Infrastructure is recognized worldwide as the current most secure alternative for the provision of secure on-line services, and individual signature authentication and non-repudiation. PKI is based on the use of electronic certificates which bind the identity of a person or an organization and the ownership of a public key, which can be accessed and used by others. Each public key has a corresponding private key, which only the owner has and can use. To keep information confidential the public key of the intended recipient is used to encrypt the message and the corresponding private key is used by the recipient to decrypt the message. 85 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha The confidence in the system that is shown by sender and receiver of information can only come about by the presence of a trusted third party which handles the issue and management of public keys to their respective owners. This third party entity is the Certification Authority (CA). Public Key infrastructure therefore permits the creation of secure and universally accepted digital signatures, on the condition that a trusted Certification Authority (CA) handles the process. Different countries are adopting different strategies in the implementation of a comprehensive Government services and nation-wide PKI infrastructure. There are several variables which impinge on the adoption of the relative strategies, among which one finds factors such as geographical characteristics, public service structure, political culture (which determines whether systems are centralized or decentralized), existing legacy systems, which would have entailed the proliferation of isolated security systems. The Grenada environment would militate in favour of a simple scaled down version of Government PKI. The Public Service should have a common platform across information systems. Problems of legacy systems and of on-line transactions do not arise. We have a National ID Card system and the Common Data Base. All these elements make for the creation of one overall Certification Authority (CA), which can issue certificates and keys to all users for utilization in respect of all Government Services. The ideal solution in the implementation and running of a Government Public Key Infrastructure would be one PKI, serviced by one Certification Authority, that would attend to the certification of all individuals and 86 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha organizations related to e-Government services, and that would be accepted across the public sector. The services of the Government Certification Authority (CA) could also be availed of by the Private Sector as, for example, in the case of Finland. The Population Register of Finland serves as the Certification Authority for the electronic exchange of official information. It provides both electronic identification for citizens, and certification services to government agencies. The Certification Authority (CA) service is based on the Finnish Electronic Identification (FINEID) card. This card, which is a smart card, has gained widespread recognition throughout Finland and may be used by the general public and the business community, not only for accessing government services, but also for conducting business electronically with a number of banking and insurance services. The envisaged benefits of such an arrangement would be relative simplicity in the design and management of the overall PKI environment, characterized by economies of scale. Ultimately, however, it will be the market that would determine whether such a scenario would eventually materialize. The creation of a single Government Portal and related PKI infrastructure, catered for by one Certification Authority for e-Government services, will avoid complexity, ensure full interoperability and encourage cross- functional utility. One further critical advantage of this approach is that it is far more cost effective to have a central PKI infrastruture lodged within the eGovernment Portal as against individual applications across the entire Public Service. Furthermore, ease of use to the user is far higher given that the user is provided with one ‘key’ which will allow him or her to 87 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha access any application in a secure manner for any government service to which the user has legitimate access. In the building of the Government PKI infrastructure a relatively uncomplicated and comprehensive solution is preferred. In this regard, the following is proposed: The setting up of a Policy Management Authority that will set policies, provide approvals and take decisions on the nature and operations of the Government PKI. Its main functions would be those of: o Providing direction and management of the Government's Public Key Infrastructure. o Establishing and approving applicable operational standards and guidelines to be followed by the Certification Authority. o Establishing and approving Pubic Key Infrastructure Certificate Policies for the Government. o Keeping the Government informed of developments in public key technology and infrastructures, including standards and industry practices. o Promoting awareness of the role of the Government PKI in enabling secure service delivery, public administration and communications. The creation of a single Certification Authority for e-Government services whose function will be that of associating a public and private key pair with a particular individual or entity. It would: o Identify the individual or entity which is to receive a key pair. o Issue keys and related certificates guaranteeing the owner's identity. o Revoke keys when a private key may have been lost, stolen or otherwise made public. o Provide notice as to those key pairs, which have been revoked. Until such time as the necessary organizational and technological structures are in place, no individual Government entity should take initiatives in this direction. This is to avoid the risks of total and costly revision and realignment later, or operating in a legal and regulatory vacuum 88 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha without adequate security guarantees and unnecessary exposure to potential liabilities. SMART CARDS The target of achieving secure transactions via authentication would point to the use of Smart Cards, possibly containing the individual's biometric data. Factors such as a lack of standardization in the smart- card environment and return-on investment considerations, are keeping countries back from making the jump to smart-cards on a national front, although individual systems using smart-cards may be found. (Visa has just introduced its smart Visa Card) Smart Cards and the National ID Card System From a business viewpoint the use of Smart Cards solely for authentication purposes would mean the underutilization of their potential. Any move towards the wholesale introduction of Smart Cards will have to factor in the various uses to which they may be put, and to tailor the possible additional applications identified for eventual uptake of Smart Card technology accordingly. Another issue relates to whether the Government will issue Smart Cards itself on a universal basis, potentially via the ID card system, or whether it will 'piggy back' on widespread card systems in use or coming into use in the private sector. It is envisaged that issuance by the Government of Smart ID Cards is the logical way to go. The example of Finland with the FINEID Card is a useful experience to study. Although the introduction of smart cards is not envisaged to take place in the immediate future, provision for this eventuality should be taken now in 89 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha order to avoid costly duplication of work when they are eventually introduced. Care should be taken to ensure that when the current ID cards are due for renewal the new cards that are distributed will contain the required space for eventual insertion of the chip. The new ID Cards would therefore be smart-card-ready plastic cards, which will still serve the purpose of physical identification. This will obviate the need for a costly card-replacement process should the shift to smart cards eventually become feasible. All that would be required would be the insertion of the chip in the existing plastic cards. The cards would then serve a dual purpose, that of smart cards for authentication and the provision of e-services, as well as the 'traditional' physical identification of the owner. Security considerations suggest that ownership of the physical cards, whether 'traditional' ID cards or (eventually) smart ID cards, need to be determined, and distinguished from the services they provide. Smart Card Infrastructure Grenada should begin exploratory discussions with various entities on the possibility of eventually adopting a common smart card infrastructure. For example, Commercial Banks need to change their current ATM infrastructure in order to introduce smart cards in lieu of the decision by MasterCard and VISA that have established mandatory migration of magnetic debit and credit cards to smart card technology by 2005. The Banks may be ready to assume a considerable portion of the costs of the technology, in return for an arrangement whereby it could benefit from a considerable increase in business, through the handling of e-Government financial transactions. Government should initiate discussions with the players in the regional and national Banking sector who might be interested in such a joint venture. 90 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha The eventuality of adopting a common ID and Banking smart card is not easy to achieve. It is highly unlikely that issues such as branding and ownership of the card will be overcome. Dual card use, that is the Government ID card for e-Government services and the Banking card for Banking services, is not, however seen as being a stumbling block to the implementation of a common smart card infrastructure. Be that as it may, the Government Portal architecture to be adopted must take into account the eventual introduction of smart-cards. The type of card to be adopted and the related technology must be determined. The question of whether to do so within the context of a CARICOM or OECS smart card standards that are to be eventually agreed upon is an important issue for discussion. The establishment of common regional specifications for a generalized smart card infrastructure seems to be a logical step as part of the Single Market and Economy. Access to essential services with smart-card based authentication everywhere in CARICOM should be a target of the CSME. In the short-term, Grenada's best way forward is likely to be that of data encryption and authentication without the use of smart cards, and to study developments of smart card for potential introduction a few years down the line. In the meantime, transaction services to be implemented will therefore be accessible via PKI and use of the private key will entail the input of a pin or personal identification code. Work on the security features will be among the first tasks to address. The CARICOM region needs to be persuaded to commit itself to: o Defining common, workable, affordable and timely security certification procedures and infrastructures for the security certification of 91 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha products/devices and acceptance environments (by a given time period, say 12 months). o Agreeing on common or interoperable technical specifications for Identification, Authentication infrastructural, and services in the Region. In the meantime preparatory work for eventual smart-card implementation should be taken in hand as a specific initiative. At this stage the main tasks envisaged would consist of: o Discussions and agreement with the Electoral Office, and the Police Department on the introduction, at the next round of ID card renewals, of smart-card-ready plastic ID cards. o Further discussions with the Banks with a view to reaching an agreement in principle as to further Government-Bank co-operation in the implementation of a common kiosk infrastructure, given that Banks are being intimated by the major credit card companies to switch to smart cards by 2005. o Identification of the Smart Card technology to be used taking into consideration the direction to be taken by the Banks in this regard. DELIVERY CHANNELS  There are several routes via which on-line e-government services can be conveyed. Direct access by PC to e-services over the Internet is the most obvious channel. Aspects related to social inclusion and public convenience would, however, point to the utilization of other channels such as call centres, kiosks and community-based over-the-counter services. Notwithstanding any future improvements in Internet penetration, there will inevitably be segments of the population that will not have the opportunity for Internet access. In addition, illiteracy, \"technophobia\" preference for person to person interaction and service, the financial inability to own a computer can all 92 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha affect a citizen's preferred mode and channel of access to government services. The adoption of a variety of access channels would therefore address the needs of a significant percentage of citizens. i. Direct Access via Internet Though the Internet is the best-known channel for the delivery of on-line services by Government to its clients, its current overall penetration even in the economically advanced countries is still far from saturation point. Grenada lags well behind with an estimated penetration rate of around 3% of the population. Direct Internet access to e-Government services via PC is therefore only one of several channels that have to be considered for the widespread dissemination of on-line services. Grenada's Internet penetration can be expected to increase substantially over the next three years, given the growth in ICT and Internet awareness, the movements in liberalization of the telecommunications sector, the growth of service providers and market competition with the concomitant price reduction, affordability and quality improvement in service provision. The speed by which transactions can be made over the Internet is another factor that will have to be tackled. Internet Service Provision at the moment is far from being satisfactory. Bandwidth has to be increased both locally and in the international connection, with adequate excess capacity built in so as to cater for future increases in number of users and traffic. Internet facilities need not be restricted to PC owners (and nowadays - mobile phone owners). The setting up of PC's in public places for universal consumption is a practice that is being followed universally, with typical venues being schools, post offices, libraries, local and community offices and government local offices, and perhaps commercial banks. 93 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha Interactive services also entail the requirement that the user have the facility to communicate with the service provider via e-mail. While PC owners who are hooked to the Internet are also provided with an e-mail address, this may not the case for those users who have to access the Internet via public access points (which may also be kiosks). The possibility of eventually providing all citizens with an individual e-mail address will therefore need to be pursued. ii. Mobile Telephony Mobile networking has become a major player in ICT over the past couple of years, due to the adoption of WAP (wireless access protocol) which is an open, global specification that enables mobile device users to easily access and interact with information and services instantly. This client- based software enables wireless access to Internet in combination with a suitable network server. WAP has been designed for the current generation of wireless devices, so that fundamental design changes to present-day mass market products are not necessary. Moreover, prices are being driven towards affordability, thanks to WAP being well suited to current product capabilities, as well as by mass-market volumes and by vigorous competition. WAP uses existing Internet standards, and has been optimized to solve problems that had to date characterized the provision of Internet over mobile networks, which required large amounts of mainly text-based data to be sent. Mobile telephony can be looked at for the provision of a host of e- services, such as e-mail, e-commerce transactions and e-banking services. The provision of information-based services also renders mobile telephony an attractive proposition within the ambit of e-Government. 94 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha Moreover, mobile telephony also lends itself to the use of smart cards, which is another feature in its favour. The provision of e-Government services over mobile telephony will be limited by the nature of the receiving set. Nevertheless, mobile telephony is a very attractive channel for a host of e-services and can play an important part in the overall e-Government set-up. The number of mobile telephony users is rising very fast. Prices are falling and technical features increasing. When roaming becomes commonplace in the Eastern and southern Caribbean, the numbers can be expected to soar. iii. Normal Telephony Value Added Services On-line delivery channels to be used realistically hinges on the status and trends relative to the stock of communications equipment currently in use by householders. Automated telephone transactions via the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), such as the ones in existence in tele- banking services, could be used in certain cases. Possible instances are the payment of fines and bills, and the renewal of licenses. Such modes of payment are currently in use in various countries. The possibility of certain basic services being provided via normal telephony should therefore be examined in the context of e-government service delivery. iv. Interactive TV There are three types of digital television (DTV) that can be utilized, namely, Digital Terrestrial TV (DTT), Digital Satellite TV (DST) and Digital Cable TV (DCT). DTT and DST would necessitate the use of access by modem via the telephone network for the use of interactive services. The extremely high penetration rate of television in Grenada and the growing penetration of Cable TV offer good prospects for its use as a channel of access and transaction. Although not yet a seamless 95 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha alternative to the PC, the DTV is a familiar and friendly tool for the technologically uninitiated. The technical problems as an Internet user interface are likely to be resolved in the near future, and allow its use as a universal take-up of e-transactions. v. Kiosks Not all citizens will ultimately have means of access to electronic transactions. It would therefore be necessary to have such means available at public sites, such as schools, local and community sites, post offices, and public libraries, commercial locations such as Banks, Malls and supermarkets. The means of access identified as being ideal for such sites are either PC's or interactive kiosks. Capital cost and maintenance factors would come into play, and will militate whether we move down this route. One alternative would be to 'piggy-back' on private kiosk-services providers, thereby maximizing usage and splitting costs. In this respect, the possibility of a joint kiosk venture with the Banks, the local shop, grocery store, or gas station could be explored to meet the Grenada requirements. vi. Over the Counter Service Face to face, over-the-counter service will continue to be the 'traditional' mode of interaction between Government and citizens. The new technology opens the prospects for such a service provision to be more efficient and more decentralized geographically, and be provided at community level. The Public Service may wish to set up its own over-the- counter delivery structures at locality level. The costs would be modest and may even represent savings over the current centralized paper- based filing and retrieval system involving use of multiple officers per transaction. 96 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha The locality-based service provider can also be an organization (NGO, service group, etc.), which is completely separate from the Back-office service providers. Another option is to contract the service out to the private sector. Any of these options entails a formal agreement between back-office supplier and the 'retailer' and the establishment of means of remuneration for services rendered It is envisaged that organizations carrying out over the counter service will essentially act as intermediaries and will utilize the web-based on-line services on behalf of the client. Authentication should not be an issue in this case. vii. Local Call Centres Local Call-centres may be used as brokers in the provision of information- based and transactional e-services. The main stumbling block to the delivery of transactional e-services via Call Centres is the question of caller's authentication. The complexity of the problem rises proportionately with the confidentiality of the transaction. Another possible use of the call centres is in the provision of help-line services to clients who are accessing the service via the Internet, kiosks or interactive TV. This service is very important in that it ensures that users constantly have the facility of obtaining assistance when accessing a service. Call centre services of a help-line nature would ideally be provided round the clock on a 24x7 basis. Any such service to be provided should be underpinned by the presence of two fundamental requirements. These are that: i. The on-line information available for onward transmission, at the 'helper' end should be quickly accessible, easily readable, comprehensive and up-to- date. 97 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha ii. The service or aspects of it (such as user-helpdesk facility) should ideally be up on a 24 hours, seven-days-a-week (24x7) basis. The first can only be provided by Government service-providers who supply the necessary information to the call centre. If the Government is not able to supply round-the-clock service kind of service via its own set- up, it should explore the possibility of farming out call-centre services to third parties. COMMERCIAL CONSIDERATIONS  The front-end delivery channels can be considered as being 'retail channels' by means of which clients make use of Government services. Just as wholesalers and retail channels are distinct operations run by separate organizations in the commercial world, the delivery or 'retail' aspect of Government service delivery can be run by entities which are distinct from the Government 'wholesale' service provision part. These commercial channels can be Government-owned but there is no barrier to farming them out to the private sector or to local community bodies in a controlled environment. Controls would be in the form of a contract or service level agreement and the issue of an operating license under clearly defined conditions. Commercial channels would include the provision of services via a web front-end, kiosks in banks, shops, or shopping malls, call centres and over the counter services. 98 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha Wholesaler to retailer payment methods for channel services provided are various, and will depend on the nature of the channel as well as on the nature of the transaction. For example: o Some Government activities could add value to the service provided by a commercial organization, which could be prepared to pay for access to these services, eg vehicle license renewal by insurance companies on behalf of their clients. o The citizen could be prepared to pay for certain services provided by the commercial channel. o Where large sums of money are involved, return to the commercial channel might be via overnight investment. o Government might fund the transaction in its entirety. o Government pays the commercial channel a flat rate per transaction delivered to it. It is as yet too early to enter into the specifics relative to the means of funding of commercial delivery channel services. However one has to bear in mind that the switch from conventional to e-services on the one hand, and the farming out of delivery channels on the other, will likely entail cost-savings to the Government in areas such as front-office operations, mail processing and data input. The notion that the end client, if not the channel, might end up paying for the service is not likely to be productive, especially in a start-up situation where the intention is to make the service as attractive as possible. Instances where channels will pay for services provided are unlikely to be substantial. As a general rule the client should not pay for channel service usage.  THE SERVICE OF EGOVERNMENT   99 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha Customer-centric business model The accelerating popularity of digital services worldwide, the emergence of the e-Economy, and the expanding Internet connectivity in Grenada are all serving to transform the expectations of increasing numbers of our citizens and businesses towards service delivery. \"One-to-one marketing\", \"24x7\", \"permission based\" ; terms that did not even exist a few years ago now permeate the daily vocabulary of customer service. These terms are now being transferred from the international commercial sector to the domestic economy and into the interactions expected between citizens and government. Citizens in Grenada can now purchase a car online, but must stand in-line to register and license their new vehicle. Citizens and businesses can interact with their Bank and their bank account online. They can pay increasing numbers of bills online, but must stand in-line to pay in cash even small amounts to the Customs or to the Treasury; or send from England to a friend or relative in Grenada to apply and collect a Birth Certificate from the Ministerial Complex and mail it to England. The divergence between dealing with government, in the real world, and operating as a citizen or a business in the online world will increasingly pressure the government to incorporate online management systems into its service delivery model. Government, as the largest supplier of services in the domestic economy must modernize itself. The modernized government online must be governed by a number of factors: • Vision and Implementation 100 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha The Vision articulated by the Government must be closely supported by the provision of the right administrative structure and mechanism that would support implementation, communicate deliverables, and establish accountability for delivery. There needs to be the right balance between political leadership and administrative simplicity for effective e- Government. There must be visible and committed leadership within both the political and administrative arms of government. The experience in several countries confirms that early political leadership builds momentum. But the creation of simple guidelines and deliverables and timetable for government agencies combine to deliver results quickly. The right infrastructure and implementation programme with clear accountability for results is crucial. Structure, in the form of an accountable agency to deliver e-Government initiatives, is vital. Canada, Singapore, Ireland, united States all have a clear Plan and Structure within government to spearhead e-Government development programmes, and have achieved their leadership position as a result of these programmes having been in place for several years. The new positions and Agencies must be attached to the highest level of Office rather than have implementation delegated to individual agencies. This high level and centralized initiative is vital, as the success of e-Government depends largely on cross agency co-operation. Grenada's e-Government strategy will adopt the following strategy: - Building e-government presence, - Thinking big, - Starting small, and - Scaling fast. Implementing the migration of government services from in-line to online can lead to dramatic improvement in public services. But that exercise is 101 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha considerably more difficult than its private sector equivalent. Implementing e-government involves not only managerial and organizational challenges, but also complex social, regulatory and legal issues that will test even the most sophisticated of public services. Not only is it necessary to move the appropriate group of citizens and businesses towards the new service delivery channels, there will also be need to target resources towards the more needy groups within the society. The national digital divide will complicate the process of implementation. Some government services with significant potential for improved efficiencies and lower costs, such as the social services, are those for which the majority of consumers are most adversely affected by the digital divide. Specific measures would have to be taken to narrow the digital divide in Grenada, and bring significant social groups within the reach of new technologies. • Citizen-Centric – An Intentions based Approach The mere provision of a Website does not constitute an e-Government strategy. A true e-Government Internet strategy must also re-examine all aspects of the model currently used to service its citizen-clients, evaluate its interactions with its customers and stakeholders, and identify those areas where more value can be created for all stakeholders by moving processes and interactions online. The overall goal of Grenada's e-government strategy will be citizen- centric, focusing the delivery of improved levels of customer service and enhanced citizen satisfaction. 102 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha Experiences of the most successful e-Government countries indicate that merely publishing information online and organizing a Web presence around Ministries' and Agencies' traditional, attitudes, structure, operations and service delivery methods will lead to disappointment. Online presence must be predicated on what the citizen wants to do, rather than how the Ministry or Agency is organized or managed. Singapore, using the intentions-based approach, designed its e-Citizen Website around the life cycle of the citizens and the typical interactions they would have with the government at various stages in their life. Website information supply is therefore only a first step. To be meaningful and valuable, Government online must graduate to greater interactivity and transaction capabilities, enabling the citizens and businesses to complete entire transactions with government online. Paying taxes, fines or claiming benefits online are citizen-centric value-added services; but moving revenue processes online offers several gains to government: collections are accelerated, processing costs are considerably reduced, and compliance is increased. • Customer Relationship Management (CRM) This marketing technique would require the Ministries and Agencies know their customers and better select and manage the service provided. They would need to streamline their citizen interface, their communications and marketing processes by tailoring their offerings, minimizing duplication of information and profiling customer behavior to predict their likely future requirements; and offer the product or service that is individually required. Government has the largest customer base in the country and stands to benefit enormously from adopting CRM disciplines in terms of increased efficiencies and lower service delivery costs. Integrating CRM with online 103 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha service delivery offers significant economies to Grenada's e-Government initiatives. • Volume and complexity The volume of services offered is vast; and the aim is to provide the range of services online. This requires the availability of Ministries' and Agencies' websites. But most important is creating innovative solutions for the citizens and businesses that they serve. The introduction of complex transactions would be a function of the citizens' requirements and must be designed to add value. There is merit in separating e-government plans from generic government Information Technology programmes. This will help to focus on the service rather than on the technology; and would promote specific e- Government initiatives to improve the quality and value of traditionally paper-based services to citizens and businesses online. Balancing technological choices with customer needs is the vital judgment call of e- Government. Provision of quality e-Government services offers the opportunity for several efficiencies as well as for increased customer services. Internet transaction costs, particularly for relatively uncomplicated transactions, are substantially lower than their clerical equivalent. Those savings will allow resources to be redirected, perhaps towards those citizens and businesses that are in need of specialized or resource-intensive support. However, these benefits are likely to be realized only if government deepens its online service offers, and persuades citizens and businesses to interact with government over the Internet. Offering a wide range of easy- to-use and value-added e-Government services will be an important factor in achieving this. The sheer magnitude of government online can be daunting, but Government must aim at maximizing value to the 104 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha citizens and businesses by ensuring that government online is easy to find and easy to transact with. • Portals - single interaction Point Citizens in Grenada complain all the time about the multiple agencies they sometime have to visit in order to transact a single matter. One Office to get information, another office to get the Form, still another Office to pay, and a further Office to collect the product or the service. Such an online arrangement would be a disaster. At best, it would not be citizen-friendly to require visits to several individual sites to transact an online service. Portals offer the citizen single points of entry to multiple agencies, and they afford citizens or businesses the opportunity to interact easily and seamlessly with several Ministries or Agencies, without the need to even know the name of the Agency. Research from the world of business has shown that customers behave differently in the online world than they do in a physical office. In the one- on-one environment of the Internet, customers seek providers who organize service around their needs. This observation points to the need for a single gateway for users of all government websites, and for organization around the information or service that the user is seeking. TYPES OF SERVICE  There are essentially five main types of e-service that the Government can provide. These are briefly described in the sections below: Information There are two types of information to consider: • General information such as the set-up of the Executive and of the Public Service, and other information such as updated laws, Government news bulletins, information of a cultural nature etc. 105 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha • Information which is more in line with the concept of e-Government. In this case the information that is supplied to the client is in the form of instructions that the client should follow. There are three sub-types of such information. • Information that relates to the nature of services provided to the client, and how these are provided. Such information is essentially akin to an instruction leaflet describing what the client should do to get a particular service. It would also include the facility for the client to download forms relative to service required. • Information that is required by the client in the normal course of life, and that is very often the reason why the service-provider has been set up. Such information is not linked to any transaction that is likely to take place. Good examples are health and safety tips or advice on preventive health care. • Information that pertains to the individual user and that is likely to be of a private nature. The user might need to consult such information for personal purposes. A typical example is the individual's updated on-line medical history, or tax status. Transactional e‐Services   This is an area where e-Government becomes interactive and therefore particularly useful to the citizen. There is a whole array of services that can be provided by the Government via this medium. The spectrum may range from the application for social services, for employment, to the payment of traffic fines, to the submission of a tax form. This is one of the most challenging aspects of e-Government in that it really takes the service to the citizen. While the provision of information is important as a service in itself, on-line delivery of services is the crux of the whole concept of e-Government. It means delivering a service to the citizen in a fashion that is 'user-friendly'. By implication the quality of service delivered on-line cannot be a replication of the bureaucracy that the citizen faces in the current environment. 106 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha Therefore, there has to be a rethink of the philosophy of Government entities which should not be restricted solely to e-Government, but should cascade to all aspects of organizational activity. In other words, if the Government adopts a business type attitude that is client-centred, service delivery, whether on-line or off-line, will improve. The introduction of e-Government therefore provides the opportunity not only for the introduction of new technologies, but also for reform of the system and the modernization of the nature and culture of public services and the relationship between government and its clients. Government service providers have to get out of the mode of demanding that the client behaves and responds according to their needs. They should switch to the mode whereby they should be seeking to render a service that, while respecting statutory and other requirements, is simple, timely, courteous and dedicated to the needs of the client, rather than those of the service provider. One key factor is that client expectations, relative to promptness in service delivery, has increased somewhat in those countries where on-line services are already provided somewhat extensively. The Canadian Public Service estimates that whereas the public deems two weeks as being an acceptable interval for a response to a request via normal mail, it expects a response to an E-mail request within four hours. Building an on-line 'façade' on the current local Government service-delivery culture can be tantamount to a boomerang in terms of public perception of, and confidence in, the efficiency and effectiveness of Government Services. 107 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha Electronic Commerce   The focus in this case is on Government to Business type of transactions. While less apparent to the general public, it is still an important aspect of e-Government. It is also likely to be the most difficult service to implement. There are two reasons for the difficulties involved. The first relates to the fact that financial transactions on-line are likely the most complex in terms of implementation. The second reason is that there is currently no e-commerce culture either in the Public Service or in the Private Sector. So, there is no real push coming from any quarter, although the global electronic market will, sooner or later exert its pressure on the local market. Meanwhile other jurisdictions are viewing e-commerce as a priority area, and some governments have taken it upon themselves to actually play the role of leaders in the field so as to encourage the private sector to follow suit, thereby boosting the economy via increased trade. Two areas in Government where electronic commerce is considered to be of particular importance are customs and general procurement of goods and services, but there are others. The Government should actively follow a policy aimed at creating an e-commerce culture in the national economy. The adoption of on-line procurement of goods and services by Government is one important measure which will directly promote e- commerce in the economy as a whole. It should be resorted to as a matter of priority. The Government should immediately initiate work towards achieving full capability in on-line procurement, and other forms of Government to Business transactions at the earliest possible opportunity, in view of the 108 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha important spillover effects that this activity can have on the e-Commerce environment in the national economy. Moreover, the Treasury should aim at effecting all payments, including internal ones such as transfers to Ministries and Departments, and the payment of salaries to Government employees, and the payment of dividends to beneficiaries, for full electronic payment to take place by direct electronic transfer. The Treasury should also target full electronic payment to contractors and suppliers by the end of 2001. This should be achievable in a relatively short time, given that the local Banks already cater for such payment facilities over their own private networks (and not yet via the Internet), and the Treasury can now make limited use of such facilities. e‐Democracy   This is a very interesting concept that has taken root in several countries that are implementing e-Government. e-Democracy is not merely seen as the potential use of Information Technology for electronic voting. It is rather the way that public authorities at different levels interact with citizens on a daily basis through the use of Information and Communication Technology. The promotion of e-Democracy is an implicit by-product of e-Government given the prospects for the provision of easily accessible on-line information to the Citizenry relative to the workings of Government. The widening of two-way communications channels is also an implicit way of fostering e-Democracy. 109 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha The open invitation of public reaction over the Internet to Government policies and envisaged legislation would represent a primary contribution to democracy in Grenada. But Government should extend the use of the Internet to ensure consultation and feedback on major political and policy initiatives. The aim would be to go beyond simply publishing legislation and White Papers on the web and establish a discussion and feedback forum possibly with independent moderators. One requisite that the literature on the subject emphasizes is the need for universal access to information and the communication channels that enable active participation. Non‐Governmental Services and Information   There may be services that are provided by the private sector that may be considered as being useful for the citizen to have access to on-line alongside e-Government services. Such services may range from the hiring of cars, provision of air transport information, and the facility for payment of utility bills, to electronic banking and other such services. These services are of particular benefit to the citizen in terms of on-line access, while adding value to the e-Government Services Site. The nature of these services can range from information to on-line transactions. Where such private entities already have web-sites and on-line services of their own, it may be worthwhile to build access to such sites via the e- Government Services web-site. A policy relative to non-government services to be incorporated with e-Government Services would have to be drawn up. One instance, which would qualify private services for 110 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha inclusion with e-Government Services, is when a private service is a component of a particular service provided by the Government, for example, private motor insurance services as a part of the annual vehicle license renewal process. THE GOVERNMENT SERVICES WEB‐SITE  The e-Government Services web-site will reside on the Government Portal front-end. It will provide the information and transactional services to any user who requires them. The layout of the information and services provided should be based on client needs and should therefore be in such a way as to facilitate search and location by users. It should also cater for accessibility by persons with special needs via the incorporation of tailored features. A practical model in terms of the organization of services, as visible to the client, is the clustering of e-Government services under 'life cycle events'. Different countries have adopted varying criteria for clustering under this broad term. Other terms are coming into play in order to cater for services that do not fall strictly under the broad definition of a life event. There are several models of product clusters in existence. The Singapore Government e-Citizen site is likely the best known, but there are other models such as the ones taken up by Portugal, the Netherlands and Australia. The notion of clustering services according to perceived client needs, and presenting them in this fashion, is valid and several countries are adopting service clustering. 111 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha The model below builds on various models adopted in other jurisdictions. There are various permutations of product clusters that can be adopted, all of which are likely equally valid. One model for a Citizen Services set of product clusters could be as follows: 01. Employment and Income. 02. Sport, leisure & Culture. 03. Health. 04. Environment and cleanliness. 05. Education. 06. Business. 07. You as Consumer. 08. Housing and Home. 09. Travel and Transportation. 10. Family Affairs. 11. Strictly for Children. 12. The Elderly. 13. Special Needs. 14. Visiting or settling in Grenada 15. Law and Order. The list is not exhaustive. Basically, a rule of thumb measure that can be applied in listing potential on-line services is that, if there are any services to the public whereby the latter has to fill in a form, or make some formal request for a document or a service, then that service should go on-line. For the less frequently used services, this may involve simply putting forms on-line for download or electronic forwarding to the proper Ministry or Agency which can then process manually if costs of backroom automation exceed benefits. Some of the services that have been identified are targeted at a small segment of the population. These have been included in the first instance but a decision can be taken at a later stage as to whether the less prominent services are required to go on-line. 112 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha It would be necessary to establish standards for presentation and format. The standards should be drawn up through the coordination of the CIMU and the final appearance of the e-Government Service Web-Pages will be based on these. BRANDING: ONE EGOVERNMENT IDENTITY  The e-Government services should fall under one single corporate identity that is distinct from that of the organizations providing the individual back- office services. The ultimate aim is to provide the image of Government e-services as one homogeneous product. This will reinforce the image of the front-end 'retail' service that is distinct from the back office 'wholesale' providers. Individual Departments will not be prominent on the e- Government Services site, and will be only visible when an individual transaction is accessed. On the other hand individual Departments also need to establish their own corporate identity to be easily distinguishable from each other as the end-service providers. The creation of an individual Departmental identity should not, however, detract from the creation of a common 'look and feel' for all services that are provided electronically. Neither should it impinge on the structure of individual Departmental web-sites, which should be similar insofar as visual and ease-of-use features such as search facilities and content indexes are concerned. If any delivery channels are to be farmed out to third parties the necessary measures to ensure the integrity of the e-Government Services brand must be adopted. Channels that can potentially interfere with the e-Government Services corporate image, or impinge negatively on it, should not be considered. 113 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha One potential source of financing of the e-Government Services, that should be favorably considered, is on-line advertising. If such a measure is adopted care should be taken to ensure that the type of products or services being promoted and the nature of the adverts should be consonant with the image that e-Government wants to project. A set of standards should be drawn up relative to branding and corporate image on the Web. The capacity would be needed to monitor the adherence of incumbents to the standards set. Grenada Government Domain Name  One fundamental component of the e-Government 'brand name' is its Domain name. The current situation in this regard is one that has to be rectified. The Grenada Government Site needs to be identified unequivocally by all users as the official Government Domain. Users have to know that they are accessing and dealing with the Government of Grenada. The issue becomes one of trust and peace of mind on the part of users. It is therefore recommended that the Government immediately assumes the '.gov.gd' domain name for the Official Site (GRENET) as well as for all official Government sites that will reside on it. There must be sole exclusivity to the Government of Grenada in the use of the \".gov.gd\" title. THE WEB‐SITE  If we are to achieve a coherent image of e-Government, we have to start off immediately at the foundations. The Government Web-site should be 114 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha of highest quality, in terms of visual coherence, format, content and organization. Information should be complete, well presented and well distributed. Specific client services page must be created whereby the citizen can obtain information, forms and contact persons relative to a government service that is required. Search facilities should be user- friendly. Another important component of the Government Site is the comprehensive presence, by way of their respective web-sites, of all Public Service organizations, that is, Ministries and Departments. All Ministries and Departments should be present. Existing web-sites and pages of some Ministries and agencies especially those that have not been updated for quite a while should be integrated into the main Government site. There is need also to create a uniform general appearance, and a facility to be able to search between sites. Overall, the establishment of web-standards for all Government sites is an important prerequisite. Setting up and managing web‐sites  This activity is a major task in itself and involves not only the physical 'look and feel' aspect but also the organisational, procedural and regulatory aspects. The Central Information Management Unit should, jointly with others, commission a blueprint in respect of presentation standards, organisation and processes, relative to the setting up and maintenance of web-sites. The final product should determine the following requirements: 115 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha o The standards relative to visual presentation, navigation facilities and accessibility features for persons with special needs. o The nature and extent of information content that would ideally be placed in the respective sites. o The organizational set-up that would be required within individual Government Ministries and Agencies to carry out the various tasks leading to successful implementation of web-sites, and regular maintenance thereafter. o The nature of human resources that would be required to carry out identified tasks. o The identification of those aspects of web-site design and development that could be farmed out vis-à-vis those that could or should be carried out in- house. There has to be a sizeable element of capacity building within Ministries and Departments for the effective implementation of e-Government. It seems logical that the human resources appointed for the development of the technical aspects - but not the content - of the web-sites would reside within the Ministries' Information Management Units (IMU's). It is likely that the duties of the staff concerned would not be restricted to web-related work, but that they would have to have multi-disciplinary capabilities. This would enable them to cater for other functions which the IMU's would be expected to carry out. Scale of operations would 116 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha dictate to what extent multi-skilling would be required. This requirement would vary across Ministries. The capacity building of Information Management Units is therefore seen as being a necessary step towards the implementation of e-Government. Government sites' Domain names All sites that would be set up and reside on the Grenada Government Site should carry the \".gov.gd\" suffix to their respective Domain names to distinguish them as official Government sites in accordance with world- wide practice. In the case of Ministries and Government Departments the respective domain names will all include this suffix. The site on which the Ministry sites shall in turn reside, shall also adopt the \".gov.gd.\" suffix. This is an important part of the the branding aspects of e-Government. The matter becomes rather less clear when it comes to Public Sector State Enterprises and Utilities. The first issue to resolve is whether any of these entities would qualify for the label \".gov.gd\" and, by implication reside on the Grenada Government Site and therefore on the Portal. A prima facie answer would be in the affirmative for at least a number of these entities. There are implications that this right will likely also entail. The following issues relative to Public Sector Entities therefore need to be addressed: 1. Whether Public Sector entities should at all carry the \".gov.gd\" domain name and reside on the Grenada Government Portal. 2. Under what criteria would Public Sector entities qualify for the \".gov.gd\" domain name. 3. For those Public Sector entities that would qualify for the \"gov.gd\" domain name, it would have to be ascertained whether the standards required for Public Service Sites would also apply to them. This would entail that the CIMU take 117 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha overall responsibility for setting standards to be followed by these Public Sector entities. 4. If these public sector entities are to supply services via the e- Government Portal, as would seem to be the case, then they would have to comply with all the security and authentication standards and protocols in place. If a number of Agencies were to establish their own e-services on separate platforms, we risk losing all the advantages of a common platform; these agencies/Ministries would fall out of the scope of the e- Government programme, and will be duplicating security and authentication requirements. It seems sensible to make provision for a coordinated umbrella responsibility within the framework of the Central Information Management Agency with appropriately wide mandate in the regulation of Information Technology, Information Systems and Information Management within the Public Service. This widening of the CIMA's mandate could be effected by the expansion of the definition of Public Service to embrace a number of Government-owned or controlled entities, that lie beyond the boundaries of the traditional Ministry and Departmental structures, and easily reside within the Private Sector, or could be conveniently privatized Ownership and Maintenance of the Grenada Government  Site, AND E‐Services  The Grenada Government Site, (GRENET) will host all the individual Ministry and Public Sector entity sites and the e-Government Services site. On its part, the e-Government Services site is the one that will host all the cross- Government e-services to be provided. By implication these sites, that is 118 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha the Grenada Government Site and the e-Government services site, are corporate entities in the ambit of the Public Sector. This raises the issue of ownership of these sites. This matter still requires further consideration and determination. One consideration is that elements responsible for the ownership and resultant development, and subsequent maintenance of the web-sites within their respective Ministries, would also own their e-services and be responsible for their setting up and subsequent maintenance. They would not, however, be responsible for the overall management of the Site on which their individual web-sites would reside or, for that matter, the e- Government Services site on which their services would reside. The management of both the Government Site (GRENET) and e-Services site could be farmed out in their totality to a third party contractor. In the case of both the Government Site (GRENET) and the e-Government Services site, the owner would be responsible for the following aspects of the operation during and subsequent to implementation: Implementation: o Drawing up the visual and content requirements of the e-Services site in accordance with established standards. o Commissioning the design of the e-Services site. o Commissioning the development of the e-Services site. o Appointing a host and manager (Web Master) for the site. o Drawing up a service level agreement / contract with the site- manager on the basis of agreed parameters. 119 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha Post‐implementation operations:  o Ensuring that the site-manager carries out the job according to agreed parameters set out in the service level agreement / contract. o Maintaining the currency of the e-Government Services site in terms of content and requesting the site-manager to carry out any changes to design and format of the web-site as required from time to time. The ownership of the Government Site (GRENET) – as against the infrastructure - is an issue that needs addressing. Several options are open for consideration. Ownership could fall to the Information Ministry, or the Ministry of Finance, or a new Government organization which can be created with this specific purpose. The e-Government Services site will be a new development. There is no Government entity that would be an automatic choice for ownership. A new Government entity catering for this function may well be a more feasible option. In terms of the e-Services site, the owner of the site would be responsible for the site itself but not for the individual services residing thereon. The individual services are owned by, and therefore the responsibility of, the respective service-delivery Ministries/Agencies These shall, as a result, be responsible for the development and subsequent maintenance of their respective services, including the management of any organizations contracted for the carrying out of such services. 120 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha PRIORITIZATION OF SERVICES TO GO ON‐LINE    Information services can start to go on-line once the preliminaries issues relative to the Government Web-site re-structuring, organizational issues as to who does what and web design standards are settled. Transaction services are not so easy to implement given various issues that have to be addressed prior to roll-out. The transaction services will go on line gradually according to a time- scale that needs to be set. It will therefore be necessary to prioritize their roll-out on a set of criteria, some of which work against one another. Suggested criteria include the following: o The volume of transactions being handled by the service and the number of clients. The higher the volume the more ideal it would be to roll out the service. o The potential backroom cost-savings in implementing on-line services. The higher the savings the more attractive the early roll- out. It is likely that the bigger the service the higher will be the savings on backroom activities. o The complexity of the service. The higher the complexity of the service the more difficult it is to achieve roll-out. o Whether the service-providing Department is computerized and, if the application is in a state of development, the likely target date when it will be completed. If the Department is not computerized, it will be difficult to achieve early roll-out unless the service is simple and does not require back-room computerization. o The level of robustness of the current IT application within the service providing Department. o The level of security that the service requires. The higher the level of security the more likely that the service will be delayed in roll-out or that the service will only be supplied in a more limited manner. o The level of business process re-engineering and/or changes in legislation that may be required in the service-providing Department prior to roll out. The bigger the requirement the more likely that rollout will be delayed. 121 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha o The level of complexity in integrating the Internet front-end to the back-office system. The higher the complexity, the later the rollout. An assessment of the services to go on line will be based on various exercises at different stages of the e-Government Programme. 01. The first exercise will be relatively high level and will serve to identify those Government services that should ideally go on-line. This exercise will also serve to provide a broad outline as to what the service will entail by way of deliverables and back-office linkages. This initial exercise will also serve to establish the positioning of the individual e-Government services in the related service clusters. 02. The second exercise will be more detailed in that it will entail a prioritization exercise resulting in a multi-year rollout plan for e- Government Services. The rollout plan will be established following analysis of each and every service on the basis of the above criteria. 03. Detailed requirement specification of the individual e-Government Services and any possible (BPR) requirements of related back-office systems will be mapped out at the implementation stage of each service. The Implementation of a Pilot  A service or a restricted series of services will be earmarked for the implementation of a pilot that will test all the features that will eventually characterize e-Government services. These features would include: o User friendliness. o Security. o Authentication. o Interaction with multiple back-office systems. o Visual presentation. o Features for persons with special needs. The pilot service/s will run on a reduced-scale model of the three-tier architecture that will be needed to run them when they eventually go live. 122 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha  COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY  A Communications Strategy is necessary throughout the various stages of the e-Government Programme. Basically the Strategy would cover the pre-implementation and implementation stages of e-Government. In the pre-implementation stage it would be ideal to sound out public perceptions and expectations by means of surveys and focus groups. The surveys and focus groups would establish: o Public awareness as to the existence of e-services and electronic channels as the means to access such services, including Government services. o Public perceptions and expectations relative to e-Government service delivery. o Propensity by the public to use e-services once these would be on- line and related reasons. o Preferences relative to eventual delivery channels that could be provided. o Conditions under which usage of electronic delivery channels would be taken up by the public. The surveys and focus groups would be targeted to address a comprehensive and statistically significant cross-section of the population. In the eventual analysis of results, however, attention would be given to replies submitted by specific categories of the population, e.g. youths, businesses, the elderly, persons with differing levels of education and so on. The results would influence not only the choice and frequency of eventual service delivery channels but also the subsequent 'marketing' of the services relative to specific target groups. The exercise would also serve to ascertain the extent and nature of any eventual capacity building requirements on a national scale. 123 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha During the implementation stage when e-Government services will start going on-line, it will become necessary for the public to be made aware of their existence and of the potential benefits that can be obtained from the utilization of such services. Work need to be done (market research) to ascertain the most appropriate communications strategies to be utilized relative to target audiences. Potential clients have to be made aware of the advantages in the utilizing on-line as against traditional modes of service. The communication strategy should emphasize those aspects that are likely to influence the public and determine whether or not on-line services are utilized. Such aspects as the respect of privacy and the security level afforded by the system in effecting on-line transactions, especially those involving money transfers, need to be emphasized. A mix of direct marketing and poster, audio-visual, print media as well as on-line advertising will likely be used for promoting the new on-line services that are available. There should be different marketing approaches to different clients mainly on such parameters as age, IT literacy and level of education. The communications strategy campaign should not raise expectations unduly and should maintain a constant tempo over an appreciable period of time. It should intensify when a critical mass of eGovernment services will have gone on-line. The campaign should also factor: o Promoting of the use of the Internet and other established service delivery channels. o Sensitisation of the public to the fact that these new service delivery options are available. 124 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha o Promoting a customer-focused services by the Government, thereby enhancing its image. o Raising public awareness as to the training facilities that will be provided in terms of Internet usage. The Information Department should be responsible for the Communications Strategy, but this should be coordinated and developed in conjunction with the other agencies. Third party services may have to be engaged as appropriate.   GOVERNMENT INTERNAL CAPACITY BUILDING  Significant organizational changes will be required in order to cater for new roles and functions which the implementation of e-Government will require. Sizeable changes will be required too in individual roles, work attitudes, work culture, skills-base and work strategies during the period of up-take of theses technologies. Most of the mundane, tedious and repetitious functions are likely to be replaced by new web-technology, communications, and customer care skills. The resultant organizational changes and skill levels within the Public Service will be far-reaching and continuous. Specific training programmes will therefore need to be planned and implemented throughout the Public sector in order to develop the human resource capabilities, not only in computer literacy and competence, but also in research techniques, information gathering, data filtering, data management, information sharing dissemination as well as in improved 125 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha service delivery skills and customer management techniques and sensibilities. ORGANIZATION‐SPECIFIC INITIATIVES  Recent experience in other countries such as the UK and Ireland relative to the implementation of e-Government is that the initiative must be centrally piloted by a Programme Coordinating Entity that will cut across departmental boundaries. Individual service-providing Departments will still be responsible for the implementation of on-line delivery of their particular services but this implementation will be within the wider ambit of the cross-Government initiatives. The following organizational requirements in this start-up phase of the Programme can be envisaged as immediate requirements: The Central Information Management Agency  The establishment of a Central Information Management Agency (CIMA) is vital to the coordination of the overall programme. In the ambit of e- Government, the Central Information Management Agency (CIMA) is necessary to take on a host of planning and coordination responsibilities, including: • Planning and Owning the e-Government Programme. a. Design and build the e-Government Portal Architecture b. Determining and sizing the Backbone c. Design, construct, maintain the Grenada Government Network d. Provision of e-Commerce solutions e. Create a Secure environment, viz: i. Design Security features ii. Authentication features iii. Smart card solutions f. Mobilizing the establishment of Ministries' websites 126 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha g. Preparing of procedures and standards h. Promoting, implementing, and managing Smart Partnership with the Private Sector • Ownership of policies and standards relative to e-Government matters, such as: - Public Key Infrastructure. - Web presentation and accessibility. - e-Government Service delivery, quality and standards. - Channel Policy. - Branding and Corporate Identity standards. - Standards relative to third-party presence on the Government Portal. Ministriesʹ Information Management Units (IMUʹs)  The creation of Information Management Units in each Ministry or Agency is required to give each Ministry enough in-house capability to manage its Information functions. Ministry IMU's have to look at the identification, development and maintenance of their respective Information System / Technology / Management requirements. IMU's need to be established early to ensure available capability for the internals of the Ministry. Within the context of e-Government, IMU's will play an important part both in the development of their respective Ministry and Departmental web-sites, as well as in the implementation phase of on-line services. Following implementation, IMU's will have to tend to the maintenance and further development of such on-line services. Disciplines in web-design and development as well as knowledge of the technical aspects of on-line service provision, and the respective interfacing with back-office systems, will definitely be required in IMU's. In the initial phases of the Programme it will be possibly to supply much of 127 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha the know-how from the Central IMU. Ultimately, however, the capability must be developed in the IMU's. It is unlikely that there will be swift and co-ordinated development of Ministry web-sites and on-line services without the efforts of IMU's out on the field. It is therefore recommended that three pilot Ministry sites be identified for the setting up of operational IMU's during 2001, following the establishment of the necessary organizational and operational framework. Other Ministries would subsequently follow on the basis of the established pilots. Public Key Infrastructure Certification Authority  The Certification Authority will require suitable organization, structure, procedures, processes and related human resources. It has to handle a widespread service such as the generation, distribution and maintenance of pubic keys to all eligible users of Grenada's e-Government services. The extent to which capacity building in this instance will be required by Government will depend on which of several options will eventually be taken up. Ownership of the GRENET and the e‐Government Sites  Capacity building needs to be undertaken by way of building the competence of the Government Ministries and Agencies that will be entrusted with the ownership of the Government Site and the e- Government Services site. Even if this entity will eventually outsource these functions, it still needs a core of knowledge workers, well versed in the subject, who will be able to manage the contractors. 128 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha SMART PARTNERSHIP: PUBLIC/PRIVATE  COLLABORATION  It is expected that such a wide-ranging initiative as the setting up and running of e-Government will entail substantial inputs from the private sector. This would provide significant impetus to the development of the local IT community. Although the private IT sector in Grenada is small and not well developed, and though it is not now possible to define the nature and extent of Public / Private relationships in the various activities that will come about as a result of the implementation of e-Government, it is reasonable to expect that Private Sector involvement would be forthcoming in the following areas: • Design of the Portal and Network • The setting up and provision of Certification Services. • The implementation and maintenance of Delivery Channels. • Web Development and maintenance on behalf of Government Entities • The provision of E-Commerce Solutions. • Hardware and Software Supplies, and modifications In some cases, such as in the management of Delivery Channels and in Web Development, the Private Sector is already present on the scene. It is expected that this presence will increase substantially in parallel with the additional activity generated by the implementation of e-Government. Setting up the e-Government Portal will necessitate the partnership with a major player in the e-Commerce field. There are not a lot of organizations that are capable of providing comprehensive solutions of the magnitude that will be required by the Government in the building of the design and building of the complete Portal Architecture. Grenada will need to make itself attractive to prospective International partners who would be interested in investing in the development of the Portal Architecture, as a showcase to the World. 129 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha FUNDING THE E‐GOVERNMENT INITIATIVE  Central Government Financing  Funding the e-Government programme is expected to be made via the annual Government Budget. The e-Government programme in this context is taken to comprise: o The setting up of the necessary technical infrastructure and architecture. o The setting up of the necessary organizational structures that will be required for implementation and subsequent maintenance. o The development of the front end. o The middleware requirements relative to each on-line service. o The application development requirements relative to the back office services to go on-line. o The business process reengineering exercises, formal and virtual, that will have to take place. It would not be prudent to advance an approximate estimate at this point in time. When initiatives of this magnitude are embarked upon, the best solution relative to financing would be to commit a sum that represents the start-up financing and thereafter work on specific estimates relative to each individual project or service that will be identified for implementation. The Government has already undertaken expenditure over the past five years in respect of IT development and maintenance in the Public Service. Any amount earmarked for the implementation of e-Government should reside with a central co-ordinating entity, which in turn will have the mandate of prioritizing initiatives and attending to their financing. Centralization of funding is a form of assurance that the e-Government 130 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha initiative is co-ordinated and that a holistic approach is guaranteed. It is essential that individual Departments and Government bodies do not go their own way in the on-line implementation of their own services. External Financing  Government and non-government financing would need to be explored. Some initiatives have already been taken in this regard. Return on Investment  Purely financial return on investments should not be based on direct income from transactions. It is unlikely that the system will feasibly allow for client payment for individual transactions effected, at least not in the short term. The basis for assessing return on investment should embrace that of offsetting set-up costs against savings to be obtained from reductions in the processing costs, as well as qualitative improvements in service performance. Improvements in service delivery will result in added value, and are as important as purely financial considerations. conclusion  The ICT document has been developed to enable Grenada to become a knowledge based society. In order to achieve the Vision of the Prime Minister, we need the tools of the ICT as well as a paradigm shift of the thinking of all citizens in the Nation. Towards this end, a major emphasis will be placed on the human resource development activities so as to secure optimal benefits of these technologies. We have sought to capture a strategy for the development of ICT for the small island economy of Grenada. The approach has been all 131 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha embracing. Small economies generally lack the skills and resources to pursue structural development without external assistance. The next stage is to go deeper into the definition of specific programmes and projects, and the development of appropriate budgets and financing strategies. Given the nature of the technologies this initiative of Grenada will be designed to accommodate regional requirements of the Caribbean and the Wider Americas. Some of this will be sought through economies gained from cooperation within the Caribbean region and in the wider Americas. Grenada will need to look to various multinational agencies and bi-laterals to add resources to its own domestic efforts. We recognize the need to periodically review and update the Strategy and Action Plan. Experience and better information will guide this process. We are convinced though that, as we improve on this Strategy and Plan, Grenada's commitment to the use of ICT as a strategy of development must be remain unwavering. 132 A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA Anurag Sinha INTRODUCTION KNOWLEDGE-BASED ECONOMY Executive Summary: Collaborative Approach Human Resource Development Access of Communities to Technology Project Management BUILDING AN INFORMATION SOCIETY IN GRENADA Prime Minister Dr. Keith Mitchell VISION MISSION STRATEGY Underlying Principles Vision of Grenada in the Information Age STRATEGIC THRUSTS BUILDING THE NATIONAL CAPACITY INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE: DEVELOPING HUMAN RESOURCES EDUCATION AND TRAINING DEVELOPING THE HUMAN RESOURCE CAPACITY Teacher Education And Engagement Engaging Civil Society: Open Door Strategy Delivering Curricular Change A Regional Educational And Training Role For Grenada Education and Training objectives FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT OF ICT INDUSTRY Modernizing Government INSTITUTIONAL & MANAGERIAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROMOTING UNIVERSAL UPTAKE OF THE INTERNET The Dissemination of e-mail on a national scale The creation of a Grenada National Internet Exchange National Free Grenadian Internet DEVELOPING ELECTRONIC COMMERCE THE IMPACT OF ECOMMERCE ON THE ECONOMY (i) Information Technology and Communication (ii) Banking, finance and Business Services (iii) Manufacturing (v) Retail THE IMPACT OF ECOMMERCE ON SOCIETY (i) Employment (ii) The advantages to the Consumer DEVELOPING THE ELECTRONIC COMMERCE SECTOR A.

ICT is a new significant factor that can propel performance and   growth of the Grenada economy. This Strategy and Action Plan   represents Grenada's approach to capturing the potentials of these   technologies and to utilizing them for sustainable development and the   fight against poverty.       ICT's allow faster delivery of change in a variety of sectors including   distance education, telemedicine, environmental management, trade,   and in strengthening the participation of social groups and the creation of   new livelihoods. ICT facilitates the reaching and embracing of more   people being involved and interacting with greater numbers of the   citizens.       ICT opens up access to information sources worldwide, promotes   networking that transcends the limitations of being a small island. ICT can   foster the empowerment of communities, women, youths and socially   disadvantaged groups, and helps spread knowledge about \"best   practices\" and experiences. ICT is indispensable in realizing the new   information society and the national knowledge-based economy.    KNOWLEDGE‐BASED ECONOMY    In the Prime Ministers' Millennium Vision delivered on the 31st December   1999, the Honorable Dr Keith Mitchell proposed the acquisition and   5   A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     utilization of knowledge as one of the most effective ways of reducing the   level of poverty in the domestic economy.   The Prime Minister is convinced that Information and Communication   Technology must be embraced as a vital tool in the next phase of   Grenada's development.     \"My government is totally committed to creating an attractive policy and   regulatory environment to facilitate the development …of Grenada as a   Knowledge Society\"      The Government also designated the new decade as the Knowledge   Enhancement Decade for Grenada, and set out a series of specific   objectives to be achieved within the ten-year period.       \"At least fifty percent of our human resources [must be] engaged in high-  value knowledge-based activities, including information and   communication technology, financial services, education, agriculture,   tourism, sport and entertainment\"      The Grenada government recognizes that the development of a   Knowledge-economy requires the intensification and deepening of the   domestic capability for acquisition and utilization of knowledge in all   sectors of the economy. Grenada will embrace information and   communication technologies and use them as development tools.      This Strategy and Action Plan is one more step in the development of   Grenada as a knowledge-based economy.        6   A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     Executive Summary:    Grenada is an independent state comprising three island: Grenada (120   sq miles), Carriacou (13 sq miles) and Petit Martinique. The capital is the   city of St.George, situated on the south western part of the mainland.   Grenada experiences a warm tropical climate, with two main seasons.   The temperature ranges from 20 to 30 degree centigrade with mean   temperature of 25 degree centigrade and annual rain fall of 1380 mm   with humidity ranging from 65 to 75 %.      The National Strategic Plan will translate the Vision of the Government of   Grenada into a set of policies and actions to enable the exploitation of   information and communication technologies as a tool of national   development. The Plan will seek to put information and communication   technologies (ICT) at the centre of Grenada's economic development as   a dynamic industry sector in itself, and in support of the development of   other sectors of the economy.   The Plan should pursue the following objectives   • Raise and develop awareness, build vision and generate   enthusiasm about the advantageous use of ICT in everyday social   and economic life   • Design and implement policies to capture information and   knowledge for development   • Promote and build connectivity and the necessary infrastructure for   access to information and development    • Build required human and social capacities and institutions, and   provide training and education to impart requisite skills   • Create new livelihood and employment opportunities;   7   A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     • Empower communities and disadvantaged groups, reinforce   participatory approaches and good governance and foster   networking;   • Build a public service that allows and encourages electronic access   to public information, and facilitates low-cost electronic   transactions with the civil society.      The Plan will take a five-year time horizon, and establish the framework for   a knowledge-based society as the platform on which to foster,   accelerate and sustain long-term economic development.  The   development of a knowledge-based society will be through training and   re-training, and otherwise strengthening of our human resource through   the availability of information and through local information technology   service industries and technology applications.      • Integral to the implementation process will be -   • Government's leadership and the commitment of resources    • Smart Partnership with key sectors.   • The involvement of all stakeholders in the execution and the   continuing development of the action plan.   • Rigorous pursuit of results within the planned timeframes.      The strategy will also seek to attract local and foreign investors through   various investment packages and incentives, sufficient workspace with   supporting technology infrastructure, as well as a pool of trained workers   and professional staff. Potential investors will be aggressively targeted   through a focused promotional strategy.      8   A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     Collaborative Approach     A collaborative approach will be encouraged for the implementation of   the Plan. Private and public sector partnerships will be pursued while   benchmarking of international standards.   The role of the international community and the Grenadian private sector   will also be actively promoted, particularly in terms of the transfer of   information, benchmarking and keeping abreast of developments in the   sector.  The private sector will be urged and encouraged to take over   and drive the continuing growth of the sector.    Government will encourage the private sector to be a partner in building   out infrastructure, in developing our human resource, in providing jobs   and in taking on development activities.      Government will promote a regional and hemispheric approach to those   elements that lend themselves to such cooperation.      Human Resource Development   The human resource strategy will seek to produce trained Grenadian   suitable for employment across the full range of ICT activities.    • Formal and non-formal training    • Private sector training initiatives   • E-training over a range of training methods   • The Physically Challenged.    • Scholarship support for talented students.    • Development of an appropriate IT Curriculum to inculcate the IT   culture at the Primary, Secondary levels, and in private training   institutions.    • Training of trainers to deliver high end programming curricula.    9   A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     Particular attention will be placed on speeding up the generation of   higher end jobs by strengthening our capacity to produce persons trained   to international standards as programmers, web managers, and other IT   technologists.       Access of Communities to Technology     It is vital that every parish and community in Grenada have effective   access to Information and Communication Technology. Identification of   the existing and potential community access nodes will be part of the   Plan process. The delivery of distance learning modules for Adult Literacy   Education through the Community network would be a major thrust. The   Plan will incorporate the promotion of IT awareness, accelerate ease of   access, facilitate acquisition of hardware promote is utilization.   Specific programs will be implemented to narrow and eliminate the Digital   Divide in Grenada society. The introduction of IT in Primary schools will   widen the catchments of youth with IT skills and deepen the program   already in place in the Secondary schools. Government will bring IT literary   training to local communities. During the academic year 2001-02, all   Secondary schools Computer labs will be made available for training to   citizens after normal schools hours. Adult literacy programs will be   intensified       The potentials of the Postal System in supporting community development   will be harnessed. The Government will encourage and support an action   plan for the building of an electronic infrastructure for the Post Offices. The   Social Services departments of Government and the NGO's will be   mobilized for hands-on development at the village and community levels.   The delivery of distance learning modules for Adult Literacy Education   through the Community network has already begun and will be 10  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     expanded and accelerated the plan will also address the promotion of e-  Commerce and e-Government strategies.      Project Management    A central administrative and technical Unit will be established to manage   the implementation of the ICT Plan. This requirement is dictated by the   critical nature of the Plan, the need to manage the collaboration   between Ministries and Agencies with respect to the national IT policy,   and the need to maintain efficiencies and the timeframes.    11  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     BUILDING AN INFORMATION SOCIETY IN GRENADA   Prime Minister Dr. Keith Mitchell   VISION    \"My government is totally committed to the development of Grenada as a  Knowledge Society by 2010.\"   MISSION    To put Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) at the center of  Grenada’s social and economic development as a dynamic industry  sector in itself, and in support of the development of other sectors of the  economy    To establish a knowledge-based society as the platform on which to  foster, accelerate and sustain long-term social, cultural and economic  development.    The Government is committed to raising the quality of life in Grenada to   the highest attainable levels.  In striving for this goal it will actively promote   and utilize Information and Communication Technology to the widest   possible extent, as a means of strengthening the economy, creating jobs,   ensuring social equity and enhancing education and culture. The   Government will ensure that all citizens participate in the creation of, and   benefit from, the additional social, cultural and economic wealth that will   be created.    STRATEGY    The Government will create an enabling environment to attract local and  foreign investors through appropriate policies, legislation and improved  public sector efficiency.     12  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     • The strategic intent of the government is to enable affordable   access to global information to all its citizens including   disadvantaged persons.   • The strategy will seek to pursue a sustainable process of action and   review which is based on the synergistic development of:   • Education and training to develop human resources in the   necessary ICT and business skills;   • Use of ICT to expand the horizons and capacity of existing   businesses and recruit new business to Grenada;   • Deepening the use of ICT in governance to increase its efficiency   and transparency in particular in support of 1 and 2 above;   • The implementation of a focused promotional strategy, directed at   the business and government sectors and civil society         Underlying Principles      The following Principles underpin the strategy that the Government will   pursue in the achievement of this Mission:    • All Grenadians will have the opportunity and the means to   participate in the Information Society and the Information Economy   irrespective of their financial, social or educational circumstances.   • The Government will actively promote the creation of the   Information Society and the Information Economy via the provision   of transactional on-line e-Government Services.   • The Government will provide the necessary policy, institutional and   regulatory framework that is required for the successful proliferation   of electronic commerce.   • Businesses will be encouraged to adopt electronic commerce.  13  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     • The achievement of computer literacy by all sectors of the   population will be actively pursued.     • The necessary measures will be taken to build up a critical mass of   Information Technology specialists that will be required to sustain   the growth of the Information Society and the Information   Economy.   Vision of Grenada in the Information Age    Over the next five years a deep transformation will take place in the   Grenada society and economy.  This transformation will take place as the   Government, in close partnership with the private sector, strives   energetically towards the attainment of an Information Society and an   Information Economy.        The vision is that in a few years the following will be achieved:     Service will improve    Citizens will benefit from one-stop, timely, high-quality and easily   accessible electronic services provided by both the Public and the Private   Sectors. The Government will provide its services over the Internet and   citizens will be served at whatever time of day from home or work place,   while still opting to utilize traditional service channels if they so desire.    Businesses will also offer their services to consumers over the Internet on a   24x7 basis.    Accessibility be universal    Information and Communication Technology will become fully accessible   nationwide; at least 50% of the population will have connection to   electronic services, and there will be widespread accessibility to services   14  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     and digital participation in economic, cultural and social life via multiple   solutions that Technology now provides.   Education will be Universal  The Education and Training system will   • Address the formation of a knowledge society trained to take full   advantage of the benefits of Information and Communication   Technology.    • Produce a crop of IT professionals of the highest calibre, and in the   numbers required to achieve the transition to an e-Society and a K-  Economy.   • Promote lifelong education initiatives by the Government in   partnership with the private sector, voluntary organizations and   other bodies.   • All citizens from all walks of life will have the opportunity to   participate in the Information Society and Knowledge Economy    The Economy will thrive  Grenada businesses will thrive as opportunities are opened to them by   way of access to a Global Market and a reduction in internal process   costs that result from the adoption of e-Commerce solutions. The   widespread demand for comprehensive e-Commerce solutions and Web   development will boost the local IT industry.   The leap in demand by businesses for e-Commerce solutions and the   implementation of e-Government Services will, in turn, generate a sizeable   demand for highly skilled IT professionals.  This situation will produce a   significant amount of high value-added jobs for our youths.   The Government will effect all its business-to-business (B2B) transactions   electronically, not only in order to optimize its resource utilization, but also   to encourage corresponding businesses to take up e-Commerce. B2B  15  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     electronic interaction will become a matter of course throughout the   economy.   Communications will be of the highest standard and will be  affordable:     The Communications infrastructure will be of the highest standards, giving   users high-bandwidth, low cost, reliable and secure access to the Internet,   via a host of access channels.  The access channels will be used   interchangeably and users will be able to interact across diverse   electronic channels.  Users will have the opportunity to choose among a   number of Communications service-providers.    The liberalization process in the telecommunications sector will bring   about an overall increase in efficiency and quality of service as well as a   general lowering of costs and prices to the benefit of the consumer.    These improvements will enhance social inclusion as well as increase the   competitiveness of the economy.   STRATEGIC THRUSTS    Achieving this Vision will entail the collective effort of the forces that make   up Grenadian Society and Economy.  It will be achieved via a series of   strategic thrusts, which will require the Government, in collaboration with   the Private sector, to set the scene.    The main strategic thrusts will be the following:      • The undertaking of a national capacity-building exercise in  collaboration with the Private Sector, aimed at the attainment of an  Information Society and an Information Economy in Grenada –  primarily the:     • Development of a legal framework that will regulate and, more   significantly, facilitate all forms of electronic interaction. 16  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha       • Promotion of the widespread use of the Internet in Grenada.     • Promotion of widespread utilization of e-Commerce in Grenadian   businesses, and developing the Information industry in Grenada     • Provision of IT and Internet education and training to all sectors of   the Grenadian society.     • Provision of mail and free access to e-Government Services to  everyone as the means to accelerate Internet uptake.     • Establishment of kiosks in selected sites to allow citizens access to e-  government services     • Development of a high quality and affordable telecommunications  infrastructure.     • The establishment of a permanent National Commission that will act   as a catalyst for the ongoing development of an Information  Society and an Information economy in Grenada.     • The implementation of e-Government that will enable the provision   of all Public Services on-line.                                         17  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha      BUILDING THE NATIONAL CAPACITY      INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT    The implementation of the Strategic objectives to bring about the   Information Society and Economy in Grenada will require the collective   efforts of the Public and Private Sectors.  This public-private partnership is   necessary to implement e-Government, e-Commerce, and to build the   national capacities in information, knowledge, skills and the utilization of   digital technologies.        The Government will stimulate the development of the Information Society   and the Information Economy by providing the regulatory, financial and   institutional infrastructure necessary for the creation of the ideal   environment, which will in turn bring about the proliferation of electronic   interaction. It will encourage the private sector to develop the technical   infrastructure at a national and at a micro levels and to develop and   adopt e-Commerce solutions.  The Private Sector will also have the   opportunity to participate actively in several national capacity-building   exercises.          THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE:    Government's strategy will be to enable a physical infrastructure   architecture encompassing all attributes, and criteria that will allow ICT to   be the medium through which Grenada will become a knowledge-based   society in the Knowledge enhancement decade. In that regard, it will   promote a high quality and affordable Telecommunication Infrastructure.   18  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha        In addressing the need for appropriate and reliable Physical infrastructure,   the Government commits to the following principles:     • We will conform with all internationally accepted standards    • Review all options of interconnectivity for all national and   international access    • We will develop an appropriate infrastructure framework and   access to meet the stated objectives consistent with the socio- economic environment     • Securing fast and reliable connectivity and value for money by driving through   the deregulation process..     • Our framework will ensure that Grenada is not locked into a single  supplier mode     • We will provide ease of access through the provision of convenient   access points nationally     • We will strive to deliver affordable access consistent with our socio  economic environment     •  We will facilitate the development of national infrastructure with   the capacity to support the delivery of integrated voice, data, and  video     • We will continuously track and adapt developments in ICT in line   with changing requirements     • We will seek strategic partners to facilitate the creation of the  various components of the information society      • We will build capacity to ensure the delivery of integrated voice,  data and video     • The infrastructure will have capacity to support distance and on-line  teaching and learning      19  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     • We will deploy scaleable technology which will accommodate new  requirements as and when needed     • The infrastructure will be deployed in such a manner as to possess   full e-commerce capabilities, reflecting the need to provide for:  • ICT Infrastructure  • ICT Industry Development  • Modernizing Government  • Education and training  • Regulation and Legal Infrastructure     Mindful of the weaknesses in the current infrastructure, government  will undertake action aimed at the following:         (a) Filling gaps in Infrastructure     - Reconciling speed with due diligence and transparency of   process in licensing new carriers.   - Ensuring the availability of wholesale pricing from the incumbent   carrier for the new carriers.  - Developing local online payment facilities for E-Commerce.   - Reclassification where necessary of the import duties on   hardware and software to facilitate the development of ICT  related business.    - Provision of a joint bonded warehousing facility to improve the  local distribution network especially for smaller businesses.    - Working together with other Caribbean countries through OECS,  CARICOM or other joint forums to define common requirements,  provide integrated services and establish stronger negotiating  positions.            (b) Improving interconnectivity of ICT infrastructure  - Negotiating bi-lateral agreements to ensure that voice and data traffic are   exchanged within the region and not routed over expensive international  bandwidth. Eliminating restrictions to the provision of common regional  services such as Roaming, online learning, and e-business developments.      (c) Relating infrastructure provision to developing ICT  services   20  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     - Developing a mechanism to provide accurate forecasts of  future local market requirements for connectivity so as to give  potential suppliers of connectivity an indication of aggregate  demand and thus pull through new provision;   - Ensuring that the proposed business park/incubator facility has  state of the art connectivity as well as 24/7 engineering support.   - Ensure that the network servicing the Government of Grenada is  scalable and adequately sized to meet current and future  needs, especially for e-government and education     (d) Developing a High Quality and affordable   Telecommunications Infrastructure  The maximization of existing telecommunications infrastructures and the   opening up of competition in the field are important steps in the context   of the attainment of the Information Society and Knowledge Economy      Allowing the local Cable TV services provider to expand into data services   to the public is a logical step both insofar as it concerns the maximization   of the national telecommunications infrastructure as well as the opening   up of competition in the field.    Open competition in the telecommunications field, which is a stated   policy direction of Government, will bring prices down and improve the   service, thereby making the Internet an affordable and attractive   proposition to the wider population.     The liberalization of the telecommunications industry in Grenada is   therefore critical for the expansion of e-Commerce.  This area will now be   addressed by the Private Sector, with the Government providing the   regulatory environment that is necessary for the effective functioning of   the sector.              21  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha                         DEVELOPING HUMAN RESOURCES EDUCATION AND   TRAINING      The objective is to put Knowledge at the centre of the nation's social and  economic development, and secure the development of Grenada as a  Knowledge Society.    Education is key to this strategy as the backbone of the knowledge   society whose social and economic value is already widely accepted.   The aim is to use the ICT strategy to accelerate general improvements of   basic skills in literacy, numeracy, and in the conduct of business and, as   necessary, to deliver particular targeted education packages for current   and potential employees.       The target will be to reflect world standards and resources configured for   local needs.       DEVELOPING THE HUMAN RESOURCE CAPACITY    The Government of Grenada has long recognized the strategic   importance of Education and training as the principal instrument of   economic and social development. Its ICT strategy began by the placing   of IT Labs in all the Secondary schools of the nation. This has already   22  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     enabled the significant growth of basic computer literacy and skills   among those of school-age population.       Government recognizes the need to both widen and deepen this   process, and therefore undertakes to pursue the following:       • We will provide an enabling environment to facilitate ICT literacy for all  citizens     • As a priority we will develop programmes to ensure that all   Ministers, Permanent Secretaries and other Senior Officers are ICT  competent     • We will develop and implement an ICT public awareness program  to promote the value of the use of ICT in our daily lives.     • We will train the government’s workforce in the basic competencies   of ICTs     • We will train large numbers of persons in the labor force with  relevant information technology skills that will contribute to new  revenue streams that are ICT enabled     • We will provide incentives for businesses to train their workforce with   relevant information technology skills that will contribute to new  revenue streams that are ICT enabled          • We will train all teachers in the use of ICT, and in its integration in the   curriculum for teaching and learning     • We will ensure that all teachers are provided with a personal  computer and access to the internet     •  We will train large numbers of persons in the labour force with the   relevant information technology skills that will contribute to new  revenue streams that are ICT enabled     • We will encourage the emergence and development of private   sector training institutions 23  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha       • We will provide suitable programs to upgrade the functional literacy   of all our citizens so that they are able to participate fully in the new  economy     • We will provide an enabling environment to ensure lifelong learning   for all citizens     • We will provide all our citizens with the basic competencies in the  use of ICT     • We will train all Teachers in the use of ICT, and ensure its integration   into the Curriculum for teaching and learning     • We will ensure that all teachers are provided with a personal  computer and access to the Internet. The objective is to facilitate  teachers having a PC in their homes to develop competencies  which will enhance teaching and learning of students in the  classroom.     • We will establish an Technology Education Task Force to complete  the development of an holistic ICT Plan for education and  commence its implementation without delay.        Teacher Education And Engagement  Teachers are the front line troops in the development of the e-economy in   Grenada.  They will be accorded the status, facilities and role of key   change agents not only in delivering the skills of the next generation, but   for their influence over the community.  The highest priority must be given   to their engagement and support.   In this role, efforts would be made to create teachers’ forums and other   mechanisms that help generate teacher ownership of the education   element of the strategy and set detailed priorities with it.  In line with Smart   Partnership principles, teachers’ Union leaders will be enlisted firmly   behind the strategy, recognizing the key role the K-economy approach   gives to education, and the future possibilities for the expansion of the   education industry. 24  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha        Engaging Civil Society: Open Door Strategy            Schools and libraries will be developed as local resources centers,   opening their doors to the community after normal hours for the use of the   new technology.  They should promote ICT and skills as an enabling tool:   empowering individuals and the institutions of civil society to better   achieve their current ambitions and broaden their horizons. The open-  door institutions should be distinctly branded, with recognizable logos and   signage, perhaps as ‘Grenada ICT Strategy Smart Partner’. The open door   itself might be adopted as a symbol for the new strategy.   This effort will give particular emphasis on:  a. Remedial literacy teaching  b. Specific Skills development   c. Use of School and Community based facilities  d. Involvement of NGO's      This bottom-up approach should lead to attempts to develop, value and   make more visible the cultural and environmental knowledge resident in   Grenada itself, and market this as appropriate;        The strategy should make special efforts to address the needs of the   relatively disadvantaged and socially excluded members of society.  This   is another strategy element that not only embodies social justice but can   help ensure wider recognition and social legitimacy for the initiative as a   whole.     Delivering Curricular Change  There are enormous opportunities for sharing experiences at a regional   level at all stages of this strategy, but particularly in the development of   educational provision.  Properly structured dialogues involving regional   participants may be one of the most cost-effective routes to opening   25  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     doors for individuals and institutions involved in education and training at   all levels;      However, use of ICT in education is not a panacea.  Educational software   can be technically smart, but socially impoverished. The changes in   teaching method which the new technology typically requires at primary   and secondary levels, such as allowing people to progress at their own   pace, need to be also socially enhancing.  Grenada and the Region   need to have a reflective and evaluative rather than purely technocratic   approach to managing change in curricula and teaching methods. We   should aim at a teaching and learning framework and a network that   add local and regional socio-cultural values to support and strengthen   curriculum restructuring.      At tertiary level the main curricula needs are to ensure that training in ICT   reflects changing national standards so as to attract local and   international entrepreneurship and capital; and to ensure that it is   buttressed by the development of general business skills.  Developing a   consciousness of world business standards and approaches to maximize   markets revenues is a key process in reinvigorating the traditional market   sectors. T A Marryshow College, already developing strategic partnerships   with UWI and with St George’s University, is well placed to help   consolidate local needs, and select, adapt and deliver from international   online education and training options in line with national requirements.   Smart Partnerships in delivery should seek to also develop partnerships   between public and private sector to define and share the cost of   effecting specific training requirements geared to investment in jobs and   infrastructure.  This would include product certification and the kind of   26  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     systems and software engineering support required to underpin any policy   initiative on this scale      A Regional Educational And Training Role For Grenada  It is disappointing that significant amount of the ICT training for the Region   takes place outside the region.  This seems to be mainly a function of the   lack of regional definition of goals and targets, and the absence of   central focus and priority to assign resources to create a regional center   of IT competence. Grenada could become the centre for regional IT   Training. A strategy for establishing Grenada as a major Hub for education   and training in ICT needs to be developed. It would benefit the Region,   yield significant local spillovers, and expose the island and its virtual   incubator/business park to new business opportunities.              Education and Training objectives    The Government, in collaboration with the Private Sector, will accelerate   and upgrade those initiatives aimed at providing widespread digital   literacy and producing a cohort of IT specialists to satisfy the labour   shortage that will inevitably occur.  These initiatives will extend beyond the   formal education ; and their implementation will involve the Private   Sector, the Ministry of Education, other public organizations, community   organizations, NGO's, and as many other interested organizations as   possible.       The envisaged initiatives will develop along the following lines:     27  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     (i) IT literacy in Schools   The Education initiatives in Secondary school  has been a success. Those   initiatives need to be deepened, and extended to the Primary schools.   The original program will be evaluated and refashioned to achieve the   specific ends of  supplying marketable skills and competence beyond   mere literacy. The implementation of widespread Internet access and the   increased training of primary and Secondary school Teachers in Internet   competences will also characterize the next phase of IT education.      (ii) Life‐long learning   There are major segments of the adult population which had had little or   no exposure to digital literacy.  If they are to be enticed to utilize the new   services, relevant initiatives to educate them must be undertaken.   Community level training will be intensified and made easily available on   a large scale. The use of the schools Lab facilities after normal school   hours will be embraced to widen and speed up the process. Basic literacy   skills, e-literacy skills, Internet skills, the use of standard software packages   will characterize the community level training.       (iii) Vocational Training and Certification  The IT literacy and competency training would be stepped up in a   focused manner with a view to increasing the chances of employability of   the unemployed segment of the population as well as providing digital   literacy for those already in employment, thereby ensuring that the   workforce will be prepared for the inevitable transformation that it will   face in the coming years.         Consideration would be given to providing incentives packages to firms   that organize IT literacy courses for their own staff. Workers initiatives to   28  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     upgrade their computer skills will also be recognized and supported. The   Private Sector institutions that offer Computer training will be encouraged   to become more active. Tailored courses could be drawn up and   delivered by private sector training firms, following the necessary   accreditation. These firms will play a major role in the generation of IT   technicians and professionals.      Online training will be encouraged and promoted as an effective cost-  effective rout to this end.      Consideration will be given to adopting European Computer Driving   License (ECDL), or its equivalent, as the official minimal requirement for  IT   literacy.  This form of recognition is important as an ever-increasing   number of employers, including the Public Service, will be looking for an   official certification of IT literacy of their prospective employees.  The   widespread adoption of the ECDL certification will mean that the local   workforce will have certification that is internationally recognized.      (iv) Tertiary Education  The Government will target the TA Marryshow Community College as the   focal point to spearhead development at this level. The College will be   encouraged to look to joint venture approaches with universities aboard   as well as the use of on-line teaching as a low cost approach to   achieving our target of professional training to the level of internationally   accepted competence.     (v) Skill Targets  The government will encourage and support of the production of certain   priority skills that will be in demand by the New Economy. The various   education and training programs in the public and the private sector s will  29  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     target the development of skilled Information Technology workers,   including the following:     i. Keyboard skills  ii. Speech and Marketing skills  iii. Transcriptions  iv. Programming  v. Hardware assembly and maintenance  vi. Scanning and digitizing  vii. CAD  viii. GIS  ix. Animation  x. Imaging  xi. Desktop publishing   xii. Database design, development and management  xiii. Internet professional skills  xiv. Network professionals (design, build, maintain).      (vi) Teaching and Training in the Work‐place  Government will encourage and support the private sector efforts to   develop ICT competence in the labour force. This could include   a. Encouraging private businesses to undertake in-house  training   b. Encouraging the development of private sector training  institutes   c. Promoting the capacities in Consultancy  d.      Links to overseas training and on-line academies           (vii) We Will Modernizing The Education Process  In making the classroom relevant to the New Economy, steps will be taken   to:     o Re-define the content and the role of Education in the  New Economy    o Update and modernize the Curriculum content  o Provide Computer Labs in all schools, and in some   classrooms  o Network ALL schools and provide system support 30  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     o Develop Electronic Libraries (Website & Links)  o Promote and facilitate self-learning and life-long learning  o Develop the habit and techniques of research  o Teach proper regard for Copyrights and Intellectual   Property  o Establish a body responsible for Education Technology  o Facilitate and support Distance Teaching and Learning            REGULATORY AND LEGAL INFRASTRUCTURE             Objects   The objects of building a legal and regulatory infrastructure are:       -  To enhance the reputation of Grenada as an international e-business centre;   -  To facilitate electronic transactions on a technology neutral basis by means of  reliable electronic records;   -  To remove uncertainties in conducting transactions electronically with respect  to the requirements for documents and for signatures to be in writing;   -  To promote public confidence in the validity, integrity and reliability of  conducting transactions electronically; and   -  To promote the development of the legal and business infrastructure necessary  to implement electronic transactions securely.        Regulatory policy  Transactions carried out by electronic means shall be regulated in a manner that:      -  Permits and encourages the growth of business by  electronic means through  the operation of free market forces;   - Promotes the greatest possible use of industry self-regulation;   - Is flexible; and   - Is technologically neutral.      31  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     Legislation will be enacted to establish the legal principles for the conduct   of e-commerce and the processing of electronic transactions. It would   seek to provide a secure legal foundation for the conduct of various forms   of electronic transactions, including the use and recognition of digital   documentation, and Emails transfers on a technology neutral basis.      The proposed legislation would be sufficiently flexible to accommodate   new technological developments and leave room for the market to   determine the future of e-commerce      The legislation would provide significant flexibility, enabling parties to an   electronic transaction to tailor a transaction (or series of transactions) to   suit their telecommunication, legal or system requirements.      An initial omnibus Electronic Transactions Bill will therefore be prepared to   provide for:   o Electronic Commerce: establishing a secure legal basis for electronic  communications, contracts, signatures and transactions, and  the establishment of a framework for Certification Authorities  and their regulation.   o Data Protection:  to ensure the protection of data, in order to protect  the rights of individuals vis-à-vis personal information.   o Computer Misuse: to criminalizes offences relating to the misuse of  computers and related paraphernalia.     Legal provisions have already been made in the setting up of the offices  of the telecommunications regulator with the establishment of ECTEL and  the National Telecommunication Regulatory Commission.              Some Guidelines for Legislation   32  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha        New Legislation would cover major issues such as:     1. Recognition of electronic records ‐ evidentiary weight:  Legislation should provide that information would not be denied legal   effect, validity, admissibility or enforceability solely on the ground that it is   in the form of an electronic record, or that, if such evidence is the best   evidence, it will not be denied admissibility on the grounds that it is not in   original form. For evidentiary purposes applied criteria should focus on the   reliability of the manner in which the electronic record was generated,   stored or communicated, the reliability of the manner in which the   integrity of the information was maintained, or the manner in which the   originator was identified.     2. Writing:  Some documents are required or described as a matter of law to be \"in   writing\". The legislation must provide that a legal requirement for \"writing\",   or a description of something as being \"in writing\", is satisfied by an   electronic record if the record is accessible and can be retained for   subsequent reference.     3. Original form:    Many jurisdictions require individuals or companies to maintain written   records. Legislation should establish the minimum requirements for an   electronic record to be regarded as the functional equivalent of an   original. Where the law requires information to be presented or retained in   its original form, an electronic record could be defined to meet that   requirement if the integrity of the information can be reliably assured.      4. Signatures:   33  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     It is already acceptable in law that a contract could still be binding even   if it is not physically signed. A signature is often only required for   evidentiary purposes. The Act provides that an electronic record meets   that requirement if the method of identifying the signatory meets certain   requirements (i.e. an electronic signature or electronic certificate).      5. Certification Service Providers:    The legislation should make provision for authorizing certification service   providers to issue accredited certificates that confirm the veracity of an   electronic signature. It should recognize certificates and certification   service providers for any other jurisdiction. [Insurance companies have a   new potential market in the insurance of the liability of such certification   service providers if one of their certificates turns out to be wrongly issued,   causing loss to those who relied on it.      6. Formation and validity of contracts and acknowledgement:    The legal principle of offer and acceptance, developed over many   centuries, is one of the basic requirements for the formation of a contract.   Legislation would need to provide that an offer and the acceptance of   an offer may be expressed by means of an electronic record. It should   establish rules of acknowledgment of receipt of an electronic record.     7. Virtual companies    Legislation would need to determine whether an offshore company,   which merely offers goods and services electronically from a web site   hosted in Grenada or transacts business through a server in Grenada, will   be regarded as carrying on business in Grenada, and whether that   company will be required to apply to the Government for a permit or   incorporate a Grenada company; whether an overseas company with   34  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     merely “virtual” presence status can claim to do business in Grenada by   using, for example, a Grenada  address or Grenadian domain name.      8. Encryption:   The legislation must make provision for regulations respecting the lawful   acquisition, use, import and export of encryption programs or other   encryption methods. The Police must be empowered to seize encryption   software. Magistrates/Judges must be empowered to direct persons to   provide assistance necessary to decode encrypted information.      9. Liability of intermediaries:   The legislation should make provision for clear definition of the liabilities of   Internet Service Providers, and others, for information transmitted over the   Internet. The legislation may determine that an ISP or other intermediary   who acts only as a conduit is not liable for the content of electronic   records provided that the intermediary has no actual knowledge or is not   aware of facts that would objectively indicate a likelihood of civil or   criminal liability in respect of material on the intermediary’s network.      10. Personal data (Data protection):   Legislation should make provision for the protection of personal data.   Provision should be made for the development of standards relating to   personal data.       11. Standards and Code of Conduct    Key Principles   Standards must be established to guide the quality of transactional   behaviour of intermediaries and e-commerce service providers, to protect   the name and reputation of Grenada as an international business centre.    35  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     The Standards should apply to intermediaries and e-commerce   service providers who are carrying on a trade or business or conducting   commercial transactions or services in or from within Grenada, or which   are   identified with Grenada, and whose transactions or services either   themselves take place electronically or which assist others to do so, or   which relate to business carried out electronically.      Intermediaries and e-commerce service providers shall be required to   observe Business Procedures and make every reasonable effort to   introduce and maintain systems, procedures and practices which   achieve material realization of the Standards      Minimum standards for intermediaries and e-commerce service providers   would include:     (i) Observation of Business Integrity; avoid prohibited and undesirable   activities      (ii) Knowing the Customer, and not knowingly aid or abet any undesirable  activities.      (iii) Knowing their Own Business well; informing themselves and exercising  good judgments so as not knowingly to render any service in respect of any  electronic record or information which contravenes or which ought  reasonably to be considered as likely to contravene or already to have  contravened the established laws.      (iv) Protecting Personal Data, and accordingly respect the privacy, accuracy  and security of personal information.      (v)  Avoiding Abusive Usage; (e.g. not sending  bulk unsolicited emails, or  seeking unauthorized access to other peoples’ systems or seeking to  interrupt other people’s use of electronic communications, or enabling  others to do so.   36  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha        (vi) Advertising Truthfully; and accordingly not misleading customers as to the  nature, quality or purposes of goods or services sold through the business.      (vii)  Dealing Fairly and Openly with Customers, and accordingly trading and  settling with customers in an honest transparent manner which has regard to  the reputation of Grenada as an international business centre.     (viii)  Settling Complaints and Disputes Quickly and Fairly, and accordingly   establishing convenient methods of receiving and dealing with complaints  and for the swift, convenient and fair settlement of disputes.                                                                    37  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha                FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE    The financial system is critical to the growth of the New Economy, to the   development of e-Commerce and to the introduction and expansion of   electronic methods of payments in Grenada. If the Commercial Banks,   Insurance companies and other financial institutions are reluctant to   participate in the cutting edge of e-Commerce development in Grenada   then it becomes impossible for Country to exploit these new   developments, and Grenada will be left behind in the backwaters of   under development.   Mindful of this the Government will seek to encourage the financial   institutions to play a positive, innovative and aggressive role in the   emergence of the e-economy in    Grenada.      The Government therefore proposes to embark on a positive and   supportive course of action, including the following:     We will encourage and support the establishment of an Association  of Bankers in Grenada    We will encourage and support the introduction of electronic  payment technologies for domestic and foreign purchases    We will encourage the development of electronic banking  including Internet banking    We will encourage and support the development of electronic  inter-bank transactions and settlements including \"switching\" and  common ATM's    We will encourage banks and other financial agencies to provide  special and concessionary loan packages to facilitate the  purchases of computers by householders of all income groups; and  to facilitate Grenada's Small Business sector. 38  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha       We will utilize electronic technologies to facilitate and simplify the  payments of public servants through the commercial banks    We will introduce appropriate legal reforms to encourage and  support electronic financial transitions, electronic legal  communications and electronic documentation    We will commit at least 5% of the National Budget to ICT promotion  and development    We will approach and negotiate with external agencies for funding  and technical assistance for the ICT sector    We will encourage foreign private direct investment into the local  ICT sector             DEVELOPMENT OF ICT INDUSTRY     (a)            Key Principles   - The vision of ICT is to be used as a tool to enable economic  growth and not the exclusive source of that growth.   - ICT would be the basis for new business as well as a means to increase the  efficiency and marketability of established sectors.  Concentrating on the  latter in the early stages of the exercise may yield early benefits and will be a  route to wider social identification with the policy;   - The capital requirements for implementation of ICT for economic  growth in Grenada will necessitate creative (Smart) partnerships  between government the private sector and other funding  sources including civil society. However where tax revenues are  expended for that purpose, there should be prior input/output  analysis to ensure net positive returns on the investment.   - The potential for synergy should be a guiding principle in the  identification of entrants and a strong element in promoting  Grenada.      (b) Fostering Entrepreneurship   - For ICT business to flourish it requires a suitable enabling  environment as will facilitate business development in general.   39  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     - One specific thrust should be developing business as well as ICT  competencies to world-class standards.    - Creation of a network to provide continually updated  information about the ICT sector in order to enable National and  Regional companies to update standards and reach new  markets.   - Enable the growth of local business through affirmative action  measures consistent with WTO agreements. Removal of barriers  to entrance should be considered in co-ordination with the  development of incentives.   - The Smart Partnership concept of “prosper thy neighbour” should  underpin the relationships between participants in this new  economy.   - Use ICT to create a virtual business incubator which would  handshake to venture capital, provide business advice, help  protect Intellectual Property Rights, audit technology and  access markets.     (c) Access to Capital   - Public/Private (Smart) partnerships may provide funding to  jumpstart certain ICT industries, with private sector funding as the  preferred source for capital.   - In addition to the traditional sources, innovative funding  mechanisms such as the existing ICT training loans and the use of  Mutual Fund (Unit Trust) arrangements to wider social  participation in the new economy, should be explored.      (d)  Encouraging IT investment by the Private Sector   The Government will promote IT investment in the private sector.   It will assist and facilitate those businesses that are willing to  invest in hardware, software and technical assistance targeted  at e-Commerce solutions and web-presence. The existing aids to  investment schemes will be fine-tuned to cater for this particular  type of investment.    In addition, the Government will nurture existing and new IT  businesses, whether locally or foreign owned.  A special  package of incentives will be drawn up with the specific intent  of building up this sector.      Government recognizes that market forces themselves that will  push the growth of the local IT industry as well as the widespread  uptake of eCommerce solutions by Grenada businesses.   The  role of the Government will be to ensure that any barriers and  unnecessary regulation that might inhibit such growth are 40  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     removed, and that the necessary aids to investment in this field  are readily available.       (e)  Work Space Infrastructure    The establishment of workspace for the provision of jobs has become  one of the elements of incentive to attract investors operating in a  knife-edge competitive environment.    Government will seek to promote the availability of workspace,  including factory shells and office buildings.  Private sector partners  will also be encouraged to invest in developing these facilities.  Government will consider positively a joint approach to such ventures.   The object will be to encourage the location of such facilities in areas  of relevant an advantageous infrastructure, and where there is a  catchment of trained and trainable human resource. Advantage will be  taken of the existence of available unused structures that lend  themselves to easy conversion.    Government will consider the provision of such workspace that would  allow for economies in the use of shared facilities, infrastructure, and  transmission equipment    The Grenada Industrial Development Corporation already has  active plans for  the provision of 20-30,000 square metres of workspace in a location near to  the Point Salines international Airport       Modernizing Government      Key principles  The Government of Grenada has clearly recognized that developing a K-  economy in the context of globalization requires an adaptive   government, fast on its feet to identify and exploit new opportunities.  It   also requires increased efficiencies in the provision of public services, to   yield new revenue streams within government, and thereby create space   for investment in changing priorities.   Within the current structure of   government, a number of initiatives might be considered that embody   the best of the ‘new public sector management’ techniques noticeable  41  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     in Europe and North American in the last decade or so.  The principle of   separating policy setting and evaluation, on the one hand, from service   delivery, on the other, opens the possibility of excising some public   services on a case-by-case  basis and contracting out their delivery by   quasi-independent agencies or public-private partnerships.  These models   will be actively explored.        Like other elements of this strategy, employing ICT to modernize   government must express clear utility values which would set criteria for   determining the priority for implementation;       If the aim of gearing up Grenada’s economy is to be achieved through   this strategy, virtually every investment in ICT to achieve efficiency and   transparency in public service delivery must be justified by its support to   the other objectives set out in this Strategic Plan.  Most notable amongst   these are the development of e-commerce and the provision of an   enabling environment for world-class ICT industry;      The implementation of e-Government as a major strategic thrust in the   engendering of an Information Society and an Information Economy is   vital to the overall national effort of creating the knowledge-based   economy in Grenada.     Accordingly, the implementation of a modernized e-Government   programme will be configured around the following:    - As part of the Public Sector Reform programme,   - As a means of providing improved quality service to the Public,   - In providing cost-effective solutions to several management  problems in Government  - Lowering costs   - Maximizing revenues   - Modernizing the level of efficiency in the public sector.      42  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     Government is both a user and a provider of services.  In both cases, it is a   large and dominant player in the economy. Its roles and impact will be   major determinants of the pace of ICT development in Grenada.   Government will take the lead to initiate advances in IT by increasing its e-  Government services to the population.   In doing so the Government will follow the following strategy:   - Building e-government presence (Portal and websites)  - Thinking big (Plan the full range of service and coverage)  - Starting small (start with what can be readily deliverable )  - Scaling up fast (expand the service quickly in response to   citizens' demand)       The overall goal of the Grenada's e-government strategy will be citizen-  centric, focusing on the delivery of improved levels of customer service   and enhanced citizen satisfaction. It will begin with information, and   quickly graduate to various electronic transactions to meet citizens'   demand and readiness. In addition to citizen satisfaction, e-government   will focus on efficiency factors, cost reduction and revenue generation.                INSTITUTIONAL & MANAGERIAL INFRASTRUCTURE    The Plan seeks to:    1. Propose leadership/Director for the entire process.     2. Establish a national coordinating advisory council headed by a   private sector professional and comprising of private sector, public  sector and NGO representatives.  This body will report to the Minister  of ICT.       43  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     3. Create the government entity (Central Information Management  Agency, CIMA) with the responsibility for the completion of the  development of the Plan and to take ownership for its  implementation. Amongst others, this body will serve as a  secretariat to the national coordinating body and mobilize the  national effort in the delivery of the ICT Plan     4. Appoint an executive level director/leader within the new entity   with responsibility to deliver the plan. The person should be of high  technological and managerial capability and experience.      5. Develop a Budget for the entity for the management, completion   and implementation of the strategic ICT Plan    6. Develop a strategy for mobilizing the finance required to implement   the national IT programme. The establishment of a technology  development/loan fund offers one approach.     7. Identify those aspect of the Plan that requires immediate   implementation    8. Conduct national surveys to determine the capital and intellectual   stock as it relates to ICT    9. As a matter of urgency establish an Educational Technology Task   Force to complete the development of an holistic ICT plan for  education and commence its implementation.     10. Establish Technology Evaluation And Procurement Council to   interface between government and the vendors of technology  systems in the ICT sector.                         44  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     PROMOTING UNIVERSAL UPTAKE OF THE INTERNET       A major challenge to the Government in the implementation of the   Information Society and K-economy will be the stimulation of the demand   for e-Commerce and Public e-Services.  The Government will, together   with entities in the business sector and in collaboration with the   telecommunications carriers and ISP's, and other service providers   undertake a concerted Communications Strategy targeted at the take-  up of e-Business solutions by businesses; and Internet and e-Commerce   usage by individual and corporate citizens.      Three potential initiatives will be aimed at promoting the popularization   and use of the Internet in Grenada in order to justify e-commerce and e-  Government, and to build capacity utilization at a national level.   These are:    - The dissemination of e-mail on a national scale  - The creation of a Grenada Internet Exchange   - National Free Grenada Internet     The Dissemination of e-mail on a national scale  E-mail is considered to be one of the first and fundamental e-services to   implement.       It is therefore proposed that a national e-mail system be established   allowing all citizens to be addressable and reachable in electronic format   and to be able to access and utilize an e-mail account.   In the context of e-government, the automatic addressability of all   potential users of the service would be a major benefit.       The availability of a single address which could be used for life would,   apart from promoting a strong e-government presence, and encouraging 45  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     e-commerce, would facilitate the adoption of a Certification Authority   related to the issuance of qualified certificates vis-à-vis advanced   electronic signatures required for access to e-Government services, since   each certificate issued to a citizen for the purposes of effecting secure   transactions with the e-government service must be associated with a   specific e-address.      A Common National Database would be required and each person   could be automatically allocated an e-address. The e-addresses would   be initially marked inactive, and would only become fully active upon   completion of a free voluntary registration procedure.  The registration   procedure should include an opt-in option to additionally list all registered   users in a publicly available web-based e-mail directory.   The national e-mail system should be available either free of charge or at   an low basic cost.  The access path should be Internet based, preferably   through the use of a web interface, ( although it is envisaged that other   alternatives based on a simple dial-up or other mechanisms could be   available).   It is recommended that the e-address allocated to each person would be   a permanent one.  Users should be able to easily configure their address   to redirect e-mail to any other email address of their choosing.  This would   allow every person to be contactable at a single address, even if the user   were to opt for an alternative commercial Service Provider in the future.     The creation of a Grenada National Internet Exchange   The lack of a local Grenadian Internet backbone will result in routes to   Grenadian sites having to pass over international connections.  Expensive,   over-subscribed and over-utilised bandwidth will result in poor   performance of Grenadian Sites.  Good performance is key to the rapid   46  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     uptake of a web-site.  It is estimated that if a site does not appear on   screen within 8 seconds most users will “click away”      It is therefore recommended that a local Internet backbone be   established.   An Exchange entity could operate as a Hub for all the connections or   alternatively a funded consortium could be created.  Either solution would   enable local traffic to remain within the local network and utilize cheap   high bandwidth connections.  This would prove beneficial to the uptake   of e-Government services and for local e-Business in general.     National Free Grenadian Internet  A classic chicken-and-egg scenario hinders the uptake of an Internet   economy.  A strong local presence from Grenada businesses on the   Internet will not develop until a critical mass of Internet users is established   in order to make the Internet a viable alternative distribution and   marketing channel.  On the other hand, a critical mass of users will not   develop until there is a strong enough local presence and content on the   Internet.  This would make the use of the Internet an attractive proposition   to the public, in that they would be able to access a rich array of relevant   and useful local content.      The success of e-Government and the e-Economy therefore depend on   resolving this issue: on the one hand a critical mass of users must be   established, while at the other end suitable and useful content must be   provided and published.  The development of the Government Site and   the eGovernment Services site will provide useful content.  However,   uptake may still be slow due to the current exceedingly high cost of an   Internet connection.     47  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     It is therefore recommended that a National Free Grenadian Internet   system be created to supplement the National E-mail System, and give   unrestricted Internet access to sites located in Grenada.  It is to be   clarified that any eventual implementation of a Grenada Internet Service   can only come about after the Grenada Internet Exchange would be up   and running.  Otherwise any access to Grenadian sites would only be   possible via international lines.  Apart from the slowness of the service,   another constraint would be the prohibitive cost entailed in the utilization   of international lines.  The adoption of the Grenada Internet Exchange   would surmount these hurdles, and make the implementation of a   National Free Grenada Internet System a realistic proposition.   This service could be implemented in two phases:   o Phase 1 would establish the service and provide free access to the  e-Government site.   o Phase 2 would entail introducing various Grenadian sites to the Free  Internet Service.  The service would be voluntary and subject to  prior agreement with the local ISP's.  Navigation by users in local  sites would be limited to local content and links to international sites  would be de-activated.     Actual placement of individual sites on the Free Internet Service would be   carried out on an individual ISP / site basis so as to filter out any   questionable material.  It is recommended that a Code of Conduct be   drawn up to serve as a policy for the filtered sites.   An effective Call Centre service has to be established to help new users in   the use of the system.  The call centre would operate as a help desk and   first line of support.  Easy to read leaflets and handbooks would provide   an added benefit.   The Free National Internet Service, would be a Government-led initiative   set at promoting widespread use of the Internet.  It is, however, underlined   that the Free National Internet Service, should it be taken up, would be an   48  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     initiative that is completely independent of the official e-Government   activity, and should be clearly seen to be so.        The following funding alternatives will need to be investigated to ensure   that the service is maintainable:   Government Subsidy   Sponsorship:   Advertising:   Strategic partners:   Financial contributions by ISP's:    The following access methods seem viable:   o Central dialup: A central dialup facility is the most fundamental access  service and is mandatory for easy access to all areas of users.   o Cable Modems / Set-top boxes: It is estimated that over 10,000  households have access to cable and would be capable of receiving fast  cable modem access.  Such a service would be distributed with various  endpoints.   o ASDL / Frame-relay / ISDN for businesses: Businesses may want to  benefit from the email and local Internet access facilities.  This  aspect is important for two reasons:  - Businesses are willing to invest in the technology, thus giving employees a   window to the portal.  - As more businesses go online, the critical mass of users requiring access to   businesses will grow exponentially.   49  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha         DEVELOPING ELECTRONIC COMMERCE     Constant technological innovation with respect to Internet access has   aided in the expansion of on-line trade, thus enabling larger segments of   the population to have the possibility to share in the benefits of on-line   commercial transactions and enabling companies – including small and   medium sized enterprises – to become part of the process, with an   attendant increase in competitiveness and scale.    The available indicators show that the greatest impetus to the growth and   development of electronic commerce is taking place in the business-to-  business sector (B2B).  As part of this process, and in relation to the   international marketing of goods and services, advances are being made   in at least two respects:      a) Through the adoption of electronic commerce as a tool for  enterprises to market goods and services on the international  market, by putting into service web sites/ electronic sites  designed for that purpose such as “vertical markets” or “business  community” type structures.    b) Through the development of technology platforms such as the  Internet, which make it possible to address operational aspects  of the international marketing of goods and services by digitizing  the procedures and documentation involved.    It is useful to review some of the advantages and potential benefits of the   promotion and introduction of e-commerce in the economic   environment.      THE IMPACT OF ECOMMERCE ON THE ECONOMY    e-Commerce is the driver of what is termed the New economy.  Its   exponential growth is spurring Governments to promote its utilization within   the respective national economies.  The e-Europe Draft Action Plan lists  50  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     the acceleration of e-Commerce within the European Union as a major   objective in the immediate future.     It is envisaged that the onset of e-Commerce will have significant effects   on individual businesses and will result in an aggregate impact on the   national economy and, as a result, on society.     e-Commerce is not limited the national economy.  The key feature of e-  Commerce is its ability to transcend national and geographical   boundaries. The challenge is for local businesses to retain their domestic   markets in the face of external e-Commerce competition, while at the   same time gaining a foothold internationally by marketing and selling via   e-Commerce.  The risks and opportunities to local business emanating   from new e-Commerce scenario will vary by business sector and target   market, and entrepreneurial drive.      Overall, it is reasonable to assume that unless e-Commerce solutions are   taken up by local business, the local economy will be at a disadvantage   in the face of external e-Commerce competition.  This disadvantage will   increase over time as external e-Commerce continues to increase.  The   need for Grenada businesses to maintain the pace with overseas   competition is therefore paramount.     Another important feature that characterizes e-Commerce is the gains to   be had from the streamlining of business processes for higher efficiency   and cost effectiveness.      In general, business should gain from the transition to e-Commerce via the   following positive effects:   o A general increase in productivity.  o A more streamlined interface between production and sales.  o Better stock management, potentially leading to 'just in time' stock   management. 51  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     o A significant reduction in distribution costs especially for those  products that can be digitized.   o A reduction in the costs of after-sales service.  o Enhanced advertising and selling in the global market at a lower   cost.  o An expansion of the IT sector as demand for e-Commerce solutions   increase.  o Increased turnover for the telecommunications sector as a direct   result of the proliferation of e-Commerce.  On a sectoral level the impact of e-Commerce will not be uniform.    Overall, however it is still envisaged that it is unlikely that such an impact   will be negative.  The Business Sector should therefore look to e-  Commerce as providing an opportunity to thrive rather than a threat to its   livelihood.      The following are some observations relative to the major sectors of the   Economy:      (i) Information Technology and Communication  The IT industry is a major input and a key enabler to the proliferation of e-  Commerce.  As such it is reasonable to expect this sector to expand in line   with the growth of e-Commerce.  It is acknowledged that the sale of IT   products is increasingly being carried out by electronic means that bypass   traditional intermediaries.   It is recognized that there will be the need for a   substantial amount of related services that need to be carried out on the   field.       Strategic alliances with major suppliers of e-Commerce, off-the-shelf   solutions, adding value via marketing, customization, installation, support   and maintenance of hardware and software will open opportunities for   Grenadian enterprises.  52  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     Web development and Internet Service Provision should generate   increases in activity as more businesses go on-line.      The expansion of e-Commerce is likely to be sustained as more powerful   hardware and software are continuously developed.    e-Commerce solutions will in turn generate constant demand for   improved solutions by businesses that are already utilizing e-Commerce.    Communications is another major input sector to e-Commerce.  The high   increase in demand for e-Commerce solutions are in turn becoming more   complex, and therefore require increasingly higher bandwidth. Grenada   will need to ensure that the requirements of the economy are satisfied.   New technologies and emerging technologies will open new   opportunities with far-reaching implications, as e-Commerce becomes   accessible via mobile telephony.  The same can be said of the   developments taking place in digital Television.  These technological   developments in the communications field will, in turn, fuel the demand   for e-Commerce, as it becomes increasingly accessible to the consumer.      (ii) Banking, finance and Business Services  The financial services sector is an information-intensive industry with an   established IT infrastructure.  The adoption of e-Commerce in this sector   will continue to bring about reductions in operating costs.  The local   banking system will benefit in that it will not need to expand its existing   front-office outlets in order to expand business.  The Banks are already   somewhat proactive on this front, and the provision of ATM services and   telebanking have already eased the pressure on the traditional Branch   front-offices.  Increased utilization of e-Banking services by clients and bill   payments over the Internet, will result in further cost savings to the Banks.    Competition will be required to drive the banks to pass on a portion of   these savings to consumers in the form of reduced charges.     53  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     It is also likely that Banks will be able to develop the provision of new   services for their customer base.   The business services sector includes professional services such as   architectural services, consulting engineering services, computer services,   legal and accounting services and marketing and business management   services.  These services are characterized by high information content   that can be digitized with relative ease, and therefore lend themselves   well to the e-Commerce environment.  Internal cost savings via   streamlining of work processes, as well as savings in cost and time in   delivering products to clients, are the main features that render e-  Commerce a viable proposition in this sector.    From an external perspective, the use of e-Commerce in business services   is an increasingly global phenomenon.  The adoption of e-Commerce in   this sector is therefore necessary both in order to maintain a competitive   edge, as well as to be able to gain or increase access to overseas   markets.     Other professional services such as Real Estate and Employment Services   also stand to gain from cost savings by bringing buyers and sellers to   interact electronically in the pre-negotiation stages.  The audio-visual   features that the Internet now offers, make such interaction an   additionally feasible and attractive proposition.  These can facilitate   business by offering such features as virtual tours of real estate for sale, or   brief video clips of job-types that are on offer.     (iii) Manufacturing   In general the e-Commerce offers an excellent opportunity for   manufacturing concerns to market and sell their products on the   international markets. Manufacturers could possibly reap advantages via   the reduction of processing costs, mainly by way of reduction of inventory   levels and the speeding up of ordering, delivery and payment processes.    54  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     Further cost savings may be obtained in certain instances from the   shortening of the distribution chain, that is by dealing with consumers   directly, thereby removing one or more layers of intermediaries.  The   potential advantages, however, would have to be weighed against   potential increases in distribution costs and after-sales servicing, which   may in certain cases render direct selling unprofitable.                    (iv) Tourism and related Services  The benefits to the tourism sector will stem from the global exposure that   on-line marketing and on-line-booking facilitates.  This applies to the   hospitality industry as well as ancillary services such as car-hire and   excursions.    It is nevertheless acknowledged that the success of the local tourist sector   to market and sell on-line will depend on a concerted drive to sell   Grenada as a tourist destination.       (v) Retail  In general e Commerce may be seen as a direct competitor with the   traditional retail sector.  This is more so, however, in areas where products   may be digitized and delivered on-line, such as in the case of software or   CD's.  Direct on-line shopping is likely to reinforce catalogue buying to the   detriment of local retailers.  It is nevertheless probable that there will still be   a preference on the part of the consumer for direct contact with the   retailer.  However, local retailers can and should avail themselves of the   facility of on-line marketing and selling to local consumers.      55  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     The retail sector should look to e-Commerce as a challenge rather than a   threat.            THE IMPACT OF ECOMMERCE ON SOCIETY    The following are some observations relative to the impact of e-  Commerce on Society:      (i) Employment  It is reasonable to assume that there will be significant shifts in the skills   required in this new environment.  It is evident that the need for IT and   Information management skills will increase in line with the trend currently   prevailing in the leading World economies.  The recent e-Europe Draft   Action plan quotes a current shortfall of 700,000 IT specialists, which is   expected to rise to 1.3million by 2003.    Grenada's shortage has not been as overt, partly because the intensity of   ICT is being stifled by a number of structural factors. The initiatives of the   Government in liberalizing the sector will release market forces that will   create pressures for greater supply of skills.      Labour requirements in other sectors such as the intermediary sector may   decline, but may in turn be offset by increased demand for labour in   other sectors, which experience increased demand for their goods and   services generated by e-Commerce.  It is not possible to predict the net   effect beyond stating that the demand for IT skills will experience a   substantial increase which may, for a time, be beyond the capability of   the educational system to meet in adequate numbers.  It is worthwhile to   56  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     add that the onset of e-Commerce is generally considered as an   opportunity rather than a threat to job creation.      “Tele-working” is another area for potential job-creation in of the   knowledge-based economy, bringing back into the market the less   advantaged groups such as women, older workers and persons with   special needs.  The proliferation of e-Commerce will render Tele-working a   more viable and attractive prospect than it has been to date.                (ii) The advantages to the Consumer   The consumer is seen to benefit in the new scenario.  E-Commerce will   bring about greater choice and price reductions due to increased   competition and improved production and distribution processes.  It   should also result in a better quality of life by freeing up quality time that   would otherwise be spent traveling and queuing up to obtain a service   across the counter.  Procurement of public and private sector goods can   be made from the comfort of the home potentially on a 24-hour, seven-  days-a-week (24x7) basis.        The opening up of access to a host of goods is not to be viewed from the   narrower viewpoint of tangible goods.  The cultural and educational   content that will be available on the Internet is another precious resource   that will raise the level of knowledge of users.  Distance learning has been   a feature of education provision for some time but can now be supplied   at a much higher quality.  Interactivity will also be a very important   feature of distance learning in an Internet environment.  57  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha            DEVELOPING THE ELECTRONIC COMMERCE SECTOR    The Internet and electronic commerce represent significant social and   economic potential for countries of CARICOM and Western Hemisphere.    Dynamic national strategies to develop infrastructure, to enhance access,   to increase participation in the Internet economy especially for SMEs, and   to create the legal foundations for online payments, electronic signatures   and certification are critical for the development of e-commerce.  At the   same time, since e-commerce is inherently borderless and global in   scope, measures to enable and promote domestic growth must also be   contemplated to allow the effective conduct of e-commerce between   countries       Government of Grenada has important roles to play with respect to these   issues, within the country, within CARICOM, the Americas and globally,   which entails cooperation, information dissemination and promotion   activities.       Government will focus on those critical requirements that will facilitate the   development of e-Commerce in Grenada, including access and   Infrastructure, Small and Medium Sized enterprises as major beneficiaries   of the technologies, Online Payment Systems, Certification and   Authentication, Consumer Protection, Intellectual Property Protection,   and Online Distribution of content.         58  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     A.  ACCESS AND INFRASTRUCTURE  While the number of Internet users in the Grenada is growing rapidly, there   are still significant segments of the population that do not have ready   access to the Internet. The challenge for the government is to encourage   the development of a vibrant, high-quality, low-cost telecommunications   infrastructure which all citizens have the opportunity to access.      Grenada already recognizes the importance of expanding access to the   Internet for purposes of economic growth and development. Steps have   already been taken to progressively liberalize the telecommunications   market; particularly the local telephone service. Government has   encouraged and facilitated investment in the development of   telecommunications infrastructure, higher penetration and lower prices for   consumers and businesses.       There is still need to    -   Acc  elerate the granting of new licenses for additional telecommunication   and Internet service providers   -   Stim  ulate Internet usage; encourage local content development, and e-  commerce - which in turn should stimulate further investment in the e-  commerce infrastructure;       -     Red  uce the cost of leased lines used to connect to the Internet backbone by   59  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     allowing competition, and/or by regulating prices set by the dominant   operator.       -    Mak  e it cheaper to get and stay on-line, especially through lower per-minute   cost or flat rate prices for local service. This would significantly increase   both the number of individuals on-line and the time each user spends on-  line;      In addition to physical networks, the widespread growth of electronic   commerce as a means of doing business depends a wide array of factors   (i.e. the e-Commerce value- chain) including the existence and   accessibility of a range of goods, services and procedures, such as   telecommunications services, electronic payment systems, transportation   and distribution systems, as well as legal or regulatory factors such as the   enforceability of electronic contracts and efficient customs clearance   procedures.       Access also relies on the existence of adequate levels of digital literacy   since the knowledge, skills and familiarity of citizens with computer   technologies will determine their ability to take advantage of electronic   commerce.  Measures to expand digital literacy throughout the   population will not only increase the overall growth of e-commerce but   also tend to assure a more even distribution of its benefits within society.   The government of Grenada therefore places high priority on computer   awareness, education and training as a means of promoting access to   the networks and technologies related to e-commerce.        60  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     Government will therefore pursue the following to facilitate the   development of e-Commerce:     1. Promote vibrant and fair competition:  1.1. Among different levels of telecommunications services (that  could be suppliers of telecommunications and computing hardware,  telecommunications carriers, telecommunications resellers, and  associated services suppliers such as e-commerce services suppliers).   1.2. Among telecommunications services provided through all types  of technological means (including wireline, wireless, cable, and  satellite technologies).  1.3. In the allocation of fundamental resources such as spectrum and  rights-of-way.  1.4. Through oversight by National Telecommunications Regulatory  Commission to ensure that no anti-competitive conditions arise.       2.  Maintain an independent, effective, fair and transparent oversight  body.      The National Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (NTRC) and   Eastern Caribbean Telecommunication Authority (ECTEL) are critical in   setting the tone for the telecommunications market, and will be key in   providing regulatory certainty, ensuring non-discriminatory treatment of   market participants (both domestic and foreign), and in preventing anti-  competitive behavior.  This healthy environment will provide the certainty   requisite in attracting large investments required for infrastructure   development and service provision.      3. Allow the marketplace to decide how to expand the availability of  data-capable infrastructure (wire line, wireless, cable, satellite, etc.) able  to support electronic commerce applications.  As technological  platforms converge to a similar set of capabilities, the Government of  Grenada would promote competition across communications platforms  through technology-neutral regulations.      4. The Government of Grenada will allow the free development of  Internet services to continue by avoiding the imposition of regulations  that might impede its development.      61  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     5. Government will support regulatory regimes that permit a broad range  of pricing strategies (including un-metered rates, for services used to  access the Internet and adopt cost-based approaches to  interconnection pricing).     6. Ensure that all information service providers have access to facilities,  networks, and network services, (including access to local loop) on a  nondiscriminatory and cost-based basis.      7. Take steps to facilitate efficient testing and certification procedures for  IT products.      8. Seek to provide access and affordable service to all members of  society:     8.1. Administer Universal Service programs for basic telephone service in  a transparent, nondiscriminatory, and competitively neutral manner, so  as to be no more burdensome than necessary.      8.2. Place governmental information and services online, in order to  provide them more efficiently and effectively, and to increase the  uptake of information technologies by business and citizens.   8.3. Maximize efforts to bring voice and data services to under-served  populations, by coordinating efforts from all social sectors involved.     9. Take steps to improve e-commerce fulfillment, including  implementation of the business facilitation measures for express  shipments (agreed to at the Toronto Ministerial).      10. Develop a clear, predictable, nondiscriminatory, stable yet flexible  legal and regulatory framework, which is conducive to the expansion of  access to information and telecommunication technologies.     11. With the support and collaboration of the public and private sector,  place a high priority on computer awareness, education, and training as  a means of promoting access to the networks and technologies related  to e-commerce           B. SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED ENTERPRISES  Small and medium sized enterprises are an important and dominant part   of the national economy, and Grenada can greatly benefit from the  62  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     creativity and entrepreneurship that can come from small businesses.   Attractive potential opportunities exist for SMEs in the exploitation of   electronic commerce. Both research studies and business experience in   other countries indicate that the adoption of electronic commerce will   enable SMEs to continue to lead in the development of jobs and growth,   and to create new forms of commerce and to improve the standard of   living in individual jurisdictions. In many ways, SMEs are in a strong position   to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the Internet and e-  commerce. They tend to be more flexible, adaptable and quick to   respond to new technologies and market opportunities as they lack the   management layers and bureaucracies that encumber decision-making.   Many SMEs recognize the Internet as a valuable means to promote their   product, establish a corporate presence on the Web and provide   customer service.       But, although the Internet can vastly expand the potential market   available to SMEs in Grenada, the challenges of electronic commerce   are more acute for SMEs than for larger business enterprises. SMEs' limited   resources make them more vulnerable to fraud and failure, and often   more reluctant to take on the risks associated with new ventures such as   e-commerce. Another challenge facing SMEs' participation in e-  commerce is the shortage of trained technical workers who can   effectively manage the changing technology and fully tap opportunities   to increase efficiency, lower supply costs, and reach new markets. SMEs   may be less able to devote resources to attracting and retaining   technically qualified workers.       Both the private sector and the government, jointly and separately, can   assist with policies and programs to help solve the problems of SMEs.   63  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha       The Government of Grenada will therefore:      1. Encourage SMEs to familiarize themselves with available electronic   commerce tools, by undertaking activities to disseminate  information on options, opportunities and challenges and to  promote the use of electronic commerce and telecommunication  technologies, in order to improve participation in international  markets.       2. Continue to cooperate with and encourage the private sector to   offer educational opportunities (including via the Internet) and to  disseminate information on the advantages and benefits of using  new technologies to conduct commercial transactions and to  improve overall efficiency and productivity by integrating  electronic commerce into business operations.      3.  Support cooperation and promote efforts by local business   organizations and small and medium sized enterprises to develop  Websites where SMEs can network, post information, and exchange  ideas about best practices and lessons learned, in order to facilitate  investment, job creation, increased competitiveness, and the use of  more advanced technologies.      4. Support the search for solutions to the obstacles faced by SMEs in   fully utilizing electronic commerce, encouraging companies that  provide electronic commerce business services to develop  products tailored to the needs of SMEs and to cooperate with these  companies to develop and promote SME export portals, affordable  and secure payment systems, SME training programs, and regional  technical centers.      5. Continue national efforts to make government products and   services available via the Internet, helping SMEs to build their  Internet skills.            C. ONLINE PAYMENT SYSTEMS   The availability of effective electronic payment systems is a significant   element of electronic commerce, enabling wholesale and retail   businesses to move their business-to-business (B2B) and business-to- 64  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     consumer (B2C) marketing and sales onto the web with minimal concerns   about completing the financial portion of the transaction. However, the   on-line environment presents challenges related to fraud, security risks,   consumer protection and privacy protection that should be adequately   addressed. In addition, the cross-border supply of payment services raises   issues about the standards and roles applicable to domestic payment   systems and their interoperability with foreign systems, and about the level   of consumer protection available for consumers who make use of foreign   payment systems.       Grenada (and the CARICOM Region) could benefit from participation in   the burgeoning electronic payments markets associated with e-  commerce. Today, payment systems based on credit cards are widely   perceived to be inadequate, as credit cards are unavailable for many   potential e-commerce consumers in Grenada and relatively expensive for   small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including retailers. Many have   identified these issues as contributing to the relatively slow entrance by   existing bricks-and-mortar retailers into e-commerce and to the relatively   low levels of consumer purchases on the Internet.       New technologies for payment are underway in the region that should   help address these problems for both business and consumers. For B2C e-  commerce, and some SME applications, banks and other e-commerce   companies should explore new approaches to supplement traditional   methods. These options could include e-commerce charges and   payments incorporated into existing utility bills; taking advantage of   existing credit relationships, use of debit cards, new payment technologies   such as bar code scanning, smart cards, electronic wallets and cellular   telephones; prepaid cards with small amounts of purchasing power for   65  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     citizens who lack access to traditional credit.  But there is more work to be   done.        The continued growth in electronic commerce depends significantly upon   the development of an efficient and secure cross-border financial   services infrastructure. CARICOM Governments, the financial sector and   retailers need to look at payment systems that can be used to support e-  commerce in the Region if they are to accelerate the growth of e-  commerce and broaden its benefits for the Region's citizens.       The relationships between financial institutions and their online business   customers will become increasingly complex and interdependent. The   ability of financial institutions to meet their customers' transactional needs   (investment, cash management and foreign exchange needs) as part of   online payment support services will be critical to the customer's ability to   compete in global e-commerce.  Local financial institutions must   therefore act with cautious haste if they are not to impede the country's   prospects for taking commercial advantage of these new opportunities.        The international private sector is responding quickly to develop   electronic payment solutions to enable e-commerce.  Our local private   sector must move with innovative speed to secure a share of the benefits   of e-commerce before it is too late. The Government will encourage and   support the introduction of effective and secure payment systems. The   Government of Grenada also recognizes the advantages of a Regional   approach to this matter of payments and will also encourage its   development.   66  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     Further, Grenada adopts and incorporates the Regional position   accepted in the context of the FTAA. Accordingly, Grenada undertakes   and will agree with Regional Governments to:       1. Work cooperatively with Regional Governments, and with the   private sector, as electronic payment systems develop, in order to  keep apprised of policy implications and to ensure that  governmental activities flexibly accommodate the needs of the  emerging marketplace.      2. Build on the existing work of governments, the private sector, and   international organizations to improve information sharing and  cooperation in combating security threats to payments systems,  cross-border fraud, illicit financial transactions, and threats to the  integrity of the Internet.       3. Examine, with the private sector, online payment systems, with a   view to removing possible obstacles to the deployment of  alternative online payment methods, thereby accelerating  participation in B2B e-commerce, especially by SMEs, and fostering  efforts to provide greater access to innovative technologies for  Internet purchases by consumers and SMEs without traditional  access to credit.       4. Develop policies in conjunction with the private sector that foster   flexible, innovative approaches in the development of alternative  payment mechanisms.  Efforts should be directed at improving the  efficiency and lowering the costs while ensuring the security of  cross-border payments systems.      5. Cooperate with the private sector, including the Chambers of   Industry and Commerce, banking and retail sectors, and NGO's to  educate SMEs and retailers about effective e-commerce models in  the region and payment technology systems.       6. Stimulate efforts by the financial and retail sectors to develop and   to identify websites utilizing secure payment technologies and  practices and respecting consumer privacy, and cooperate with  the private sector to educate consumers and business and provide  them with the information they need to decide whether and how to  participate confidently in e-commerce.      67  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     7. Encourage banks, payment card companies and retailers to work  to achieve an appropriate sharing of risk and costs among  themselves to promote broader participation in e-commerce by  retailers, SMEs, and financial institutions, while protecting consumers  from unreasonable liability for fraudulent and unauthorized  electronic payment transactions.      8. Support policies and procedures designed to promote   transparency in the regulation of payments systems, including  standard-setting, the application process, and judicial, arbitral,  and/or administrative review.          D. CERTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION    Authentication technologies help identify  parties to electronic business   transactions, and provide means by which they can reliably sign   documents, assent to transactions, and verify documents' integrity. As   such, they play an important role in building user confidence in e-  commerce.       But technology is not sufficient in and of itself. The development of   electronic commerce requires legal recognition, functional equivalence   and non-discrimination as regards electronic signatures, as well as   technological neutrality in order to avoid locking consumers and   businesses into one technology that may not suit their needs and erecting   artificial barriers to the development of new technologies.        Internationally, companies are increasingly employing authentication   methods in electronic markets through closed systems. A closed system is   established by a voluntary agreement under private law in which   participants specify in advance how they will conduct business, including   what method of logging on to the system and signing they will use.   68  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     Through closed systems, participants may access information, utilize   services, and engage in transactions. Many closed systems employ   electronic agents, computer programs that initiate or respond to   messages on behalf of an entity or individual without contemporaneous   human participation.       In closed systems, mutual trust has already been established between the   parties through their agreement. Thus, these agreements can be relied   upon to govern the system, provided that the legal rules for e-commerce   recognize and enforce private law agreements with respect to   authentication methods and other operational aspects of closed systems,   including the use of electronic agents. Closed systems constitute the   backbone of B2B e-commerce.       The Government of Grenada accepts that competition and non-  discrimination are important principles in the provision of certification   services.  Various national approaches to the establishment and   governance of certification authorities and their activities can co-exist.   These approaches may include varying elements of industry self-  regulation and/or governmental regulation.                            As part of its policy to encourage e-commerce, the government of  Grenada will:   69  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha        1. Take steps to identify and remove legal barriers that hinder the   recognition of electronic transactions, including recognizing the  legal validity of electronic signatures and documents, (taking into  consideration the enabling provisions of the 1996 UNCITRAL Model  Law on Electronic Commerce).      2. Make efforts to ensure that its electronic signature legislation is   technology-neutral .      3. Ensure the legal validity of electronic records and evidence for use  in court and other official proceedings, independently of the  authentication and certification technology used.      4. Afford parties to a B2B transaction the freedom to determine by   private law agreement the appropriate technological and business  methods of authentication and give the parties’ agreement legal  effect, including possible means for resolving disputes, without  prejudice to applicable public policies.      5. Recognize the importance that the private sector must play in the   development and deployment of authentication and certification  technologies, and promote the participation of all relevant social  sectors in the process of formulation of policies and laws in this area.       6. Make efforts to ensure that laws and regulations do not discriminate   against electronic authentication methods, or against national or  foreign providers of authentication services, and do not erect  barriers to the provision of authentication services by any of them.       7. Work with the private sector to encourage the development and   deployment of authentication systems that provide adequate  protection against fraud and identity theft, are consistent with  respecting individuals' personal privacy, and do not impede use by  creating barriers.           E. CONSUMER PROTECTION    Increasing competition in the global electronic marketplace offers   consumers new and substantial benefits, including convenience, access   70  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     to a wider range of goods and services and the ability to gather and   compare information online, resulting in the possibility of obtaining   reduced transaction costs, and better prices, quality and service. These   benefits cannot be fully realized, however, without consumer confidence   in domestic and international e-commerce. The key elements for building   consumer confidence in electronic commerce include: protection from   fraud and from misleading and unfair conduct and commercial   practices; respect for consumer privacy; private sector initiatives; global   cooperation; consumer and business education, and effective means of   dispute resolution.       Consumer protection agencies around the world have begun to address   the increased need to cooperate in efforts to combat fraudulent,   deceptive, and unfair practices on-line.  This cooperation has included   the sharing of information and experiences, joint action, and   coordination.  Furthermore, efforts are underway in international fora, such   as OECD, APEC, the International Chamber of Commerce, the Hague   Conference on Private International Law and the Global Business   Dialogue on Electronic Commerce (GBDe) to develop cooperative   arrangements and means to protect consumers in the context of cross-  border e-commerce.  These efforts include private sector   recommendations, international guidelines, and public workshops.       F. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION  The ability to perfectly copy electronic data, to distribute it instantly on a   global basis, and the growth of e-commerce raise a number of key issues   for holders of intellectual property and governments related to the   adequate and effective protection of copyrighted works online.  Authors,   producers of copyrighted works, and performing artists must be able to  71  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     have confidence that their copyrighted works will be protected online.    Legal protection of intellectual property in the online environment   preserves incentives for the creation of local content and encourages its   world-wide dissemination. Consumers also must have confidence that   they can rely on trademarks as trusted indicators of the origin and quality   of their on-line purchases.          G. ONLINE DISTRIBUTION OF CONTENT  The countries of the Hemisphere are among the most active in the world   in terms of generating “content” suitable for online distribution.  Every day   sees a growth in the global reserve of music, film and audiovisual fixations,   computer software, training programs, literature, journalism, etc., through   contributions resulting from the creative ingenuity and entrepreneurial   capacity of the Americas.  Ensuring the online distribution of content is an   important factor in increasing economic output from electronic   commerce, and should be a priority for the governments of CARICOM    and the FTAA countries.       Currently, the distribution of content through placement on Web sites and   subsequent downloading, or through forms of distribution from a single   source to multiple users, such as simulcasting, is one of the most active   forms of electronic commerce.  However, producers of content who work   in the countries of the Hemisphere are suffering important economic   losses due to the unauthorized distribution and/or use of content by third   parties. Grenada is mindful of this and will work at the regional level for a   cooperative solution to this problem.           72  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha                                DEVELOPING e‐GOVERNMENT IN GRENADA       PRINCIPLES OF THE PROPOSED EGOVERNMENT  STRATEGY     The key principles governing the provision of e-Government from the   perspective of both a user and a service provider include the following   commitments:   o e-Government Services should be easy to access in terms of speed,  entry points, and multi-channel access.   o There has to be full social inclusion and  universality of access to e- Government Services, which necessitates ensuring that those  persons with special needs or who have affordability or literacy  problems are able to access such services with relative ease.     o Universality of access shall be ensured by the delivery of e- Government services across multiple channels, which shall not be at  the exclusion of conventional channels.   o e-Government services shall be easy to use.  o The service has to be inexpensive in relation to average disposable   incomes and therefore be widely affordable.  o Security in terms of authentication, fraud prevention and prevention   of unauthorized hacking shall be guaranteed.   73  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     o The government will ensure the legal framework and government  policy protect the individual privacy of users and provides security  of information and infrastructure.   o Any profiling data submitted by users voluntarily, in order to obtain  better services from the Government, shall not be used without their  prior consent.   o e-Government services shall provide a one-stop-shop to the user.  o Services shall be focused towards customer needs and not   Government requirements.  o Users will be able to access the services at all times and on all days   (24x7 access).  o Assistance to users of the services will be available at all times.  o e-Government services provided will be faster, more efficient and   effective and of a higher quality than conventional services.   Parameters relative to service quality in respect of each service shall  be established and made public.   o e-Government services shall be more economic and cost-effective  than conventional services, thereby ensuring more efficient use of  taxpayers' money.   o e-Government services shall be consistent in terms of content and  quality, across different delivery channels.   o e-Government services shall be regulated and facilitated by the  appropriate legislative framework.   o Mechanisms for feedback and redress shall be available to all users  in respect of all services.     o Feedback mechanisms shall be used for the engendering of  electronic democracy.   o The architecture and technology that will be adopted for the  implementation of e-services will be scalable and common across  delivery channels wherever possible.  It will also entail minimal  disruption to back-office processes.   o Back-office information systems shall be designed with a view to the  provision of electronic services to the public.   o e-Services shall pass through one central point or Portal.  This shall  be the Grenada Government Portal.   o All services and information residing on the Government Portal shall  have an owner that shall be responsible for maintaining the   74  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     currency as well as quality and other standards of the area for  which it is responsible.   o All services shall be available at all times without fail.  Electronic  communication shall be speedy and efficient.   • There shall be one distinct corporate image of Government as the  provider of e-services.        INFRASTRUCTURE  FOR ElectRonic GOVERNMENT    The roll-out of information technology within Government requires an   information technology framework which is forward looking, consistent   and inter-operable.  This framework must be based primarily on two major   principles:      o Information is a shared resource and will, with exceptions necessary   to protect individual privacy or legislatively entrenched  confidentiality, be made available to all systems with consistency  throughout the Public Service - available when necessary, where  necessary and in the form necessary.      o Information systems will be designed or acquired on the basis of a  shared infrastructure which will continue to be designed to be  stable, requiring only changes which are necessary for the  extension of the network’s capability.     The above-mentioned principles are critical for the attainment of e-  Government. They promote widespread, albeit controlled, access to and   sharing of information, which may be stored within respective ministries   and departments.  They also advocate the sharing of the same   infrastructure with all that this implies in terms of economies of scale, the   flexibility of the infrastructure and the inter-operability of systems that   reside on it.  The infrastructure should grow and be scalable enough to   accommodate new technologies as appropriate, without the need to be   replaced as a complete entity.     75  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     The opportunities that a Grenada Government Network can provide   should be exploited to their optimal possibility in order to ensure the   maximum return on the investment made.  The attainment of e-  Government is one notable way of achieving such a return on investment.   Government entities outside of the Public Service, private organizations,   third parties and the public in general should have all the facilities to be   able to plug into and use the e-Government Services that will reside on   the Grenada Government Network.       Controlled development of the Grenada Government Network via the   creation of secure, sectoral networks for the enablement of e-  Government must therefore be actively pursued.  Furthermore,   opportunities that the Internet provides should also be exploited in order   to provide the client with a personalized e-service.       To this end, appropriate gateways, interfaces and new services should be   designed, developed and installed on the Grenada Government Network   in order to facilitate information sharing principles among all parties   involved.     Thus, the Internet Architecture must have 100% resiliency and fast,   dependable performance and sufficient bandwidth and speed.      In order to facilitate the capability of the Grenada Government Network,   the adoption of advanced telecommunications networking technologies,   such as ADSL, and cable modem, data services should be actively   pursued by respective service providers.  These measures will make for   service provision that is more efficient and effective than is currently the   case.        76  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     OTHER PUBLIC SERVICE‐WIDE INITIATIVES  Other Service-wide initiatives for the proliferation of e-Government will   centre mainly on:    - the dissemination and upgrading of e-mail; and  - the training of all staff in digital literacy.      Dissemination of e-mail    The widespread dissemination of e-mail facilities in the Public Service is an   important goal to be reached as soon as possible for effective   communications both internally as well as with the external environment.   Implementation of an e-mail system within the Public Service offers a very   positive prospect for efficiency improvement. This should be initiated early.    The ultimate target should be that of having e-mail on the desks of all   knowledge workers in the Public Service (by 2002).     Impediments in the way of widespread use of e-mail should be removed.       Widespread training in e-literacy and e-competence   The Government should in the first instance set itself the target of training   its own staff in basic PC skills, in general competence and Internet usage.    Some training has been taking place  in the Public service but this has   been limited and restricted.  The e-literacy programme has to be   deepened and widened to embrace all categories of workers.   With respect to new entrants, all candidates for the clerical and executive   grades of the Public Service should be required to have an established   level of Computer competence to be eligible for entry.  The establishment   of the required entry-standard should be speedily developed.     1.Developing Databases throughout the Public Service  2.Digitizing Public sector Information                3.Training in Data management] 77  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     4.Training in customer service delivery]  5.CHANGING THE NATURE OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE: ]  6. New phase of Public Sector Reform ]         SPILLOVER EFFECTS OF EGOVERNMENT ON THE   INFORMATION ECONOMY     There are three particular aspects of e-Government that will have a   multiplier effect on a national scale.  These are:    1. The widespread adoption of e-Commerce solutions in such  activities as procurement is widely recognized as being a major lever in  firing up the widespread adoption of eCommerce in business.  Firms that  do business with the Government will be encouraged to utilize the Internet  in their transactions.  It is reasonable to expect that once the process is set  in motion, businesses will be alert to recognize the benefits of participating  and the disadvantages of sticking to conventional methods of doing  business.  With the Government being a major player in the national  economy, the overall multiplier effect should make a significant impact  on the proliferation of eCommerce.    2. The presence of Government Services on-line will provide precious  local content that will fuel consumer demand for Internet usage.  This will  help create the necessary critical mass of users, which will make the  utilization of e-Commerce solutions an attractive proposal to an ever- increasing number of businesses.  On the supply side, this upward spiral will  in turn generate activity and value added in the IT, ISP and the  telecommunications sectors.    It is universally acknowledged that rich local content is a major driver of  consumer demand.  The presence of on-line Government transactional  services and information will certainly make a significant contribution to  enriching local content.    3. The government will adopt the use of digital signatures and will put  in place the supporting legal and regulatory framework to adequately  authenticate the identity of the user and the integrity of the transaction.   The issue of security is critical and a major stumbling block to the fast  dissemination of e-Commerce world-wide.  Winning over public trust in  effecting transactions electronically will be another key ingredient in the  proliferation of on-line service provision and usage and the utilization of  the Internet in general.    78  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha                                     THE SETTING UP OF A PORTAL       Portal Definition  All e-Government services will pass through one Portal.  A portal is the   interface that brings together the user with Government information and   services.     It is proposed that the Portal Architecture be composed of three tiers,   comprising:    The Front-end or Clients' interface  Middle tier  Back end or Back-Office      The Front-end will be the Internet-based access channel to the Portal.  The   Front-end will provide the connectivity and access for customers to   common Government information and services.     Other access channels, which will not necessarily be Internet based, will   also be available and the Portal will be flexible enough as to interface   with these channels. The architecture will provide the ability to add new   79  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     access channels without technological constraint or implications on the   service delivery architecture.   The Grenada Government Web-site will host all Ministry web-sites as well   as the e-Government Services site and will reside on the Front-end of the   Portal Architecture.        The Middle tier contains the Transaction Management System which   houses the middleware and provides the common infrastructure to   support the transportation of messages and to obtain the appropriate   level of authentication and access the services or information.  Common   information-based services are also housed within the Transaction   Management System including, for example, common search facilities to   provide information across the range of services contained within the   Portal service set.  Data protection auditing will also be provided in the   Middle Tier to ensure that information relating to specific services is only   sent to the appropriate Department to safeguard the rights of the   individual.        The Back End will provide the connectivity from the departmental systems,   including legacy systems, to the Transaction Management System through   appropriate interface systems.         Portal Characteristics  There will be one Government Portal to which access can be gained via   multiple channels.  .    The e-Government service provisions through the Portal will be   characterised by:   o Access from a wide range of locations, including the home and  workplace, using a range of different access methods.   80  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     o Provision of all interactions with the client, including client  expectation management and client help interactions.   o 24 hour 7 days a week service.     o Seamless one-stop shopping for a range of Government services   from multiple Government Departments.  The front end of the portal  will be responsible for providing the client side experience.   o Service delivery on the basis of logical service clusters as perceived  by the client.  Back-end systems pertaining to different Departments  will be virtually integrated by the Portal and will not be visible to the  client.   o Fast electronic interchange of information.  o Increased efficiency through electronic delivery and authorization.  o A message passing regime capable of giving different grades of   service for traffic with varying priorities.  This will be implemented  between the e-Government service portal and the back-end  systems.   o High levels of privacy and security.  Data protection principles will  be rigorously applied and critical personal information will be  hidden from back-end systems in agencies where there is no good  reason to pass on this data.   o Time-boxed delivery guarantees.  o Positive notification of progress.  o Ease of use characteristics.            Portal Architecture    The Portal architecture must be:  o Able to cope with a variety of channels.  o Capable of providing access to all Government Back-end services   from all delivery channels.  o Structured to accommodate different Back Office requirements.  o Based on proven, widely available and used technology.  o Scalable to accommodate growing and changing usage   requirements with cheap incremental increases in size.  81  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     o Structured to integrate new delivery channels.  o Equipped to handle digital authorization.  o Capable of handling unpredictable volumes of traffic.    The Architecture should be able to support the following types of  interaction:  o Citizen-to-Government, for which the main paradigm should be   HTML and forms.  These will be converted by the e-public service  portal to XML and XSL - based interactions for e-filing, e-lookup,  expectation management, etc.   o Business-to-government, for which the main paradigm should be  XML and XSL data packages and file transfer protocols.   o Government-to-business, (e.g. the e-procurement activities of  government agencies) for which the main paradigm should be XML  and XSL data packages and file transfer protocols.     The Portal must also support Government's policies for social inclusion. A   range of channels will be provided which will collectively appeal to all   sectors of the user community.  A common access technology must be   provided within the Portal that will provide the flexibility to add channels   freely as and when required without impedance from technological   constraints.  Therefore the portal technology must provide a low cost,   easy to implement interface that supports multiple channels.  Internet   technology provides the solution here.      Potential portal delivery channels can be categorized as:  o Direct electronic channels, for example Internet access through a   customer's PC, interactive television and kiosk.  o Voice telephony channels where the customer contacts a Call   Centre agent/officer by telephone who is able to communicate  with the Portal using a direct electronic channel.   o Face-to-Face channels where the customer interacts directly with  an agent/officer who is able to communicate with the Portal using  a direct electronic channel.   o Mobile telephony and other third generation technology.       82  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     Correctly managed, the Architecture should provide:  • The ability to integrate new delivery channels.  • The means to add new services through the existing delivery   channels without major changes to the existing service set of the  Back Office legacy systems.   • Scalability beyond the capabilities of traditional two tier  architectures.       Portal Functions  The envisaged setting-up phase of the Portal architecture will entail the   identification of specific roles and activities to be carried out by different   organizations.  A Central Information Management Agency  (CIMA) will   be responsible for the management of those activities that are farmed   out.       Three major functions have to be carried out, in terms of designing the   Architecture and setting up the related infrastructure:   o Assuming overall responsibility for Architecture design and  standards.   o Drawing up of Architecture Design and standards .  o Setting up of the infrastructure relative to the three-tier Architecture.     When the architecture becomes operational there will be allocation of   distinct roles and responsibilities in respect of the various aspects of its   ongoing operations.  The nature of responsibilities and expected   outcomes will be specified in service-level agreements or contracts.  The   CIMA will retain overall responsibility for the running of the infrastructure on   behalf of the Government, and will generate formal agreements with   those entities, whether Government or the private sector, in respect of the   running of their particular part of the operations.      83  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     The following is a brief listing of the major functions to be carried out in   terms operating the various components of the Portal:   o Management and maintenance of the Portal   o Hosting and management of the official Web site that will reside on   the Portal front-end.   o Management of middle-tier and rear-end connectivity components   of architecture.  o Hosting and maintenance of middleware.         Portal Security    The issue of secure on-line transactions is perhaps the most sensitive   aspect of e-Government, and the major factor that can make or break   the eventual widespread use by the public of on-line Government   services.       One key aspect of the Portal architecture therefore is the design of the   security infrastructure that is integral in maintaining trust and confidence in   e-Government.  It is therefore proposed that the security features to be   adopted will be based on electronic signature technologies (Public Key   Infrastructure (PKI)) residing in the middle tier of the architecture.     The following are key features that the security aspect of the Portal   architecture should address:   o Secure authentication and data encryption processes and prevention  from unauthorized use.   o A multi-step authorization process using private data stored in a PKI- secured personal vault on the e-Government Portal to achieve equivalent  levels of information entropy to that provided by the private key used for  e-signing.   o The super-registration of data by clients, on a voluntary basis, into a  personal PKI-protected vault on the e-public service portal for data items  such as digital photographs, income details, family details, phone contact   84  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     details, roles in organizations etc.  Access by government systems to the  data in this vault would be totally under client side control.  The super  registration process would also be used for PKI registration.   o Data protection compliance and multi-step authorization processing,  which will be carried out at the eGovernment Portal by using the episode  knowledge base and data held in the personal vaults.   o Electronic signing of HTML forms of XML or XSL files which are transferred to  the e-Government Portal.   o Electronic signature requirement for all interactions between the e- Government Portal and back-end systems.   o Message digests for all client-side interactions that should be archived to  deal with any contract or service delivery issues that might arise later on.        PUBLIC KEY INFRASTRUCTURE    Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is the technology that is currently being   adopted worldwide for the provision of on-line security and personal   authentication.  Public Key Infrastructure may be defined as the entire set   of policies, processes, server platforms, software, and workstations used for   the purpose of administering certificates and keys.  Public Key   Infrastructure is recognized worldwide as the current most secure   alternative for the provision of secure on-line services, and individual   signature authentication and non-repudiation.        PKI is based on the use of electronic certificates which bind the identity of   a person or an organization and the ownership of a public key, which can   be accessed and used by others.  Each public key has a corresponding   private key, which only the owner has and can use.  To keep information   confidential the public key of the intended recipient is used to encrypt the   message and the corresponding private key is used by the recipient to   decrypt the message.      85  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     The confidence in the system that is shown by sender and receiver of   information can only come about by the presence of a trusted third party   which handles the issue and management of public keys to their   respective owners.  This third party entity is the Certification Authority (CA).    Public Key infrastructure therefore permits the creation of secure and   universally accepted digital signatures, on the condition that a trusted   Certification Authority (CA) handles the process.      Different countries are adopting different strategies in the implementation   of a comprehensive Government services and nation-wide PKI   infrastructure.  There are several variables which impinge on the adoption   of the relative strategies, among which one finds factors such as   geographical characteristics, public service structure, political culture   (which determines whether systems are centralized or decentralized),   existing legacy systems, which would have entailed the proliferation of   isolated security systems.       The Grenada environment would militate in favour of a simple scaled   down version of Government PKI.  The Public Service should have a   common platform across information systems. Problems of legacy systems   and of on-line transactions do not arise.  We have a National ID Card   system and the Common Data Base.  All these elements make for the   creation of one overall Certification Authority (CA), which can issue   certificates and keys to all users for utilization in respect of all Government   Services.      The ideal solution in the implementation and running of a Government   Public Key Infrastructure would be one PKI, serviced by one Certification   Authority, that would attend to the certification of all individuals and   86  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     organizations related to e-Government services, and that would be   accepted across the public sector.        The services of the Government Certification Authority (CA) could also be   availed of by the Private Sector as, for example, in the case of Finland.   The Population Register of Finland serves as the Certification Authority for   the electronic exchange of official information.  It provides both   electronic identification for citizens, and certification services to   government agencies.  The Certification Authority (CA) service is based   on the Finnish Electronic Identification (FINEID) card.  This card, which is a   smart card, has gained widespread recognition throughout Finland and   may be used by the general public and the business community, not only   for accessing government services, but also for conducting business   electronically with a number of banking and insurance services.  The   envisaged benefits of such an arrangement would be relative simplicity in   the design and management of the overall PKI environment,   characterized by economies of scale. Ultimately, however, it will be the   market that would determine whether such a scenario would eventually   materialize.      The creation of a single Government Portal and related PKI infrastructure,   catered for by one Certification Authority for e-Government services, will   avoid complexity, ensure full interoperability and encourage cross-  functional utility. One further critical advantage of this approach is that it   is far more cost effective to have a central PKI infrastruture lodged within   the eGovernment Portal as against individual applications across the   entire Public Service. Furthermore, ease of use to the user is far higher   given that the user is provided with one ‘key’ which will allow him or her to   87  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     access any application in a secure manner for any government service to   which the user has legitimate access.      In the building of the Government PKI infrastructure a relatively   uncomplicated and comprehensive solution is preferred.  In this regard,   the following is proposed:       The setting up of a Policy Management Authority that will set policies, provide  approvals and take decisions on the nature and operations of the Government  PKI.  Its main functions would be those of:   o Providing direction and management of the Government's Public  Key Infrastructure.   o Establishing and approving applicable operational standards and  guidelines to be followed by the Certification Authority.   o Establishing and approving Pubic Key Infrastructure Certificate  Policies for the Government.   o Keeping the Government informed of developments in public key  technology and infrastructures, including standards and industry  practices.   o Promoting awareness of the role of the Government PKI in enabling  secure service delivery, public administration and communications.      The creation of a single Certification Authority for e-Government services  whose function will be               that of associating a public and private key pair with a particular  individual or entity.  It would:   o Identify the individual or entity which is to receive a key pair.  o Issue keys and related certificates guaranteeing the owner's   identity.  o Revoke keys when a private key may have been lost, stolen or   otherwise made public.  o Provide notice as to those key pairs, which have been revoked.       Until such time as the necessary organizational and technological   structures are in place, no individual Government entity should take   initiatives in this direction. This is to avoid the risks of total and costly revision   and realignment later, or operating in a legal and regulatory vacuum 88  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     without adequate security guarantees and unnecessary exposure to   potential liabilities.        SMART CARDS  The target of achieving secure transactions via authentication would   point to the use of Smart Cards, possibly containing the individual's   biometric data.  Factors such as a lack of standardization in the smart-  card environment and return-on investment considerations, are keeping   countries back from making the jump to smart-cards on a national front,   although individual systems using smart-cards may be found. (Visa has just   introduced its smart Visa Card)      Smart Cards and the National ID Card System  From a business viewpoint the use of Smart Cards solely for authentication   purposes would mean the underutilization of their potential.  Any move   towards the wholesale introduction of Smart Cards will have to factor in   the various uses to which they may be put, and to tailor the possible   additional applications identified for eventual uptake of Smart Card   technology accordingly.        Another issue relates to whether the Government will issue Smart Cards   itself on a universal basis, potentially via the ID card system, or whether it   will 'piggy back' on widespread card systems in use or coming into use in   the private sector.  It is envisaged that issuance by the Government of   Smart ID Cards is the logical way to go.  The example of Finland with the   FINEID Card is a useful experience to study.      Although the introduction of smart cards is not envisaged to take place in   the immediate future, provision for this eventuality should be taken now in  89  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     order to avoid costly duplication of work when they are eventually   introduced.  Care should be taken to ensure that when the current ID   cards are due for renewal the new cards that are distributed will contain   the required space for eventual insertion of the chip.  The new ID Cards   would therefore be smart-card-ready plastic cards, which will still serve the   purpose of physical identification.     This will obviate the need for a costly card-replacement process should   the shift to smart cards eventually become feasible.  All that would be   required would be the insertion of the chip in the existing plastic cards.    The cards would then serve a dual purpose, that of smart cards for   authentication and the provision of e-services, as well as the 'traditional'   physical identification of the owner.     Security considerations suggest that ownership of the physical cards,   whether 'traditional' ID cards or (eventually) smart ID cards, need to be   determined, and distinguished from the services they provide.      Smart Card Infrastructure  Grenada should begin exploratory discussions with various entities on the   possibility of eventually adopting a common smart card infrastructure.  For   example, Commercial Banks need to change their current ATM   infrastructure in order to introduce smart cards in lieu of the decision by   MasterCard and VISA that have established mandatory migration of   magnetic debit and credit cards to smart card technology by 2005.  The   Banks may be ready to assume a considerable portion of the costs of the   technology, in return for an arrangement whereby it could benefit from a   considerable increase in business, through the handling of e-Government   financial transactions.     Government should initiate discussions with the players in the regional and   national Banking sector who might be interested in such a joint venture.    90  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     The eventuality of adopting a common ID and Banking smart card is not   easy to achieve. It is highly unlikely that issues such as branding and   ownership of the card will be overcome.  Dual card use, that is the   Government ID card for e-Government services and the Banking card for   Banking services, is not, however seen as being a stumbling block to the   implementation of a common smart card infrastructure.     Be that as it may, the Government Portal architecture to be adopted   must take into account the eventual introduction of smart-cards.      The type of card to be adopted and the related technology must be   determined. The question of whether to do so within the context of a   CARICOM or OECS smart card standards that are to be eventually   agreed upon is an important issue for discussion.  The establishment of   common regional specifications for a generalized smart card   infrastructure seems to be a logical step as part of the Single Market and   Economy. Access to essential services with smart-card based   authentication everywhere in CARICOM should be a target of the CSME.        In the short-term, Grenada's best way forward is likely to be that of data   encryption and authentication without the use of smart cards, and to   study developments of smart card for potential introduction a few years   down the line.  In the meantime, transaction services to be implemented   will therefore be accessible via PKI and use of the private key will entail   the input of a pin or personal identification code.  Work on the security   features will be among the first tasks to address.       The CARICOM region needs to be persuaded to commit itself to:   o Defining common, workable, affordable and timely security certification  procedures and infrastructures for the security certification of   91  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     products/devices and acceptance environments (by a given time period,  say 12 months).   o Agreeing on common or interoperable technical specifications for  Identification, Authentication infrastructural, and services in the Region.     In the meantime preparatory work for eventual smart-card   implementation should be taken in hand as a specific initiative.  At this   stage the main tasks envisaged would consist of:   o Discussions and agreement with the Electoral Office, and the Police  Department on the introduction, at the next round of ID card renewals, of  smart-card-ready plastic ID cards.    o Further discussions with the Banks with a view to reaching an agreement in  principle as to further Government-Bank co-operation in the  implementation of a common kiosk infrastructure, given that Banks are  being intimated by the major credit card companies to switch to smart  cards by 2005.   o Identification of the Smart Card technology to be used taking into  consideration the direction to be taken by the Banks in this regard.          DELIVERY CHANNELS    There are several routes via which on-line e-government services can be   conveyed.        Direct access by PC to e-services over the Internet is the most obvious   channel.  Aspects related to social inclusion and public convenience   would, however, point to the utilization of other channels such as call   centres, kiosks and community-based over-the-counter services.    Notwithstanding any future improvements in Internet penetration, there   will inevitably be segments of the population that will not have the   opportunity for Internet access.       In addition, illiteracy, \"technophobia\" preference for person to person   interaction and service, the financial inability to own a computer can all  92  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     affect a citizen's preferred mode and channel of access to government   services. The adoption of a variety of access channels would therefore   address the needs of a significant percentage of citizens.       i. Direct Access via Internet  Though the Internet is the best-known channel for the delivery of on-line   services by Government to its clients, its current overall penetration even   in the economically advanced countries is still far from saturation point.    Grenada lags well behind with an estimated penetration rate of around   3% of the population.  Direct Internet access to e-Government services via   PC is therefore only one of several channels that have to be considered   for the widespread dissemination of on-line services.  Grenada's Internet   penetration can be expected to increase substantially over the next three   years, given the growth in ICT and Internet awareness, the movements in   liberalization of the telecommunications sector, the growth of service   providers and market competition with the concomitant price reduction,   affordability and quality improvement in service provision.        The speed by which transactions can be made over the Internet is   another factor that will have to be tackled.  Internet Service Provision at   the moment is far from being satisfactory.  Bandwidth has to be increased   both locally and in the international connection, with adequate excess   capacity built in so as to cater for future increases in number of users and   traffic.      Internet facilities need not be restricted to PC owners (and nowadays -   mobile phone owners).  The setting up of PC's in public places for universal   consumption is a practice that is being followed universally, with typical   venues being schools, post offices, libraries, local and community offices   and government local offices, and perhaps commercial banks. 93  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha        Interactive services also entail the requirement that the user have the   facility to communicate with the service provider via e-mail.  While PC   owners who are hooked to the Internet are also provided with an e-mail   address, this may not the case for those users who have to access the   Internet via public access points (which may also be kiosks).  The possibility   of eventually providing all citizens with an individual e-mail address will   therefore need to be pursued.      ii. Mobile Telephony  Mobile networking has become a major player in ICT over the past couple   of years, due to the adoption of WAP (wireless access protocol) which is   an open, global specification that enables mobile device users to easily   access and interact with information and services instantly.  This client-  based software enables wireless access to Internet in combination with a   suitable network server.   WAP has been designed for the current generation of wireless devices, so   that fundamental design changes to present-day mass market products   are not necessary.  Moreover, prices are being driven towards   affordability, thanks to WAP being well suited to current product   capabilities, as well as by mass-market volumes and by vigorous   competition.  WAP uses existing Internet standards, and has been   optimized to solve problems that had to date characterized the provision   of Internet over mobile networks, which required large amounts of mainly   text-based data to be sent.     Mobile telephony can be looked at for the provision of a host of e-  services, such as e-mail, e-commerce transactions and e-banking   services.  The provision of information-based services also renders mobile   telephony an attractive proposition within the ambit of e-Government.    94  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     Moreover, mobile telephony also lends itself to the use of smart cards,   which is another feature in its favour.   The provision of e-Government services over mobile telephony will be   limited by the nature of the receiving set.  Nevertheless, mobile telephony   is a very attractive channel for a host of e-services and can play an   important part in the overall e-Government set-up. The number of mobile   telephony users is rising very fast. Prices are falling and technical features   increasing. When roaming becomes commonplace in the Eastern and   southern Caribbean, the numbers can be expected to soar.     iii. Normal Telephony Value Added Services  On-line delivery channels to be used realistically hinges on the status and   trends relative to the stock of communications equipment currently in use   by householders. Automated telephone transactions via the Public   Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), such as the ones in existence in tele-  banking services, could be used in certain cases.  Possible instances are   the payment of fines and bills, and the renewal of licenses.  Such modes   of payment are currently in use in various countries.  The possibility of   certain basic services being provided via normal telephony should   therefore be examined in the context of e-government service delivery.       iv. Interactive TV  There are three types of digital television (DTV) that can be utilized,   namely, Digital Terrestrial TV (DTT), Digital Satellite TV (DST) and Digital   Cable TV (DCT).  DTT and DST would necessitate the use of access by   modem via the telephone network for the use of interactive services.      The extremely high penetration rate of television in Grenada and the   growing penetration of Cable TV offer good prospects for its use as a   channel of access and transaction. Although not yet a seamless  95  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     alternative to the PC, the DTV is a familiar and friendly tool for the   technologically uninitiated. The technical problems as an Internet user   interface are likely to be resolved in the near future, and allow its use as a   universal take-up of e-transactions.     v. Kiosks  Not all citizens will ultimately have means of access to electronic   transactions. It would therefore be necessary to have such means   available at public sites, such as schools, local and community sites, post   offices, and public libraries, commercial locations such as Banks, Malls   and supermarkets.  The means of access identified as being ideal for such   sites are either PC's or interactive kiosks.    Capital cost and maintenance factors would come into play, and will   militate whether we move down this route.  One alternative would be to   'piggy-back' on private kiosk-services providers, thereby maximizing usage   and splitting costs.  In this respect, the possibility of a joint kiosk venture   with the Banks, the local shop, grocery store, or gas station could be   explored to meet the Grenada requirements.      vi. Over the Counter Service  Face to face, over-the-counter service will continue to be the 'traditional'   mode of interaction between Government and citizens.  The new   technology opens the prospects for such a service provision to be more   efficient and more decentralized geographically, and be provided at   community level.  The Public Service may wish to set up its own over-the-  counter delivery structures at locality level. The costs would be modest   and may even represent savings over the current centralized paper-  based filing and retrieval system involving use of multiple officers per   transaction.    96  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     The locality-based service provider can also be an organization (NGO,   service group, etc.), which is completely separate from the Back-office   service providers.  Another option is to contract the service out to the   private sector.  Any of these options entails a formal agreement between   back-office supplier and the 'retailer' and the establishment of means of   remuneration for services rendered      It is envisaged that organizations carrying out over the counter service will   essentially act as intermediaries and will utilize the web-based on-line   services on behalf of the client.  Authentication should not be an issue in   this case.     vii.  Local Call Centres  Local Call-centres may be used as brokers in the provision of information-  based and transactional e-services.  The main stumbling block to the   delivery of transactional e-services via Call Centres is the question of   caller's authentication.  The complexity of the problem rises   proportionately with the confidentiality of the transaction.    Another possible use of the call centres is in the provision of help-line   services to clients who are accessing the service via the Internet, kiosks or   interactive TV.  This service is very important in that it ensures that users   constantly have the facility of obtaining assistance when accessing a   service. Call centre services of a help-line nature would ideally be   provided round the clock on a 24x7 basis.   Any such service to be provided should be underpinned by the presence   of two fundamental requirements.  These are that:   i. The   on-line information available for onward transmission, at the 'helper' end   should be quickly accessible, easily readable, comprehensive and up-to-  date.  97  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     ii. The   service or aspects of it (such as user-helpdesk facility) should ideally be up   on a 24 hours, seven-days-a-week (24x7) basis.      The first can only be provided by Government service-providers who   supply the necessary information to the call centre.  If the Government is   not able to supply round-the-clock service kind of service via its own set-  up,  it should explore the possibility of farming out call-centre services to   third parties.              COMMERCIAL CONSIDERATIONS    The front-end delivery channels can be considered as being 'retail   channels' by means of which clients make use of Government services.    Just as wholesalers and retail channels are distinct operations run by   separate organizations in the commercial world, the delivery or 'retail'   aspect of Government service delivery can be run by entities which are   distinct from the Government 'wholesale' service provision part.  These   commercial channels can be Government-owned but there is no barrier   to farming them out to the private sector or to local community bodies in   a controlled environment.  Controls would be in the form of a contract or   service level agreement and the issue of an operating license under   clearly defined conditions.  Commercial channels would include the   provision of services via a web front-end, kiosks in banks, shops, or   shopping malls, call centres and over the counter services.      98  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     Wholesaler to retailer payment methods for channel services provided are   various, and will depend on the nature of the channel as well as on the   nature of the transaction.  For example:   o Some Government activities could add value to the service provided by  a commercial organization, which could be prepared to pay for access  to these services, eg vehicle license renewal by insurance companies on  behalf of their clients.   o The citizen could be prepared to pay for certain services provided by the  commercial channel.   o Where large sums of money are involved, return to the commercial  channel might be via overnight investment.   o Government might fund the transaction in its entirety.  o Government pays the commercial channel a flat rate per transaction   delivered to it.    It is as yet too early to enter into the specifics relative to the means of   funding of commercial delivery channel services.  However one has to   bear in mind that the switch from conventional to e-services on the one   hand, and the farming out of delivery channels on the other, will likely   entail cost-savings to the Government in areas such as front-office   operations, mail processing and data input.     The notion that the end client, if not the channel, might end up paying for   the service is not likely to be productive, especially in a start-up situation   where the intention is to make the service as attractive as possible.    Instances where channels will pay for services provided are unlikely to be   substantial.  As a general rule the client should not pay for channel service   usage.            THE SERVICE OF EGOVERNMENT        99  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     Customer-centric business model   The accelerating popularity of digital services worldwide, the emergence   of the e-Economy, and the expanding Internet connectivity in Grenada   are all serving to transform the expectations of increasing numbers of our   citizens and businesses towards service delivery. \"One-to-one marketing\",   \"24x7\", \"permission based\" ; terms that did not even exist a few years ago   now permeate the daily vocabulary of customer service. These terms are   now being transferred from the international commercial sector to the   domestic economy and into the interactions expected between citizens   and government.   Citizens in Grenada can now purchase a car online, but must stand in-line   to register and license their new vehicle. Citizens and businesses can   interact with their Bank and their bank account online. They can pay   increasing numbers of bills online, but must stand in-line to pay in cash   even small amounts to the Customs or to the Treasury; or send from   England to a friend or relative in Grenada to apply and collect a Birth   Certificate from the Ministerial Complex and mail it to England.      The divergence between dealing with government, in the real world, and   operating as a citizen or a business in the online world will increasingly   pressure the government to incorporate online management systems into   its service delivery model. Government, as the largest supplier of services   in the domestic economy must modernize itself.         The modernized government online must be governed by a number of   factors:     • Vision and Implementation   100  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     The Vision articulated by the Government must be closely supported by   the provision of the right administrative structure and mechanism that   would support implementation, communicate deliverables, and establish   accountability for delivery. There needs to be the right balance between   political leadership and administrative simplicity for effective e-  Government. There must be visible and committed leadership within both   the political and administrative arms of government. The experience in   several countries confirms that early political leadership builds   momentum. But the creation of simple guidelines and deliverables and   timetable for government agencies combine to deliver results quickly. The   right infrastructure and implementation programme with clear   accountability for results is crucial.      Structure, in the form of an accountable agency to deliver e-Government   initiatives, is vital. Canada, Singapore, Ireland, united States all have a   clear Plan and Structure within government to spearhead e-Government   development programmes, and have achieved their leadership position   as a result of these programmes having been in place for several years.   The new positions and Agencies must be attached to the highest level of   Office rather than have implementation delegated to individual   agencies. This high level and centralized initiative is vital, as the success of   e-Government depends largely on cross agency co-operation.      Grenada's e-Government strategy will adopt the following strategy:   - Building e-government presence,   - Thinking big,   - Starting small, and   - Scaling fast.     Implementing the migration of government services from in-line to online   can lead to dramatic improvement in public services. But that exercise is   101  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     considerably more difficult than its private sector equivalent.   Implementing e-government involves not only managerial and   organizational challenges, but also complex social, regulatory and legal   issues that will test even the most sophisticated of public services. Not only   is it necessary to move the appropriate group of citizens and businesses   towards the new service delivery channels, there will also be need to   target resources towards the more needy groups within the society.      The national digital divide will complicate the process of implementation.   Some government services with significant potential for improved   efficiencies and lower costs, such as the social services, are those for   which the majority of consumers are most adversely affected by the   digital divide. Specific measures would have to be taken to narrow the   digital divide in Grenada, and bring significant social groups within the   reach of new technologies.              • Citizen-Centric – An Intentions based Approach  The mere provision of a Website does not constitute an e-Government   strategy. A true e-Government Internet strategy must also re-examine all   aspects of the model currently used to service its citizen-clients, evaluate   its interactions with its customers and stakeholders, and identify those   areas where more value can be created for all stakeholders by moving   processes and interactions online.   The overall goal of Grenada's e-government strategy will be citizen-  centric, focusing the delivery of improved levels of customer service and   enhanced citizen satisfaction.    102  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     Experiences of the most successful e-Government countries indicate that   merely publishing information online and organizing a Web presence   around Ministries' and Agencies' traditional, attitudes, structure, operations   and service delivery methods will lead to disappointment. Online   presence must be predicated on what the citizen wants to do, rather   than how the Ministry or Agency is organized or managed.   Singapore, using the intentions-based approach, designed its e-Citizen   Website around the life cycle of the citizens and the typical interactions   they would have with the government at various stages in their life.    Website information supply is therefore only a first step. To be meaningful   and valuable, Government online must graduate to greater interactivity   and transaction capabilities, enabling the citizens and businesses to   complete entire transactions with government online. Paying taxes, fines   or claiming benefits online are citizen-centric value-added services; but   moving revenue processes online offers several gains to government:   collections are accelerated, processing costs are considerably reduced,   and compliance is increased.      • Customer Relationship Management (CRM)  This marketing technique would require the Ministries and Agencies know   their customers and better select and manage the service provided. They   would need to streamline their citizen interface, their communications   and marketing processes by tailoring their offerings, minimizing duplication   of information and profiling customer behavior to predict their likely future   requirements; and offer the product or service that is individually required.       Government has the largest customer base in the country and stands to   benefit enormously from adopting CRM disciplines in terms of increased   efficiencies and lower service delivery costs. Integrating CRM with online   103  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     service delivery offers significant economies to Grenada's e-Government   initiatives.     • Volume and complexity  The volume of services offered is vast; and the aim is to provide the range   of services online. This requires the availability of Ministries' and Agencies'   websites. But most important is creating innovative solutions for the citizens   and businesses that they serve. The introduction of complex transactions   would be a function of the citizens' requirements and must be designed to   add value.    There is merit in separating e-government plans from generic government   Information Technology programmes. This will help to focus on the service   rather than on the technology; and would promote specific e-  Government initiatives to improve the quality and value of traditionally   paper-based services to citizens and businesses online. Balancing   technological choices with customer needs is the vital judgment call of e-  Government.      Provision of quality e-Government services offers the opportunity for   several efficiencies as well as for increased customer services. Internet   transaction costs, particularly for relatively uncomplicated transactions,   are substantially lower than their clerical equivalent. Those savings will   allow resources to be redirected, perhaps towards those citizens and   businesses that are in need of specialized or resource-intensive support.   However, these benefits are likely to be realized only if government   deepens its online service offers, and persuades citizens and businesses to   interact with government over the Internet. Offering a wide range of easy-  to-use and value-added e-Government services will be an important   factor in achieving this. The sheer magnitude of government online can   be daunting, but Government must aim at maximizing value to the  104  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     citizens and businesses by ensuring that government online is easy to find   and easy to transact with.        • Portals - single interaction Point  Citizens in Grenada complain all the time about the multiple agencies   they sometime have to visit in order to transact a single matter. One   Office to get information, another office to get the Form, still another   Office to pay, and a further Office to collect the product or the service.    Such an online arrangement would be a disaster. At best, it would not be   citizen-friendly to require visits to several individual sites to transact an   online service.    Portals offer the citizen single points of entry to multiple agencies, and   they afford citizens or businesses the opportunity to interact easily and   seamlessly with several Ministries or Agencies, without the need to even   know the name of the Agency.    Research from the world of business has shown that customers behave   differently in the online world than they do in a physical office. In the one-  on-one environment of the Internet, customers seek providers who   organize service around their needs. This observation points to the need   for a single gateway for users of all government websites, and for   organization around the information or service that the user is seeking.        TYPES OF SERVICE  There are essentially five main types of e-service that the Government can   provide.  These are briefly described in the sections below:      Information    There are two types of information to consider:    • General information such as the set-up of the Executive and of the Public Service, and other   information such as updated laws, Government news bulletins, information of a cultural nature etc.   105  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     • Information which is more in line with the concept of e-Government.  In  this case the information that is supplied to the client is in the form of  instructions that the client should follow.  There are three sub-types of such  information.     • Information that relates to the nature of services provided to the client, and how these are   provided.  Such information is essentially akin to an instruction leaflet describing what  the client should do to get a particular service.  It would also include the facility for the  client to download forms relative to service required.      • Information that is required by the client in the normal course of life, and  that is very often the reason why the service-provider has been set up.   Such information is not linked to any transaction that is likely to take place.   Good examples are health and safety tips or advice on preventive health  care.       • Information that pertains to the individual user and that is likely to be of a   private nature.  The user might need to consult such information for  personal purposes.  A typical example is the individual's updated on-line  medical history, or tax status.         Transactional e‐Services   This is an area where e-Government becomes interactive and therefore   particularly useful to the citizen.  There is a whole array of services that can   be provided by the Government via this medium.  The spectrum may   range from the application for social services, for employment, to the   payment of traffic fines, to the submission of a tax form.  This is one of the   most challenging aspects of e-Government in that it really takes the   service to the citizen.     While the provision of information is important as a service in itself, on-line   delivery of services is the crux of the whole concept of e-Government.  It   means delivering a service to the citizen in a fashion that is 'user-friendly'.    By implication the quality of service delivered on-line cannot be a   replication of the bureaucracy that the citizen faces in the current   environment.    106  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha        Therefore, there has to be a rethink of the philosophy of Government   entities which should not be restricted solely to e-Government, but should   cascade to all aspects of organizational activity.  In other words, if the   Government adopts a business type attitude that is client-centred, service   delivery, whether on-line or off-line, will improve.        The introduction of e-Government therefore provides the opportunity not   only for the introduction of new technologies, but also for reform of the   system and the modernization of the nature and culture of public services   and the relationship between government and its clients.    Government service providers have to get out of the mode of demanding   that the client behaves and responds according to their needs.  They   should switch to the mode whereby they should be seeking to render a   service that, while respecting statutory and other requirements, is simple,   timely, courteous and dedicated to the needs of the client, rather than   those of the service provider.      One key factor is that client expectations, relative to promptness in   service delivery, has increased somewhat in those countries where on-line   services are already provided somewhat extensively.        The Canadian Public Service estimates that whereas the public deems   two weeks as being an acceptable interval for a response to a request   via normal mail, it expects a response to an E-mail request within four   hours.  Building an on-line 'façade' on the current local Government   service-delivery culture can be tantamount to a boomerang in terms of   public perception of, and confidence in, the efficiency and effectiveness   of Government Services.    107  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha        Electronic Commerce   The focus in this case is on Government to Business type of transactions.    While less apparent to the general public, it is still an important aspect of   e-Government.  It is also likely to be the most difficult service to   implement.  There are two reasons for the difficulties involved.     The first relates to the fact that financial transactions on-line are likely the   most complex in terms of implementation.  The second reason is that there   is currently no e-commerce culture either in the Public Service or in the   Private Sector. So, there is no real push coming from any quarter, although   the global electronic market will, sooner or later exert its pressure on the   local market.  Meanwhile other jurisdictions are viewing e-commerce as a   priority area, and some governments have taken it upon themselves to   actually play the role of leaders in the field so as to encourage the private   sector to follow suit, thereby boosting the economy via increased trade.        Two areas in Government where electronic commerce is considered to   be of particular importance are customs and general procurement of   goods and services, but there are others.  The Government should actively   follow a policy aimed at creating an e-commerce culture in the national   economy.  The adoption of on-line procurement of goods and services by   Government is one important measure which will directly promote e-  commerce in the economy as a whole.  It should be resorted to as a   matter of priority.      The Government should immediately initiate work towards achieving full   capability in on-line procurement, and other forms of Government to   Business transactions at the earliest possible opportunity, in view of the   108  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     important spillover effects that this activity can have on the e-Commerce   environment in the national economy.        Moreover, the Treasury should aim at effecting all payments, including   internal ones such as transfers to Ministries and Departments, and the   payment of salaries to Government employees, and the payment of   dividends to beneficiaries, for full electronic payment to take place by   direct electronic transfer.  The Treasury should also target full electronic   payment to contractors and suppliers by the end of 2001.      This should be achievable in a relatively short time, given that the local   Banks already cater for such payment facilities over their own private   networks (and not yet via the Internet), and the Treasury can now make   limited use of such facilities.           e‐Democracy   This is a very interesting concept that has taken root in several countries   that are implementing e-Government.  e-Democracy is not merely seen   as the potential use of Information Technology for electronic voting.  It is   rather the way that public authorities at different levels interact with   citizens on a daily basis through the use of Information and   Communication Technology.      The promotion of e-Democracy is an implicit by-product of e-Government   given the prospects for the provision of easily accessible on-line   information to the Citizenry relative to the workings of Government.  The   widening of two-way communications channels is also an implicit way of   fostering e-Democracy.   109  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     The open invitation of public reaction over the Internet to Government   policies and envisaged legislation would represent a primary contribution   to democracy in Grenada.      But Government should extend the use of the Internet to ensure   consultation and feedback on major political and policy initiatives.  The   aim would be to go beyond simply publishing legislation and White Papers   on the web and establish a discussion and feedback forum possibly with   independent moderators.      One requisite that the literature on the subject emphasizes is the need for   universal access to information and the communication channels that   enable active participation.           Non‐Governmental Services and Information   There may be services that are provided by the private sector that may   be considered as being useful for the citizen to have access to on-line   alongside e-Government services.  Such services may range from the   hiring of cars, provision of air transport information, and the facility for   payment of utility bills, to electronic banking and other such services.    These services are of particular benefit to the citizen in terms of on-line   access, while adding value to the e-Government Services Site.  The nature   of these services can range from information to on-line transactions.    Where such private entities already have web-sites and on-line services of   their own, it may be worthwhile to build access to such sites via the e-  Government Services web-site.  A policy relative to non-government   services to be incorporated with e-Government Services would have to   be drawn up.  One instance, which would qualify private services for   110  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     inclusion with e-Government Services, is when a private service is a   component of a particular service provided by the Government, for   example, private motor insurance services as a part of the annual vehicle   license renewal process.           THE GOVERNMENT SERVICES WEB‐SITE    The e-Government Services web-site will reside on the Government Portal   front-end.  It will provide the information and transactional services to any   user who requires them.  The layout of the information and services   provided should be based on client needs and should therefore be in   such a way as to facilitate search and location by users.     It should also cater for accessibility by persons with special needs via the   incorporation of tailored features.      A practical model in terms of the organization of services, as visible to the   client, is the clustering of e-Government services under 'life cycle events'.    Different countries have adopted varying criteria for clustering under this   broad term.  Other terms are coming into play in order to cater for   services that do not fall strictly under the broad definition of a life event.    There are several models of product clusters in existence.    The Singapore Government e-Citizen site is likely the best known, but there   are other models such as the ones taken up by Portugal, the Netherlands   and Australia.  The notion of clustering services according to perceived   client needs, and presenting them in this fashion, is valid and several   countries are adopting service clustering.      111  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     The model below builds on various models adopted in other jurisdictions.    There are various permutations of product clusters that can be adopted,   all of which are likely equally valid.      One model for a Citizen Services set of product clusters could be as follows:  01. Employment and Income.  02. Sport, leisure & Culture.  03. Health.  04. Environment and cleanliness.  05. Education.  06. Business.  07. You as Consumer.  08. Housing and Home.  09. Travel and Transportation.  10. Family Affairs.  11. Strictly for Children.  12. The Elderly.  13. Special Needs.  14. Visiting or settling in Grenada  15. Law and Order.  The list is not exhaustive.      Basically, a rule of thumb measure that can be applied in listing potential   on-line services is that, if there are any services to the public whereby the   latter has to fill in a form, or make some formal request for a document or   a service, then that service should go on-line.  For the less frequently used   services, this may involve simply putting forms on-line for download or   electronic forwarding to the proper Ministry or Agency which can then   process manually if costs of backroom automation exceed benefits.         Some of the services that have been identified are targeted at a small   segment of the population.  These have been included in the first instance   but a decision can be taken at a later stage as to whether the less   prominent services are required to go on-line.      112  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     It would be necessary to establish standards for presentation and format.    The standards should be drawn up through the coordination of the CIMU   and the final appearance of the e-Government Service Web-Pages will   be based on these.       BRANDING: ONE EGOVERNMENT IDENTITY    The e-Government services should fall under one single corporate identity   that is distinct from that of the organizations providing the individual back-  office services.  The ultimate aim is to provide the image of Government   e-services as one homogeneous product.  This will reinforce the image of   the front-end 'retail' service that is distinct from the back office 'wholesale'   providers.  Individual Departments will not be prominent on the e-  Government Services site, and will be only visible when an individual   transaction is accessed.       On the other hand individual Departments also need to establish their   own corporate identity to be easily distinguishable from each other as the   end-service providers.  The creation of an individual Departmental identity   should not, however, detract from the creation of a common 'look and   feel' for all services that are provided electronically.  Neither should it   impinge on the structure of individual Departmental web-sites, which   should be similar insofar as visual and ease-of-use features such as search   facilities and content indexes are concerned.      If any delivery channels are to be farmed out to third parties the   necessary measures to ensure the integrity of the e-Government Services   brand must be adopted.  Channels that can potentially interfere with the   e-Government Services corporate image, or impinge negatively on it,   should not be considered.   113  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha        One potential source of financing of the e-Government Services, that   should be favorably considered, is on-line advertising.  If such a measure is   adopted care should be taken to ensure that the type of products or   services being promoted and the nature of the adverts should be   consonant with the image that e-Government wants to project.        A set of standards should be drawn up relative to branding and corporate   image on the Web. The capacity would be needed to monitor the   adherence of incumbents to the standards set.       Grenada Government Domain Name  One fundamental component of the e-Government 'brand name' is its   Domain name.  The current situation in this regard is one that has to be   rectified.     The Grenada Government Site needs to be identified unequivocally by all   users as the official Government Domain.  Users have to know that they   are accessing and dealing with the Government of Grenada.  The issue   becomes one of trust and peace of mind on the part of users. It is   therefore recommended that the Government immediately assumes the   '.gov.gd' domain name for the Official Site (GRENET) as well as for all   official Government sites that will reside on it.  There must be sole   exclusivity to the Government of Grenada in the use of the \".gov.gd\" title.          THE WEB‐SITE     If we are to achieve a coherent image of e-Government, we have to start   off immediately at the foundations.  The Government Web-site should be   114  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     of highest quality, in terms of visual coherence, format, content and   organization. Information should be complete, well presented and well   distributed.  Specific client services page must be created whereby the   citizen can obtain information, forms and contact persons relative to a   government service that is required.  Search facilities should be user-  friendly.       Another important component of the Government Site is the   comprehensive presence, by way of their respective web-sites, of all   Public Service organizations, that is, Ministries and Departments.   All   Ministries and Departments should be present.  Existing web-sites and   pages of some Ministries and agencies especially those that have not   been updated for quite a while should be integrated into the main   Government site.  There is need also to create a uniform general   appearance, and a facility to be able to search between sites.        Overall, the establishment of web-standards for all Government sites is an   important prerequisite.         Setting up and managing web‐sites  This activity is a major task in itself and involves not only the physical 'look   and feel' aspect but also the organisational, procedural and regulatory   aspects.  The Central Information Management Unit should, jointly with   others, commission a blueprint in respect of presentation standards,   organisation and processes, relative to the setting up and maintenance of   web-sites. The final product should determine the following requirements:      115  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     o The   standards relative to visual presentation, navigation facilities and   accessibility features for persons with special needs.   o The   nature and extent of information content that would ideally be placed in   the respective sites.   o The   organizational set-up that would be required within individual   Government Ministries and Agencies to carry out the various tasks leading   to successful implementation of web-sites, and regular maintenance   thereafter.   o The   nature of human resources that would be required to carry out identified   tasks.   o The   identification of those aspects of web-site design and development that   could be farmed out vis-à-vis those that could or should be carried out in-  house.      There has to be a sizeable element of capacity building within Ministries   and Departments for the effective implementation of e-Government.  It   seems logical that the human resources appointed for the development   of the technical aspects - but not the content - of the web-sites would   reside within the Ministries' Information Management Units (IMU's).  It is   likely that the duties of the staff concerned would not be restricted to   web-related work, but that they would have to have multi-disciplinary   capabilities.  This would enable them to cater for other functions which   the IMU's would be expected to carry out.  Scale of operations would   116  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     dictate to what extent multi-skilling would be required.  This requirement   would vary across Ministries.   The capacity building of Information Management Units is therefore seen   as being a necessary step towards the implementation of e-Government.     Government sites' Domain names  All sites that would be set up and reside on the Grenada Government Site   should carry the \".gov.gd\" suffix to their respective Domain names to   distinguish them as official Government sites in accordance with world-  wide practice.  In the case of Ministries and Government Departments the   respective domain names will all include this suffix.  The site on which the   Ministry sites shall in turn reside, shall also adopt the \".gov.gd.\" suffix.  This is   an important part of the the branding aspects of e-Government.      The matter becomes rather less clear when it comes to Public Sector State   Enterprises and Utilities.  The first issue to resolve is whether any of these   entities would qualify for the label \".gov.gd\" and, by implication reside on   the Grenada Government Site and therefore on the Portal.  A prima facie   answer would be in the affirmative for at least a number of these entities.    There are implications that this right will likely also entail.        The following issues relative to Public Sector Entities therefore need to be   addressed:   1. Whether Public Sector entities should at all carry the   \".gov.gd\" domain name and reside on the Grenada  Government Portal.   2. Under what criteria would Public Sector entities qualify for  the \".gov.gd\" domain name.   3. For those Public Sector entities that would qualify for the  \"gov.gd\" domain name, it would have to be ascertained  whether the standards required for Public Service Sites would  also apply to them.  This would entail that the CIMU take   117  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     overall responsibility for setting standards to be followed by  these Public Sector entities.   4. If these public sector entities are to supply services via the e- Government Portal, as would seem to be the case, then they  would have to comply with all the security and  authentication standards and protocols in place.       If a number of Agencies were to establish their own e-services on   separate platforms, we risk losing all the advantages of a common   platform; these agencies/Ministries would fall out of the scope of the e-  Government programme, and will be duplicating security and   authentication requirements.      It seems sensible to make provision for a coordinated umbrella   responsibility within the framework of the Central Information   Management Agency with appropriately wide mandate in the regulation   of Information Technology, Information Systems and Information   Management within the Public Service.  This widening of the CIMA's   mandate could be effected by the expansion of the definition of Public   Service to embrace a number of Government-owned or controlled   entities, that lie beyond the boundaries of the traditional Ministry and   Departmental structures, and easily reside within the Private Sector, or   could be conveniently privatized         Ownership and Maintenance of the Grenada Government  Site, AND E‐Services   The Grenada Government Site, (GRENET) will host all the individual Ministry   and Public Sector entity sites and the e-Government Services site.  On its   part, the e-Government Services site is the one that will host all the cross-  Government e-services to be provided.  By implication these sites, that is  118  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     the Grenada Government Site and the e-Government services site, are   corporate entities in the ambit of the Public Sector.  This raises the issue of   ownership of these sites.       This matter still requires further consideration and determination. One   consideration is that elements responsible for the ownership and resultant   development, and subsequent maintenance of the web-sites within their   respective Ministries, would also own their e-services and be responsible   for their setting up and subsequent maintenance.  They would not,   however, be responsible for the overall management of the Site on which   their individual web-sites would reside or, for that matter, the e-  Government Services site on which their services would reside.        The management of both the Government Site (GRENET) and e-Services   site could be farmed out in their totality to a third party contractor. In the   case of both the Government Site (GRENET) and the e-Government   Services site, the owner would be responsible for the following aspects of   the operation during and subsequent to implementation:      Implementation:  o Drawing up the visual and content requirements of the e-Services   site in accordance with established standards.  o Commissioning the design of the e-Services site.  o Commissioning the development of the e-Services site.  o Appointing a host and manager (Web Master) for the site.  o Drawing up a service level agreement / contract with the site-  manager on the basis of agreed parameters.         119  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     Post‐implementation operations:  o Ensuring that the site-manager carries out the job according to   agreed parameters set out in the service level agreement /  contract.   o Maintaining the currency of the e-Government Services site in terms  of content and requesting the site-manager to carry out any  changes to design and format of the web-site as required from time  to time.      The ownership of the Government Site (GRENET)  – as against the   infrastructure - is an issue that needs addressing.  Several options are open   for consideration.  Ownership could fall to the Information Ministry, or the   Ministry of Finance, or a new Government organization which can be   created with this specific purpose.        The e-Government Services site will be a new development.  There is no   Government entity that would be an automatic choice for ownership.  A   new Government entity catering for this function may well be a more   feasible option.        In terms of the e-Services site, the owner of the site would be responsible   for the site itself but not for the individual services residing thereon.  The   individual services are owned by, and therefore the responsibility of, the   respective service-delivery Ministries/Agencies..  These shall, as a result, be   responsible for the development and subsequent maintenance of their   respective services, including the management of any organizations   contracted for the carrying out of such services.             120  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     PRIORITIZATION OF SERVICES TO GO ON‐LINE    Information services can start to go on-line once the preliminaries issues   relative to the Government Web-site re-structuring, organizational issues as   to who does what and web design standards are settled.  Transaction   services are not so easy to implement given various issues that have to be   addressed prior to roll-out.      The transaction services will go on line gradually according to a time-  scale that needs to be set.  It will therefore be necessary to prioritize their   roll-out on a set of criteria, some of which work against one another.    Suggested criteria include the following:     o The volume of transactions being handled by the service and the   number of clients.  The higher the volume the more ideal it would  be to roll out the service.   o The potential backroom cost-savings in implementing on-line  services.  The higher the savings the more attractive the early roll- out.  It is likely that the bigger the service the higher will be the  savings on backroom activities.   o The complexity of the service.  The higher the complexity of the  service the more difficult it is to achieve roll-out.      o Whether the service-providing Department is computerized and, if  the application is in a state of development, the likely target date  when it will be completed.  If the Department is not computerized, it  will be difficult to achieve early roll-out unless the service is simple  and does not require back-room computerization.   o The level of robustness of the current IT application within the service  providing Department.   o The level of security that the service requires.  The higher the level of  security the more likely that the service will be delayed in roll-out or  that the service will only be supplied in a more limited manner.   o The level of business process re-engineering and/or changes in  legislation that may be required in the service-providing  Department prior to roll out.  The bigger the requirement the more  likely that rollout will be delayed. 121  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     o The level of complexity in integrating the Internet front-end to the  back-office system.  The higher the complexity, the later the rollout.     An assessment of the services to go on line will be based on various  exercises at different stages of the e-Government Programme.    01. The first exercise will be relatively high level and will serve to identify   those Government services that should ideally go on-line.  This  exercise will also serve to provide a broad outline as to what the  service will entail by way of deliverables and back-office linkages.   This initial exercise will also serve to establish the positioning of the  individual e-Government services in the related service clusters.    02. The second exercise will be more detailed in that it will entail a  prioritization exercise resulting in a multi-year rollout plan for e- Government Services.  The rollout plan will be established following  analysis of each and every service on the basis of the above  criteria.   03. Detailed requirement specification of the individual e-Government  Services and any possible (BPR) requirements of related back-office  systems will be mapped out at the implementation stage of each  service.        The Implementation of a Pilot  A service or a restricted series of services will be earmarked for the   implementation of a pilot that will test all the features that will eventually   characterize e-Government services.  These features would include:   o User friendliness.  o Security.  o Authentication.  o Interaction with multiple back-office systems.  o Visual presentation.  o Features for persons with special needs.    The pilot service/s will run on a reduced-scale model of the three-tier   architecture that will be needed to run them when they eventually go   live.    122  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha           COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY    A Communications Strategy is necessary throughout the various stages of   the e-Government Programme.  Basically the Strategy would cover the   pre-implementation and implementation stages of e-Government.  In the   pre-implementation stage it would be ideal to sound out public   perceptions and expectations by means of surveys and focus groups.  The   surveys and focus groups would establish:   o Public awareness as to the existence of e-services and electronic  channels as the means to access such services, including  Government services.   o Public perceptions and expectations relative to e-Government  service delivery.   o Propensity by the public to use e-services once these would be on- line and related reasons.   o Preferences relative to eventual delivery channels that could be  provided.   o Conditions under which usage of electronic delivery channels  would be taken up by the public.     The surveys and focus groups would be targeted to address a   comprehensive and statistically significant cross-section of the population.    In the eventual analysis of results, however, attention would be given to   replies submitted by specific categories of the population, e.g. youths,   businesses, the elderly, persons with differing levels of education and so   on.  The results would influence not only the choice and frequency of   eventual service delivery channels but also the subsequent 'marketing' of   the services relative to specific target groups.  The exercise would also   serve to ascertain the extent and nature of any eventual capacity   building requirements on a national scale.      123  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     During the implementation stage when e-Government services will start   going on-line, it will become necessary for the public to be made aware   of their existence and of the potential benefits that can be obtained from   the utilization of such services.  Work need to be done (market research)   to ascertain the most appropriate communications strategies to be   utilized relative to target audiences.      Potential clients have to be made aware of the advantages in the utilizing   on-line as against traditional modes of service.  The communication   strategy should emphasize those aspects that are likely to influence the   public and determine whether or not on-line services are utilized.  Such   aspects as the respect of privacy and the security level afforded by the   system in effecting on-line transactions, especially those involving money   transfers, need to be emphasized.        A mix of direct marketing and poster, audio-visual, print media as well as   on-line advertising will likely be used for promoting the new on-line   services that are available.  There should be different marketing   approaches to different clients mainly on such parameters as age, IT   literacy and level of education.      The communications strategy campaign should not raise expectations   unduly and should maintain a constant tempo over an appreciable   period of time.  It should intensify when a critical mass of eGovernment   services will have gone on-line.  The campaign should also factor:   o Promoting of the use of the Internet and other established service  delivery channels.   o Sensitisation of the public to the fact that these new service delivery  options are available.   124  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     o Promoting a customer-focused services by the Government,  thereby enhancing its image.   o Raising public awareness as to the training facilities that will be  provided in terms of Internet usage.     The Information Department should be responsible for the   Communications Strategy, but this should be coordinated and developed   in conjunction with the other agencies. Third party services may have to   be engaged as appropriate.               GOVERNMENT INTERNAL CAPACITY BUILDING    Significant organizational changes will be required in order to cater for   new roles and functions which the implementation of e-Government will   require.        Sizeable changes will be required too in individual roles, work attitudes,   work culture, skills-base and work strategies during the period of up-take   of theses technologies.  Most of the mundane, tedious and repetitious   functions are likely to be replaced by new web-technology,   communications, and customer care skills. The resultant organizational   changes and skill levels within the Public Service will be far-reaching and   continuous.   Specific training programmes will therefore need to be planned and   implemented throughout the Public sector in order to develop the human   resource capabilities, not only in computer literacy and competence, but   also in research techniques, information gathering, data filtering, data   management, information sharing dissemination as well as in improved   125  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     service delivery skills and customer management techniques and   sensibilities.      ORGANIZATION‐SPECIFIC INITIATIVES    Recent experience in other countries such as the UK and Ireland relative   to the implementation of e-Government is that the initiative must be   centrally piloted by a Programme Coordinating Entity that will cut across   departmental boundaries.  Individual service-providing Departments will   still be responsible for the implementation of on-line delivery of their   particular services but this implementation will be within the wider ambit of   the cross-Government initiatives.        The following organizational requirements in this start-up phase of the   Programme can be envisaged as immediate requirements:        The Central Information Management Agency  The establishment of a Central Information Management Agency (CIMA)   is vital to the coordination of the overall programme. In the ambit of e-  Government, the Central Information Management Agency (CIMA) is   necessary to take on a host of planning and coordination responsibilities,   including:   • Planning and Owning the e-Government Programme.   a. Design and build the e-Government Portal Architecture  b. Determining and sizing the Backbone  c. Design, construct, maintain the Grenada Government   Network  d. Provision of e-Commerce solutions  e. Create a Secure environment, viz:   i. Design Security features  ii. Authentication features  iii. Smart card solutions   f. Mobilizing the establishment of Ministries' websites  126  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     g. Preparing of procedures and standards  h. Promoting, implementing, and managing Smart Partnership   with the Private Sector     • Ownership of policies and standards relative to e-Government  matters, such as:   - Public Key Infrastructure.   - Web presentation and accessibility.   - e-Government  Service delivery, quality and standards.  - Channel Policy.  - Branding and Corporate Identity standards.  - Standards relative to third-party presence on the Government Portal.       Ministriesʹ Information Management Units (IMUʹs)  The creation of Information Management Units in each Ministry or Agency   is required to give each Ministry enough in-house capability to manage its   Information functions.    Ministry IMU's have to look at the identification,   development and maintenance of their respective Information System /   Technology / Management requirements.      IMU's need to be established early to ensure available capability for the   internals of the Ministry. Within the context of e-Government, IMU's will play   an important part both in the development of their respective Ministry and   Departmental web-sites, as well as in the implementation phase of on-line   services.  Following implementation, IMU's will have to tend to the   maintenance and further development of such on-line services.        Disciplines in web-design and development as well as knowledge of the   technical aspects of on-line service provision, and the respective   interfacing with back-office systems, will definitely be required in IMU's. In   the initial phases of the Programme it will be possibly to supply much of   127  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     the know-how from the Central IMU. Ultimately, however, the capability   must be developed in the IMU's.      It is unlikely that there will be swift and co-ordinated development of   Ministry web-sites and on-line services without the efforts of IMU's out on   the field.  It is therefore recommended that three pilot Ministry sites be   identified for the setting up of operational IMU's during 2001, following the   establishment of the necessary organizational and operational   framework.  Other Ministries would subsequently follow on the basis of the   established pilots.        Public Key Infrastructure Certification Authority  The Certification Authority will require suitable organization, structure,   procedures, processes and related human resources.  It has to handle a   widespread service such as the generation, distribution and maintenance   of pubic keys to all eligible users of Grenada's e-Government services.     The extent to which capacity building in this instance will be required by   Government will depend on which of several options will eventually be   taken up.      Ownership of the GRENET and the e‐Government Sites  Capacity building needs to be undertaken by way of building the   competence of the Government Ministries and Agencies that will be   entrusted with the ownership of the Government Site and the e-  Government Services site.     Even if this entity will eventually outsource these functions, it still needs a   core of knowledge workers, well versed in the subject, who will be able to   manage the contractors.       128  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     SMART PARTNERSHIP: PUBLIC/PRIVATE  COLLABORATION    It is expected that such a wide-ranging initiative as the setting up and   running of e-Government will entail substantial inputs from the private   sector. This would provide significant impetus to the development of the   local IT community.  Although the private IT sector in Grenada is small and   not well developed, and though it is not now possible to define the nature   and extent of Public / Private relationships in the various activities that will   come about as a result of the implementation of e-Government, it is   reasonable to expect that Private Sector involvement would be   forthcoming in the following areas:   • Design of the Portal and Network  • The setting up and provision of Certification Services.  • The implementation and maintenance of Delivery Channels.  • Web Development and maintenance on behalf of Government   Entities   • The provision of E-Commerce Solutions.  • Hardware and Software Supplies, and modifications     In some cases, such as in the management of Delivery Channels and in   Web Development, the Private Sector is already present on the scene.  It   is expected that this presence will increase substantially in parallel with the   additional activity generated by the implementation of e-Government.        Setting up the e-Government Portal will necessitate the partnership with a   major player in the e-Commerce field.  There are not a lot of organizations   that are capable of providing comprehensive solutions of the magnitude   that will be required by the Government in the building of the design and   building of the complete Portal Architecture.     Grenada will need to make itself attractive to prospective International   partners who would be interested in investing in the development of the   Portal Architecture, as a showcase to the World. 129  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha        FUNDING THE E‐GOVERNMENT INITIATIVE    Central Government Financing  Funding the e-Government programme is expected to be made via the   annual Government Budget.    The e-Government programme in this context is taken to comprise:   o The setting up of the necessary technical infrastructure and  architecture.   o The setting up of the necessary organizational structures that will be  required for implementation and subsequent maintenance.   o The development of the front end.  o The middleware requirements relative to each on-line service.  o The application development requirements relative to the back   office services to go on-line.  o The business process reengineering exercises, formal and virtual,   that will have to take place.    It would not be prudent to advance an approximate estimate at this point   in time.  When initiatives of this magnitude are embarked upon, the best   solution relative to financing would be to commit a sum that represents   the start-up financing and thereafter work on specific estimates relative to   each individual project or service that will be identified for   implementation.        The Government has already undertaken expenditure over the past five   years in respect of IT development and maintenance in the Public   Service.      Any amount earmarked for the implementation of e-Government should   reside with a central co-ordinating entity, which in turn will have the   mandate of prioritizing initiatives and attending to their financing.    Centralization of funding is a form of assurance that the e-Government  130  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     initiative is co-ordinated and that a holistic approach is guaranteed.  It is   essential that individual Departments and Government bodies do not go   their own way in the on-line implementation of their own services.        External Financing  Government and non-government financing would need to be explored.     Some initiatives have already been taken in this regard.   Return on Investment  Purely financial return on investments should not be based on direct   income from transactions.  It is unlikely that the system will feasibly allow   for client payment for individual transactions effected, at least not in the   short term.     The basis for assessing return on investment should embrace that of   offsetting set-up costs against savings to be obtained from reductions in   the processing costs, as well as qualitative improvements in service   performance. Improvements in service delivery will result in added value,   and are as important as purely financial considerations.      conclusion    The ICT document has been developed to enable Grenada to become a   knowledge based society. In order to achieve the Vision of the Prime   Minister, we need the tools of the ICT as well as a paradigm shift of the   thinking of all citizens in the Nation. Towards this end, a major emphasis will   be placed on the human resource development activities so as to secure   optimal benefits of these technologies.      We have sought to capture a strategy for the development of ICT for the   small island economy of Grenada.  The approach has been all  131  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha     embracing. Small economies generally lack the skills and resources to   pursue structural development without external assistance.  The next stage   is to go deeper into the definition of specific programmes and projects,   and the development of appropriate budgets and financing strategies.    Given the nature of the technologies this initiative of Grenada will be   designed to accommodate regional requirements of the Caribbean and   the Wider Americas. Some of this will be sought through economies   gained from cooperation within the Caribbean region and in the wider   Americas. Grenada will need to look to various multinational agencies   and bi-laterals to add resources to its own domestic efforts.      We recognize the need to periodically review and update the Strategy   and Action Plan. Experience and better information will guide this process.    We are convinced though that, as we improve on this Strategy and Plan,   Grenada's commitment to the use of ICT as a strategy of development   must be remain unwavering.      132  A STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN FOR GRENADA  Anurag Sinha      INTRODUCTION  KNOWLEDGE-BASED ECONOMY  Executive Summary:  Collaborative Approach  Human Resource Development   Access of Communities to Technology   Project Management     BUILDING AN INFORMATION SOCIETY IN GRENADA  Prime Minister Dr. Keith Mitchell  VISION  MISSION  STRATEGY  Underlying Principles   Vision of Grenada in the Information Age  STRATEGIC THRUSTS             BUILDING THE NATIONAL CAPACITY  INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT     THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE:   DEVELOPING HUMAN RESOURCES EDUCATION AND TRAINING  DEVELOPING THE HUMAN RESOURCE CAPACITY  Teacher Education And Engagement  Engaging Civil Society: Open Door Strategy          Delivering Curricular Change  A Regional Educational And Training Role For Grenada  Education and Training objectives           FINANCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE  DEVELOPMENT OF ICT INDUSTRY  Modernizing Government   INSTITUTIONAL & MANAGERIAL INFRASTRUCTURE   PROMOTING UNIVERSAL UPTAKE OF THE INTERNET   The Dissemination of e-mail on a national scale  The creation of a Grenada National Internet Exchange   National Free Grenadian Internet    DEVELOPING ELECTRONIC COMMERCE  THE IMPACT OF ECOMMERCE ON THE ECONOMY  (i) Information Technology and Communication  (ii) Banking, finance and Business Services  (iii) Manufacturing   (v) Retail   THE IMPACT OF ECOMMERCE ON SOCIETY  (i) Employment  (ii) The advantages to the Consumer    DEVELOPING THE ELECTRONIC COMMERCE SECTOR  A.

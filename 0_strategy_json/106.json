Communication Action Plan (CAP) Malaysia Smart City Framework i. Fulfil the country’s direction to make our cities competitive in line with national and international agendas (e.g. SDGs, NUA, etc.); ii. Provide a collaborative space to stakeholders and strategic partners based on directions/roles in smart city development; iii. Positioning our cities’ standing on par with global smart cities; and iv. Enabling stakeholders to address the urbanisation issues through the smart city initiatives to improve the wellbeing and quality of life. Malaysia Smart City Framework3 Concept of Smart City Globally The concept of smart city typically has three themes: 1. Using information, communication and digital technology to address urban challenges, improve urban management and quality of life, sustainability, efficiency and security. 2. Increase economic and business activities. 3. Continuous public participation and urban innovation. Generally, there is no universal definition for smart city. Although there is no standard for defining smart city, various organisations and researchers have defined it in their own terms. Among the smart city’s definition coined by researchers and organisations across the globe are as follows: A city that monitors and integrates conditions of all of its critical infrastructures, including roads, bridges, tunnels, rails, subways, airports, seaports, communications, water, power, even major buildings, can better optimise its resources, plan its preventive maintenance activities, and monitor security aspects while maximising services to its citizens (Hall, 2000) A city well performing in a forward-looking way in economy, people, governance, mobility, environment, and living, built on the smart combination of endowments and activities of self-decisive, independent and aware citizens (Giffinger et al., 2007) 1 2 SMART CITY FRAMEWORK Malaysia Smart City Framework 4 A city to be smart when investments in human and social capital and traditional (transport) and modern (ICT) communication infrastructure fuel sustainable economic growth and a high quality of life, with a wise management of natural resources, through participatory governance (Caragliu et al., 2009) Information technologies represent the key concept. The vision of an intelligent city is not confined to economic excellence that can be led by information technologies, but an integral part of this vision is its concern for the quality of life for the ordinary citizen (Mahizhnan, 1999) A Smart City is a city well performing in a forward-looking way in six “smart” characteristics, built on the ”smart” combination of endowments and activities of self-decisive, independent and aware citizens. ( 3 4 5 Malaysia Smart City Framework5 Criteria of Smart Cities Comprehensive primary and basic infrastructure should be in place in order to advance smart city agenda. Basic infrastructure in this context refers to the fundamental physical facilities and systems serving a city which includes roads, bridges, tunnels, water supply, sewers, electrical grids and telecommunications. Comprehensive primary and basic infrastructure By using digital technology, smart city initiatives should align around the needs of the city based on identified urban challenges – e.g. government efficiency, sustainability, health and wellness, mobility, economic development, public safety and quality of life Initiatives aligned with the needs of the city Engagement of larger community (local authority, government agencies, businesses, communities, business districts, smart buildings, housing complexes), and individual residents to drive out the innovation and value creation towards co-creating the smart city together Engage broad community of innovators Government at all levels collect valuable data on a wide range of areas. Data sharing is vital for government to government (G2G) and government to citizens (G2C) relationships in the development and operation of a smart city. Sharing non-personal and non-sensitive data whether through open data or inter-governmental platform enables citizens, businesses and government to draw insights on many areas, solve issues and improve efficiency of services Government data sharing Smart city anchor on the concept that everything are connected and intelligent. Shared digital infrastructure will help cities correlate data from multiple sources to generate new value and efficiencies Connected and modern digital infrastructure Support from the leaders of various levels of government helps to develop smart city agenda. Strong political shifts government project priorities to allocates more budget and focusses public attention on smart city initiatives Strong political will The smart city players (policymakers, technologists and innovators) must create sensible policies to proactively seek out public and private collaborators in order to build sustainable and synergistic partnerships. Both policies and partnerships are the catalysts of a smart city. They augment and amplify limited city resources and capabilities, scale faster, while minimising risk Master policies and synergistic partnerships Level 1: Core Criteria Level 2: Catalyst There are 11 criteria that can influence the success of smart city implementation. These criteria are divided into three levels: core, catalyst, and plus point. 01 03 02 04 05 06 07 Malaysia Smart City Framework 6 Initiatives aligned with the needs of the city Empowering communities through open data and relevant solutions in linking communities with local authorities in order to build the community capabilities to reach mutual agreement in decision-making Community empowerment Robust information and data protection are necessary for stakeholders buy-in and support for the smart city agenda. A secure technology infrastructure and information collection system ensures stakeholders confidence in using smart solutions. Information collected must be protected, and used in accordance to its owners’ wishes. Policies, legislation and technology should continually be adapted to achieve a balance of protection, privacy, transparency and utility. Data and information protection Involves the empowerment of vulnerable groups as well as balancing the participation of both genders in any decision making process Gender empowerment and inclusivity of vulnerable group Introduce the concept of green cities in Malaysia, thereby helping to reduce carbon emission in cities and townships as well as provide guidance towards green solutions for their cities and townships Low carbon city and green lifestyle Level 3: Plus Points 08 09 10 11 Malaysia Smart City Framework7 DEFIN ITIO N Cities that use ICT and technological advancement to address urban issues including to improve quality of life, promote economic growth, develop sustainable and safe environment and encourage efficient urban management practices VISION Quality and Smart Living Vision and Definition of Malaysia Smart City Smart City Components and Characteristics 1 2 3 45 6 7 Smart City Components and Characteristics Smart Economy • High productivity • Implementation of innovation in all sectors of the economy • Utilisation of ICT in the economy (i.e. digital economy) • Competitive economy and attractive for Smart People • Low carbon city and green lifestyle • Empowered community • Talented human capital with high digital skill • Community with good moral values • Community with first-class mentality investment • Urban safety and security • High quality of healthcare services Smart Environment • High quality of life in housing areas • Environmental protection • Clean environment • Sustainable resource management • Readiness towards disaster resilient cities Smart Mobility • Inter-governmental data sharing • Seamless and efficient connectivity • Integrated, safe and reliable roads and public transport • Sustainability/green as a core principle Smart Digital Infrastructure • Offers flexible and affordable modes of transport • Comprehensive network coverage • Widespread adoption of high speed internet • Enhanced personal data protection and cybersecurity measures Smart Government • Gender and vulnerable group friendly • Open data and information disclosure • Quality e-government services Smart Living Malaysia Smart City Framework 8 Smart Economy • Low productivity in the current economy • Inadequate creation of high value-added jobs • Low level of readiness to transition to high value- added industries • Weak development of innovative businesses and enterprises 01 Smart Living • Relatively high crime index • Increasing demand for healthcare services 02 Smart Mobility • Traffic congestion • Low rail ridership and high private vehicle ownership • Poor first and last mile connectivity and accessibility • Low service quality and facility provision in public transportation • High carbon footprint 06 Smart Digital Infrastructure • Low internet speed and connectivity • Unsatisfactory indoor and outdoor mobile network coverage • Cybersecurity threats 07 Key Urban Challenges Malaysia Smart City Framework9 KEY URBAN CHALLENGES Smart Environment • Loss of green area • Improper solid waste management • Air pollution • Water pollution • Flash flood • Landslide • High rate of non-revenue water • High usage of non-renewable energy • High carbon footprint 03 Smart People • Low moral intelligence and low social integrity • Low skilled manpower and talented human capital • Lack of harmonious public interactions and community empowerment • Lack of gender-friendly environment and inclusivity of vulnerable groups • Low adaptability to emerging technologies 04 Smart Government • Lack of public information sharing from government • Low quality in e-government services • Lack of information and data sharing in and between government agencies 05 Key Urban Challenges Malaysia Smart City Framework 10 Primary infrastructure shall be upgraded to incorporate smart and IoT elements towards addressing core urban challenges Shared digital infrastructure and internet connectivity shall be enhanced for all cities in Malaysia Quality of human capital shall be enhanced to meet future demands of industry and evolving environment in a smart city Cybersecurity shall be strengthened in smart city context Open data and open government practices shall be promoted Accreditation of smart city standards shall be introduced to set a standard for smart city qualification and recognition Social inclusion, especially gender equality shall be given emphasis in smart city development Sustainable and smart environment practices shall be encouraged in all development of smart city This section recommends policies that can help spur smart city development in Malaysia.

Positioning our cities’ standing on par with global smart cities; and  iv. Enabling stakeholders to address the urbanisation issues through the  smart city initiatives to improve the wellbeing and quality of life.    Malaysia Smart City Framework3  Concept of Smart City Globally The concept of smart city typically has three themes:  1. Using information, communication and digital  technology to address urban challenges,  improve urban management and quality of life,  sustainability, efficiency and security.  2. Increase economic and business activities. 3. Continuous public participation and urban   innovation.  Generally, there is no universal definition for smart  city. Although there is no standard for defining smart  city, various organisations  and researchers have  defined it in their own terms. Among the smart city’s  definition coined by researchers and organisations  across the globe are as follows:  A city that monitors and integrates conditions  of all of its critical infrastructures, including   roads, bridges, tunnels, rails, subways, airports,  seaports, communications, water, power,   even major buildings, can better optimise its  resources, plan its preventive maintenance   activities, and monitor security aspects while  maximising services to its citizens   (Hall, 2000)  A city well performing in a forward-looking  way in economy, people, governance, mobility,   environment, and living, built on the smart  combination of endowments and activities of  self-decisive, independent and aware citizens   (Giffinger et al., 2007)  1  2  SMART CITY FRAMEWORK    Malaysia Smart City Framework 4  A city to be smart when investments in human  and social capital and traditional (transport) and  modern (ICT) communication infrastructure fuel  sustainable economic growth and a high quality   of life, with a wise management of natural  resources, through participatory governance   (Caragliu et al., 2009)  Information technologies represent the key  concept. The vision of an intelligent city is not   confined to economic excellence that can be led  by information technologies, but an integral part   of this vision is its concern for the quality of life  for the ordinary citizen   (Mahizhnan, 1999)  A Smart City is a city well performing  in a forward-looking way in six “smart”   characteristics, built on the ”smart” combination  of endowments and activities of self-decisive,   independent and aware citizens.  (www.smart-cities.eu)  3  4  5    Malaysia Smart City Framework5  Criteria of Smart Cities  Comprehensive primary and basic  infrastructure should be in place in order  to advance smart city agenda. Basic  infrastructure in this context refers to the  fundamental physical facilities and systems  serving a city which includes  roads, bridges,  tunnels, water supply, sewers, electrical grids  and telecommunications.  Comprehensive primary and  basic infrastructure  By using digital technology, smart city initiatives should align around the needs of the  city based on identified urban challenges – e.g. government efficiency, sustainability,  health and wellness, mobility, economic development, public safety and quality of life  Initiatives aligned with the needs of the city  Engagement of larger community  (local authority, government agencies,  businesses, communities, business  districts, smart buildings, housing  complexes), and individual residents  to drive out the innovation and value  creation towards              co-creating  the smart city together  Engage broad community of  innovators   Government at all levels collect  valuable data on a wide range of areas.  Data sharing is vital for government  to government (G2G) and government  to citizens (G2C) relationships in the  development and operation of a  smart city.  Sharing non-personal and  non-sensitive data whether through  open data or inter-governmental  platform enables citizens, businesses  and government to draw insights on  many areas, solve issues and improve  efficiency of services  Government data sharing  Smart city anchor on the concept  that everything are connected and  intelligent. Shared digital infrastructure  will help cities correlate data from  multiple sources to generate new value  and efficiencies  Connected and modern  digital infrastructure  Support from the leaders of various levels  of government helps to develop smart city  agenda. Strong political shifts government  project priorities to allocates more budget  and focusses public attention on smart city  initiatives  Strong political will   The smart city players (policymakers,  technologists and innovators) must create  sensible policies to proactively seek out public  and private collaborators in order to build  sustainable and synergistic partnerships. Both  policies and partnerships are the catalysts of a  smart city. They augment and amplify limited  city resources and capabilities, scale faster,  while minimising risk  Master policies and synergistic  partnerships   Level 1: Core Criteria  Level 2: Catalyst  There are 11 criteria that can influence the success of smart city implementation.  These criteria are divided into three levels: core, catalyst, and plus point.  01  03  02  04 05  06 07    Malaysia Smart City Framework 6  Initiatives aligned with the needs of the city  Empowering communities through open data and relevant solutions in linking  communities with local authorities in order to build the community capabilities to reach  mutual agreement in decision-making  Community empowerment  Robust information and data protection are necessary for stakeholders buy-in and  support for the smart city agenda. A secure technology infrastructure and information  collection system ensures stakeholders confidence in using smart solutions.

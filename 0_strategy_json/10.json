Over the last 18 months we have seen a rapid uptake of digital technologies across our society. It has helped businesses to stay afloat, grow and create new jobs, and it has helped people continue to live their daily lives in new and different ways. As we emerge from the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, a thriving digital economy is critical to Australia’s overall economic recovery. Many countries are investing in their digital futures and we must too if we are to ensure Australian businesses remain globally competitive and that Australia retains its position of influence as a global leader. We are not starting from scratch. Australia has strong foundations to support a growing digital economy. We are early adopters of technology, we are known for our robust regulatory systems and we are a democratic society. The Australian Government is ambitious about Australia’s digital future. Our goal is for Australia to be a world-leading digital economy and society by 2030. What does that look like? In summary, it means thriving high growth industries, all businesses are digital businesses, all Australians have access to digital skills and technology, there is frictionless government service delivery, fit- for-purpose regulation builds trust, and we have integrated data and technologies that make life easier. The Digital Economy Strategy outlines a cohesive roadmap – encompassing initiatives already underway, investments we are making now to take us forward, and areas to be considered to help us identify opportunities into the future. The focus is on getting the foundations right, building capability in emerging technologies and lifting our ambition through digital growth priorities. This is a living strategy. We will continue to track progress towards our 2030 vision and adjust course as we need to, to ensure we are successful in reaching our ambition. 1 2 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY Building a modern and resilient economy to drive Australia’s future prosperity Our Vision For Australia to be a leading digital economy and society by 2030 Delivering the right foundations to grow the digital economy Digital infrastructure Cyber security, safety and trust Skills and inclusion Systems and regulation Trade and international engagement Keeping at the forefront of emerging technologies Artificial Intelligence Internet of Things Data Analytics Blockchain Quantum Computing Lifting our ambition – Digital Growth Priorities Digital SMEs Modern industry sectors Dynamic and emerging tech sector Digital Government and services Key 2021-22 Budget Initiatives • AI investments to drive greater AI adoption across the economy • Emerging Aviation Technology reforms and industry partnerships to enable the use of drones and other aviation technologies • Tax incentives to grow the digital games sector and encourage business investment in digital technologies • Accelerating the rollout of the Consumer Data Right giving Australians greater access to, and control over, their data • Unlocking the value of data with an Australian Data Strategy • Building skills for a modern economy with a Digital Skills Cadetship Trial and Next Generation AI and Emerging Technology Graduates • Enhancing myGov to deliver better services to Australians • Enabling next-wave My Health Record for world-leading healthcare • Expanding the use of the Digital Identity System for secure and simple access to services from government and across the economy • Expansion of Digital Solutions - Australian Small Business Advisory Services to build SME digital capability • Improving internet and mobile connectivity in peri-urban areas • Driving the uptake of e-Invoicing by businesses • Working with industry to secure Australia’s mobile networks (5G and future 6G networks) and data centre infrastructure • Digital Atlas to support emergency response, environmental management, virtual construction design and business investment We’ll be succeeding when 100% of Australian Government services are available online Tertiary advanced digitally skilled graduates increase to more than 15,000 per year Digitally-intensive industries employ more than 10% of the Australian workforce All new businesses are ‘born’ digital All Australian businesses continue to improve cyber security practices 95% of SMEs are using e-Commerce tools 3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY How well our businesses, governments and workforce keep pace with changes in technology and the digital frontier will define Australia’s future prosperity. The potential benefits to the Australian economy through digitalisation have been estimated to be as much as $315 billion over the next decade, with the potential to create up to a quarter of a million new jobs by 2025.1 With other countries investing heavily in their digital futures, our actions over the next 10 years will determine whether we lead or fall behind our global competitors. COVID-19 accelerated the take up of digital technology and highlighted the role it can play to support and enhance business operations across every sector of the economy, improve the delivery of government services and make life easier for Australians. From telehealth and electronic prescriptions to online sales, cloud computing and remote working, COVID-19 has driven a huge leap forward in our digital capability and our appetite for data. Australia must maintain this momentum to secure our future prosperity and protect our national interests. The Digital Economy Strategy sets out how Australia will secure its future as a modern and leading digital economy and society by 2030. It builds on the Australian Government’s existing digital and data initiatives, sets out further actions the Government is taking through the 2021-22 Budget and defines future pathways to 2030. The Strategy recognises that the Government plays an enabling role – Australian businesses and individuals will ultimately determine our success. The Strategy is built around three pillars: 1. Building the foundations to grow the digital economy – The first role of government is to create the policy settings for the digital economy to flourish. This includes investing in digital infrastructure, a skilled workforce, digital inclusion, digital trade agreements, cyber security and safety, and world-class systems and regulation that encourage the adoption and creation of trusted digital technology. 2. Building capability in emerging technologies – The Government recognises the important role of emerging technologies in driving future productivity and prosperity. It is developing its understanding of these technologies so it can build capability and keep pace with changes in technology to position Australia at the forefront of technology development and use. 3. Setting Digital Growth Priorities to lift our ambition – The Government has identified four strategic priorities across the economy where we can partner with the private sector to drive digital growth, jobs and capability. These priorities include lifting the digital capability of small to medium enterprises (SMEs); supporting modern and globally competitive industry sectors in areas like manufacturing, agriculture, mining and construction; building a dynamic and emerging technology sector; and delivering simple and secure digital government services. 4 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 The 2021-22 Budget supports the Digital Economy Strategy through $1.2 billion in strategic investments to unlock the value of data, drive investment and uptake of emerging technologies, build the skills required for a modern economy, and enhance government service delivery. This builds on the $800 million Digital Business Plan, the $1.67 billion Cyber Security Strategy 2020, the $1 billion JobTrainer fund and the $4.5 billion upgrade plan for the NBN. These investments will drive greater productivity, high-quality jobs, and income growth across the economy. But our action and investment won’t stop there. The Digital Economy Strategy sets out the pathways to guide future actions, set ambitious targets and will be continually renewed to realise our vision of being a leading digital economy and society by 2030. 5 AUSTRALIA - A WORLD LEADING MODERN, DIGITAL ECONOMY Australia is part of an increasingly interconnected global economy where the online world is rapidly changing the economic and social landscape. Business models are changing – they can deliver tailored goods and services to be accessed by consumers and business anywhere, anytime. This creates new global markets for innovative Australian businesses, while also introducing greater competition to our domestic economy. Digital technology is also driving a re-evaluation of data, transforming it into an asset that can be used to deliver better outcomes for Australians. COVID-19 changed the way Australians engaged with digital technologies. Estimates suggest that Australia vaulted five years forward in consumer and business digital adoption in around two months.2 Almost 9 in 10 Australian businesses adopted new technologies during COVID-19 to support business continuity while Australians took to online shopping, working from home and social engagement as never seen before.3 During the past 12 months, many Australian businesses introduced new ways of working and leveraged digital technologies to change what they offered and how it was delivered. Businesses that engaged in e-Commerce were the most resilient and adaptable to the shock of the pandemic, and catalysed other businesses to digitise their operations. Australia needs to maintain this momentum to secure our future prosperity. Increased digital uptake will support improvements in living standards, ensure we remain globally competitive and are well positioned to protect our interests. Greater adoption of digital technology in a secure and trusted way will be a key driver of higher productivity, wages and employment growth. Even before COVID-19, Australia had sound foundations that made us well-placed to be a leading digital economy. We are a democratic nation, with high levels of internet connectivity, and Australians are well-educated and keen adopters of new technology. Australia is an attractive place to live and do business and we are leading the world to make sure that digital technology is fair, safe and trusted through initiatives like the world-first Office of the eSafety Commissioner. 6 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 These fundamentals position Australia internationally as a country ready to increase its digitalisation (Figure 1). Among 141 countries assessed for digital readiness using seven indicators, Australia was in the top 20. However, this is a ‘never-ending journey’ and even leading countries face a constant need to develop their digital readiness to remain competitive relative to their peers and keep ahead of up-and-coming nations that desire to take a leading position. Figure 1 Australia compared to the world - digital readiness Activate Accelerate (low) Accelerate (High) Amplify No Data Reproduced with permission: CISCO (2020) Digital Readiness Index A range of sectors and businesses are already leading the world in technology development and adoption. A key objective of the Digital Economy Strategy is for as many Australian businesses as possible to be operating at the digital frontier in their sectors, and we can already see this in some sectors of our economy such as mining, agriculture and health. To achieve this objective, a thriving digital technology sector will be essential for supplying the skills needed to uplift digital capability across the economy. 7 Case study LEADING THE WORLD IN APPLYING AI FOR MINING LAB3 Lumen assisted a large mining company looking to reduce its costs by using SensorMine® to extend tyre life. SensorMine® enables analytics of real-time data that assists with predictive maintenance and improves operational performance. SensorMine® was installed on truck tyres to collect real-time vibration data, allowing the client to monitor and identify harsh terrain. This enabled them to analyse and roll- out alternative routes that will reduce wear and maximise tyre life. Mine sites implementing LAB3’s SensorMine® solution could reduce tyre costs by an estimated 4 per cent. With tyre costs representing one of the top four costs in the sector, the solution has the potential to deliver real industry impact and improve competitiveness. Founded in 2017, LAB3 has grown to more than 150 ICT professionals. LAB3’s growth has been powered by a unique blend of exceptional engineering talent coupled with a thirst for developing dynamic professionals entering the sector. With the help of government grants, graduate programs and industry partnerships, LAB3 has invested over $5 million in its research and development (R&D) activities, creating 30 full time jobs and enabling LAB3's intellectual property and products to be sold in numerous international markets, including the US, Japan, Canada and the EU. 8 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 Other key areas where we are already building our capability include: Skills: The Australian Government has made significant investments in education and training that will help Australians to lift their digital capabilities in the workforce. Digital skills are increasingly part of every job. The Government’s JobTrainer program, Boosting Apprenticeships Commencements, and Job-ready Graduates initiatives are helping to provide Australians with the skills our businesses need. We have also elevated digital skills alongside language, literacy and numeracy for job seekers as a foundational skill. Regulation: To ensure that businesses have the confidence to invest and actively participate in the digital economy, regulation needs to be clear, proportionate and fit-for-purpose. The digital economy also requires a different mindset for regulation. Modernising regulation – whether competition, consumer protection, safety or security – requires smart regulatory design. It must support new economic opportunities while safeguarding the rights of individuals and deliver broader public benefit. Australia has undertaken world-leading investigations to ensure our competition rules remain up to date through the Digital Platforms Inquiry and the related examination of our privacy laws. We are the first country to create and enact a digital trade agreement featuring modernised digital trade rules (with Singapore), and the first to establish an eSafety Commissioner to make sure that Australians are protected online. Australia’s Consumer Data Right is also becoming a world leading consumer-driven data sharing framework that will give Australians more control over their data while boosting innovation and competition. Cyber security: Businesses and people will only embrace digital opportunities to the maximum extent if they are confident that they can trust the technologies and the identity of the people and businesses they interact with online. Cyber security risks have a significant economic cost, estimated to be as much as $29 billion per year. Central to realising the benefits of the digital economy is continuing to position Australia as a world-leader in online safety and trusted technology, which we are doing through the $1.67 billion Cyber Security Strategy 2020. Safety and security does not mean stifling innovation or trading off broader digital opportunities. On the contrary, it can actually open the door for Australia to create new economic opportunities by carving out a market for safe and trusted digital products and services. While we are starting from a solid base, there is significant room to grow. Australia ranks well internationally on many facets of digitalisation (Figure 2), and recent investments will maintain and/or lift our competitiveness. However, there are challenges still to be met, including increasing adoption of technology across the economy, particularly by SMEs; maintaining and growing a skilled workforce; and stimulating greater development and adoption of technologies to meet Australia’s specific needs. The ICT sector is a relatively small share of Australia’s economy, reflecting the relative size of other sectors, such as mining, agriculture and construction. However, we rank highly in the application of digital technologies across the economy, skills, digital government, data and cyber security. In all areas there is potential for further improvements to reach the level of current leaders and significant investment is required to maintain this leadership into the future. 9 Figure 2 Australia compared to similar economies – selected indices Ra nk D ig it al E co no m y In di ca to rs Sk ill s an d Ca pa bi lit ie s D ig it al G ov er nm en t O nl in e Se cu ri ty % o f I CT G ro ss Va lu e Ad de d (O EC D 2 02 1) 4 D ig ita l-i nt en si ve se ct or s’ sh ar e in to ta l em pl oy m en t (O EC D 2 01 6) 5 Sh ar e of s m al l bu si ne ss es m ak in g e co m m er ce - sa le s in th e la st 12 m on th s (O EC D 2 02 0) 6 Sh ar e of In te rn et u se rs w ho h av e pu rc ha se d on lin e in th e la st 1 2 m on th s (O EC D 2 02 0) 7 % te rt ia ry IC T gr ad ua te s (O EC D 2 01 8) 8 Sh ar e of a du lts pr ofi ci en t at p ro bl em - so lv in g in te ch no lo gy -r ic h en vi ro nm en ts (O CE D 2 01 5) 9 In cl us iv e In te rn et In de x - O ve ra ll (E IU 2 02 1) 10 eG ov er nm en t D ev el op m en t (U N 2 02 0) 11 Pu bl ic at io n of O pe n G ov er nm en t D at a (O pe n Kn ow le dg e Fo un da tio n 20 17 )12 G lo ba l Cy be rs ec ur ity In de x – Co un tr y Co m m itm en t Le ve ls (IT U 2 01 8) 13 1 U K U K 2 IS RA EL AU ST RA LI A U SA AU ST RA LI A U SA 3 U K 4 U SA AU ST RA LI A 5 AU ST RA LI A CA N AD A 6 U SA SI N G AP O RE 7 U K CA N AD A AU ST RA LI A U K 8 U K CA N AD A CA N AD A M AL AY SI A 9 AU ST RA LI A U K U SA CA N AD A 10 JA PA N AU ST RA LI A 11 CA N AD A U SA 12 JA PA N SI N G AP O RE 13 U SA 14 U K JA PA N JA PA N 15 16 IS RA EL IS RA EL JA PA N 17 IS RA EL JA PA N AU ST RA LI A 18 JA PA N IS RA EL 19 20 U SA (L ow er ) (3 9) (2 6) 10 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 Australia’s productivity and economic performance needs to increase if we are to sustain and grow our enviable standard of living. As one of the strongest recovering economies coming through COVID-19, Australia can seize the opportunity to be even stronger and more prepared for a digital future. Unlocking the value of digital technologies will drive a stronger economy and support important social, environmental and health outcomes. Continued rapid advancement in technologies like precision healthcare, low emissions technologies and assistive technologies will be crucial in delivering improved living standards to 2030 and beyond. The digital economy is dynamic. Technologies will evolve and new technologies will emerge, potentially as revolutionary as the internet and email were at the end of the 20th century. The Digital Economy Strategy will continue to evolve and adapt to these changing circumstances to ensure Australia remains on track to be a leading digital economy. What is a digital economy and society? A digital economy and society includes all activity reliant on, or significantly enhanced by, the use of digital inputs including: • technologies: the tools and products that help us work and in our everyday lives such as smartphones, robotics and automation. • infrastructure: the systems that keep us connected and online such as mobile and fixed phone and broadband services and location-based technologies (like GPS). • services: the processes, culture and business models that enable a user-centric end- to-end service such as digital platforms, software and cloud storage. • data: the basic element that can be processed or produced by a computer to convey information, including the facts, statistics, instructions, concepts, or other information capable of being communicated, analysed or processed by an individual or by other means including a computer, electronic and automated means. • regulatory frameworks: that oversee the efficient, safe and reliable functioning of the digital economy, including the standards that underpin the operation of digital technologies and infrastructure. • capabilities and skills: the application of skills and knowledge that ensures people are able to use digital technologies and participate in society. All businesses, consumers and government that use and are responsible for these inputs are part of a digital economy and society. Source: Based on OECD (Measurement - Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (oecd.org)) 11 A digital economy is characterised by online transactions and engagement – a virtual, paperless and cashless world. It harnesses a range of technologies, services and business models that improve personalisation through human-centred design and create new opportunities and markets. Ultimately there will be no distinguishing between the digital economy and the economy as a whole. This means that by 2030: • All businesses are digital businesses, using e-Commerce tools and new technologies to improve productivity, innovate and generate high-paying jobs. • All transactions are electronic, integrated and secure - from registration through to employment, reporting, marketing, banking, accounting and security. • Australians have the capabilities to confidently use and create digital technology, forming the skilled workforce needed to help businesses reach and operate at the digital frontier. All Australians will have learning opportunities to gain the foundational maths and digital skills to give them a head start for future careers across the economy, or upskill on a shared understanding of what is required to gain and advance in employment. • Government services will all be easily and safely accessible online, saving people and businesses time and money. Government service delivery will by supported by better public data availability and sharing that is used by a highly-skilled public service to deliver more targeted policy and programs. • Australia leads the world in smart regulation and initiatives to ensure Australia has the safest and most cyber secure environment for Australians living and working online, building trust in the digital economy and opening up new economic opportunities. • Australia leads the world in areas of technology development that harness our strengths and make life easier for Australians in what they use and do every day. New data-driven businesses are being developed to provide more sophisticated and personalised goods and services, and consumers have greater control over the use of their data. • Australia is resilient to economic, health and environmental shocks and threats to our national interests with technology enabling business continuity, community safety and swift recovery. 12 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 Technology is changing how we do business Technology is transforming business models and reducing barriers to growth for small business through affordable access to safe and secure payment systems, forums for collaboration, and reduced technology investment costs through the adoption of multi cloud, hybrid cloud and distributed cloud services. Growth in digital activity has outpaced overall growth in the economy and the affordability of communications services has continued to improve.14 The importance of digital technologies to global commerce is reflected in the prominence of technology businesses in the world’s largest companies. In 2019, the five largest companies by market capitalisation were Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet (Google) and Facebook. Just ten years ago, this list was dominated by industrial companies – General Electric, Exxon, Pfizer and Citi – with Microsoft the only digital business.15 Digital platforms allow digital services to operate at scale and are rapidly becoming the new marketplace by playing the role of intermediary between businesses and consumers. However, change in the short term can be difficult with a range of issues associated with, or exacerbated by, their growth: cybercrime, online safety and privacy, market power and competition, and tax and industrial relations issues. The Australian Government has established strong foundations in addressing these issues to date and will continue to pay close attention to these technology trends in the achievement of our digital ambition. 13 Figure 3 Trends driven by digital technology Trends being driven by digital technology More online interactions between people, businesses and systems that allow for the discovery and sharing of information. Increased data collection and analysis allowing more personalisation and different business models, but also introducing opportunities for misuse. Changing business models including the ability to make money from underused assets (like ride-sharing services) and digital platforms that organise a market rather than just participate. More flexible supply chains that can change how businesses participate and compete in the global marketplace. Evolving tasks and capabilities needs that are changing how we live, play and find and perform work. Country borders becoming less binding for trade increasing the importance of standards and interoperability of systems. Increasing frequency, scale, sophistication and impact of cybercrime ranging from online scams through to large- scale hacking of systems.

Technology and digital platforms are also changing how business and workers connect to perform jobs. Jobs that are more routine in nature like data collection and administration are increasingly being more streamlined or augmented using digital tools. Jobs that require more critical thinking or greater connections, such as accounting and teaching are being enhanced by digital technology, supporting people with these capabilities. Entirely new jobs and businesses have emerged in areas like cyber security and data analytics. The Digital Transformation Expert Panel noted estimates that by 2034, technology will augment 4.5 million Australian workers.24 This is not unusual. There has always been evolution in activity and jobs in the Australian economy, and a need to upskill to keep pace with technological change. History has shown this has led to increased overall employment and access to better jobs with higher wages. It is important to understand how the nature of work is changing, including the role of the ‘gig-based’ economy, so that we can better support Australians with the skills and training to take advantage of these new opportunities. 16 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 The changing nature of jobs in Australia • Almost every job has changes in the tasks it involves. These shifts have been from routine towards more non-routine tasks, which are associated with higher wages and greater job satisfaction. Recent estimates are that 87 per cent of jobs now require digital skills – across every sector and industry. • Employment for occupations requiring the highest level of skills has increased notably as a share of total employment from 15 per cent in the mid-1960s to above 30 per cent today. Analytical, cognitive, social, management and maths skills are most utilised in these roles. Of the new jobs created, most are in high-skilled occupations. • The employment share of lower-skill occupations has fallen gradually since the 1960s but stabilised over the past decade reflecting strong demand for carers and labourers, but digital technologies are also changing these roles. • Job categories with a relatively high share of new job titles and relatively strong growth in Australia include computer software programmers, ICT security specialists, computer network professionals, and education advisers and reviewers. Employment growth in occupations with a high share of new job titles accounted for over 10 per cent of the 4 million or so jobs created over the past 20 years in Australia. • It is estimated that 250,000 new jobs will be created by digitalisation by 2025. Australia had more than 770,000 technology workers in 2019, 6.8 per cent higher than 2018. This was 1.5 times the growth in the number of professional occupations over the same period.

From project management digital tools and apps to augmented reality software to walk through building sites, there’s a digital future quickly moving away from pencil and paper. Large Australian world leading companies such as Lendlease and tech SMEs such as Willow are seeing the growing demand for all contractors and employees to be using digital skills. Willow provides a software platform that creates “digital twins” of built assets. The twin is a virtual replica of any built asset and funnels data from across design, equipment, and live information into an easy-to-use interface. Willow is also working with education providers to ensure that there is industry relevant experience of what will be needed in a world of ‘digital twins’ for building. During the construction of 60 Martin Place Sydney, Willow’s Twin Creator platform tracked and validated all 71,848 digital assets within the building, resulting in 100 per cent completion and compliance a week prior to practical completion. Willow’s team worked directly with Lendlease to ensure all stakeholders understood the digital handover process and were able to simply and efficiently deliver spatial, static and live asset data. The live data is being shared with engineering students to explore trends from across a number of systems including ventilation, lift and access control to identify sustainability initiatives and smarter maintenance practices. This digital twin enables firms like Investa to manage the build with greater efficiency, fix problems before they occur, better manage sustainability and improve the occupant experience. Founded in 2017, Willow has grown to more than 180 staff in Sydney, Melbourne and around the world from New York to Tel Aviv. 18 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 AUSTRALIA’S VISION TO BE A LEADING DIGITAL ECONOMY AND SOCIETY BY 2030 The Government is committed to securing Australia’s future prosperity and the digital economy plays a vital role. Over the next decade, investment in secure digital technology will underpin improvements in jobs, productivity and make Australia’s economy more dynamic and resilient. Success will be measured through delivering positive outcomes to the Australian people and businesses and by providing better government services. Australians By 2030, all Australians will have access to digital skills and technology to ensure inclusivity. The digital capabilities of Australians will keep pace with new and emerging technologies so that we have a workforce that meets the needs of a modern economy. Australians will be able to maintain and build their skills through access to a range of flexible education and training offerings that are industry-relevant and informed. Through more secure cyber practices, Australians will trust and embrace technologies to enrich their lives. People will access and confidently use digital technologies to learn, work and connect, making everyday life and jobs easier and more convenient. Better use of data will allow for more tailored experiences, greater flexibility around how and where people work, greater consumer choice, direct benefit and control over their own data and provide more ways to connect to family and communities. This means Australians will: • increase their digital capabilities, at any age, through access to flexible training and education • be able to access education, health and other essential services seamlessly online from any location over a range of mediums • work confidently in jobs with a range of digital technologies, services and infrastructure • use trusted digital identity to prove their identity - easily and once only - for a range of government and non-government services such as medicare, tax and banking 19 • enjoy simple, smart and personalised interactions with government, with proactive identification of services based on life events • connect to digital platforms and services safely and securely for work and daily life. We’ll be succeeding when: • all Australians have access to high-speed internet services and the ability to use it effectively • 90 per cent of Australians are confident using technology, protecting their privacy and assessing whether information is credible • there is a strong pipeline of graduates with advanced digital skills coming through the education and training ecosystem, meeting demand from businesses • the significant majority of Australians over 18 are registered for myGovID or another trusted digital identity • there are more higher paying digitally skilled jobs in Australia and digitally intensive industries are employing more than 10 per cent of the Australian workforce. Business By 2030, all businesses will be digital businesses. Business, including SMEs and the not-for-profit sector, have the confidence and capacity to invest and participate in the digital economy. A broad uplift in the digital skills of Australians allows more businesses to innovate and improve productivity using the best available technologies. They are generating rewarding and high-paying jobs, improving productivity, and are globally competitive in new markets. Businesses and a vibrant technology sector drive future innovation, value for consumers and underpin growth across critical Australian sectors. A vision for digital business Digital technologies are transforming how we do business across the economy – from small tourism operators, to those delivering in-person services, to large manufacturing firms. To be a leading digital economy and society in 2030, every business needs to become a digital business. 20 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 We need more: • businesses understanding the value of using digital tools and services such as payroll, payments and inventory management systems, online sales platforms and social media • businesses adopting and adapting digital technology to add flexibility, mobility and resilience to their businesses, and save themselves time and money • digitally capable people for the modern workplace, and businesses employing workers with digitally advanced and data skills • workers with mindsets and capabilities to transform businesses and innovate using digital technologies • large businesses supporting the digitalisation of SMEs in their supply chains. • trusted advisors and touchpoints providing high quality advice to support digital adoption, particularly for small and medium businesses • granular data showing the status of digitalisation across businesses, to inform future policies and programs • public awareness and transparency of digital support programs provided by both the private and public sector. We’ll be succeeding when: • all new Australian businesses are “born digital” – new businesses put digital tools, processes and mindset front-and-centre in running their business • 95 per cent of SMEs use e-Commerce and cyber security tools, opening them up to new markets and improved productivity and resilience • businesses can verify the digital identity of customers and suppliers with absolute confidence • highly skilled jobs increase as a proportion of total employment and there is a pipeline of skilled workers to fill these jobs • more Australian sectors are operating at the digital frontier • digital production activities are increasing in value for economic activity (gross value added (GVA)) • the security of critical infrastructure and essential services like water, telecommunications and energy is enhanced • Australian industries adopt, adapt, develop and export safe and secure AI technologies, lifting productivity, boosting competitiveness and creating jobs. 21 Government By 2030, Government service delivery will be frictionless and integrated with technology making life easier. The Australian Government will lead in the efficient, trusted and secure delivery of services to Australians online. Data will be used in the design of policies and services to better target them to the needs of Australians. Business and citizen interaction with government services will be seamless and driven by customer experience. Service delivery will be supported by protections of public data and smart, adaptive and digitally-enabled regulation. Improved ability to use data to understand complex issues allows for better decisions and more targeted programs for all Australians. This will mean: • Government will deliver tailored, personalised and integrated services, proactively identifying eligible services based on life events • high levels of cyber security across Australian Government systems to protect national security and personal information • businesses and individuals only need to report information to government once • providing seamless services to Australians across all levels of government • enhanced regulatory compliance through fit-for-purpose regulation that is administered efficiently, informed by appropriate data and digitally-enabled to minimise the impost on business. We’ll be succeeding when: • all Australian Government services are available securely and easily online • the significant majority of Australians over 18 are registered for myGovID or other trusted digital identity • 95 per cent of businesses are using e-Commerce tools including e-Invoicing and Single Touch Payroll • all new businesses are ‘born digital’ through streamlined business registration • Australia has clear arrangements and agreement in place with other jurisdictions regarding cross border data flows • Australia has a national strategy covering the regulation of the use, movement and custodianship of public and private data. 22 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 Figure 5 Government digital initiatives underway Bringing digital policy together – a whole of government approach There is significant work already occurring across the Australian Government in areas as diverse as privacy reform, cyber security and critical technology, the Consumer Data Right and technologies like 5G and AI.

The Australian Government has been working to position Australia on the path to being a leading digital economy and society. Many of the foundations are in place – building on Australia’s Tech Future, which set out over 150 existing programs and policies supporting opportunities for a digital future and a thriving digital economy. The Government has been making significant investments to ensure that the right infrastructure, skills, systems and regulation are in place to enable economic growth and prosperity. The Digital Business Plan, released in September 2020, is helping businesses to use digital technologies to grow and create jobs as part of the economic recovery. The Digital Business Plan invested in digital infrastructure and skills, removed out-dated regulatory barriers, boosted small business capability, and simplified doing business with government. Activity is underway to progress the Digital Business Plan across government, with major milestones including: • Launch of the first round of the Australian 5G innovation initiative in February 2021 to fund small to large businesses to test and develop 5G uses, applications, services and products. This technology will drive productivity across key industry sectors like agriculture, mining, retail, health, construction and manufacturing. • Amendments to the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 in December 2020 to promote the ongoing rollout of the Consumer Data Right. • Launch of the Regtech Commercialisation Initiative under the Business Research and Innovation Initiative to improve regulatory compliance, reduce regulatory administration, and directly support innovative firms. 26 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 Digital infrastructure To connect businesses and households A key underpinning for the digital economy is to have the infrastructure that makes it possible to access the digital world. By investing in the physical and digital infrastructure that keeps us connected and online, more Australians can participate in the digital economy. Australian Government investment in regional digital infrastructure continues to support digital inclusion by delivering fast, affordable and reliable connectivity. This infrastructure is underpinned by a competitive market and multiple infrastructure owners for fixed wireless, fixed line and mobile infrastructure for which the Government’s regulatory regime supports open competition and facilitates deploying communication facilities as well as the allocation of spectrum. What has already been delivered? The rollout of the NBN is largely complete and has provided ubiquitous access to high speed wholesale broadband to support dozens of retail service providers to deliver the opportunities of the digital age to households and businesses the country. The Government committed in 2020 that the NBN would invest a further $4.5 billion to provide access to higher wholesale speeds to an estimated 75 per cent of homes and businesses on the fixed-line network by 2023. This will make the highest speed tiers available to these premises should they wish even higher broadband speeds. This commitment by NBN Co will also support business innovation, productivity and growth by making business-grade fibre services more affordable and accessible, through the creation of 240 business fibre zones and enabling 90 per cent of Australian businesses to access NBN Co’s ultrafast broadband business services at no upfront cost. Regional areas will benefit including through the upgrade of fibre to the curb services and enabling 950,000 premises in fibre to the node areas to access higher wholesale speeds on demand. The $300 million co-investment fund is aimed at converting more premises from fixed wireless and satellite to fixed-line broadband services and 85 of the business fibre zones are in regional Australia. The Australian Broadband Advisory Council (ABAC) has been established to provide advice on ways to maximise the benefits of high speed networks in key sectors of the economy. The Government’s Universal Service Guarantee provides for all premises in Australia to have access to baseline broadband services, as well as ongoing access to standard telephone services and payphone services. The Government is supporting the roll out of 5G services through the timely availability of spectrum, streamlining deployment arrangements and showcasing trials of 5G use cases to promote business uptake. Spectrum is key to enabling higher capacity for more data to be transmitted for mobile digital communication for robotics and logistics for agtech and mining. The Australian 5G Innovation Initiative is supporting private sector investment in 5G trials to demonstrate the capabilities of 5G and productivity benefits to businesses in Australia. 27 The Regional Connectivity Program is making targeted investment in ‘place-based’ telecommunications infrastructure to deliver economic and social opportunities for regional, rural and remote Australian communities. Funded projects under Round 1 included upgrading 4G services on King Island, expanding fibre broadband to Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory and improving wireless broadband around Roma in Queensland to support agricultural producers to use new technologies to improve productivity. Through projects like these, more communities have access to telehealth, new agtech services, and online educational and business opportunities. The Mobile Black Spot Program is funding new mobile base stations to address mobile coverage issues across regional and remote Australia, with over 925 base stations activated. The Government is continuing to deliver around $4 million a year to maintain community payphones and satellite Wi-Fi telephones in small Indigenous communities which historically have limited, or in some cases no, access to mobile phone or internet services. New investments for the next step change The Government is investing a further $84.8 million to expand the Regional Connectivity Program to continue to improve internet and mobile services in regional and remote Australia that are outside the NBN fixed line footprint. A further $68.5 million has been allocated towards supplementary rounds of the Regional Connectivity Program and the Mobile Black Spot Program to address connectivity issues across Northern Australia. The Peri-Urban Mobile Program will provide $16.4 million to improve network infrastructure in the urban fringe of Australia’s major cities (the peri-urban fringe) that are prone to bushfires. These areas include the Blue Mountains, northern parts of Sydney, the Perth and Adelaide hills districts and the north of Melbourne. Funding will be provided to continue and extend the Measuring Broadband Australia program to assist consumers to select reliable, high-speed fixed-line broadband services. Fixed wireless broadband services will now be included in the program to ensure additional regional and emerging market segments can benefit from this information. 28 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 Next steps to 2030 Timeframe Infrastructure Next 2 years • Ensure 75% of homes that get a fixed line NBN can order gigabit NBN • Support rollout of 5G through the allocation of spectrum in the 26 GHz and 850/900 MHz bands via competitive auction • Complete and assess the Alternative Voice Services Trial to inform future approaches to the Universal Services Guarantee • Showcase successful trials of 5G use cases to promote business uptake and promote business use cases for NBN in key sectors • Address regional Australia’s current and future infrastructure and affordability needs with State and Territory governments • Deliver next Regional Telecommunications Review Next 5 years • Expand high-speed internet and mobile coverage in regional Australia, supported by future government investments, new technologies (such as satellite) and Regional Telecommunications Reviews • Invest in the underlying infrastructure to support next generation telecommunications technologies, such future G technologies By 2030 • All Australians have access to high speed internet services and the ability to use it effectively • Integrated data and technologies are making life easier 29 Cyber security, safety and trust To protect and build confidence Security, safety and trust are essential to the digital economy. Businesses and consumers will only actively engage in the digital economy where they are confident they can trust the technologies, services and platforms, and they know who they are dealing with. What has already been delivered? The Australian Government’s Cyber Security Strategy 2020 lays a strong foundation for Australia’s digital future with a $1.67 billion investment. The Security Legislation Amendment (Critical Infrastructure) Bill will uplift the security and resilience of Australia’s critical infrastructure. Elements of digital trust – such as cyber security, data security and identity assurance – are emerging as valued commodities that can create marketable business opportunities. Through the Cyber Security Best Practice Regulation Task Force the Government is now considering voluntary initiatives and further legislative changes to help Australian businesses across the economy become more resilient to cyber security threats. The Government is also ensuring law enforcement has the powers and capabilities to investigate and disrupt cybercrime, including on the dark web. The Surveillance Legislation Amendment (Identify and Disrupt) Bill introduces new law enforcement powers to combat cyber-enabled crime, including online child exploitation. The Government has also committed $164.9 million to strengthen Australia’s counter cybercrime capability. Increased numbers of outreach officers in the Joint Cyber Security Centres play a key role in strengthening industry partnerships. The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) is Australia’s lead operational cyber security agency that identifies cyber threats, provides technical cyber security advice and guidance, and builds partnerships with critical infrastructure, industry and government to protect Australians. The ACSC will continue to provide Australians and businesses with advice through the one-stop-shop cyber.gov.au. AustCyber, Australia’s Cyber Security Growth Network, and the Cyber Security Skills Partnership Innovation Fund are supporting the pipeline of skilled cyber security professionals and supporting cyber security solutions from business set-up to export. The Cyber Security Cooperative Research Centre is helping governments and key stakeholders drive innovative research to build Australia’s cyber security capacity and capability. To support SME use of digital technologies, the Cyber Security Business Connect and Protect program provided funding to trusted business advisers to work with SMEs and lift their cyber security capability for the benefit of themselves and their customers. Further, the Cyber Security Assessment Tool delivered by the Government in March 2021 provides businesses with an online tool to regularly self-assess their cyber security maturity and receive practical actionable advice from the ACSC to improve their cyber security. 30 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 Australia has led the world by being first to establish a government agency committed to keeping its citizens safer online. Australia’s eSafety Commissioner has powers relating to cyberbullying, image-based abuse, and illegal and harmful online content. The significant increase in internet use as a result of COVID-19 also led to an increased demand for support to respond to negative online experiences – and additional funding was provided to eSafety to deliver on this. The new Online Safety Act will ensure better protections for all Australians through enhanced complaints and removal schemes for child cyberbullying, image-based abuse and harmful online content. It will also include a new adult cyber-abuse scheme and a new power to block access to sites containing abhorrent violent material and stronger expectations and mandatory transparency reporting for industry. As Australians spend more of their time online, and new technologies emerge, more personal information about individuals is being captured and processed. The review of the Privacy Act 1988 is considering whether the Act remains fit-for-purpose. Outcomes of this review will also build on Social Media reforms that increase the maximum civil penalties under the Privacy Act 1988 and develop a binding privacy code to apply to social media and other online platforms that trade in personal information. New investments for the next step change The Australian Government is investing $31.7 million to pre-emptively identify and address the range of security risks presented by the 5G and 6G technology that will underpin Australia’s digital future. The Government will establish ‘Secure G’ Connectivity Test Lab in partnership with the private sector to trial innovative approaches to network security and data protections. Looking ahead to the next generation of communications technology, 6G security research and development will assist in identifying potential security risks and enable the Government to take proactive measures to secure it. A National Data Security Action Plan will provide Government with a whole-of-economy approach to data security uplift, and set the roadmap for the development of clear data security standards for the entire digital economy. Consistent data security standards and controls will ensure that the Government is able to deliver digital services underpinned by security and backed by public trust. Additional funding of $43.8 million will be provided to expand the Cyber Security Skills Partnership Innovation Fund for industry and education providers to deliver more projects that meet local requirements to quickly improve the quality and quantity of cyber security professionals in Australia. 31 The Australian Government will pilot three Cyber Hubs to enable leading agencies such as Defence, Home Affairs and Services Australia to provide cyber services for those agencies that cannot match their breadth and depth of skills. This will uplift the protection of the government services and data that Australians and businesses rely on, and make it harder for malicious actors and cyber criminals. Next steps to 2030 Timeframe Cyber security, safety and trust Next 2 years • Strengthening Australia’s cyber security incentives and regulations through the Cyber Security Best Practice Regulation Task Force and feedback from industry • Improve protections for Australian’s privacy online and transparency of data handling practices through the review of the Privacy Act 1988 • Deliver a review and updates to the cyber security related occupations as coded in the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations Next 5 years • Develop a cyber security skills shortage forecasting methodology and model with reporting and ongoing data collection by 2024 to more effectively target initiatives that address cyber security skills demand • Privacy settings in place that empower consumers, protect their data and serve the Australian economy • A National Data Security Action Plan makes public and private data more secure through the introduction of standards and policies as part of a National Data Security Action Plan By 2030 • Strengthened cyber security and data settings supports Australian businesses and Australians to improve cyber security practices 32 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 Skills and inclusion To build digital capabilities for the future workforce Increasing the digital capabilities of all Australians will be key to ensure we can all actively participate in the digital economy. All jobs are increasingly requiring some level of digital skills. New and emerging technologies are also driving a need for more advanced digital capabilities across industries. The Digital Transformation Expert Panel emphasised the value of lifelong learning for skills and workforce development, business operations and for individuals. This requires high quality relevant education and training, and strong partnerships between governments, employers and education and training providers. Australia’s prosperity relies on inclusion. This means all Australians being able to afford, access and benefit from digital technology, tailored to their needs. Australians should feel well-equipped to use digital technology confidently, safely and securely. A digitally inclusive and capable Australia will enhance workforce participation, community engagement and access to social assistance. What has already been delivered? The Government’s significant investments in education, skills and training, especially during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, prioritised the areas most in demand for employers. In the school system, young people are learning to use design thinking and be innovative developers of digital solutions with the Australian Curriculum. Foundation to Year 10 Digital Technologies Curriculum alongside the ICT General Capability involves students learning to make the most of the digital technologies available to them, adapting to new ways of doing tasks in a digital environment. The Australian Curriculum is being reviewed in 2021 to ensure a focus on essential content or core concepts, that the curriculum is fit-for-purpose and is preparing Australian students for the workplaces of the 21st century. There have also been some extraordinary partnerships between business and education and training institutions, with the Government’s support, to ensure that all Australians, have access to opportunities to upskill their digital capabilities in areas that align with job opportunities and business needs. Eligible Australians are supported to develop their foundational digital literacy through the Foundation Skills For Your Future program, building their capacity for workforce participation and further education and training. 33 Digital literacy and ability are being considered as part of an Indigenous Digital Inclusion Plan currently being developed. The Plan will consider Government investments to date to improve Indigenous digital inclusion and identify priorities for further work. It will also have a focus on access and affordability. JobTrainer created a $1 billion fund shared with the states and territories to create 300,000 new training places. Combined with the 30,000 extra university places in 2021 and funding for higher education short courses, on top of the considerable existing investment in skills and higher education, Australians have access to learning options to suit their circumstances and future job opportunities. Recognising the ever increasing importance of digital capabilities for every job into the future, many of the Government’s recent education and training measures have a focus on growing digital skills including: • The Job Ready Graduates Package, designed to encourage students to enrol in areas of national priority, such as IT, is reducing the maximum student contributions from $9,698 to $7,950. In addition, higher education providers will receive an increase in funding per student from $11,015 to $13,250 to further encourage providers to offer courses in IT. • The Digital Skills Organisation is working closely with digital employers to strengthen training to meet emerging digital skills needs. Its initial focus is testing approaches to bring together employers and training providers to rapidly train individuals for digital roles, with the first project focusing on training 100 data analysts. • The Australian Industry and Skills Committee has developed new training products in response to emerging skills needs across industry sectors, including developing cross-sector units and skills sets to address common skills needs including in the areas of big data and cyber security. • Funding for several programs testing advanced apprenticeship-style courses, including in IT, which feature a new model of collaboration in higher education delivery between universities, industry and government. The Industry 4.0 Advanced Apprenticeship Pilot targets SMEs in key manufacturing ‘pipeline’ industries, delivering training to employees in advanced manufacturing technologies. The Women in STEM Cadetships and Advanced Apprenticeships Program supports part time study for female employees looking to upskill in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields or move into a STEM career. Australia has an exceptionally capable and responsive higher education sector which responded to COVID-19 by developing over four hundred subsidised six-month higher education short courses, which were required to be delivered online. In the additional short courses being funded in 2021, 152 Information Technology short courses will be offered, making up around 18 per cent of approved courses. 34 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 Under the Australian Government’s Job-ready Graduates reforms, $900 million has been committed over 4 years to the National Priorities and Industry Linkage Fund (NPILF) which has been established to support universities engage with industry and create job-ready graduates. A key priority for the NPILF is to increase the number of STEM-skilled graduates and improve their employment outcomes. This will help build the STEM skills necessary for Australia’s future workforce, including in digital technologies, alongside the Advancing Women in Stem Strategy and Action Plan 2020. As part of the Government’s JobMaker Plan, the Global Business and Talent Attraction Taskforce was established to help generate quality jobs for Australians. Bringing businesses and exceptional individuals to Australia helps local industry and partners reap the benefits of their ideas, capital, talent and networks to build clusters of excellence in priority sectors, conduct cutting-edge research and development, and fill gaps in supply chains. This work complements the Global Talent Visa Program, that supports highly skilled professionals to work and live permanently in Australia. Australia is after the brightest and best global talent to work in identified future-focused sectors including agtech, fintech, health and defence. The visa program is designed to help grow our digital economy and create opportunities for Australians by transferring skills, promoting innovation, and creating jobs. 35 Case study FROM LITTLE SKILLS COMES BIG THINGS Funded under the Digital Business Plan, Skill Finder launched in October 2020 as a world-first - and free - micro skill marketplace available to all Australians. The platform provides an opportunity for “every Australian to up-level their with transferable andknowledge useful micro-skills, so they are prepared for the digital world and workforce. Adobe and Amazon Web Services (AWS) provide cloud services to support the website whilst many global tech leaders including Atlassian, Canva, MYOB, Xero, Adobe, AWS, Google, IBM, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Salesforce and Twitter have indexed courses on the site. Skill Finder now indexes 15 Be Connected courses, with a view to working together to further promote the Be Connected program amongst their users. To add to its reach, the Office of the eSafety Commissioner has worked with Skill Finder to ensure that Be Connected is included in these training resources. Be Connected was designed for older Australians to build their digital skills, but can be used more widely help build the digital literacy baseline for all Australians, giving them the confidence to undertake more complex digital courses or use these new skills to enter the workforce. New investments for the next step change Delivering on education and training requires strong partnerships and this is a key focus of the next phase of investment in digital skills. The Digital Skills Cadetship Trial will be designed and delivered with industry partners to provide innovative trials of skilling people to fill in-demand digital jobs. The Government is investing $10.7 million over three years to increase the number of Australians with digital skills through a four-to-six month cadetship comprising formal training with on-the-job experience provided by host employers. 36 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 The next National Skills Agreement being developed with the States and Territories will ensure we continue to deliver the skills for the future workforce, together helping businesses develop the skills they need to engage in the digital economy. Priority reforms under the Heads of Agreement for Skills Reform include all government working together to strengthen industry engagement in training, VET qualifications and the quality of training. As part of the Commonwealth’s commitment to providing stronger support for foundation skills under the Heads of Agreement for Skills Reform, the Government is expanding and uncapping the Skills for Education and Employment program, and providing an additional $4 million over two years to support projects that better incorporate digital skills training for job seekers. Under the extension and expansion of the JobTrainer Fund, 10,000 places will be allocated to digital skills courses. To ensure that Australia will also meet its more advanced technology needs, the Government is investing a further $22.6 million to establish the Next Generation Emerging Technology Graduates Program and $24.7 million for the Next Generation AI Graduates over the next six years. These will provide more than 400 competitive national scholarships in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, automation, cyber security, quantum computing, blockchain and data in priority areas identified through the National Manufacturing Priority Roadmaps. Next steps to 2030 Timeframe Skills and inclusion Next 2 years • Delivering the National Skills Agreement with State and Territory Governments • Deliver Indigenous Digital Inclusion Plan • Implementing the Advancing Women in STEM Action Plan 2020 • Work with stakeholders including State and Territory governments to: • ensure the Australian Curriculum embeds digital literacy as an essential capability demonstrated through the learning areas; and • implement targeted training courses/microcredentials to build digital skills, and encourage workers to reskill Next 5 years • Increase the number of people undertaking digital skill training (higher education/ VET/microcredentials) By 2030 • All Australians have access to digital skills • Tertiary advanced digital skills graduates will increase to more than 15,000 per year • 90% of Australians are confident using digital technology, protecting their privacy and assessing whether information is credible 37 Systems and regulation To implement smart and modern settings to drive digitalisation Modern regulatory settings and systems are the building blocks that will maximise productivity and enable people, businesses and government to realise the full benefits of the digital economy. Rules and laws should provide security and certainty while remaining fit-for-purpose and agile as technology develops. By investing in enabling systems and digital service delivery, the Government can deliver better outcomes for all and drive broader digital transformation. What has already been delivered? Enabling systems The Australian Government has taken a world-leading position on the regulation and settings needed for an accelerating digital economy. This is exemplified by the News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code, which was a recommendation from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (ACCC) Digital Platforms Inquiry (DPI). The DPI also resulted in new six-monthly reporting by the ACCC on emerging competition issues in the markets for the supply of digital platform services, and the commencement of a review of the Privacy Act 1988. The Government is acting to ensure that competition settings and regulation is fit-for-purpose in the digital age. Over the next decade, the Government will also consider issues relating to emerging digital industries, like the gig economy, as these industries grow in relevance and play a significant role in Australia’s digital economy. We need to ensure that the regulatory framework for these industries remain fit-for-purpose and allow digital industries to maximise their productivity and utility to Australians. Australia’s Consumer Data Right (CDR) will be a game changer. The CDR is designed to give consumers greater access to and control over their data that is held by private companies. It improves consumers’ ability to compare and switch between products and services, and encourages competition between service providers, leading not only to better prices and service quality for customers but also more innovative products and services. The banking sector is the first to be transformed by CDR, and the energy sector is next. In 2021 telecommunications will be assessed, with a rolling program to assess and designate a new sector each year. The Digital Business Plan and Deregulation Agenda continue to remove outdated and burdensome regulation, and support the greater uptake of digital technology while retaining essential safe-guards. This has enabled companies to hold virtual meetings and execute documents electronically, and reforming the regulation of stored-value facilities to drive competition and innovation. The Government’s renewed Deregulation Agenda supports leadership and stewardship of fit-for-purpose regulation with a focus on lifting regulator performance across government to drive economic recovery and growth. 38 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 It is estimated that in excess of 1.2 billion invoices are exchanged annually in Australia, and around 90 per cent of business invoice processing is still labour-based. e-Invoicing is the digital exchange of invoices directly between the accounting systems of a buyer and a supplier that can deliver around $20 of savings every time an e-Invoice replaces a traditional invoice. The Australian Government has committed to using e-Invoicing by its agencies by 1 July 2022. It will also pay all e-Invoices under $1 million within 5 business days, improving business cash flow. The review of the Australian payments system is also ensuring that the regulatory architecture can support, accommodate and respond to advances in payments technology. Continued innovation of this key economic infrastructure will be central to lowering transaction costs, improving safety and reducing the cost to doing business. A further $419.9 million investment was delivered in the Digital Business Plan to fully implement the Modernising Business Registers program. This will allow businesses to quickly view, update and maintain their business registry data in one location instead of the more than 30 current registries. 39 Case study MAKING LIFE EASIER FOR SMALL BUSINESS Single Touch Payroll (STP) provides employers and tax practitioners with digital end-to-end services to report payroll and superannuation information, reducing compliance costs for business and allowing pre-filling of individuals’ income tax returns and business activity statements. More than 99 per cent of large employers and 85 per cent of small employers are reporting through STP. This digitisation has also improved government service delivery, most recently enabling the rapid deployment of JobKeeper, which was life-saving support for so many businesses and workers during COVID-19. Strategium is a small and rapidly growing management consultancy business based in Canberra. The transition to using STP was surprisingly easy and did not require their bookkeeper or accountant. STP has delivered benefits to Strategium including easier compliance easier and a better understanding of where the money is flowing. 40 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 The Australian tax system provides a number of incentives to support businesses digitise, adopt new technologies and innovate. Temporary full expensing allows eligible businesses to immediately deduct the business portion of the cost of an asset in the year it is first used or installed, encouraging investment to digitise. The Venture Capital Limited Partnerships and Early-Stage Venture Capital Limited Partnerships incentives offer tax benefits to stimulate venture capital investment. The Research and Development Tax Incentive (R&DTI) provides businesses with a tax offset for eligible R&D expenditure incurred in developing new or improved products, processes and services that will help make Australia more competitive and create more jobs in the long-term. As part of the economic recovery plan, the Government invested a further $2 billion through the R&DTI in the 2020-21 Budget to support business R&D investment in Australia. Government services The Australian Government is making investments in foundations such as digital identity and Single Touch Payroll that are transforming the services relied on by Australians and businesses to provide seamless service delivery. The Digital Identity system will enable more secure and convenient engagement with government services, and in future, the private sector. The Government invested a further $256.6 million in the Digital Identity system in the 2020-21 Budget. Digital identity is already being used by more than 2.3 million Australians and 1.2 million businesses to access over 75 government services. Launched in July 2018, the Online Employment Services Trial was rapidly expanded in April 2020 to support the large cohort of jobseekers accessing Government support during the COVID-19 pandemic. In excess of 1.4 million job seekers have been initially referred through the Online Employment Services gateway, with more than 400,000 job-ready job seekers digitally self-managing their way back to employment without the assistance of employment services providers. To support the delivery of the New Employment Services Model from July 2022, the Government has invested $295.9 million over four years in Tranche 1 to deliver a new Digital Employment Services Platform. This investment will generate considerable benefits for all users, including jobseekers, employers and employment services providers. It will improve matching, pre-screening and validation processes for jobseekers, assist employers and providers in maximising employment outcomes. Future tranches will build on the foundations from the new digital platform, maturing the capabilities and further linking with other government programs. 41 The Office of the National Data Commissioner is streamlining public sector data sharing to promote greater use that drives innovation and economic, social and environmental benefits. The Data Availability and Transparency Bill will set standards for safe and transparent sharing of public sector data. New investments for the next step change Accelerating e-Invoicing adoption across the economy is an ongoing priority for the Government. The Government will progress a range of measures to enhance e-Invoicing’s value for businesses and increase adoption. These include working to more closely link e-Invoicing to payments to help businesses get paid faster, a series of education activities to raise business awareness, and e-Invoicing pilots across key supply chains to test and drive adoption. The Government will also progress further consultation on regulatory and non-regulatory options to accelerate e-Invoicing adoption, and continue work with states and territories to boost adoption across Australia’s public sector. The Government has committed a further $111.3 million to strengthen and expand the world-leading Consumer Data Right (CDR across the economy. It will continue to establish the foundations of the data economy, creating new opportunities for Australian consumers and data-driven businesses. This measure includes funding to accelerate the rollout of CDR, including continued implementation in the banking and energy sectors and undertaking a strategic assessment to deliver a roadmap for economy wide rollout. It will also expand Australia’s international influence to establish an interoperable and rules-based approach to international consumer data portability and sharing frameworks. Customers empowered by CDR to view their data and use it to transact easily, more securely and efficiently, will drive increased competition and data-driven innovation in Australian businesses. They will benefit from improved services and product offerings while saving time and money. The Government will promote Australia as an international leader in consumer data portability, supporting our fintech exports and improving access by our consumers and businesses to data driven services. The Government is committing to deliver an Australian Data Strategy by late 2021 that will set out how the Government will enhance effective, safe and secure data use from 2021 to 2025. The Data Strategy will explore how to enable a data-driven economy through improved economy-wide data sharing while embedding trust and security in data use. It will also outline existing data initiatives across Government and opportunities to harmonise and streamline approaches to minimise burden on stakeholders. For example, it will look to identify how the CDR and supporting institutions could be further leveraged to build a data-driven economy. Funding of $16.5 million for a pilot program that will develop data inventories for 20 per cent of Australian Government agencies will enhance the management of government data assets. 42 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 The Digital Atlas will be a collaborative, dynamic and secure platform, based on a modernised and updated NationalMap, which delivers advanced location data analytics and a rich data environment compiled from accurate, authoritative and ready-to-use data sources covering people, the economy, employment, infrastructure, health, land and the environment. It will present data against Australia’s geography, allowing governments and other organisations to better understand and respond to issues, including national disasters and infrastructure planning. Figure 6 NationalMap showing mineral exploration overlaid with power generation capacity under the National Electricity Market 43 The Australian Government is also investing in modernising regulation to reduce the burden and improve regulatory outcomes for business. Through the $120 million Deregulation Agenda, the Government is investing in technology to reduce regulatory impacts on business. This includes streamlining digital services in the health sector to reduce the regulatory burden on around 400 companies that currently lodge 2,000 applications annually in the pharmaceutical, medical technology services and medical software industries. In addition, improved electronic monitoring systems will assist around 610 fishing businesses to more efficiently meet their regulatory requirements and will also help an estimated 1,220 commercial fishing businesses meet data provision requirements to enable more informed decision making. Through the Modernising Business Communications work, the Government has committed to modernising laws within the Treasury portfolio so they are technology neutral. This will enable easier communication between businesses, individuals and regulators. The Deregulation Agenda will also make it easier for business to employ Australians, utilising digital solutions to assist small business to comply with modern awards. The Trusted Digital Identity Framework sets out the rules for the national digital identity scheme. This Framework will make it easier and safer for people to access online services and provide additional protections against identity crime, which is estimated to cost the economy over $3.1 billion a year. The Government will progress legislation to enable the rollout of the Framework to the private sector and other governments. The legislation will embed privacy, security and fraud prevention mechanisms to build trust and confidence by those who choose to participate. 44 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 Next steps to 2030 Timeframe Systems and regulation Next 2 years • The ACCC to release six monthly reports on competition and consumer issues relating to digital platforms to 2025 • Review of the News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code • Progress reforms to media laws towards an end state of a platform-and-technology neutral regulatory framework • Office of the National Data Commissioner to build inventories of data assets with Australian Government agencies • Improve data servicing and sharing between Australian Government agencies and trusted partners • National Disability Data asset final report on pilot outcomes, including 5 test cases, is delivered • Modernising Business Registers: companies release (Companies Register), including linking to director ID and significant data migration • Continued deep dives on key regulatory issues as part of the Deregulation Agenda • Regulator Performance Guide is implemented and Ministers issue Statements of Expectations for regulators • Implementation of CDR in energy sector and assessment of telecommunications sector.

Promoting Australia as a safe and stable place to do business will encourage investment and further digital trade agreements will open opportunities for Australian businesses. What has already been delivered? In our region, we have negotiated high quality rules to support digital trade through the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and through bilateral free trade agreements. In 2020, the Australian Government signed a ground-breaking Digital Economy Agreement with Singapore. The agreement features modern, upgraded rules to free up data flows and increase compatibility for online trade. It sets the conditions for Australian businesses and consumers to make the most of the digital economy. Australia is engaging bilaterally and multilaterally to lead and influence the setting of norms, standards and regulations for digital technologies (Figure 7). International technology standards support Australian and global business productivity by facilitating innovation and establishing a common language for new digital concepts and technologies. Without harmonised international standards Australian businesses may face higher costs of doing business if they need to comply with different standards for different markets. 46 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 Figure 7 Australia’s international engagement on digital technology Multilateral G7 Digital and Technology Taskforce & Working Group WTO Joint Statement Initiative on E-commerce Pacific Islands Forum G20 Digital Economy Taskforce Quad Critical and Emerging Technology Working Group APEC’s Digital Economy Steering Group OECD Committee on Digital Economy Policy Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence ASEAN-Australia Cyber Policy Dialogue East Asia Summit APEC’s Cebu Action Plan Other fora Global Forum on Cyber Expertise Future Tech Forum World Economic Forum Bilateral Aust-US Frontier Tech Dialogue Japan Cyber Policy Dialogue India Cyber and Critical Tech Partnership Malaysia-Australia Tech Exchange MoU UK FinTech Bridge Indonesia Cyber MoU and Dialogue Australia-Singapore Digital Economy Agreement Australia-US Digital Trade Agreement Standards International Standards Organisation (ISO) International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) International Telecommunications Union ASEAN-Australian Digital Standards Cooperation Initiative In 2020 the Australian Government allocated $5.9 million over three years to step up our leadership, influence and uptake of international standards. Funding will include support to Australian peak standards and conformance bodies and a dedicated boost to digital, critical technology and critical minerals standards work. Having more Australian experts participate in more international standards committees will build our capability to apply international standards and help businesses to use them. It will also help Australian businesses capture new markets opportunities and maintain their global competitiveness. In 2021, Australia’s Services Exports Action Plan was announced to promote an internationally competitive services sector that boosts Australian exports. This Plan sets out immediate actions to help Australia’s economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and long-term goals for strengthening the competitiveness of Australian service suppliers into the future, including through data flows, international rules and developing world-class skills and talent. The Digital Business Plan provided measures to support the growth of the Australian fintech sector, including options to drive fintech adoption and expand the FinTech Bridge. 47 Case study TAKING AUSTRALIAN INNOVATION TO THE WORLD Melbourne-based Zed Technologies shows how Australian digital health ideas can accelerate overseas growth. With a cloud-based service, the company has partnered with an Indonesian med-tech company for its cloud-based service to give patients access to their X-rays, MRIs, scans and ultrasounds through an app. Sharing medical images using the cloud isn’t new, but what makes Zed Technologies unique is its focus on patients. The digital technology means patients don’t need to carry physical scans around with them. It also means that specialists anywhere in the world can examine a scan and provide a remote diagnosis. And with a trusted local partner, Zed Technologies is powering fastest growing medical-technology markets in Southeast Asia. With a world-leading product, the company has been quick to grow overseas. From its genesis in 2012, Zed has scaled up, with Australian Government support, into new markets starting with Singapore, then Indonesia, and now into Europe. The company has grown over 30 per cent year on year and now delivers over 9 million scans a year to doctors and 3.5 million scans to patients.  into one of the 48 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 Growing, protecting and promoting Australia’s critical and emerging technologies Australia’s international engagement seeks to shape the design, development and use of secure, resilient and trusted technology in line with Australia’s values and interests. Our engagement is guided by core principles and values of human rights, rules of law, fairness, open competition, security, transparency, respect and integrity. Australia’s Ambassador for Cyber Affairs and Critical Technology, guided by Australia’s International Cyber and Critical Tech Engagement Strategy, has an important role in ensuring Australia benefits from the growth of a connected, prosperous and resilient Indo-Pacific enabled by safe and secure critical technologies. As an important participant in global economic, scientific and technology ecosystems, Australia will work with other nations to shape the ecosystems in a way that not only enhances our security and prosperity, but supports positive security outcomes for all nations. Critical and emerging technologies have the capacity to significantly enhance Australia’s national interests. Critical technologies are often enabled by and reliant on digital networks and can include technologies (or applications of technologies) such as Smart Cities, AI, 5G and next generation communications, IoT, quantum computing and synthetic biology. To assist organisations – including governments and businesses of all sizes – in making decisions about trusted suppliers and the transparency of their own products, the Australian Government is also developing Critical Technology Supply Chain Principles in consultation with industry. The Principles fall under the three pillars of transparency, security-by-design, and autonomy and integrity. In 2019 the Australian Government released a set of voluntary AI Ethics Principles to encourage Australian organisations using AI systems to adopt and develop this technology in a transparent and safe way. Australia is one of 42 countries that have signed up to the OECD Principles on AI that sets out international standards to ensure these systems are designed to be robust, fair and trustworthy. Australia also committed to the G20’s Human Centred AI Principles, released as part of the Ministerial Statement on Trade and Digital Economy in 2019. Our participation in the Global Partnership on AI is also fostering international collaboration on the responsible use and development of AI. 49 Next steps to 2030 Timeframe Trade and international engagement Next 2 years • Engaging with Singapore on establishment of a fintech bridge which would include enhanced regulatory cooperation, support for fintech firms, and safe and secure data sharing • Implementing the AI Ethics framework for business and government • Implementing the 2021 International Cyber and Critical Technology Strategy • Critical Technology Supply Chain Principles incorporated into Australian Government decision making practices, as an exemplar for international partners and industry to securely develop and adopt critical technologies • The Quad Critical and Emerging Technology Working Group will continue work to ensure that critical and emerging technology is governed and operates according to shared interests and values Next 5 years • Working with trade partners to support implementation of international commitments on digital trade, including in South East Asia • Negotiating high quality digital trade rules building on existing free trade agreements • Co-chairing the WTO Joint Statement Initiative on E-commerce and negotiating the first set of global digital trade rules • Progressive build and implementation of Regional Data Hub By 2030 • Australia’s engagement in digital standards and international standard setting forums promotes our democratic values and technology that is secure-by-design 50 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES ARE OPENING NEW OPPORTUNITIES Digital technologies and new business models will boost productivity, create jobs, solve the real-world problems of today and grow the businesses and sectors of tomorrow. We are using technology such as drones, robotics, 3D printing and blockchain now. By 2030 we would expect to see breakthroughs in emerging technologies that can transform the Australian economy. These are likely to include artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, nanotechnology, cognitive science, energy capture and storage, more connected devices through increased penetration of the Internet of Things (IoT), and the further advancement of existing technologies with undeveloped potential. In addition, new technological fields may result from the convergence of different technologies. For example, where voice, data, video are brought together to share resources and interact. Hyperautomation will combine AI, robotic process automation, machine learning and other automation technologies to create interoperable systems of automation. The increase in end- to-end automation will drive efficiency, streamline processes and prioritise higher value work.  Understanding how these technologies are developing and the potential applications and risks that need to be managed, is essential to delivering the right policy and regulatory settings to support uptake across the economy. The Government, through organisations like Data61 and the Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, is building its capability to assess technology developments that keep Australia at the digital frontier. By better understanding the technologies of today and preparing for the technologies of the future, Australia is well placed to embrace new opportunities. 51 52 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 KEY TECHNOLOGIES SHAPING AUSTRALIA’S FUTURE TO 2030 Artificial Intelligence: a collection of technologies that can be used to solve problems autonomously and perform tasks to achieve defined objectives, in some cases without the explicit guidance from a human being. Internet of Things: the network of physical objects that are able to connect to the Internet. Data Analytics: the analysis of raw datasets using specialised computers and software. Blockchain: a software solution that allows data to be verified and stored in a distributed network, thereby reducing single points of failure, mitigating fraud, and enabling the automated execution of agreements via smart contracts. Quantum Computing: storing and processing information by manipulating the behaviour of individual atoms, ions, electrons or photons. 53 Case studies AUSTRALIAN BUSINESSES AT THE DIGITAL FRONTIER Cybersecurity using quantum Canberra-headquartered QuintessenceLabs uses quantum physics to develop a suite of data security tools that strongly protect systems from cyber-crime. These tools are in use by major financial corporations, cloud providers, governments and defence agencies, across the globe, and include the world’s fastest random number generator, advanced encryption key management and quantum key distribution to strengthen enterprise-scale encryption. QuintessenceLabs is also working on using quantum-encrypted communications in space. In 2018, QuintessenceLabs was selected by the World Economic Forum as a Technology Pioneer, for its work in quantum-based cybersecurity solutions. Leveraging blockchain for contracts Piper Alderman has become the first Australian legal firm to execute a blockchain-based payment guarantee in a commercial contract, and may be the first law firm in the world to do it. Piper Alderman partnered up with Lygon, a blockchain business which includes CBA, Westpac, and ANZ as shareholders. Using Lygon fast tracks the bank guarantee issue, redemption and return process, cutting costly paper trails and effectively eliminating the risk of fraud. In 2018, Piper Alderman became one of the first major law firms to accept digital currencies for settlements of bills, leading the way in alternative payments for clients in the growing blockchain space. 54 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 What has already been delivered? New infrastructure, like 5G and further investment in the NBN, will provide significantly faster data transmission speeds and the increased development of IoT. The Australian 5G innovation initiative will fund small to large businesses to test and develop 5G uses, applications, services and products. Improved data access and use will also enable new products and services to be developed that will transform everyday life, drive efficiency and safety, create productivity gains, and allow better decision-making. Data will power much of the transformative technology such as AI, machine learning and predictive analytics. Business models will need to adapt to the unification of data, personalised customer experiences, and cybersecurity. The Consumer Data Right will support innovative data-driven businesses to develop better products and services and increase Australia’s productivity. Australia is home to a number of world-first blockchain applications. Combining blockchain technology with other technologies can add economic value to a range of business sectors. The National Blockchain Roadmap highlights some of the enormous opportunities blockchain technology can enable across our whole economy and provides the signposts for the future development of this technology. The Digital Business Plan announced funding for two blockchain pilots that will demonstrate the technology’s potential to reduce business compliance costs. Quantum computing has the potential to transform the information economy and create the industries of the future – solving complex solutions in hours or minutes. Australian researchers have established global leadership in quantum information. The Government has funded the Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology (CQC²T), an international collaboration between seven Australian universities and more than 25 partners to form one of the largest combined efforts in quantum computation and communication research in the world. It has also co-funded an Australian quantum computing company—Silicon Quantum Computing Pty Ltd to produce a prototype quantum computer chip—the first step in building a fully- functional quantum computer. New investments for the next step change The expansion of the world-leading Consumer Data Right will continue to strengthen the foundations of the data economy, while the Australian Data Strategy will explore how to enable a data-driven economy through improved economy-wide data sharing while embedding trust and security in data use. These initiatives will create new opportunities for data-driven businesses and technologies. Australia is a world leader in computer vision, deep learning, field robotics, neural networks and machine learning. Only one other country in the world produces more AI research per capita than Australia.25 These strengths provide a solid foundation for an AI-enabled economy. The Government’s $124.1 million over six years for the AI Action Plan will set out the Government’s plan to build Australia’s AI capability to grow the economy, support industry competitiveness, create jobs and improve lives. This will include modernising manufacturing and farming activites, improving diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and enhancing our defence capabilities. 55 Emerging aviation technologies could add $14.5 billion to GDP over the next 20 years, and create around 5,500 additional jobs.26 The Government will partner with industry to deliver grants to support the use of emerging aviation technologies (such as electric engines, drones and electric Vertical Take-off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft) to address priority community, mobility and cargo needs in regional Australia. These partnerships will be supported by improved regulation for these emerging technologies through the development of a Drone Rule Management System and National Drone Detection Network, working with other levels of government. We have also delivered a National Emerging Aviation Technology Policy Statement. Next steps to 2030 Timeframe Emerging technologies Next 2 years • Increasing Australian business investment in digital technologies, including emerging technologies like AI • Implementing the National Blockchain Roadmap and blockchain pilots • Improving research collaboration and commercialisation to support the adoption of AI tailored to Australian needs across the economy Next 5 years • Increased domestic capability in key industry sectors including manufacturing, agriculture and defence By 2030 • Digitally intensive industries will employ more than 10% of the Australian workforce • Australia is a global leader in the development and adoption of trusted, secure and responsible AI technology • More Australian sectors are operating at the digital frontier 56 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 57 LIFTING OUR AMBITION: DIGITAL GROWTH PRIORITIES Building on the investments to secure the foundations to grow the digital economy, the Australian Government has identified four priority areas for strategic focus where we can partner with the private sector to position Australia as a leading digital economy and society by 2030. These are: • Digital SMEs – lifting digital capability and adoption across the economy to support new ways to work and do business. This will increase profitability and save businesses time. • Modern Industry sectors – supporting globally competitive export sectors operating at the digital frontier, including manufacturing, mining, agriculture and construction. • Dynamic and emerging tech sector – building emerging technology capability and accelerating the growth of tech start-ups in areas like fintech and regtech that can drive an uplift in the rest of the economy. • Digital government and services – delivering simple, secure and trusted essential services for frictionless interactions. Digital SMEs Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Small Business Digital Taskforce Report 2018 showed many SMEs struggled to understand how digital technology could generate growth and productivity benefits for their business. SME engagement with digital products was low, with only half of businesses having a web presence, 40 per cent using cloud services, and very few citing cyber security as a priority.27 Over 2020, the pandemic made it an imperative for many Australian SMEs to actively engage with digital technology to adapt to changed conditions. Nearly 9 in 10 Australian firms adopted new technologies to improve their business continuity during COVID-19, with 13 per cent recognising that technology tools were essential to their operations.28 Many businesses found these new digital channels opened up opportunities for growth and improved overall productivity.29 Within one year, for example, Australian SMEs achieved more growth in web presence, use of digital payroll tools, and use of digital stock control processes than they had in the previous 10 years combined, and 37 per cent of the more digitally advanced firms increased productivity either slightly or significantly over this time.30 While more SMEs are beginning to take up digital tools, the gap between connected and disconnected businesses has deepened. The broader barriers identified in 2018 have not been eliminated. Micro-firms remain 75 per cent less likely to adopt digital technology to support 58 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 business processes like strategic planning, and less than 40 per cent of micro-and-small firms use digital tools to support planning, marketing or production processes.31 Many SMEs are unaware that digital technology is a function that can define the pathway towards a solution. Despite the depth of support available from both the private sector and across government, many firms continue to face ongoing challenges when considering digital adoption. Over the next decade, the Government will focus on lifting digital capability and adoption across the economy to support new ways to work and do business, increasing profitability and saving time. Figure 8 Electrical business digital transformation journey Trades and their customers have come a long way on the digital journey. It used to be: • Paper-based invoicing • Telephone books to find suppliers / to be found by customers • Cheques in the mail – out and in • Paper maps to find cables or ‘dig’n’hope’ • Paper installation guides • How-to-guides by phoning a friend • Managing schedules in a hard copy diary – tracking hours worked on a job • In person orders at a supplier • Standing in line at a bank to do wages What’s it look like now?

Since 2018, the Australian Small Business Advisory Services program has helped around 22,000 small businesses on their digital journey. The Government committed an additional $9 million in the 2020-21 Budget to extend the program to provide low-cost independent, expert and tailored advice to an additional 10,000 small business. The Digital Readiness Assessment Tool provides tools, advice and information for businesses to understand where they are in their digital journey while the Small Business Digital Champions Project provided free sector-specific digital advisory services covering topics such as technology trends, adoption, hardware, software, cyber security, digital training, planning and support. The Government is also working with big businesses to identify what they can and will do to support their SME partners along the digitalisation journey. New investments for the next step change The Government is empowering businesses to grow investment in digital technologies by allowing taxpayers to self-assess the effective life of certain intangible assets, which would better match the tax treatment of such assets with the period of time they provide economic benefits to the taxpayer. An expanded Digital Solutions – Australian Small Business Advisory Service will provide $12.7 million to provide high-quality, low cost, independent advice to 17,000 Australian small business in 2021-22. This funding extends the 2020-21 expansion for a further year to assist small businesses to build their digital capabilities, use digital technologies and build business continuity and resilience. The expansion of this program includes a pilot program servicing not-for-profit organisations. The Digital Business-to-Business Partnerships initiative capitalises on the trusted relationships that Australia’s corporate sector has with SMEs to promote the adoption, use and access to digital products and services. Through a public commitment a number of leading Australian businesses and industry associations will pledge to directly and actively support SMEs in their digital transformation. Next steps to 2030 Timeframe Digital SMEs Next 2 years • Work with stakeholders to lift business-to-business partnerships that encourage SMEs to build digital capability through existing or new digital products and services Next 5 years • e-Invoicing is adopted across the private sector and more businesses process payments online By 2030 • All new businesses are born digital • 95% of all SMEs have a digital presence or are using digital processes. 60 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 Modern industry sectors To compete in increasingly globalised markets, Australian businesses need to grow their use of digital technologies, infrastructure and services and build their digital capability or risk falling behind their international counterparts. Enabling technology solutions and uptake across all Australian sectors will unlock productivity gains and create new products, markets and industries, growing Australia’s jobs, income and export opportunities. Every sector has a lot to gain from using digital tools. For example, the mining sector is adopting automation, software, robotics and data analytics to improve supply chain efficiencies and enhance safety. Over the next decade, the Government will focus on supporting globally competitive export sectors operating at the digital frontier, including manufacturing, mining, agriculture and construction. What has already been delivered? The Modern Manufacturing Strategy is designed to ensure Australian manufacturers scale-up, become more competitive and more resilient. By making strategic investments and harnessing Australia’s world-class science and research, we are opening up new markets to export high-quality products to the rest of the world. As demonstrated in Figure 9, the adoption of digital tools will be an important contributor to achieve this uplift. The Defence Transformation Strategy include a focus on strengthening Defence’s approach to Australian industry capability, including innovation, export and harnessing opportunities from Australian science and technology. Australia’s Technology Investment Roadmap is a strategy to accelerate development and commercialisation of low emissions technologies. New investments for the next step change The Agriculture 2030 package will drive productivity through innovation, encourage private sector investment and strengthen Australia’s biosecurity systems. The digital technologies used in screening for pests that could harm Australia’s agricultural production will be enhanced and the capability of the sector to adopt digital tools will be improved through better skills and data. The Government is investing in the rollout of the National Freight Data Hub following extensive consultation and testing. By improving national freight data industry and governments can plan, make better operational and investment decisions and be more resilient and responsive. 61 Next steps to 2030 Timeframe Modern industry sectors Next 2 years • Work with stakeholders including State and Territory governments to identify ways to lift sectors where digitalisation can drive greater productivity • Launch of full Freight Data Hub with enhanced freight data, insights, project and standards information Next 5 years • Innovative products and technologies are being developed and adopted within Australian sectors including manufacturing, agriculture and defence • Origin and traceability systems are enhanced to provide quality assurance of Australian goods in global markets • Through implementation of the Modern Manufacturing Strategy, Australian manufacturers are collaborating and using smart manufacturing to respond to new and emerging opportunities, consumer trends and market demands • Enhanced cross-sector collaboration on technology adoption By 2030 • Digitally intensive industries will employ more than 10% of the Australian workforce • More Australian sectors are operating at the digital frontier 62 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 Figure 9 Digital economy aligning with the National Manufacturing Priorities Digital Opportunities: National Manufacturing Priorities Foundations to grow the Digital Economy • Infrastructure – NBN, 5G, Regional Connectivity • Skills – data analysts, software and web developers • Systems and regulation • Safety and security • Trade and international engagement Emerging technology opening new opportunities • AI, IoT, data analytics, blockchain, quantum computer Growing our ambitions • Digital SMEs • Modern industry sectors • Dynamic and emerging tech sector • Digital government and services Aligning with: • $1.5 billion Modern Manufacturing Strategy, including the $1.3 billion Modern Manufacturing Initiative grants. • Helping Australian manufacturing to scale-up, become more competitive and resilient. • Making science and technology work for industry by backing digital transformation The Modern Manufacturing Strategy supports getting the economic conditions right for manufacturers, including settings that support use of digital technologies.

The sector helps to build Australia’s skills base by delivering well-paid, highly skilled jobs, and supports innovation and productivity in almost every other sector through the development and adoption of tailored technology solutions. It also delivers value to Australians by improving the quality of service delivery in a range of applications from online banking, contactless payments and online entertainment through to accessing government services. Australia has a strong history of developing new technologies, which have generated huge economic and social benefits worldwide. Some of these include Wi-Fi, polymer banknotes, the cochlear implant (bionic ear) to assist with hearing, spray-on skin for burns victims, pacemakers, Google Maps and the flight recorder blackbox that helps keep commercial air travel safe. Australia has organic growth in fintech, regtech, agritech and creative industries like game and film production. Overall, the sector is comparatively small relative to other economies and there is significant room to grow. Innovation and investment in this sector has been stalling and new ideas are not regularly translated into commercial outcomes. Over the next decade, the Government will focus on building emerging technology capability and accelerating the growth of tech start-ups in areas like fintech and regtech to drive an uplift in the rest of the economy. What has already been delivered? The Government invested an additional $2 billion through the Research and Development Tax Incentive in the 2020-21 Budget to help innovative businesses that invest in R&D. Business investment in R&D is central to the development of new products, processes and services that will help make Australia more competitive and create more jobs in the long-term. Building on Australia’s strong financial services foundations, the Australian Government is providing a supportive policy environment that will allow the fintech sector to grow. Australia’s fintech industry has a reputation for quality and diverse product offerings and is maturing at a rapid rate. The CDR, Enhanced Regulatory Sandbox and the UK-Australia FinTech Bridge enable safe data sharing, innovation across borders and support for the flourishing Australian fintech ecosystem, which included more than 730 active fintechs in 2020.32 The Fintech100 report nominated seven Australian firms as being among the best fintech innovators from around the world.33 65 The National Blockchain Roadmap will drive the long-term development and adoption of this technology in Australia. The Digital Business Plan announced funding for two blockchain pilots that will demonstrate the technology’s potential to reduce business compliance costs. The National Transport Technology Action Plan outlines Australia’s priorities for implementing new transport technologies, which have been developed in partnership with the states, territories and industry. New investments for the next step change Better and smarter use of data can improve performance, reduce overheads and create value for customers. Businesses using AI are performing 11.5 per cent better than those who are not.34 Despite this enthusiasm, Australia is estimated to be about 34 per cent behind global peers in realising the economic benefits of digital innovation. In the 2021-22 Budget the Australian Government’s $124.1 million AI Action Plan will help Australia maximise the benefits of AI for all Australians and manage the potential challenges. These investments will also support digital SMEs and modern industry sectors. Under the plan we are investing: • $53.8 million to create the National Artificial Intelligence Centre that will drive business adoption of AI technologies by establishing up to four strategic AI and Digital Capability Centres that will provide SMEs with a ‘front door’ for AI talent, knowledge and resources. Coordinated by CSIRO’s Data 61, the Centre will support the development of new AI solutions with a commercial application by linking our leading AI researchers with firms able to commercialise that research into high-end products and services. • $33.7 million to support six industry pilots under AI solutions to build a stronger Australia for businesses to partner with government to develop AI-based solutions to challenges that have significant spill-over benefits for job creation, economic recovery and other social benefits. • $24.7 million in the skills of the future by establishing the Next Generation AI Graduates Program that will attract and train home-grown, job-ready AI specialists through competitive national scholarships. • $12 million to support exemplar applications of AI that will catalyse the AI opportunity in our Regions by co-funding 36 competitive grants for AI opportunities to be deployed to help solve local or regional problems. In the 2021-22 Budget the Government will partner with other levels of government and industry to deliver $32.6 million in grants to support the use of emerging aviation technologies (such as electric engines, drones and electric Vertical Take-off and Landing aircraft) to address priority community, mobility and cargo needs in regional Australia. These partnerships will be supported by improved regulation through the development of a Drone Rule Management System and National Drone Detection Network. 66 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 The Government is also providing tax support through the 30 per cent refundable digital games tax offset that will make Australia an attractive destination for digital talent and grow a viable export industry. With support, the Australian games industry could generate up to $1 billion per year and employ 10,000 full-time workers within the decade.35 Gaming sector talent has transferable digital capabilities that Australia could apply to range of sectors, including defence, health, education and construction. Consultation with industry in mid-2021 will inform the criteria and definition of qualifying expenditure to support the development of digital games. Case study A MIGHTY KINGDOM OF DIGITAL CAPABILITIES Mighty Kingdom has created games for some of the world’s leading toy and entertainment giants, including Disney, LEGO, Australian Red Cross, Sony, Funcom, Rogue, and Snapchat. The South Australian company employs 120 people.  The company successfully listed on the Australian Securities Exchange in 2021 and is one of few Australian- based games companies listed. Mighty Kingdom operates in the global gaming market, which is forecast to reach US$200 billion by 2023. The company also actively supports Adelaide’s games ecosystem, building skills and attracting local and international investors. 67 To support Australian companies to engage and retain the talent they need to compete on a global scale, the Government will ensure that employees that receive a tax-deferred Employee Share Scheme do not become subject to tax when their employment ceases. Employee Share Schemes are particularly important for businesses that are unable to offer competitive wages during their growth stage. The Australian venture capital market is currently supported by tax incentives designed to attract foreign investment and encourage venture capitalists to invest in early-stage Australian companies to drive innovation and additional investment. The Government will undertake a review of venture capital tax concessions to ensure current arrangements are fit-for-purpose and support genuine early-stage Australian start-ups. Next steps to 2030 Timeframe Dynamic and emerging tech sector Next 2 years • Completing two industry-led pilots that demonstrate the application of blockchain technology to reduce regulatory compliance costs and encourage broader take up of productivity boosting blockchain technology by Australian businesses • Reviewing Australia’s readiness for automated road vehicles with a focus on trials, regulation, infrastructure and public attitudes in collaboration with States and Territories • RegTech Commercialisation Initiative – deliver four challenges and up to eight proof of concepts Next 5 years • Establishing a national automated vehicle (AV) regulatory framework to enable the safe and legal operation of AVs on Australia’s roads • Develop the next iteration of the National Land Transport Technology Action Plan (2024-2027) to operationalise a national coordinated approach for deploying digital technologies for land transport in collaboration with States and Territories • Ensure tax concessions continue to be fit-for-purpose to encourage start-ups and venture capital in Australia By 2030 • Increased GVA value contributed by tech businesses launched in Australia • Australia is a global leader in the development and adoption of trusted, secure and responsible AI technology 68 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 Digital government and services Digital technology is changing how people and businesses interact with government to access essential services. Only a few years ago, we operated in a world where tax returns were lodged on paper forms, Medicare claims were made in person, and reporting income to Centrelink required regular phone calls. Today more services are completed online, and information already held by the Government is used to help complete applications for new services. COVID-19 demonstrated the benefit of Government adopting digital solutions for a range of issues including procurement, service delivery, regulation and policy making. Australians rightly expect continuous service improvements from government in the same way they do from their banks, telecommunication provider and any other service providers. Australia already performs well in government service delivery relative to other countries. Australia was second for E-Government in the IMD’s 2019 Digital Competitiveness rankings and fifth in the UN 's 2020 E-Government Survey. We also rank second on the open data index. However, there is always room for improvement. To allow business-led growth it will be essential to continue to lower regulatory barriers to investment. Modernising regulation, whether around competition, consumer protection, finance, safety or security will remove the hand brake on innovation. Through smart regulatory design and working with the sector, Australia can open up new economic opportunities while ensuring the benefits of the digital era deliver broader public benefit. Given digital technologies allow easier access to international markets it will be important to continue to open, and advocate for the benefits of, global markets and the rules-based trading system. Over the next decade, the Government will focus on delivering simple, secure and trusted essential services for frictionless interactions. What has already been delivered? myGov was introduced to make it easier for Australians to access their personal government services. It is now the Australian Government’s largest and most recognised government platform, with approximately 500,000 logins each day and more than 19.8 million active myGov accounts. myGov provides access to multiple services with one login: My Health Record, the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), Medicare, myTax, Centrelink, Child Support, Australian Job Search, Department of Veterans’ Affairs, HousingVic Online Services and National Redress Scheme and My Aged Care. 69 Digital Identity will give Australian people and businesses a single, secure way to use government services online. Creating a Digital Identity is like doing a 100-point identification check. It removes the need to visit a shopfront with your identity documents. Digital Identity is already being used by over 2.3 million Australians and 1.2 million businesses to access over 75 government services. Digital Identity ensures personal information is securely encrypted and stored in Australia and no personal information is presented through a double blind system. The proposed new legislation for the Digital Identity system will extend these protections and standards to businesses and state and territory governments who will use the digital identity. Delivering on the Government’s Deregulation Agenda through simple changes to complex processes, for example, joining up services in the Therapeutic Goods Administration to provide an estimated $2 million per year in reduced compliance costs. This change helps ensure Australians have the quickest possible access to medicines and medical technologies. Sponsors will now be able to use an electronic database with automatic data transfer – saving them up to 15 minutes per report. Early childhood education and care approval processes were also streamlined by merging the application process to meet requirements under both Commonwealth and state government law. The change will save 5,100 hours per year for prospective applicants for the Commonwealth’s Child Care Subsidy - a reduction of 75 per cent on current processing times. Case study DIGITAL RECORDS SAVING LIVES The Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) provides emergency and primary health care services for those living in rural, remote and regional areas of Australia who cannot access a hospital or general practice due to the vast distances of the Outback. As an online summary of key health information, the My Health Record system can assist overcoming this geographical barrier. Where an individual has a My Health Record, RFDS can access this electronic record, removing the need for paper based patient information. Information in a patient’s My Health Record could include details such as discharge summaries, medication and pathology and radiology reports performed elsewhere when providing both emergency and ongoing treatment. RFDS clients receiving specialist services at tertiary hospitals in metropolitan centres are sometimes under considerable stressors such as leaving community, minimal social supports and dealing with new life changing health diagnosis. 70 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 That’s where access to My Health Record becomes invaluable - the chronic disease coordinator from the RFDS may be able to access this information through My Health Record when providing care back in the remote community. The ability of the My Health Record system to provide health care information whenever and wherever it is needed is supporting the RFDS and Australians living in regional and rural areas. New investments for the next step change The Government is making a further $200.1 million investment in myGov to better connect and deliver essential government services by streamlining and tailoring online interactions for individuals and businesses. The enhancements will improve the functionality of myGov, making it easier and faster for people to engage with government. It will deliver smart and personalised interactions with government – allowing Australians to see a summary of all their interactions with government in one place, reminders to lodge returns or report income and proactive identification of services based on life events. 71 The Government is further investing in the infrastructure to digitally enable health care in Australia through the next wave of My Health Record. This will support innovation in health technology to safely and securely integrate new functions. In addition, by leveraging connection and digitisation, older Australians will be better supported when moving between care environments as their health information will follow them digitally. Australia will be one of the first countries in the world to enable its people to truly hold their healthcare in their hand, providing for a richer experience and interaction with healthcare services. The Digital Transformation Agency has a refocused mandate and will be better able to add value across the APS through a transfer to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Its functions have also been updated to deliver strategic and policy leadership on whole-of-government and shared ICT investments and digital service delivery. Through the Deregulation Agenda the government will continue to build foundations for future regulatory reform work, supporting innovative digital solutions and best practice approaches to regulation that benefits Australians. Next steps to 2030 Timeframe Lifting our ambition: Digital government and services Next 2 years • Complete core build of the Identity Management Services including APIs for integrating with the Permissions Platform • Refresh of the Digital Transformation Strategy to reflect changing expectations of government service delivery and keep accelerating the transformation of government • Release of the Commonwealth Digital Health Blueprint 2030 that will direct and prioritise the Commonwealth’s substantial investment in digital health initiatives to support national long-term health priorities and critical needs identified by healthcare providers and consumers • Refresh of the National Digital Health Strategy that sets out agreed priority areas and to support the national health priorities Next 5 years • More government services available through myGov as it becomes a whole-of-government, end-to-end service delivery platform By 2030 • Increasingly frictionless government service delivery • All Australian Government services securely available online • Significant majority of Australians over 18 are registered for myGovID or another trusted digital identity 72 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 KEY INVESTMENTS IN THE 2021-22 BUDGET In the 2021-22 Budget the Government is continuing to invest in strengthening foundational settings and providing targeted funding for digital growth priorities. As digital technologies become a more important driver for all Australian businesses and sectors, a more co-ordinated approach to developing relevant policies and regulation will ensure greater success. Digital Economy Strategy – Summary of 2021-22 Budget measures Measure Investment Right foundations to grow the digital economy Peri-Urban Mobile Program to fund new mobile solutions $16.4 million Continuing Measuring Broadband Australia $7.7 million Securing Australia’s future mobile networks $31.7 million Delivery of a National Data Security Action Plan $1.8 million Expanding the Cyber Security Skills Partnership Innovation Fund $43.8 million Strengthening Australia’s national system of identity settings $2.8 million Cyber Hubs pilot $18.8 million Digital Skills Cadetship Trial $10.7 million Accelerating the adoption of electronic invoicing $15.3 million Accelerated rollout of the Consumer Data Right $111.3 million 73 Measure Investment Delivering a Digital Atlas $40.2 million Enhanced management of Government data assets $16.5 million Building capabilities in emerging technologies Establishing a National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Centre and AI and Digital Capability Centres $53.8 million AI-based solutions to solve national challenges grants $33.7 million Catalysing AI in our regions grants* $12.0 million Next Generation AI Graduates Program^ $24.7 million Next Generation Emerging Technology Graduates Program^ $22.6 million Emerging Aviation Technology Partnerships grants $32.6 million New Drone Rule Management System $1.6 million Developing a National Drone Detection Network $1.5 million Lifting our ambition – Digital Growth Priorities Allowing taxpayers to self-assess the effective life of depreciating intangible assets $170.0 million Expanding and enhancing the Digital Solutions - Australian Small Business Advisory Services program $12.7 million Introducing a digital games tax offset $18.8 million Enhancing myGov $200.1 million Enabling next-wave My Health Record $301.8 million Total $1.2 billion Note: Measures reflect funding over the forward estimates to 2024-25 unless otherwise specified *Measure reflects investment to 2025-26 ^Measures reflect investments to 2026-27 74 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 75 TRACKING PROGRESS TO 2030 The Digital Economy Strategy sets out how Australia will be a modern and leading digital economy and society by 2030. The Government’s $2 billion investment over the last two Budgets are building the foundations for the digital economy, building capability in emerging technology and setting digital growth priorities. In tracking progress to 2030 we will be guided by the following: • Government must be an exemplar in its own delivery of services, and seize the opportunities afforded by data and digital technology. • Government must act with partners – exemplified by lessons learned during COVID-19 where business came to government offering support and assistance. • Focusing on delivering for the future and preparing ourselves for how data and digital technologies can be applied to solve the challenges ahead of us. • Data and digital must be underpinned by security and trust. By embedding security and trust into all we do, better services will be delivered for Australians. This will cement our international reputation as a trusted partner with people-centred values. The work to plan and prepare for a digital future does not end with the Digital Business Plan nor the package of measures under the Digital Economy Strategy. There is a breadth and depth of work underway across government that means the Digital Economy Strategy will continue to evolve. To support this work, the Government is extending the Digital Technology Taskforce. The Taskforce will monitor implementation of the Strategy as well as developments in emerging technologies to inform policy and regulatory development. The Strategy lays out a vision of what a digital Australia may look like in 2030 and what the role of government will be to enable, incentivise, build capabilities, and deliver its services. To be a leading digital economy and society by 2030, Australia will need to grow its digital capabilities, for our jobs, for our people, and to be able to move above and beyond whatever comes next. There is a lot already in train as the roadmap following shows. It will be important to track progress across government in delivering on the vision as well as through the ambitions, indicators and targets in the Strategy. We will learn more as measures are delivered and digital technologies advance. The Digital Economy Strategy will be a living Strategy and will continue to evolve to ensure we remain on track and be adjusted where needed. 76 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030 Roadmap to 2030 and measures of success 2021 2 yrs Digital Skills Organisation Data Analysts Pilot Delivering the National Data Security Action Plan Delivering AI Action Plan Delivering more connectivity to the regions and peri-urban areas Cyber Security Connect & Protect for SMEs Cyber Security Skills Partnerships Innovation Fund Australian Data Strategy Developing intergovernmental agreement to support national data sharing between governments The National AI Centre and Digital Capability Centres are driving business adoption and use of AI technologies by 2022 Consumer Data Right – Energy sector Release the Commonwealth Digital Health Blueprint 2030 Digital Atlas of Australia RegTech Commercialisation Initiative – deliver four challenges and 8 proof of concepts by 2023 Digital Identity legislation Digital Skills Cadetships Trial Next Generation AI Graduates in the workplace All Australian Government agencies using e-Invoicing and paying e-Invoices under $1 million within 5 business days 77 5 yrs 10 yrs 2030 Consumer Data Right: yearly assessment and designation of a new sector Establishing a national automated vehicle (AV) regulatory framework Showcase successful trials of 5G use cases to promote business uptake Increasing number of people undertaking a digital skill training course (higher education/ VET/ microcredentials) National Land Transport Action Plan Increasing number of digital agreements with like-minded partners Modernising Business Registers: Professional Registers implemented and decommissioning e-Invoicing is rolled out across the private sector to encourage all businesses to process payments online.

Over the last 18 months we have seen a  rapid uptake of digital technologies across  our society. It has helped businesses to  stay afloat, grow and create new jobs, and it has  helped people continue to live their daily lives in  new and different ways.   As we emerge from the challenges of the  COVID-19 pandemic, a thriving digital economy is  critical to Australia’s overall economic recovery.  Many countries are investing in their digital  futures and we must too if we are to ensure  Australian businesses remain globally  competitive and that Australia retains its  position of influence as a global leader.   We are not starting from scratch. Australia has strong foundations to support a growing  digital economy. We are early adopters of technology, we are known for our robust regulatory  systems and we are a democratic society.   The Australian Government is ambitious about Australia’s digital future. Our goal is for Australia  to be a world-leading digital economy and society by 2030. What does that look like? In summary,  it means thriving high growth industries, all businesses are digital businesses, all Australians  have access to digital skills and technology, there is frictionless government service delivery, fit- for-purpose regulation builds trust, and we have integrated data and technologies that  make life easier.   The Digital Economy Strategy outlines a cohesive roadmap – encompassing initiatives  already underway, investments we are making now to take us forward, and areas to be  considered to help us identify opportunities into the future.   The focus is on getting the foundations right, building capability in emerging technologies  and lifting our ambition through digital growth priorities.   This is a living strategy. We will continue to track progress towards our 2030 vision and  adjust course as we need to, to ensure we are successful in reaching our ambition.  1    2 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY Building a modern and resilient economy to drive Australia’s future prosperity  Our Vision For Australia to be a leading digital economy and society by 2030  Delivering the right foundations to grow the digital economy  Digital  infrastructure  Cyber security,  safety and trust  Skills and  inclusion  Systems and  regulation  Trade and  international  engagement  Keeping at the forefront of emerging technologies  Artificial  Intelligence  Internet  of Things Data Analytics Blockchain Quantum   Computing  Lifting our ambition –  Digital Growth Priorities  Digital SMEs  Modern industry sectors  Dynamic and emerging  tech sector  Digital Government  and services  Key 2021-22 Budget Initiatives • AI investments to drive greater AI adoption across the economy • Emerging Aviation Technology reforms and industry partnerships to   enable the use of drones and other aviation technologies  • Tax incentives to grow the digital games sector and encourage business   investment in digital technologies • Accelerating the rollout of the Consumer Data Right giving Australians greater   access to, and control over, their data • Unlocking the value of data with an Australian Data Strategy • Building skills for a modern economy with a Digital Skills Cadetship Trial and   Next Generation AI and Emerging Technology Graduates • Enhancing myGov to deliver better services to Australians • Enabling next-wave My Health Record for world-leading healthcare • Expanding the use of the Digital Identity System for secure and simple   access to services from government and across the economy • Expansion of Digital Solutions - Australian Small Business Advisory Services  to build SME digital capability • Improving internet and mobile connectivity in peri-urban areas • Driving the uptake of e-Invoicing by businesses • Working with industry to secure Australia’s mobile networks   (5G and future 6G networks) and data centre infrastructure  • Digital Atlas to support emergency response, environmental management,   virtual construction design and business investment  We’ll be succeeding when  100% of Australian Government services are  available online  Tertiary advanced digitally skilled graduates  increase to more than 15,000 per year  Digitally-intensive industries employ more  than 10% of the Australian workforce  All new businesses are ‘born’ digital  All Australian businesses continue to improve  cyber security practices  95% of SMEs are using e-Commerce tools    3  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY How well our businesses, governments and workforce keep pace with changes in technology and  the digital frontier will define Australia’s future prosperity. The potential benefits to the Australian  economy through digitalisation have been estimated to be as much as $315 billion over the  next decade, with the potential to create up to a quarter of a million new jobs by 2025.1 With other  countries investing heavily in their digital futures, our actions over the next 10 years will determine  whether we lead or fall behind our global competitors.   COVID-19 accelerated the take up of digital technology and highlighted the role it can play to  support and enhance business operations across every sector of the economy, improve the delivery  of government services and make life easier for Australians. From telehealth and electronic  prescriptions to online sales, cloud computing and remote working, COVID-19 has driven a huge  leap forward in our digital capability and our appetite for data. Australia must maintain this  momentum to secure our future prosperity and protect our national interests.  The Digital Economy Strategy sets out how Australia will secure its future as a modern and  leading digital economy and society by 2030. It builds on the Australian Government’s existing  digital and data initiatives, sets out further actions the Government is taking through the 2021-22  Budget and defines future pathways to 2030.   The Strategy recognises that the Government plays an enabling role – Australian businesses and  individuals will ultimately determine our success. The Strategy is built around three pillars:  1. Building the foundations to grow the digital economy – The first role of government is to create the policy settings for the digital economy to flourish. This includes investing in digital infrastructure, a skilled workforce, digital inclusion, digital trade agreements, cyber security and safety, and world-class systems and regulation that encourage the adoption and creation of trusted digital technology.  2. Building capability in emerging technologies – The Government recognises the important role of emerging technologies in driving future productivity and prosperity. It is developing its understanding of these technologies so it can build capability and keep pace with changes in technology to position Australia at the forefront of technology development and use.  3. Setting Digital Growth Priorities to lift our ambition – The Government has identified four strategic priorities across the economy where we can partner with the private sector to drive digital growth, jobs and capability. These priorities include lifting the digital capability of small to medium enterprises (SMEs); supporting modern and globally competitive industry sectors in areas like manufacturing, agriculture, mining and construction; building a dynamic and emerging technology sector; and delivering simple and secure digital government services.    4 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  The 2021-22 Budget supports the Digital Economy Strategy through $1.2 billion in strategic  investments to unlock the value of data, drive investment and uptake of emerging technologies,  build the skills required for a modern economy, and enhance government service delivery.  This builds on the $800 million Digital Business Plan, the $1.67 billion Cyber Security Strategy 2020,  the $1 billion JobTrainer fund and the $4.5 billion upgrade plan for the NBN. These investments will  drive greater productivity, high-quality jobs, and income growth across the economy.   But our action and investment won’t stop there. The Digital Economy Strategy sets out the  pathways to guide future actions, set ambitious targets and will be continually renewed to  realise our vision of being a leading digital economy and society by 2030.    5  AUSTRALIA -  A WORLD LEADING  MODERN, DIGITAL ECONOMY  Australia is part of an increasingly interconnected global economy where the online world is rapidly  changing the economic and social landscape. Business models are changing – they can deliver  tailored goods and services to be accessed by consumers and business anywhere, anytime.  This creates new global markets for innovative Australian businesses, while also introducing  greater competition to our domestic economy. Digital technology is also driving a re-evaluation of  data, transforming it into an asset that can be used to deliver better outcomes for Australians.  COVID-19 changed the way Australians engaged with digital technologies. Estimates suggest that  Australia vaulted five years forward in consumer and business digital adoption in around two  months.2 Almost 9 in 10 Australian businesses adopted new technologies during COVID-19 to  support business continuity while Australians took to online shopping, working from home and  social engagement as never seen before.3  During the past 12 months, many Australian businesses introduced new ways of working and  leveraged digital technologies to change what they offered and how it was delivered. Businesses  that engaged in e-Commerce were the most resilient and adaptable to the shock of the pandemic,  and catalysed other businesses to digitise their operations. Australia needs to maintain this  momentum to secure our future prosperity. Increased digital uptake will support improvements  in living standards, ensure we remain globally competitive and are well positioned to protect our  interests. Greater adoption of digital technology in a secure and trusted way will be a key driver of  higher productivity, wages and employment growth.  Even before COVID-19, Australia had sound foundations that made us well-placed to be  a leading digital economy. We are a democratic nation, with high levels of internet connectivity,  and Australians are well-educated and keen adopters of new technology. Australia is an attractive  place to live and do business and we are leading the world to make sure that digital technology  is fair, safe and trusted through initiatives like the world-first Office of the eSafety Commissioner.    6 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  These fundamentals position Australia internationally as a country ready to increase its  digitalisation (Figure 1). Among 141 countries assessed for digital readiness using seven  indicators, Australia was in the top 20. However, this is a ‘never-ending journey’ and even leading  countries face a constant need to develop their digital readiness to remain competitive relative to  their peers and keep ahead of up-and-coming nations that desire to take a leading position.  Figure 1  Australia compared to the world - digital readiness  Activate Accelerate (low)  Accelerate (High)  Amplify No Data  Reproduced with permission: CISCO (2020) Digital Readiness Index  A range of sectors and businesses are already leading the world in technology development and  adoption. A key objective of the Digital Economy Strategy is for as many Australian businesses as  possible to be operating at the digital frontier in their sectors, and we can already see this in some  sectors of our economy such as mining, agriculture and health. To achieve this objective, a thriving  digital technology sector will be essential for supplying the skills needed to uplift digital capability  across the economy.     7  Case study  LEADING THE WORLD IN APPLYING AI FOR MINING  LAB3 Lumen assisted a large mining company looking to reduce its costs by using  SensorMine® to extend tyre life. SensorMine® enables analytics of real-time data  that assists with predictive maintenance and improves operational performance.  SensorMine® was installed on truck tyres to collect real-time vibration data, allowing  the client to monitor and identify harsh terrain. This enabled them to analyse and roll- out alternative routes that will reduce wear and maximise tyre life.  Mine sites implementing LAB3’s SensorMine® solution could reduce tyre costs  by an estimated 4 per cent. With tyre costs representing one of the top four costs  in the sector, the solution has the potential to deliver real industry impact and improve  competitiveness. Founded in 2017, LAB3 has grown to more than 150 ICT  professionals. LAB3’s growth has been powered by a unique blend of exceptional  engineering talent coupled with a thirst for developing dynamic professionals  entering the sector.  With the help of government grants, graduate programs and industry partnerships,  LAB3 has invested over $5 million in its research and development (R&D) activities,  creating 30 full time jobs and enabling LAB3's intellectual property and products to be  sold in numerous international markets, including the US, Japan, Canada and the EU.    8 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  Other key areas where we are already building our capability include:  Skills: The Australian Government has made significant investments in education and training that  will help Australians to lift their digital capabilities in the workforce. Digital skills are increasingly  part of every job. The Government’s JobTrainer program, Boosting Apprenticeships  Commencements, and Job-ready Graduates initiatives are helping to provide Australians with the  skills our businesses need. We have also elevated digital skills alongside language, literacy and  numeracy for job seekers as a foundational skill.   Regulation: To ensure that businesses have the confidence to invest and actively participate in the  digital economy, regulation needs to be clear, proportionate and fit-for-purpose. The digital  economy also requires a different mindset for regulation. Modernising regulation – whether  competition, consumer protection, safety or security – requires smart regulatory design. It must  support new economic opportunities while safeguarding the rights of individuals and deliver  broader public benefit.  Australia has undertaken world-leading investigations to ensure our competition rules remain  up to date through the Digital Platforms Inquiry and the related examination of our privacy laws.  We are the first country to create and enact a digital trade agreement featuring modernised digital  trade rules (with Singapore), and the first to establish an eSafety Commissioner to make sure that  Australians are protected online. Australia’s Consumer Data Right is also becoming a world leading  consumer-driven data sharing framework that will give Australians more control over their data  while boosting innovation and competition.    Cyber security: Businesses and people will only embrace digital opportunities to the maximum  extent if they are confident that they can trust the technologies and the identity of the people  and businesses they interact with online. Cyber security risks have a significant economic cost,  estimated to be as much as $29 billion per year. Central to realising the benefits of the digital  economy is continuing to position Australia as a world-leader in online safety and trusted  technology, which we are doing through the $1.67 billion Cyber Security Strategy 2020.  Safety and security does not mean stifling innovation or trading off broader digital opportunities.  On the contrary, it can actually open the door for Australia to create new economic opportunities by  carving out a market for safe and trusted digital products and services.   While we are starting from a solid base, there is significant room to grow.   Australia ranks well internationally on many facets of digitalisation (Figure 2), and recent  investments will maintain and/or lift our competitiveness. However, there are challenges still to  be met, including increasing adoption of technology across the economy, particularly by SMEs;  maintaining and growing a skilled workforce; and stimulating greater development and adoption  of technologies to meet Australia’s specific needs.  The ICT sector is a relatively small share of Australia’s economy, reflecting the relative size of  other sectors, such as mining, agriculture and construction. However, we rank highly in the  application of digital technologies across the economy, skills, digital government, data and  cyber security. In all areas there is potential for further improvements to reach the level of current  leaders and significant investment is required to maintain this leadership into the future.    9  Figure 2  Australia compared to similar economies – selected indices  Ra nk  D ig  it al   E co  no m  y  In  di ca  to rs  Sk ill  s  an  d  Ca  pa bi  lit ie  s D  ig it  al  G  ov er  nm en  t O  nl in  e  Se  cu ri  ty  %  o  f I CT   G ro  ss    Va lu  e  Ad  de d   (O EC  D  2  02 1)  4  D ig  ita l-i  nt en  si ve    se  ct or  s’  sh  ar e   in  to  ta l   em pl  oy m  en t   (O EC  D  2  01 6)  5  Sh ar  e  of   s m  al l   bu si  ne ss  es    m ak  in g   e co  m m  er ce    - sa le  s  in   th e   la st    12   m on  th s   (O EC  D  2  02 0)  6  Sh ar  e  of    In  te rn  et  u  se rs    w  ho  h  av e   pu rc  ha se  d  on  lin e   in  th  e  la  st  1  2  m  on th  s  (O  EC D   2 02  0) 7  %  te  rt ia  ry  IC  T  gr  ad ua  te s   (O EC  D  2  01 8)  8  Sh ar  e  of   a du  lts    pr ofi  ci en  t  at   p ro  bl em  - so  lv in  g  in    te  ch no  lo gy  -r ic  h  en  vi ro  nm en  ts    (O CE  D  2  01 5)  9  In cl  us iv  e  In  te rn  et  In  de x   -  O  ve ra  ll  (E  IU  2  02 1)  10  eG ov  er nm  en t   D ev  el op  m en  t   (U  N  2  02 0)  11  Pu bl  ic at  io n   of  O  pe n   G ov  er nm  en t   D at  a  (O  pe n   Kn ow  le dg  e  Fo  un da  tio n   20 17  )12  G lo  ba l   Cy be  rs ec  ur ity    In  de x   –  Co  un tr  y  Co  m m  itm en  t  Le  ve ls    (IT  U  2  01 8)  13  1 U  K U  K  2 IS  RA EL  AU ST  RA LI  A U  SA AU  ST RA  LI A  U SA  3 U  K  4 U  SA AU  ST RA  LI A  5 AU  ST RA  LI A  CA N  AD A  6 U  SA SI  N G  AP O  RE  7 U  K CA  N AD  A AU  ST RA  LI A  U K  8 U  K CA  N AD  A CA  N AD  A M  AL AY  SI A  9 AU  ST RA  LI A  U K  U SA  CA N  AD A  10 JA  PA N  AU ST  RA LI  A  11 CA  N AD  A U  SA  12 JA  PA N  SI N  G AP  O RE  13 U  SA  14 U  K JA  PA N  JA PA  N  15 16  IS  RA EL  IS RA  EL JA  PA N  17 IS  RA EL  JA PA  N AU  ST RA  LI A  18 JA  PA N  IS RA  EL  19 20 U  SA  (L ow  er )  (3 9)  (2 6)    10 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  Australia’s productivity and economic performance needs to increase if we are to sustain and  grow our enviable standard of living. As one of the strongest recovering economies coming  through COVID-19, Australia can seize the opportunity to be even stronger and more prepared  for a digital future. Unlocking the value of digital technologies will drive a stronger economy and  support important social, environmental and health outcomes. Continued rapid advancement in  technologies like precision healthcare, low emissions technologies and assistive technologies will  be crucial in delivering improved living standards to 2030 and beyond.   The digital economy is dynamic. Technologies will evolve and new technologies will emerge,   potentially as revolutionary as the internet and email were at the end of the 20th century.  The Digital Economy Strategy will continue to evolve and adapt to these changing circumstances  to ensure Australia remains on track to be a leading digital economy.  What is a digital economy and society?  A digital economy and society includes all activity reliant on, or significantly enhanced by,  the use of digital inputs including:  • technologies: the tools and products that help us work and in our everyday lives such as smartphones, robotics and automation.  • infrastructure: the systems that keep us connected and online such as mobile and fixed phone and broadband services and location-based technologies (like GPS).  • services: the processes, culture and business models that enable a user-centric end- to-end service such as digital platforms, software and cloud storage.  • data: the basic element that can be processed or produced by a computer to convey information, including the facts, statistics, instructions, concepts, or other information capable of being communicated, analysed or processed by an individual or by other means including a computer, electronic and automated means.  • regulatory frameworks: that oversee the efficient, safe and reliable functioning of the digital economy, including the standards that underpin the operation of digital technologies and infrastructure.  • capabilities and skills: the application of skills and knowledge that ensures people are able to use digital technologies and participate in society.  All businesses, consumers and government that use and are responsible for these inputs  are part of a digital economy and society.   Source: Based on OECD (Measurement - Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (oecd.org))    11  A digital economy is characterised by online transactions and engagement – a virtual, paperless  and cashless world. It harnesses a range of technologies, services and business models that  improve personalisation through human-centred design and create new opportunities and markets.  Ultimately there will be no distinguishing between the digital economy and the economy as  a whole. This means that by 2030:  • All businesses are digital businesses, using e-Commerce tools and new technologies to  improve productivity, innovate and generate high-paying jobs.  • All transactions are electronic, integrated and secure - from registration through to employment, reporting, marketing, banking, accounting and security.  • Australians have the capabilities to confidently use and create digital technology, forming the  skilled workforce needed to help businesses reach and operate at the digital frontier. All  Australians will have learning opportunities to gain the foundational maths and digital skills  to give them a head start for future careers across the economy, or upskill on a shared  understanding of what is required to gain and advance in employment.  • Government services will all be easily and safely accessible online, saving people and  businesses time and money. Government service delivery will by supported by better public  data availability and sharing that is used by a highly-skilled public service to deliver more  targeted policy and programs.  • Australia leads the world in smart regulation and initiatives to ensure Australia has the safest  and most cyber secure environment for Australians living and working online, building trust in  the digital economy and opening up new economic opportunities.  • Australia leads the world in areas of technology development that harness our strengths and  make life easier for Australians in what they use and do every day. New data-driven  businesses are being developed to provide more sophisticated and personalised goods and  services, and consumers have greater control over the use of their data.  • Australia is resilient to economic, health and environmental shocks and threats to our  national interests with technology enabling business continuity, community safety and swift  recovery.    12 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  Technology is changing how we do business Technology is transforming business models and reducing barriers to growth for small business  through affordable access to safe and secure payment systems, forums for collaboration,  and reduced technology investment costs through the adoption of multi cloud, hybrid cloud and  distributed cloud services. Growth in digital activity has outpaced overall growth in the economy  and the affordability of communications services has continued to improve.14  The importance of digital technologies to global commerce is reflected in the prominence of  technology businesses in the world’s largest companies. In 2019, the five largest companies by  market capitalisation were Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, Alphabet (Google) and Facebook. Just ten  years ago, this list was dominated by industrial companies – General Electric, Exxon, Pfizer and  Citi – with Microsoft the only digital business.15  Digital platforms allow digital services to operate at scale and are rapidly becoming the new  marketplace by playing the role of intermediary between businesses and consumers. However,  change in the short term can be difficult with a range of issues associated with, or exacerbated by,  their growth: cybercrime, online safety and privacy, market power and competition, and tax and  industrial relations issues. The Australian Government has established strong foundations in  addressing these issues to date and will continue to pay close attention to these technology  trends in the achievement of our digital ambition.    13   Figure 3  Trends driven by digital technology  Trends being driven by  digital technology  More online interactions between people,  businesses and systems that allow for the  discovery and sharing of information.  Increased data collection and analysis  allowing more personalisation and different  business models, but also introducing  opportunities for misuse.  Changing business models including  the ability to make money from underused  assets (like ride-sharing services) and digital  platforms that organise a market rather than  just participate.  More flexible supply chains that can  change how businesses participate and  compete in the global marketplace.  Evolving tasks and capabilities needs that  are changing how we live, play and find and  perform work.  Country borders becoming less binding  for trade increasing the importance of  standards and interoperability of systems.  Increasing frequency, scale,  sophistication and impact of cybercrime  ranging from online scams through to large- scale hacking of systems.

Technology and digital platforms are also changing  how business and workers connect to perform jobs.  Jobs that are more routine in nature like data collection and administration are increasingly being  more streamlined or augmented using digital tools. Jobs that require more critical thinking or  greater connections, such as accounting and teaching are being enhanced by digital technology,  supporting people with these capabilities. Entirely new jobs and businesses have emerged in areas  like cyber security and data analytics. The Digital Transformation Expert Panel noted estimates that  by 2034, technology will augment 4.5 million Australian workers.24  This is not unusual. There has always been evolution in activity and jobs in the Australian economy,  and a need to upskill to keep pace with technological change. History has shown this has led to  increased overall employment and access to better jobs with higher wages.   It is important to understand how the nature of work is changing, including the role of the  ‘gig-based’ economy, so that we can better support Australians with the skills and training to  take advantage of these new opportunities.    16 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  The changing nature of jobs in Australia  • Almost every job has changes in the tasks it involves. These shifts have been from  routine towards more non-routine tasks, which are associated with higher wages and  greater job satisfaction. Recent estimates are that 87 per cent of jobs now require  digital skills – across every sector and industry.  • Employment for occupations requiring the highest level of skills has increased notably  as a share of total employment from 15 per cent in the mid-1960s to above  30 per cent today. Analytical, cognitive, social, management and maths skills are most utilised in these roles. Of the new jobs created, most are in high-skilled  occupations.  • The employment share of lower-skill occupations has fallen gradually since the 1960s  but stabilised over the past decade reflecting strong demand for carers and labourers,  but digital technologies are also changing these roles.  • Job categories with a relatively high share of new job titles and relatively strong  growth in Australia include computer software programmers, ICT security specialists,  computer network professionals, and education advisers and reviewers. Employment  growth in occupations with a high share of new job titles accounted for over 10 per cent of the 4 million or so jobs created over the past 20 years in Australia.  • It is estimated that 250,000 new jobs will be created by digitalisation by 2025.  Australia had more than 770,000 technology workers in 2019, 6.8 per cent higher than  2018. This was 1.5 times the growth in the number of professional occupations over  the same period.

From project management digital tools and apps to  augmented reality software to walk through building sites, there’s a digital  future quickly moving away from pencil and paper. Large Australian world  leading companies such as Lendlease and tech SMEs such as Willow are  seeing the growing demand for all contractors and employees to be using  digital skills.   Willow provides a software platform that creates “digital twins” of built  assets. The twin is a virtual replica of any built asset and funnels data from  across design, equipment, and live information into an easy-to-use interface.  Willow is also working with education providers to ensure that there is  industry relevant experience of what will be needed in a world of ‘digital twins’  for building. During the construction of 60 Martin Place Sydney, Willow’s Twin  Creator platform tracked and validated all 71,848 digital assets within  the building, resulting in 100 per cent completion and compliance a week prior  to practical completion. Willow’s team worked directly with Lendlease to  ensure all stakeholders understood the digital handover process and were  able to simply and efficiently deliver spatial, static and live asset data. The live  data is being shared with engineering students to explore trends from across  a number of systems including ventilation, lift and access control to identify  sustainability initiatives and smarter maintenance practices.  This digital twin enables firms like Investa to manage the build with greater  efficiency, fix problems before they occur, better manage sustainability and  improve the occupant experience.  Founded in 2017, Willow has grown to more than 180 staff in Sydney,  Melbourne and around the world from New York to Tel Aviv.    18 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  AUSTRALIA’S VISION  TO BE A LEADING DIGITAL  ECONOMY AND SOCIETY  BY 2030  The Government is committed to securing Australia’s future prosperity and the digital economy  plays a vital role. Over the next decade, investment in secure digital technology will underpin  improvements in jobs, productivity and make Australia’s economy more dynamic and resilient.  Success will be measured through delivering positive outcomes to the Australian people and  businesses and by providing better government services.   Australians By 2030, all Australians will have access to digital skills and technology to ensure inclusivity.  The digital capabilities of Australians will keep pace with new and emerging technologies so  that we have a workforce that meets the needs of a modern economy. Australians will be able to  maintain and build their skills through access to a range of flexible education and training  offerings that are industry-relevant and informed.  Through more secure cyber practices, Australians will trust and embrace technologies to enrich  their lives. People will access and confidently use digital technologies to learn, work and connect,  making everyday life and jobs easier and more convenient.  Better use of data will allow for more tailored experiences, greater flexibility around how and where  people work, greater consumer choice, direct benefit and control over their own data and provide  more ways to connect to family and communities.  This means Australians will:  • increase their digital capabilities, at any age, through access to flexible training and education • be able to access education, health and other essential services seamlessly online from any  location over a range of mediums  • work confidently in jobs with a range of digital technologies, services and infrastructure • use trusted digital identity to prove their identity - easily and once only - for a range of  government and non-government services such as medicare, tax and banking    19  • enjoy simple, smart and personalised interactions with government, with proactive identification of services based on life events  • connect to digital platforms and services safely and securely for work and daily life.  We’ll be succeeding when:  • all Australians have access to high-speed internet services and the ability to use it effectively  • 90 per cent of Australians are confident using technology, protecting their privacy and assessing whether information is credible  • there is a strong pipeline of graduates with advanced digital skills coming through the education and training ecosystem, meeting demand from businesses  • the significant majority of Australians over 18 are registered for myGovID or another trusted digital identity  • there are more higher paying digitally skilled jobs in Australia and digitally intensive industries are employing more than 10 per cent of the Australian workforce.  Business  By 2030, all businesses will be digital businesses. Business, including SMEs and  the not-for-profit sector, have the confidence and capacity to invest and participate in the  digital economy. A broad uplift in the digital skills of Australians allows more businesses to  innovate and improve productivity using the best available technologies. They are generating  rewarding and high-paying jobs, improving productivity, and are globally competitive in  new markets.   Businesses and a vibrant technology sector drive future innovation, value for consumers and  underpin growth across critical Australian sectors.  A vision for digital business  Digital technologies are transforming how we do business across the economy  – from small tourism operators, to those delivering in-person services, to large manufacturing firms.  To be a leading digital economy and society in 2030, every business needs to  become a digital business.      20 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  We need more:  • businesses understanding the value of using digital tools and services such as  payroll, payments and inventory management systems, online sales platforms  and social media  • businesses adopting and adapting digital technology to add flexibility, mobility  and resilience to their businesses, and save themselves time and money  • digitally capable people for the modern workplace, and businesses employing  workers with digitally advanced and data skills  • workers with mindsets and capabilities to transform businesses and innovate  using digital technologies  • large businesses supporting the digitalisation of SMEs in their supply chains. • trusted advisors and touchpoints providing high quality advice to support   digital adoption, particularly for small and medium businesses  • granular data showing the status of digitalisation across businesses, to inform  future policies and programs  • public awareness and transparency of digital support programs provided by  both the private and public sector.  We’ll be succeeding when: • all new Australian businesses are “born digital” – new businesses put digital tools,  processes and mindset front-and-centre in running their business  • 95 per cent of SMEs use e-Commerce and cyber security tools, opening them up to new markets and improved productivity and resilience  • businesses can verify the digital identity of customers and suppliers with absolute confidence  • highly skilled jobs increase as a proportion of total employment and there is a pipeline of skilled workers to fill these jobs  • more Australian sectors are operating at the digital frontier • digital production activities are increasing in value for economic activity  (gross value added (GVA))  • the security of critical infrastructure and essential services like water, telecommunications and energy is enhanced  • Australian industries adopt, adapt, develop and export safe and secure AI technologies, lifting productivity, boosting competitiveness and creating jobs.    21  Government By 2030, Government service delivery will be frictionless and integrated with technology making  life easier. The Australian Government will lead in the efficient, trusted and secure delivery of  services to Australians online. Data will be used in the design of policies and services to better  target them to the needs of Australians. Business and citizen interaction with government services  will be seamless and driven by customer experience.  Service delivery will be supported by protections of public data and smart, adaptive and  digitally-enabled regulation. Improved ability to use data to understand complex issues allows  for better decisions and more targeted programs for all Australians.   This will mean:  • Government will deliver tailored, personalised and integrated services, proactively identifying eligible services based on life events  • high levels of cyber security across Australian Government systems to protect national security and personal information  • businesses and individuals only need to report information to government once  • providing seamless services to Australians across all levels of government • enhanced regulatory compliance through fit-for-purpose regulation that is administered  efficiently, informed by appropriate data and digitally-enabled to minimise the impost on business.  We’ll be succeeding when:  • all Australian Government services are available securely and easily online • the significant majority of Australians over 18 are registered for myGovID or other trusted   digital identity • 95 per cent of businesses are using e-Commerce tools including e-Invoicing and Single   Touch Payroll • all new businesses are ‘born digital’ through streamlined business registration • Australia has clear arrangements and agreement in place with other jurisdictions regarding   cross border data flows  • Australia has a national strategy covering the regulation of the use, movement and  custodianship of public and private data.    22 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  Figure 5  Government digital initiatives underway  Bringing digital policy together – a whole of government approach  There is significant work already occurring across the Australian Government in areas as  diverse as privacy reform, cyber security and critical technology, the Consumer Data Right  and technologies like 5G and AI.

The Australian Government has been working to position Australia on the path to being a  leading digital economy and society. Many of the foundations are in place – building on  Australia’s Tech Future, which set out over 150 existing programs and policies supporting  opportunities for a digital future and a thriving digital economy.   The Government has been making significant investments to ensure that the right infrastructure,  skills, systems and regulation are in place to enable economic growth and prosperity.  The Digital Business Plan, released in September 2020, is helping businesses to use digital  technologies to grow and create jobs as part of the economic recovery. The Digital Business  Plan invested in digital infrastructure and skills, removed out-dated regulatory barriers, boosted  small business capability, and simplified doing business with government. Activity is underway  to progress the Digital Business Plan across government, with major milestones including:  • Launch of the first round of the Australian 5G innovation initiative in February 2021 to fund  small to large businesses to test and develop 5G uses, applications, services and products.  This technology will drive productivity across key industry sectors like agriculture, mining,  retail, health, construction and manufacturing.  • Amendments to the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 in December 2020 to promote the  ongoing rollout of the Consumer Data Right.  • Launch of the Regtech Commercialisation Initiative under the Business Research and  Innovation Initiative to improve regulatory compliance, reduce regulatory administration,  and directly support innovative firms.    26 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  Digital infrastructure To connect businesses and households   A key underpinning for the digital economy is to have the infrastructure that makes it possible  to access the digital world. By investing in the physical and digital infrastructure that keeps  us connected and online, more Australians can participate in the digital economy. Australian  Government investment in regional digital infrastructure continues to support digital inclusion  by delivering fast, affordable and reliable connectivity.  This infrastructure is underpinned by a competitive market and multiple infrastructure owners  for fixed wireless, fixed line and mobile infrastructure for which the Government’s regulatory  regime supports open competition and facilitates deploying communication facilities as well as  the allocation of spectrum.  What has already been delivered?  The rollout of the NBN is largely complete and has provided ubiquitous access to high speed  wholesale broadband to support dozens of retail service providers to deliver the opportunities  of the digital age to households and businesses the country. The Government committed in 2020  that the NBN would invest a further $4.5 billion to provide access to higher wholesale speeds to an  estimated 75 per cent of homes and businesses on the fixed-line network by 2023. This will make  the highest speed tiers available to these premises should they wish even higher broadband speeds.  This commitment by NBN Co will also support business innovation, productivity and growth by  making business-grade fibre services more affordable and accessible, through the creation of 240  business fibre zones and enabling 90 per cent of Australian businesses to access NBN Co’s  ultrafast broadband business services at no upfront cost. Regional areas will benefit including  through the upgrade of fibre to the curb services and enabling 950,000 premises in fibre to the  node areas to access higher wholesale speeds on demand. The $300 million co-investment fund is  aimed at converting more premises from fixed wireless and satellite to fixed-line broadband  services and 85 of the business fibre zones are in regional Australia. The Australian Broadband  Advisory Council (ABAC) has been established to provide advice on ways to maximise the  benefits of high speed networks in key sectors of the economy.  The Government’s Universal Service Guarantee provides for all premises in Australia to have  access to baseline broadband services, as well as ongoing access to standard telephone  services and payphone services.  The Government is supporting the roll out of 5G services through the timely availability of  spectrum, streamlining deployment arrangements and showcasing trials of 5G use cases to  promote business uptake. Spectrum is key to enabling higher capacity for more data to be  transmitted for mobile digital communication for robotics and logistics for agtech and mining.  The Australian 5G Innovation Initiative is supporting private sector investment in 5G trials to  demonstrate the capabilities of 5G and productivity benefits to businesses in Australia.    27  The Regional Connectivity Program is making targeted investment in ‘place-based’  telecommunications infrastructure to deliver economic and social opportunities for regional,  rural and remote Australian communities. Funded projects under Round 1 included upgrading 4G  services on King Island, expanding fibre broadband to Indigenous communities in the Northern  Territory and improving wireless broadband around Roma in Queensland to support agricultural  producers to use new technologies to improve productivity. Through projects like these,  more communities have access to telehealth, new agtech services, and online educational and  business opportunities. The Mobile Black Spot Program is funding new mobile base stations  to address mobile coverage issues across regional and remote Australia, with over 925 base  stations activated.  The Government is continuing to deliver around $4 million a year to maintain community  payphones and satellite Wi-Fi telephones in small Indigenous communities which historically  have limited, or in some cases no, access to mobile phone or internet services.   New investments for the next step change The Government is investing a further $84.8 million to expand the Regional Connectivity Program  to continue to improve internet and mobile services in regional and remote Australia that are  outside the NBN fixed line footprint. A further $68.5 million has been allocated towards  supplementary rounds of the Regional Connectivity Program and the Mobile Black Spot Program  to address connectivity issues across Northern Australia.  The Peri-Urban Mobile Program will provide $16.4 million to improve network infrastructure  in the urban fringe of Australia’s major cities (the peri-urban fringe) that are prone to bushfires.  These areas include the Blue Mountains, northern parts of Sydney, the Perth and Adelaide hills  districts and the north of Melbourne.  Funding will be provided to continue and extend the Measuring Broadband Australia program  to assist consumers to select reliable, high-speed fixed-line broadband services. Fixed wireless  broadband services will now be included in the program to ensure additional regional and  emerging market segments can benefit from this information.    28 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  Next steps to 2030  Timeframe Infrastructure  Next  2 years  • Ensure 75% of homes that get a fixed line NBN can order gigabit NBN • Support rollout of 5G through the allocation of spectrum in the 26 GHz  and 850/900 MHz bands via competitive auction • Complete and assess the Alternative Voice Services Trial to inform future   approaches to the Universal Services Guarantee • Showcase successful trials of 5G use cases to promote business uptake and   promote business use cases for NBN in key sectors • Address regional Australia’s current and future infrastructure and affordability   needs with State and Territory governments  • Deliver next Regional Telecommunications Review  Next  5 years  • Expand high-speed internet and mobile coverage in regional Australia, supported by future government investments, new technologies (such as satellite) and Regional Telecommunications Reviews  • Invest in the underlying infrastructure to support next generation telecommunications technologies, such future G technologies  By  2030  • All Australians have access to high speed internet services and the ability to use it effectively  • Integrated data and technologies are making life easier    29  Cyber security, safety and trust To protect and build confidence  Security, safety and trust are essential to the digital economy. Businesses and consumers will only  actively engage in the digital economy where they are confident they can trust the technologies,  services and platforms, and they know who they are dealing with.  What has already been delivered?  The Australian Government’s Cyber Security Strategy 2020 lays a strong foundation for  Australia’s digital future with a $1.67 billion investment. The Security Legislation Amendment  (Critical Infrastructure) Bill will uplift the security and resilience of Australia’s critical infrastructure.  Elements of digital trust – such as cyber security, data security and identity assurance –  are emerging as valued commodities that can create marketable business opportunities. Through  the Cyber Security Best Practice Regulation Task Force the Government is now considering  voluntary initiatives and further legislative changes to help Australian businesses across the  economy become more resilient to cyber security threats.  The Government is also ensuring law enforcement has the powers and capabilities to investigate  and disrupt cybercrime, including on the dark web. The Surveillance Legislation Amendment  (Identify and Disrupt) Bill introduces new law enforcement powers to combat cyber-enabled crime,  including online child exploitation. The Government has also committed $164.9 million  to strengthen Australia’s counter cybercrime capability.   Increased numbers of outreach officers in the Joint Cyber Security Centres play a key role in  strengthening industry partnerships. The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) is Australia’s  lead operational cyber security agency that identifies cyber threats, provides technical cyber  security advice and guidance, and builds partnerships with critical infrastructure, industry and  government to protect Australians. The ACSC will continue to provide Australians and businesses  with advice through the one-stop-shop cyber.gov.au.  AustCyber, Australia’s Cyber Security Growth Network, and the Cyber Security Skills Partnership  Innovation Fund are supporting the pipeline of skilled cyber security professionals and supporting  cyber security solutions from business set-up to export. The Cyber Security Cooperative  Research Centre is helping governments and key stakeholders drive innovative research to  build Australia’s cyber security capacity and capability.  To support SME use of digital technologies, the Cyber Security Business Connect and  Protect program provided funding to trusted business advisers to work with SMEs  and lift their cyber security capability for the benefit of themselves and their customers.  Further, the Cyber Security Assessment Tool delivered by the Government in March 2021 provides  businesses with an online tool to regularly self-assess their cyber security maturity  and receive practical actionable advice from the ACSC to improve their cyber security.    30 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  Australia has led the world by being first to establish a government agency committed to keeping  its citizens safer online. Australia’s eSafety Commissioner has powers relating to cyberbullying,  image-based abuse, and illegal and harmful online content. The significant increase in internet  use as a result of COVID-19 also led to an increased demand for support to respond to negative  online experiences – and additional funding was provided to eSafety to deliver on this.  The new Online Safety Act will ensure better protections for all Australians through enhanced  complaints and removal schemes for child cyberbullying, image-based abuse and harmful online  content. It will also include a new adult cyber-abuse scheme and a new power to block access to  sites containing abhorrent violent material and stronger expectations and mandatory  transparency reporting for industry.  As Australians spend more of their time online, and new technologies emerge, more personal  information about individuals is being captured and processed. The review of the Privacy Act 1988  is considering whether the Act remains fit-for-purpose. Outcomes of this review will also build on  Social Media reforms that increase the maximum civil penalties under the Privacy Act 1988 and  develop a binding privacy code to apply to social media and other online platforms that trade in  personal information.  New investments for the next step change  The Australian Government is investing $31.7 million to pre-emptively identify and address the  range of security risks presented by the 5G and 6G technology that will underpin Australia’s digital  future. The Government will establish ‘Secure G’ Connectivity Test Lab in partnership with the  private sector to trial innovative approaches to network security and data protections. Looking  ahead to the next generation of communications technology, 6G security research and  development will assist in identifying potential security risks and enable the Government to take  proactive measures to secure it.   A National Data Security Action Plan will provide Government with a whole-of-economy approach  to data security uplift, and set the roadmap for the development of clear data security standards  for the entire digital economy. Consistent data security standards and controls will ensure that the  Government is able to deliver digital services underpinned by security and backed by public trust.  Additional funding of $43.8 million will be provided to expand the Cyber Security Skills  Partnership Innovation Fund for industry and education providers to deliver more projects  that meet local requirements to quickly improve the quality and quantity of cyber security  professionals in Australia.    31  The Australian Government will pilot three Cyber Hubs to enable leading agencies such as  Defence, Home Affairs and Services Australia to provide cyber services for those agencies that  cannot match their breadth and depth of skills. This will uplift the protection of the government  services and data that Australians and businesses rely on, and make it harder for malicious actors  and cyber criminals.  Next steps to 2030  Timeframe Cyber security, safety and trust  Next  2 years  • Strengthening Australia’s cyber security incentives and regulations through the  Cyber Security Best Practice Regulation Task Force and feedback from industry  • Improve protections for Australian’s privacy online and transparency of data  handling practices through the review of the Privacy Act 1988  • Deliver a review and updates to the cyber security related occupations as coded in  the Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations  Next  5 years  • Develop a cyber security skills shortage forecasting methodology and model with reporting and ongoing data collection by 2024 to more effectively target initiatives that address cyber security skills demand  • Privacy settings in place that empower consumers, protect their data and serve the Australian economy  • A National Data Security Action Plan makes public and private data more secure through the introduction of standards and policies as part of a National Data Security Action Plan  By  2030  • Strengthened cyber security and data settings supports Australian businesses and Australians to improve cyber security practices    32 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  Skills and inclusion To build digital capabilities for the future workforce  Increasing the digital capabilities of all Australians will be key to ensure we can all actively  participate in the digital economy. All jobs are increasingly requiring some level of digital skills.  New and emerging technologies are also driving a need for more advanced digital capabilities  across industries.  The Digital Transformation Expert Panel emphasised the value of lifelong learning for skills and  workforce development, business operations and for individuals. This requires high quality relevant  education and training, and strong partnerships between governments, employers and education  and training providers.  Australia’s prosperity relies on inclusion. This means all Australians being able to afford, access  and benefit from digital technology, tailored to their needs. Australians should feel well-equipped to  use digital technology confidently, safely and securely. A digitally inclusive and capable Australia  will enhance workforce participation, community engagement and access to social assistance.  What has already been delivered?  The Government’s significant investments in education, skills and training, especially during the  height of the COVID-19 pandemic, prioritised the areas most in demand for employers.  In the school system, young people are learning to use design thinking and be innovative  developers of digital solutions with the Australian Curriculum. Foundation to Year 10 Digital  Technologies Curriculum alongside the ICT General Capability involves students learning to make  the most of the digital technologies available to them, adapting to new ways of doing tasks in a  digital environment. The Australian Curriculum is being reviewed in 2021 to ensure a focus on  essential content or core concepts, that the curriculum is fit-for-purpose and is preparing  Australian students for the workplaces of the 21st century.  There have also been some extraordinary partnerships between business and education and  training institutions, with the Government’s support, to ensure that all Australians, have access  to opportunities to upskill their digital capabilities in areas that align with job opportunities and  business needs.  Eligible Australians are supported to develop their foundational digital literacy through the  Foundation Skills For Your Future program, building their capacity for workforce participation and  further education and training.    33  Digital literacy and ability are being considered as part of an Indigenous Digital Inclusion Plan  currently being developed. The Plan will consider Government investments to date to improve  Indigenous digital inclusion and identify priorities for further work. It will also have a focus on  access and affordability.  JobTrainer created a $1 billion fund shared with the states and territories to create 300,000  new training places. Combined with the 30,000 extra university places in 2021 and funding for  higher education short courses, on top of the considerable existing investment in skills and  higher education, Australians have access to learning options to suit their circumstances and  future job opportunities.  Recognising the ever increasing importance of digital capabilities for every job into the future,  many of the Government’s recent education and training measures have a focus on growing  digital skills including:  • The Job Ready Graduates Package, designed to encourage students to enrol in areas of national priority, such as IT, is reducing the maximum student contributions from $9,698 to $7,950. In addition, higher education providers will receive an increase in funding per student from $11,015 to $13,250 to further encourage providers to offer courses in IT.  • The Digital Skills Organisation is working closely with digital employers to strengthen training to meet emerging digital skills needs. Its initial focus is testing approaches to bring together employers and training providers to rapidly train individuals for digital roles, with the first project focusing on training 100 data analysts.  • The Australian Industry and Skills Committee has developed new training products in response to emerging skills needs across industry sectors, including developing cross-sector units and skills sets to address common skills needs including in the areas of big data and cyber security.  • Funding for several programs testing advanced apprenticeship-style courses, including in IT, which feature a new model of collaboration in higher education delivery between universities, industry and government. The Industry 4.0 Advanced Apprenticeship Pilot targets SMEs in key manufacturing ‘pipeline’ industries, delivering training to employees in advanced manufacturing technologies. The Women in STEM Cadetships and Advanced Apprenticeships Program supports part time study for female employees looking to upskill in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields or move into a STEM career.  Australia has an exceptionally capable and responsive higher education sector which responded  to COVID-19 by developing over four hundred subsidised six-month higher education short  courses, which were required to be delivered online. In the additional short courses being funded in  2021, 152 Information Technology short courses will be offered, making up around 18 per cent of  approved courses.    34 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  Under the Australian Government’s Job-ready Graduates reforms, $900 million has been  committed over 4 years to the National Priorities and Industry Linkage Fund (NPILF) which has  been established to support universities engage with industry and create job-ready graduates. A  key priority for the NPILF is to increase the number of STEM-skilled graduates and improve their  employment outcomes. This will help build the STEM skills necessary for Australia’s future  workforce, including in digital technologies, alongside the Advancing Women in Stem Strategy  and Action Plan 2020.  As part of the Government’s JobMaker Plan, the Global Business and Talent Attraction Taskforce  was established to help generate quality jobs for Australians. Bringing businesses and exceptional  individuals to Australia helps local industry and partners reap the benefits of their ideas, capital,  talent and networks to build clusters of excellence in priority sectors, conduct cutting-edge  research and development, and fill gaps in supply chains. This work complements the  Global Talent Visa Program, that supports highly skilled professionals to work and live  permanently in Australia.  Australia is after the brightest and best global talent to work in identified future-focused sectors  including agtech, fintech, health and defence. The visa program is designed to help grow our  digital economy and create opportunities for Australians by transferring skills, promoting  innovation, and creating jobs.    35  Case study  FROM LITTLE SKILLS COMES BIG THINGS  Funded under the Digital Business Plan, Skill Finder launched in October 2020  as a world-first - and free - micro skill marketplace available to all Australians.  The platform provides an opportunity for “every Australian to up-level their   with transferable andknowledge    useful  micro-skills, so they are prepared for  the digital world and workforce.   Adobe and Amazon  Web Services (AWS) provide cloud services to support  the website whilst  many global tech leaders including Atlassian, Canva,  MYOB, Xero, Adobe, AWS, Google, IBM, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Salesforce and  Twitter have indexed courses on the site. Skill Finder now indexes 15  Be Connected courses, with a view to working together to further promote the  Be Connected program amongst their users.  To add to its reach, the Office of the eSafety Commissioner has worked with  Skill Finder to ensure that Be Connected is included in these training  resources. Be Connected was designed for older Australians to build their  digital skills, but can be used more widely help build the digital literacy  baseline for all Australians, giving them the confidence to undertake more  complex digital courses or use these new skills to enter the workforce.  New investments for the next step change  Delivering on education and training requires strong partnerships and this is a key focus of  the next phase of investment in digital skills.  The Digital Skills Cadetship Trial will be designed and delivered with industry partners to provide  innovative trials of skilling people to fill in-demand digital jobs. The Government is investing  $10.7 million over three years to increase the number of Australians with digital skills through a  four-to-six month cadetship comprising formal training with on-the-job experience provided by  host employers.    36 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  The next National Skills Agreement being developed with the States and Territories will ensure we  continue to deliver the skills for the future workforce, together helping businesses develop the skills  they need to engage in the digital economy. Priority reforms under the Heads of Agreement for  Skills Reform include all government working together to strengthen industry engagement  in training, VET qualifications and the quality of training.  As part of the Commonwealth’s commitment to providing stronger support for foundation skills  under the Heads of Agreement for Skills Reform, the Government is expanding and uncapping the  Skills for Education and Employment program, and providing an additional $4 million over two  years to support projects that better incorporate digital skills training for job seekers.  Under the extension and expansion of the JobTrainer Fund, 10,000 places will be allocated to  digital skills courses.  To ensure that Australia will also meet its more advanced technology needs, the Government  is investing a further $22.6 million to establish the Next Generation Emerging Technology  Graduates Program and $24.7 million for the Next Generation AI Graduates over the next six years.  These will provide more than 400 competitive national scholarships in emerging technologies such  as artificial intelligence, robotics, automation, cyber security, quantum computing, blockchain and  data in priority areas identified through the National Manufacturing Priority Roadmaps.  Next steps to 2030  Timeframe Skills and inclusion  Next  2 years  • Delivering the National Skills Agreement with State and Territory Governments • Deliver Indigenous Digital Inclusion Plan • Implementing the Advancing Women in STEM Action Plan 2020 • Work with stakeholders including State and Territory governments to:  • ensure the Australian Curriculum embeds digital literacy as an essential capability demonstrated through the learning areas; and  • implement targeted training courses/microcredentials to build digital skills, and encourage workers to reskill  Next  5 years  • Increase the number of people undertaking digital skill training (higher education/ VET/microcredentials)  By  2030  • All Australians have access to digital skills • Tertiary advanced digital skills graduates will increase to more than   15,000 per year • 90% of Australians are confident using digital technology, protecting their   privacy and assessing whether information is credible    37  Systems and regulation To implement smart and modern settings to drive digitalisation  Modern regulatory settings and systems are the building blocks that will maximise productivity  and enable people, businesses and government to realise the full benefits of the digital economy.  Rules and laws should provide security and certainty while remaining fit-for-purpose and agile as  technology develops. By investing in enabling systems and digital service delivery, the Government  can deliver better outcomes for all and drive broader digital transformation.   What has already been delivered?   Enabling systems  The Australian Government has taken a world-leading position on the regulation and settings needed  for an accelerating digital economy. This is exemplified by the News Media and Digital Platforms  Mandatory Bargaining Code, which was a recommendation from the Australian Competition  and Consumer Commission’s (ACCC) Digital Platforms Inquiry (DPI). The DPI also resulted in  new six-monthly reporting by the ACCC on emerging competition issues in the markets for the supply  of digital platform services, and the commencement of a review of the Privacy Act 1988. The  Government is acting to ensure that competition settings and regulation is fit-for-purpose  in the digital age. Over the next decade, the Government will also consider issues relating to  emerging digital industries, like the gig economy, as these industries grow in relevance and play a  significant role in Australia’s digital economy. We need to ensure that the regulatory framework for  these industries remain fit-for-purpose and allow digital industries to maximise their productivity  and utility to Australians.  Australia’s Consumer Data Right (CDR) will be a game changer. The CDR is designed to give  consumers greater access to and control over their data that is held by private companies.  It improves consumers’ ability to compare and switch between products and services,  and encourages competition between service providers, leading not only to better prices and  service quality for customers but also more innovative products and services. The banking sector  is the first to be transformed by CDR, and the energy sector is next. In 2021 telecommunications  will be assessed, with a rolling program to assess and designate a new sector each year.  The Digital Business Plan and Deregulation Agenda continue to remove outdated and  burdensome regulation, and support the greater uptake of digital technology while retaining  essential safe-guards. This has enabled companies to hold virtual meetings and execute  documents electronically, and reforming the regulation of stored-value facilities to drive  competition and innovation. The Government’s renewed Deregulation Agenda supports leadership  and stewardship of fit-for-purpose regulation with a focus on lifting regulator performance across  government to drive economic recovery and growth.    38 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  It is estimated that in excess of 1.2 billion invoices are exchanged annually in Australia, and  around 90 per cent of business invoice processing is still labour-based. e-Invoicing is the digital  exchange of invoices directly between the accounting systems of a buyer and a supplier that can  deliver around $20 of savings every time an e-Invoice replaces a traditional invoice. The Australian  Government has committed to using e-Invoicing by its agencies by 1 July 2022. It will also pay  all e-Invoices under $1 million within 5 business days, improving business cash flow.  The review of the Australian payments system is also ensuring that the regulatory architecture  can support, accommodate and respond to advances in payments technology. Continued  innovation of this key economic infrastructure will be central to lowering transaction costs,  improving safety and reducing the cost to doing business.  A further $419.9 million investment was delivered in the Digital Business Plan to fully  implement the Modernising Business Registers program. This will allow businesses to  quickly view, update and maintain their business registry data in one location instead of the  more than  30 current registries.    39  Case study  MAKING LIFE EASIER FOR SMALL BUSINESS  Single Touch Payroll (STP) provides employers and tax practitioners  with digital end-to-end services to report payroll and superannuation  information, reducing compliance costs for business and allowing  pre-filling of individuals’ income tax returns and business activity statements.  More than 99 per cent of large employers and 85 per cent of small employers  are reporting through STP. This digitisation has also improved government  service delivery, most recently enabling the rapid deployment of JobKeeper,  which was life-saving support for so many businesses and workers  during COVID-19.  Strategium is a small and rapidly growing management consultancy  business based in Canberra. The transition to using STP was surprisingly  easy and did not require their bookkeeper or accountant.  STP has delivered benefits to Strategium including easier compliance easier  and a better understanding of where the money is flowing.    40 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  The Australian tax system provides a number of incentives to support businesses digitise,  adopt new technologies and innovate. Temporary full expensing allows eligible businesses  to immediately deduct the business portion of the cost of an asset in the year it is first used  or installed, encouraging investment to digitise. The Venture Capital Limited Partnerships and  Early-Stage Venture Capital Limited Partnerships incentives offer tax benefits to stimulate  venture capital investment.  The Research and Development Tax Incentive (R&DTI) provides businesses with a tax offset for  eligible R&D expenditure incurred in developing new or improved products, processes and services  that will help make Australia more competitive and create more jobs in the long-term. As part of  the economic recovery plan, the Government invested a further $2 billion through the R&DTI in the  2020-21 Budget to support business R&D investment in Australia.   Government services  The Australian Government is making investments in foundations such as digital identity and  Single Touch Payroll that are transforming the services relied on by Australians and businesses  to provide seamless service delivery.  The Digital Identity system will enable more secure and convenient engagement with government  services, and in future, the private sector. The Government invested a further $256.6 million in the  Digital Identity system in the 2020-21 Budget. Digital identity is already being used by more than  2.3 million Australians and 1.2 million businesses to access over 75 government services.  Launched in July 2018, the Online Employment Services Trial was rapidly expanded in April 2020  to support the large cohort of jobseekers accessing Government support during the COVID-19  pandemic. In excess of 1.4 million job seekers have been initially referred through the Online  Employment Services gateway, with more than 400,000 job-ready job seekers digitally  self-managing their way back to employment without the assistance of employment  services providers.   To support the delivery of the New Employment Services Model from July 2022, the Government  has invested $295.9 million over four years in Tranche 1 to deliver a new Digital Employment  Services Platform. This investment will generate considerable benefits for all users, including  jobseekers, employers and employment services providers. It will improve matching,  pre-screening and validation processes for jobseekers, assist employers and providers in  maximising employment outcomes. Future tranches will build on the foundations from the new  digital platform, maturing the capabilities and further linking with other government programs.    41  The Office of the National Data Commissioner is streamlining public sector data sharing to  promote greater use that drives innovation and economic, social and environmental benefits.  The Data Availability and Transparency Bill will set standards for safe and transparent sharing  of public sector data.  New investments for the next step change Accelerating e-Invoicing adoption across the economy is an ongoing priority for the Government.  The Government will progress a range of measures to enhance e-Invoicing’s value for businesses  and increase adoption. These include working to more closely link e-Invoicing to payments to  help businesses get paid faster, a series of education activities to raise business awareness, and  e-Invoicing pilots across key supply chains to test and drive adoption. The Government will also  progress further consultation on regulatory and non-regulatory options to accelerate e-Invoicing  adoption, and continue work with states and territories to boost adoption across Australia’s  public sector.  The Government has committed a further $111.3 million to strengthen and expand the  world-leading Consumer Data Right (CDR across the economy. It will continue to establish the  foundations of the data economy, creating new opportunities for Australian consumers and  data-driven businesses. This measure includes funding to accelerate the rollout of CDR, including  continued implementation in the banking and energy sectors and undertaking a strategic  assessment to deliver a roadmap for economy wide rollout. It will also expand Australia’s  international influence to establish an interoperable and rules-based approach to international  consumer data portability and sharing frameworks.   Customers empowered by CDR to view their data and use it to transact easily, more securely and  efficiently, will drive increased competition and data-driven innovation in Australian businesses.  They will benefit from improved services and product offerings while saving time and money. The  Government will promote Australia as an international leader in consumer data portability,  supporting our fintech exports and improving access by our consumers and businesses to data  driven services.  The Government is committing to deliver an Australian Data Strategy by late 2021 that will set  out how the Government will enhance effective, safe and secure data use from 2021 to 2025.  The Data Strategy will explore how to enable a data-driven economy through improved  economy-wide data sharing while embedding trust and security in data use. It will also outline  existing data initiatives across Government and opportunities to harmonise and streamline  approaches to minimise burden on stakeholders. For example, it will look to identify how the  CDR and supporting institutions could be further leveraged to build a data-driven economy.  Funding of $16.5 million for a pilot program that will develop data inventories for 20 per cent of  Australian Government agencies will enhance the management of government data assets.     42 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  The Digital Atlas will be a collaborative, dynamic and secure platform, based on a modernised and  updated NationalMap, which delivers advanced location data analytics and a rich data environment  compiled from accurate, authoritative and ready-to-use data sources covering people, the economy,  employment, infrastructure, health, land and the environment. It will present data against Australia’s  geography, allowing governments and other organisations to better understand and respond  to issues, including national disasters and infrastructure planning.  Figure 6  NationalMap showing mineral exploration overlaid with power  generation capacity under the National Electricity Market    43  The Australian Government is also investing in modernising regulation to reduce the burden  and improve regulatory outcomes for business. Through the $120 million Deregulation Agenda,  the Government is investing in technology to reduce regulatory impacts on business. This includes  streamlining digital services in the health sector to reduce the regulatory burden on around  400 companies that currently lodge 2,000 applications annually in the pharmaceutical,  medical technology services and medical software industries.   In addition, improved electronic monitoring systems will assist around 610 fishing businesses to more efficiently meet their regulatory requirements and will also help an estimated  1,220 commercial fishing businesses meet data provision requirements to enable more  informed decision making.   Through the Modernising Business Communications work, the Government has committed to  modernising laws within the Treasury portfolio so they are technology neutral. This will enable  easier communication between businesses, individuals and regulators. The Deregulation Agenda  will also make it easier for business to employ Australians, utilising digital solutions to assist small  business to comply with modern awards.   The Trusted Digital Identity Framework sets out the rules for the national digital identity scheme.  This Framework will make it easier and safer for people to access online services and provide  additional protections against identity crime, which is estimated to cost the economy over  $3.1 billion a year. The Government will progress legislation to enable the rollout of the Framework  to the private sector and other governments. The legislation will embed privacy, security and fraud  prevention mechanisms to build trust and confidence by those who choose to participate.    44 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  Next steps to 2030  Timeframe Systems and regulation  Next  2 years  • The ACCC to release six monthly reports on competition and consumer issues relating to digital platforms to 2025  • Review of the News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code • Progress reforms to media laws towards an end state of a platform-and-technology  neutral regulatory framework • Office of the National Data Commissioner to build inventories of data assets with  Australian Government agencies • Improve data servicing and sharing between Australian Government agencies and  trusted partners • National Disability Data asset final report on pilot outcomes, including 5 test cases,  is delivered • Modernising Business Registers: companies release (Companies Register),  including linking to director ID and significant data migration  • Continued deep dives on key regulatory issues as part of the Deregulation Agenda • Regulator Performance Guide is implemented and Ministers issue Statements of  Expectations for regulators • Implementation of CDR in energy sector and assessment of telecommunications  sector.

Promoting Australia as a safe and stable place to  do business will encourage investment and further digital trade agreements will open opportunities  for Australian businesses.  What has already been delivered?  In our region, we have negotiated high quality rules to support digital trade through the Comprehensive  and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, Regional Comprehensive Economic  Partnership and through bilateral free trade agreements. In 2020, the Australian Government signed a  ground-breaking Digital Economy Agreement with Singapore. The agreement features modern,  upgraded rules to free up data flows and increase compatibility for online trade. It sets the  conditions for Australian businesses and consumers to make the most of the digital economy.  Australia is engaging bilaterally and multilaterally to lead and influence the setting of norms,  standards and regulations for digital technologies (Figure 7). International technology standards  support Australian and global business productivity by facilitating innovation and establishing a  common language for new digital concepts and technologies. Without harmonised international  standards Australian businesses may face higher costs of doing business if they need to comply  with different standards for different markets.    46 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  Figure 7  Australia’s international engagement on digital technology     Multilateral  G7 Digital and Technology Taskforce & Working Group   WTO Joint Statement Initiative on E-commerce   Pacific Islands Forum  G20 Digital Economy Taskforce  Quad Critical and Emerging Technology Working Group   APEC’s Digital Economy Steering Group  OECD Committee on Digital Economy Policy  Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence  ASEAN-Australia Cyber Policy Dialogue   East Asia Summit  APEC’s Cebu Action Plan  Other fora  Global Forum on Cyber  Expertise  Future Tech Forum  World Economic Forum  Bilateral  Aust-US Frontier Tech Dialogue  Japan Cyber Policy Dialogue  India Cyber and Critical Tech Partnership  Malaysia-Australia Tech Exchange MoU  UK FinTech Bridge  Indonesia Cyber MoU and Dialogue  Australia-Singapore Digital Economy Agreement  Australia-US Digital Trade Agreement  Standards  International Standards  Organisation (ISO)  International Electrotechnical  Commission (IEC)  International  Telecommunications Union  ASEAN-Australian Digital  Standards Cooperation   Initiative  In 2020 the Australian Government allocated $5.9 million over three years to step up our  leadership, influence and uptake of international standards. Funding will include support  to Australian peak standards and conformance bodies and a dedicated boost to digital,  critical technology and critical minerals standards work. Having more Australian experts  participate in more international standards committees will build our capability to apply  international standards and help businesses to use them. It will also help Australian  businesses capture new markets opportunities and maintain their global competitiveness.  In 2021, Australia’s Services Exports Action Plan was announced to promote an internationally  competitive services sector that boosts Australian exports. This Plan sets out immediate actions  to help Australia’s economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and long-term goals for  strengthening the competitiveness of Australian service suppliers into the future, including through  data flows, international rules and developing world-class skills and talent.   The Digital Business Plan provided measures to support the growth of the Australian  fintech sector, including options to drive fintech adoption and expand the FinTech Bridge.    47  Case study  TAKING AUSTRALIAN INNOVATION TO THE WORLD  Melbourne-based Zed Technologies shows how Australian digital health  ideas can accelerate overseas growth. With a cloud-based service, the  company has partnered with an Indonesian med-tech company for its  cloud-based service to give patients access to their X-rays, MRIs, scans and  ultrasounds through an app. Sharing medical images using the cloud  isn’t new, but what makes Zed Technologies unique is its focus on patients.  The digital technology means patients don’t need to carry physical scans  around with them. It also means that specialists anywhere in the world can  examine a scan and provide a remote diagnosis.   And with a trusted local partner, Zed Technologies is powering  fastest growing medical-technology markets in Southeast Asia.  With a world-leading product, the company has been quick to grow overseas.  From its genesis in 2012, Zed has scaled up, with Australian Government  support, into new markets starting with Singapore, then Indonesia, and now  into Europe. The company has grown over 30 per cent year on year and now  delivers over 9 million scans a year to doctors and 3.5 million scans  to patients.   into one of the     48 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  Growing, protecting and promoting Australia’s critical and  emerging technologies  Australia’s international engagement seeks to shape the design, development and use of secure,  resilient and trusted technology in line with Australia’s values and interests. Our engagement is  guided by core principles and values of human rights, rules of law, fairness, open competition,  security, transparency, respect and integrity. Australia’s Ambassador for Cyber Affairs and Critical  Technology, guided by Australia’s International Cyber and Critical Tech Engagement Strategy, has  an important role in ensuring Australia benefits from the growth of a connected, prosperous and  resilient Indo-Pacific enabled by safe and secure critical technologies. As an important participant  in global economic, scientific and technology ecosystems, Australia will work with other nations to  shape the ecosystems in a way that not only enhances our security and prosperity, but supports  positive security outcomes for all nations.   Critical and emerging technologies have the capacity to significantly enhance Australia’s national  interests. Critical technologies are often enabled by and reliant on digital networks and can include  technologies (or applications of technologies) such as Smart Cities, AI, 5G and next generation  communications, IoT, quantum computing and synthetic biology.   To assist organisations – including governments and businesses of all sizes – in making  decisions about trusted suppliers and the transparency of their own products, the Australian  Government is also developing Critical Technology Supply Chain Principles in consultation with  industry.  The Principles fall under the three pillars of transparency, security-by-design, and autonomy  and integrity.   In 2019 the Australian Government released a set of voluntary AI Ethics Principles to encourage  Australian organisations using AI systems to adopt and develop this technology in a transparent  and safe way. Australia is one of 42 countries that have signed up to the OECD Principles on  AI that sets out international standards to ensure these systems are designed to be robust,  fair and trustworthy. Australia also committed to the G20’s Human Centred AI Principles, released  as part of the Ministerial Statement on Trade and Digital Economy in 2019.  Our participation in the Global Partnership on AI is also fostering international collaboration  on the responsible use and development of AI.    49  Next steps to 2030  Timeframe Trade and international engagement  Next  2 years  • Engaging with Singapore on establishment of a fintech bridge which would include  enhanced regulatory cooperation, support for fintech firms, and safe and secure  data sharing  • Implementing the AI Ethics framework for business and government • Implementing the 2021 International Cyber and Critical Technology Strategy • Critical Technology Supply Chain Principles incorporated into Australian   Government decision making practices, as an exemplar for international partners  and industry to securely develop and adopt critical technologies  • The Quad Critical and Emerging Technology Working Group will continue work to  ensure that critical and emerging technology is governed and operates according  to shared interests and values  Next  5 years  • Working with trade partners to support implementation of international  commitments on digital trade, including in South East Asia  • Negotiating high quality digital trade rules building on existing free trade agreements  • Co-chairing the WTO Joint Statement Initiative on E-commerce and negotiating  the first set of global digital trade rules  • Progressive build and implementation of Regional Data Hub  By  2030  • Australia’s engagement in digital standards and international standard setting forums promotes our democratic values and technology that is secure-by-design    50 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030    EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES  ARE OPENING NEW     OPPORTUNITIES    Digital technologies and new business models will boost productivity, create jobs, solve the  real-world problems of today and grow the businesses and sectors of tomorrow. We are using  technology such as drones, robotics, 3D printing and blockchain now. By 2030 we would expect to  see breakthroughs in emerging technologies that can transform the Australian economy. These are  likely to include artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, nanotechnology, cognitive science,  energy capture and storage, more connected devices through increased penetration of the Internet  of Things (IoT), and the further advancement of existing technologies with undeveloped potential.   In addition, new technological fields may result from the convergence of different technologies. For  example, where voice, data, video are brought together to share resources and interact.  Hyperautomation will combine AI, robotic process automation, machine learning and  other automation technologies to create interoperable systems of automation. The increase in end- to-end automation will drive efficiency, streamline processes and prioritise higher value work.   Understanding how these technologies are developing and the potential applications and risks that  need to be managed, is essential to delivering the right policy and regulatory settings to support  uptake across the economy. The Government, through organisations like Data61 and the Centre of  Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, is building its capability to  assess technology developments that keep Australia at the digital frontier.  By better understanding the technologies of today and preparing for the technologies of  the future, Australia is well placed to embrace new opportunities.  51    52 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030   KEY TECHNOLOGIES SHAPING AUSTRALIA’S FUTURE TO 2030  Artificial Intelligence: a collection of technologies that can be used  to solve problems autonomously and perform tasks to achieve  defined objectives, in some cases without the explicit guidance  from a human being.  Internet of Things: the network of physical objects that  are able to connect to the Internet.  Data Analytics: the analysis of raw datasets using specialised  computers and software.  Blockchain: a software solution that allows data to be verified and  stored in a distributed network, thereby reducing single points of  failure, mitigating fraud, and enabling the automated execution of  agreements via smart contracts.  Quantum Computing: storing and processing information by  manipulating the behaviour of individual atoms, ions,  electrons or photons.    53  Case studies  AUSTRALIAN BUSINESSES AT THE DIGITAL FRONTIER  Cybersecurity using quantum Canberra-headquartered QuintessenceLabs uses quantum physics to  develop a suite of data security tools that strongly protect systems from  cyber-crime. These tools are in use by major financial corporations, cloud  providers, governments and defence agencies, across the globe, and  include the world’s fastest random number generator, advanced  encryption key management and quantum key distribution to strengthen  enterprise-scale encryption. QuintessenceLabs is also working on using  quantum-encrypted communications in space. In 2018, QuintessenceLabs   was selected by the World Economic Forum as a Technology Pioneer, for  its work in quantum-based cybersecurity solutions.  Leveraging blockchain for contracts  Piper Alderman has become the first Australian legal firm to execute a  blockchain-based payment guarantee in a commercial contract, and may be  the first law firm in the world to do it. Piper Alderman partnered up with  Lygon, a blockchain business which includes CBA, Westpac, and ANZ as  shareholders. Using Lygon fast tracks the bank guarantee issue, redemption  and return process, cutting costly paper trails and effectively eliminating the  risk of fraud. In 2018, Piper Alderman became one of the first major law  firms to accept digital currencies for settlements of bills, leading the way in  alternative payments for clients in the growing blockchain space.    54 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  What has already been delivered?  New infrastructure, like 5G and further investment in the NBN, will provide significantly faster data  transmission speeds and the increased development of IoT. The Australian 5G innovation initiative  will fund small to large businesses to test and develop 5G uses, applications, services and products.   Improved data access and use will also enable new products and services to be developed that will  transform everyday life, drive efficiency and safety, create productivity gains, and allow better  decision-making. Data will power much of the transformative technology such as AI, machine  learning and predictive analytics. Business models will need to adapt to the unification of data,  personalised customer experiences, and cybersecurity. The Consumer Data Right will support  innovative data-driven businesses to develop better products and services and increase Australia’s  productivity.   Australia is home to a number of world-first blockchain applications. Combining blockchain  technology with other technologies can add economic value to a range of business sectors.  The National Blockchain Roadmap highlights some of the enormous opportunities blockchain  technology can enable across our whole economy and provides the signposts for the future  development of this technology. The Digital Business Plan announced funding for two blockchain  pilots that will demonstrate the technology’s potential to reduce business compliance costs.  Quantum computing has the potential to transform the information economy and create the  industries of the future – solving complex solutions in hours or minutes. Australian researchers  have established global leadership in quantum information. The Government has funded the Centre  of Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology (CQC²T),  an international collaboration between seven Australian universities and more than 25 partners to  form one of the largest combined efforts in quantum computation and communication research in  the world. It has also co-funded an Australian quantum computing company—Silicon Quantum  Computing Pty Ltd to produce a prototype quantum computer chip—the first step in building a fully- functional quantum computer.  New investments for the next step change  The expansion of the world-leading Consumer Data Right will continue to strengthen the  foundations of the data economy, while the Australian Data Strategy will explore how to enable  a data-driven economy through improved economy-wide data sharing while embedding trust and  security in data use. These initiatives will create new opportunities for data-driven businesses and  technologies.  Australia is a world leader in computer vision, deep learning, field robotics, neural networks  and machine learning. Only one other country in the world produces more AI research per capita  than Australia.25 These strengths provide a solid foundation for an AI-enabled economy.  The Government’s $124.1 million over six years for the AI Action Plan will set out the Government’s  plan to build Australia’s AI capability to grow the economy, support industry competitiveness, create  jobs and improve lives. This will include modernising manufacturing and farming activites,  improving diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and enhancing our defence capabilities.    55  Emerging aviation technologies could add $14.5 billion to GDP over the next 20 years, and create  around 5,500 additional jobs.26 The Government will partner with industry to deliver grants to  support the use of emerging aviation technologies (such as electric engines, drones and electric  Vertical Take-off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft) to address priority community, mobility and cargo  needs in regional Australia. These partnerships will be supported by improved regulation for  these emerging technologies through the development of a Drone Rule Management System  and National Drone Detection Network, working with other levels of government. We have also  delivered a National Emerging Aviation Technology Policy Statement.  Next steps to 2030  Timeframe Emerging technologies  Next  2 years  • Increasing Australian business investment in digital technologies, including emerging technologies like AI  • Implementing the National Blockchain Roadmap and blockchain pilots • Improving research collaboration and commercialisation to support the adoption of  AI tailored to Australian needs across the economy  Next  5 years  • Increased domestic capability in key industry sectors including manufacturing, agriculture and defence  By  2030  • Digitally intensive industries will employ more than 10% of the Australian workforce • Australia is a global leader in the development and adoption of trusted, secure and  responsible AI technology • More Australian sectors are operating at the digital frontier    56 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030    57  LIFTING OUR AMBITION:  DIGITAL GROWTH PRIORITIES  Building on the investments to secure the foundations to grow the digital economy, the Australian  Government has identified four priority areas for strategic focus where we can partner with the  private sector to position Australia as a leading digital economy and society by 2030. These are:  • Digital SMEs – lifting digital capability and adoption across the economy to support new ways to work and do business. This will increase profitability and save businesses time.  • Modern Industry sectors – supporting globally competitive export sectors operating at the digital frontier, including manufacturing, mining, agriculture and construction.  • Dynamic and emerging tech sector – building emerging technology capability and accelerating the growth of tech start-ups in areas like fintech and regtech that can drive an uplift in the rest of the economy.  • Digital government and services – delivering simple, secure and trusted essential services for frictionless interactions.  Digital SMEs Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Small Business Digital Taskforce Report 2018 showed many  SMEs struggled to understand how digital technology could generate growth and productivity  benefits for their business. SME engagement with digital products was low, with only half of  businesses having a web presence, 40 per cent using cloud services, and very few citing cyber  security as a priority.27  Over 2020, the pandemic made it an imperative for many Australian SMEs to actively engage with  digital technology to adapt to changed conditions. Nearly 9 in 10 Australian firms adopted new  technologies to improve their business continuity during COVID-19, with 13 per cent recognising  that technology tools were essential to their operations.28  Many businesses found these new digital channels opened up opportunities for growth and  improved overall productivity.29 Within one year, for example, Australian SMEs achieved more  growth in web presence, use of digital payroll tools, and use of digital stock control processes than  they had in the previous 10 years combined, and 37 per cent of the more digitally advanced firms  increased productivity either slightly or significantly over this time.30  While more SMEs are beginning to take up digital tools, the gap between connected and  disconnected businesses has deepened. The broader barriers identified in 2018 have not been  eliminated. Micro-firms remain 75 per cent less likely to adopt digital technology to support     58 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  business processes like strategic planning, and less than 40 per cent of micro-and-small firms use  digital tools to support planning, marketing or production processes.31  Many SMEs are unaware that digital technology is a function that can define the pathway towards a  solution. Despite the depth of support available from both the private sector and across government,  many firms continue to face ongoing challenges when considering digital adoption.  Over the next decade, the Government will focus on lifting digital capability and adoption across the  economy to support new ways to work and do business, increasing profitability and saving time.

Since 2018, the Australian Small Business Advisory Services program has helped around 22,000  small businesses on their digital journey. The Government committed an additional $9 million in the  2020-21 Budget to extend the program to provide low-cost independent, expert and tailored advice to  an additional 10,000 small business.  The Digital Readiness Assessment Tool provides tools, advice and information for businesses to  understand where they are in their digital journey while the Small Business Digital Champions Project  provided free sector-specific digital advisory services covering topics such as technology trends,  adoption, hardware, software, cyber security, digital training, planning and support. The Government is  also working with big businesses to identify what they can and will do to support their SME partners  along the digitalisation journey.  New investments for the next step change  The Government is empowering businesses to grow investment in digital technologies by allowing  taxpayers to self-assess the effective life of certain intangible assets, which would better match the  tax treatment of such assets with the period of time they provide economic benefits to the taxpayer.  An expanded Digital Solutions – Australian Small Business Advisory Service will provide $12.7 million  to provide high-quality, low cost, independent advice to 17,000 Australian small business in 2021-22.  This funding extends the 2020-21 expansion for a further year to assist small businesses to build  their digital capabilities, use digital technologies and build business continuity and resilience.  The expansion of this program includes a pilot program servicing not-for-profit organisations.   The Digital Business-to-Business Partnerships initiative capitalises on the trusted relationships that  Australia’s corporate sector has with SMEs to promote the adoption, use and access to digital  products and services. Through a public commitment a number of leading Australian businesses and  industry associations will pledge to directly and actively support SMEs in their digital transformation.  Next steps to 2030  Timeframe Digital SMEs  Next  2 years  • Work with stakeholders to lift business-to-business partnerships that encourage SMEs to build digital capability through existing or new digital products and services  Next  5 years  • e-Invoicing is adopted across the private sector and more businesses process payments online  By  2030  • All new businesses are born digital • 95% of all SMEs have a digital presence or are using digital processes.    60 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  Modern industry sectors To compete in increasingly globalised markets, Australian businesses need to grow their use of  digital technologies, infrastructure and services and build their digital capability or risk falling  behind their international counterparts. Enabling technology solutions and uptake across all  Australian sectors will unlock productivity gains and create new products, markets and industries,  growing Australia’s jobs, income and export opportunities.  Every sector has a lot to gain from using digital tools. For example, the mining sector is adopting  automation, software, robotics and data analytics to improve supply chain efficiencies and  enhance safety.  Over the next decade, the Government will focus on supporting globally competitive export sectors  operating at the digital frontier, including manufacturing, mining, agriculture and construction.  What has already been delivered?   The Modern Manufacturing Strategy is designed to ensure Australian manufacturers scale-up,  become more competitive and more resilient. By making strategic investments and harnessing  Australia’s world-class science and research, we are opening up new markets to export high-quality  products to the rest of the world. As demonstrated in Figure 9, the adoption of digital tools will be  an important contributor to achieve this uplift.  The Defence Transformation Strategy include a focus on strengthening Defence’s approach to  Australian industry capability, including innovation, export and harnessing opportunities from  Australian science and technology.  Australia’s Technology Investment Roadmap is a strategy to accelerate development and  commercialisation of low emissions technologies.  New investments for the next step change  The Agriculture 2030 package will drive productivity through innovation, encourage private sector  investment and strengthen Australia’s biosecurity systems. The digital technologies used in  screening for pests that could harm Australia’s agricultural production will be enhanced and the  capability of the sector to adopt digital tools will be improved through better skills and data.  The Government is investing in the rollout of the National Freight Data Hub following extensive  consultation and testing. By improving national freight data industry and governments can plan,  make better operational and investment decisions and be more resilient and responsive.    61  Next steps to 2030  Timeframe Modern industry sectors  Next  2 years  • Work with stakeholders including State and Territory governments to identify ways to lift sectors where digitalisation can drive greater productivity  • Launch of full Freight Data Hub with enhanced freight data, insights, project and standards information  Next  5 years  • Innovative products and technologies are being developed and adopted within Australian sectors including manufacturing, agriculture and defence  • Origin and traceability systems are enhanced to provide quality assurance of Australian goods in global markets  • Through implementation of the Modern Manufacturing Strategy, Australian manufacturers are collaborating and using smart manufacturing to respond to new and emerging opportunities, consumer trends and market demands  • Enhanced cross-sector collaboration on technology adoption  By  2030  • Digitally intensive industries will employ more than 10% of the Australian workforce  • More Australian sectors are operating at the digital frontier    62 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  Figure 9  Digital economy aligning with the National Manufacturing Priorities   Digital Opportunities:  National Manufacturing Priorities  Foundations to grow the  Digital Economy  • Infrastructure – NBN, 5G,  Regional Connectivity  • Skills – data analysts, software and  web developers  • Systems and regulation • Safety and security • Trade and international engagement  Emerging technology opening  new opportunities  • AI, IoT, data analytics, blockchain,  quantum computer  Growing our ambitions  • Digital SMEs • Modern industry sectors • Dynamic and emerging tech sector • Digital government and services  Aligning with:  • $1.5 billion Modern  Manufacturing Strategy,  including the $1.3 billion  Modern Manufacturing  Initiative grants.  • Helping Australian  manufacturing to scale-up,  become more competitive  and resilient.  • Making science and  technology work for industry by  backing digital transformation  The Modern Manufacturing Strategy supports getting the economic conditions right  for manufacturers, including settings that support use of digital technologies.  Future growth opportunities have been identified across the six National Manufacturing  Priorities. Many of these opportunities recognise that further use of digital technologies  will enable scale, competitiveness and resilience in Australian manufacturing.     63  Medical Products  opportunities  • Digitally integrated products and  platforms, including digitising existing  medical products, emerging data-driven  products and advanced manufacturing.  • Using smart medical devices, and  analysing the data generated, to make  better health decisions.  • Using data analytics, robotics and  automation to produce high-value  medicines and cutting edge treatments  Food & Beverage  opportunities  • Smart manufacturing, such as: • AI and advanced data analysis in   automation of continuous and batch  control systems  • AI and robotics in logistics/distribution  chains (e.g. high speed palletising)  • AI, big data and advanced analytics to  monitor systems (e.g. temperature).  • Food safety, origin and traceability  systems.

The sector helps to build Australia’s skills base by delivering well-paid, highly skilled jobs,  and supports innovation and productivity in almost every other sector through the development  and adoption of tailored technology solutions. It also delivers value to Australians by improving  the quality of service delivery in a range of applications from online banking, contactless payments  and online entertainment through to accessing government services.  Australia has a strong history of developing new technologies, which have generated huge  economic and social benefits worldwide. Some of these include Wi-Fi, polymer banknotes,  the cochlear implant (bionic ear) to assist with hearing, spray-on skin for burns victims,  pacemakers, Google Maps and the flight recorder blackbox that helps keep commercial air  travel safe. Australia has organic growth in fintech, regtech, agritech and creative industries like  game and film production.  Overall, the sector is comparatively small relative to other economies and there is significant  room to grow. Innovation and investment in this sector has been stalling and new ideas are not  regularly translated into commercial outcomes.  Over the next decade, the Government will focus on building emerging technology capability and  accelerating the growth of tech start-ups in areas like fintech and regtech to drive an uplift in the  rest of the economy.  What has already been delivered?  The Government invested an additional $2 billion through the Research and Development Tax  Incentive in the 2020-21 Budget to help innovative businesses that invest in R&D. Business  investment in R&D is central to the development of new products, processes and services that  will help make Australia more competitive and create more jobs in the long-term.  Building on Australia’s strong financial services foundations, the Australian Government  is providing a supportive policy environment that will allow the fintech sector to grow.  Australia’s fintech industry has a reputation for quality and diverse product offerings and is  maturing at a rapid rate. The CDR, Enhanced Regulatory Sandbox and the UK-Australia FinTech  Bridge enable safe data sharing, innovation across borders and support for the flourishing  Australian fintech ecosystem, which included more than 730 active fintechs in 2020.32  The Fintech100 report nominated seven Australian firms as being among the best fintech  innovators from around the world.33    65  The National Blockchain Roadmap will drive the long-term development and adoption of this  technology in Australia. The Digital Business Plan announced funding for two blockchain pilots  that will demonstrate the technology’s potential to reduce business compliance costs.  The National Transport Technology Action Plan outlines Australia’s priorities for implementing  new transport technologies, which have been developed in partnership with the states,  territories and industry.   New investments for the next step change  Better and smarter use of data can improve performance, reduce overheads and create value for  customers. Businesses using AI are performing 11.5 per cent better than those who are not.34  Despite this enthusiasm, Australia is estimated to be about 34 per cent behind global peers  in realising the economic benefits of digital innovation. In the 2021-22 Budget the Australian  Government’s $124.1 million AI Action Plan will help Australia maximise the benefits of AI for  all Australians and manage the potential challenges. These investments will also support digital  SMEs and modern industry sectors. Under the plan we are investing:  • $53.8 million to create the National Artificial Intelligence Centre that will drive business  adoption of AI technologies by establishing up to four strategic AI and Digital Capability  Centres that will provide SMEs with a ‘front door’ for AI talent, knowledge and resources.  Coordinated by CSIRO’s Data 61, the Centre will support the development of new AI solutions  with a commercial application by linking our leading AI researchers with firms able to  commercialise that research into high-end products and services.  • $33.7 million to support six industry pilots under AI solutions to build a stronger Australia for  businesses to partner with government to develop AI-based solutions to challenges that have  significant spill-over benefits for job creation, economic recovery and other social benefits.  • $24.7 million in the skills of the future by establishing the Next Generation AI Graduates  Program that will attract and train home-grown, job-ready AI specialists through competitive  national scholarships.  • $12 million to support exemplar applications of AI that will catalyse the AI opportunity in our  Regions by co-funding 36 competitive grants for AI opportunities to be deployed to help solve  local or regional problems.  In the 2021-22 Budget the Government will partner with other levels of government and  industry to deliver $32.6 million in grants to support the use of emerging aviation technologies  (such as electric engines, drones and electric Vertical Take-off and Landing aircraft) to address  priority community, mobility and cargo needs in regional Australia. These partnerships will be  supported by improved regulation through the development of a Drone Rule Management  System and National Drone Detection Network.    66 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  The Government is also providing tax support through the 30 per cent refundable digital games tax  offset that will make Australia an attractive destination for digital talent and grow a viable export  industry. With support, the Australian games industry could generate up to $1 billion per year and  employ 10,000 full-time workers within the decade.35 Gaming sector talent has transferable digital  capabilities that Australia could apply to range of sectors, including defence, health, education and  construction. Consultation with industry in mid-2021 will inform the criteria and definition of  qualifying expenditure to support the development of digital games.  Case study  A MIGHTY KINGDOM OF DIGITAL CAPABILITIES  Mighty Kingdom has created games for some of the world’s leading toy  and entertainment giants, including Disney, LEGO, Australian Red Cross,  Sony, Funcom, Rogue, and Snapchat. The South Australian company  employs 120 people.   The company successfully listed on the Australian Securities Exchange  in 2021 and is one of few Australian- based games companies listed.  Mighty Kingdom operates in the global gaming market, which is  forecast to reach US$200 billion by 2023. The company also  actively supports Adelaide’s games ecosystem, building skills and  attracting local and international investors.     67  To support Australian companies to engage and retain the talent they need to compete  on a global scale, the Government will ensure that employees that receive a tax-deferred  Employee Share Scheme do not become subject to tax when their employment ceases.  Employee Share Schemes are particularly important for businesses that are unable to offer  competitive wages during their growth stage.  The Australian venture capital market is currently supported by tax incentives designed to  attract foreign investment and encourage venture capitalists to invest in early-stage Australian  companies to drive innovation and additional investment. The Government will undertake a  review of venture capital tax concessions to ensure current arrangements are fit-for-purpose  and support genuine early-stage Australian start-ups.  Next steps to 2030  Timeframe Dynamic and emerging tech sector  Next  2 years  • Completing two industry-led pilots that demonstrate the application of blockchain technology to reduce regulatory compliance costs and encourage broader take up of productivity boosting blockchain technology by Australian businesses  • Reviewing Australia’s readiness for automated road vehicles with a focus on trials, regulation, infrastructure and public attitudes in collaboration with States and Territories  • RegTech Commercialisation Initiative – deliver four challenges and up to eight proof of concepts  Next  5 years  • Establishing a national automated vehicle (AV) regulatory framework to enable the  safe and legal operation of AVs on Australia’s roads  • Develop the next iteration of the National Land Transport Technology Action Plan  (2024-2027) to operationalise a national coordinated approach for deploying digital  technologies for land transport in collaboration with States and Territories  • Ensure tax concessions continue to be fit-for-purpose to encourage start-ups and venture capital in Australia  By  2030  • Increased GVA value contributed by tech businesses launched in Australia • Australia is a global leader in the development and adoption of trusted, secure and  responsible AI technology    68 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  Digital government and services Digital technology is changing how people and businesses interact with government to access  essential services. Only a few years ago, we operated in a world where tax returns were lodged on  paper forms, Medicare claims were made in person, and reporting income to Centrelink required  regular phone calls. Today more services are completed online, and information already held by  the Government is used to help complete applications for new services. COVID-19 demonstrated  the benefit of Government adopting digital solutions for a range of issues including procurement,  service delivery, regulation and policy making.  Australians rightly expect continuous service improvements from government in the same way they  do from their banks, telecommunication provider and any other service providers. Australia already  performs well in government service delivery relative to other countries. Australia was second  for E-Government in the IMD’s 2019 Digital Competitiveness rankings and fifth in the UN 's 2020  E-Government Survey. We also rank second on the open data index. However, there is always  room for improvement.  To allow business-led growth it will be essential to continue to lower regulatory barriers  to investment. Modernising regulation, whether around competition, consumer protection, finance,  safety or security will remove the hand brake on innovation. Through smart regulatory design and  working with the sector, Australia can open up new economic opportunities while ensuring the  benefits of the digital era deliver broader public benefit.  Given digital technologies allow easier access to international markets it will be important  to continue to open, and advocate for the benefits of, global markets and the rules-based  trading system.  Over the next decade, the Government will focus on delivering simple, secure and trusted  essential services for frictionless interactions.  What has already been delivered?   myGov was introduced to make it easier for Australians to access their personal government  services. It is now the Australian Government’s largest and most recognised government platform,  with approximately 500,000 logins each day and more than 19.8 million active myGov accounts.  myGov provides access to multiple services with one login: My Health Record, the National  Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), Medicare, myTax, Centrelink, Child Support, Australian  Job Search, Department of Veterans’ Affairs, HousingVic Online Services and National Redress  Scheme and My Aged Care.    69  Digital Identity will give Australian people and businesses a single, secure way to use government  services online. Creating a Digital Identity is like doing a 100-point identification check. It removes  the need to visit a shopfront with your identity documents. Digital Identity is already being used  by over 2.3 million Australians and 1.2 million businesses to access over 75 government services.  Digital Identity ensures personal information is securely encrypted and stored in Australia and no  personal information is presented through a double blind system. The proposed new legislation for  the Digital Identity system will extend these protections and standards to businesses and state and  territory governments who will use the digital identity.  Delivering on the Government’s Deregulation Agenda through simple changes to complex  processes, for example, joining up services in the Therapeutic Goods Administration to provide an  estimated $2 million per year in reduced compliance costs. This change helps ensure Australians  have the quickest possible access to medicines and medical technologies. Sponsors will now be  able to use an electronic database with automatic data transfer – saving them up to 15 minutes  per report. Early childhood education and care approval processes were also streamlined by  merging the application process to meet requirements under both Commonwealth and state  government law. The change will save 5,100 hours per year for prospective applicants for the  Commonwealth’s Child Care Subsidy - a reduction of 75 per cent on current processing times.  Case study  DIGITAL RECORDS SAVING LIVES  The Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) provides emergency and primary  health care services for those living in rural, remote and regional areas of  Australia who cannot access a hospital or general practice due to the vast  distances of the Outback. As an online summary of key health information,  the My Health Record system can assist overcoming this geographical  barrier. Where an individual has a My Health Record, RFDS can access this  electronic record, removing the need for paper based patient information.  Information in a patient’s My Health Record could include details such  as discharge summaries, medication and pathology and radiology  reports performed elsewhere when providing both emergency and  ongoing treatment.  RFDS clients receiving specialist services at tertiary hospitals in metropolitan  centres are sometimes under considerable stressors such as leaving  community, minimal social supports and dealing with new life changing  health diagnosis.    70 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  That’s where access to My Health Record becomes invaluable - the chronic  disease coordinator from the RFDS may be able to access this information  through My Health Record when providing care back in the remote community.   The ability of the My Health Record system to provide health care information  whenever and wherever it is needed is supporting the RFDS and Australians  living in regional and rural areas.  New investments for the next step change  The Government is making a further $200.1 million investment in myGov to better connect  and deliver essential government services by streamlining and tailoring online interactions for  individuals and businesses. The enhancements will improve the functionality of myGov, making  it easier and faster for people to engage with government. It will deliver smart and personalised  interactions with government – allowing Australians to see a summary of all their interactions with  government in one place, reminders to lodge returns or report income and proactive identification of services based on life events.    71  The Government is further investing in the infrastructure to digitally enable health care in Australia  through the next wave of My Health Record. This will support innovation in health technology to  safely and securely integrate new functions. In addition, by leveraging connection and digitisation,  older Australians will be better supported when moving between care environments as their health  information will follow them digitally. Australia will be one of the first countries in the world to  enable its people to truly hold their healthcare in their hand, providing for a richer experience and  interaction with healthcare services.  The Digital Transformation Agency has a refocused mandate and will be better able to  add value across the APS through a transfer to the Department of the Prime Minister  and Cabinet. Its functions have also been updated to deliver strategic and policy leadership  on whole-of-government and shared ICT investments and digital service delivery.  Through the Deregulation Agenda the government will continue to build foundations for  future regulatory reform work, supporting innovative digital solutions and best practice approaches  to regulation that benefits Australians.   Next steps to 2030  Timeframe Lifting our ambition: Digital government and services  Next   2 years  • Complete core build of the Identity Management Services including APIs for  integrating with the Permissions Platform  • Refresh of the Digital Transformation Strategy to reflect changing expectations of government service delivery and keep accelerating the  transformation of government  • Release of the Commonwealth Digital Health Blueprint 2030 that will direct and  prioritise the Commonwealth’s substantial investment in digital health initiatives  to support national long-term health priorities and critical needs identified by  healthcare providers and consumers  • Refresh of the National Digital Health Strategy that sets out agreed priority areas  and to support the national health priorities  Next  5 years  • More government services available through myGov as it becomes a whole-of-government, end-to-end service delivery platform  By  2030  • Increasingly frictionless government service delivery • All Australian Government services securely available online • Significant majority of Australians over 18 are registered for myGovID   or another trusted digital identity    72 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  KEY INVESTMENTS IN  THE 2021-22 BUDGET  In the 2021-22 Budget the Government is continuing to invest in strengthening foundational  settings and providing targeted funding for digital growth priorities.  As digital technologies become a more important driver for all Australian businesses  and sectors, a more co-ordinated approach to developing relevant policies and regulation  will ensure greater success.

The Government’s $2 billion investment over the last two Budgets are building  the foundations for the digital economy, building capability in emerging technology and setting  digital growth priorities.  In tracking progress to 2030 we will be guided by the following:  • Government must be an exemplar in its own delivery of services, and seize the opportunities  afforded by data and digital technology.  • Government must act with partners – exemplified by lessons learned during COVID-19  where business came to government offering support and assistance.  • Focusing on delivering for the future and preparing ourselves for how data and digital  technologies can be applied to solve the challenges ahead of us.  • Data and digital must be underpinned by security and trust. By embedding security and trust  into all we do, better services will be delivered for Australians. This will cement our  international reputation as a trusted partner with people-centred values.  The work to plan and prepare for a digital future does not end with the Digital Business Plan nor  the package of measures under the Digital Economy Strategy. There is a breadth and depth of work  underway across government that means the Digital Economy Strategy will continue to evolve.  To support this work, the Government is extending the Digital Technology Taskforce. The Taskforce  will monitor implementation of the Strategy as well as developments in emerging technologies to  inform policy and regulatory development.  The Strategy lays out a vision of what a digital Australia may look like in 2030 and what the role of  government will be to enable, incentivise, build capabilities, and deliver its services. To be a leading  digital economy and society by 2030, Australia will need to grow its digital capabilities, for our jobs,  for our people, and to be able to move above and beyond whatever comes next.  There is a lot already in train as the roadmap following shows. It will be important to track progress  across government in delivering on the vision as well as through the ambitions, indicators and targets  in the Strategy. We will learn more as measures are delivered and digital technologies advance.  The Digital Economy Strategy will be a living Strategy and will continue to evolve to ensure we  remain on track and be adjusted where needed.    76 DIGITAL ECONOMY STRATEGY 2030  Roadmap to 2030 and  measures of success  2021  2 yrs  Digital Skills Organisation  Data Analysts Pilot  Delivering the National  Data Security Action Plan   Delivering AI Action Plan  Delivering more  connectivity to the  regions and peri-urban  areas  Cyber Security  Connect &  Protect for SMEs  Cyber Security  Skills Partnerships  Innovation Fund  Australian  Data Strategy  Developing  intergovernmental  agreement to support  national data sharing  between governments  The National AI Centre  and Digital Capability  Centres are driving  business adoption and  use of AI technologies  by 2022  Consumer Data  Right – Energy  sector  Release the Commonwealth  Digital Health Blueprint 2030  Digital Atlas  of Australia  RegTech  Commercialisation  Initiative – deliver  four challenges and  8 proof of concepts  by 2023  Digital Identity  legislation  Digital Skills  Cadetships Trial  Next Generation  AI Graduates in  the workplace  All Australian Government  agencies using e-Invoicing and  paying e-Invoices under $1 million  within 5 business days    77  5 yrs 10 yrs  2030  Consumer Data  Right: yearly  assessment  and designation  of a new sector  Establishing a national automated  vehicle (AV) regulatory framework  Showcase successful  trials of 5G use cases to  promote business uptake  Increasing number of people undertaking  a digital skill training course (higher  education/ VET/ microcredentials)  National Land  Transport Action Plan  Increasing  number of digital  agreements with  like-minded partners  Modernising Business Registers:  Professional Registers implemented  and decommissioning  e-Invoicing is  rolled out across  the private sector  to encourage all  businesses to  process payments  online.

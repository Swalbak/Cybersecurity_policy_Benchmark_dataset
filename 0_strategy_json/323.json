Introduction  The main directions of the future development strategy of the Republic of Azerbaijan are the achievement of sustainable economic growth and progress and diversification of the economy due to the development of the non-oil sector. For this purpose, it is intended to create and develop strong motivational mechanisms for reducing the natural resources factor and ensuring the superiority of the non-oil factor in the composition of the gross domestic product of our country, as well as in the formation of the state budget, and for expanding the application of innovations in the economy. Using available resources and geographic locations, Ensuring the socio-economic development of all regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan at the level of modern requirements and increasing the competitiveness of our economy will create conditions for national products to occupy a worthy place in the world market. These goals are reflected in the Development Concept \"Azerbaijan 2020: a vision of the future\" (hereinafter - the Concept) approved by Decree No. 800 of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan dated December 29, 2012. The main goal in the concept is to double the gross domestic product in the next eight to ten years mainly due to the development of the non-oil sector in the Republic of Azerbaijan, and to implement this increase due to the establishment of an innovation-oriented and knowledge-based economy in the Republic. One of the main pillars of such development is information and communication technologies (hereinafter - ICT). As a new economic sector with a high growth rate, ICT plays the role of modern and multi-purpose infrastructure, as well as the leading force of comprehensive socio-economic progress. Today, ICT is considered as a convenient tool for ensuring the continuous and stable development of the republic, strengthening its intellectual potential, advancing business, fighting corruption, reducing poverty and unemployment, and developing transparency and democracy in society.

The development of Internet media, the existence of freedom of opinion and speech on the Internet, the wide spread of electronic newspapers and magazines, external and internal social networks are new opportunities provided by ICT to society. In order to reach the main goal defined in the concept, it is required to expand the volume of the ICT sector by 4-4.5 times in the next ten years, to strengthen the economic potential of ICT, and to meet the society's ICT needs. In order to achieve these, the formation of innovative, competitive and export- oriented ICT potential, the transformation of the country into a regional information services center, the development of the space industry and the wide application of satellite technologies, the creation of conditions for citizens and society to effectively benefit from the available opportunities, products and services, and the development of their ICT knowledge and skills and improvement of training, development of \"e-government\" and use of electronic services at all levels of public administration, The development of ICT, including the Internet economy, will also play an important role in the  https://president.az/   23. 6. 30. 오후 2:02 NATIONAL STRATEGY for the development of the information society in the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2014-2020 » Offici…  https://president.az/az/articles/view/11312/print 2/11  development of traditional economic fields. It is the Internet economy that creates conditions for creating new environments of use and participation, increasing productivity, gaining a strategic advantage over competitors, strengthening relations with partners, optimal use of information resources, and improving the well-being of society as a whole. In order to achieve all these goals and systematically implement the planned works, the \"National Strategy for the Development of the Information Society in the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2014-2020\" (hereinafter - the National Strategy) was prepared. This National Strategy is based on the \"National Strategy on Information and Communication Technologies for the Development of the Republic of Azerbaijan (2003-2012)\" approved by Decree No. 1146 of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan dated February 17, 2003, and the state adopted regarding the implementation of that strategy. is based on the results of the large-scale work done in the direction of the implementation of the programs. The results obtained, the establishment of the foundations of the information society, the wide use of ICT by citizens, society, the private sector and state bodies create favorable conditions for planning the directions of action at the next stage. Society's demand for modern communication and information technologies, world experience, international organizations,  2. Current situation  As a result of the work done for the development of ICT in the Republic of Azerbaijan, the faster integration of the country into the global electronic space, the formation of new forms of social and economic activity (e-government, e-commerce, distance education, etc.), information and knowledge important steps have been taken in the direction of creating a market, increasing efficiency in various areas of the economy, and improving the quality of products and services. It was declared that this field, which is under the special attention of the state, is one of the priorities for the future development of the country's economy, and 2013 was declared the \"Year of Information and Communication Technologies\" in the Republic of Azerbaijan by Decree No. 2664 of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan dated January 16, 2013. During the years 2003-2013, high attention and care was paid to the field of ICT by the state, purposeful, complex and consistent activities were carried out. It is a manifestation of this that many international reports, including \"The Global Information Technology Report\" of the World Economic Forum, began to take into account the results of the Republic of Azerbaijan in the field of ICT, and in the report of 2013 \"Successes of the government in supporting ICT\" and \"In the future views of the government According to the \"importance given to ICT\" indices, our country was ranked among the top ten in the world. In general, in this report, Azerbaijan took the 56th place among 144 countries on the network readiness index and was in the leader group among the CIS countries. During these years, an appropriate legal framework was created to ensure development in the field, many important laws and other normative legal acts were adopted. State programs for the development of communication and information technologies in the Republic of Azerbaijan approved by the relevant orders of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan in 2005 and 2010, as well as \"In the Republic of Azerbaijan 2010- In 2011, the \"Action Program on the Formation of Electronic Government\" ensured the implementation of practical measures related to the development of ICT. These legal acts opened up new opportunities for the development of ICT in our country, and created conditions for the expectation of the principles of free market and healthy competition in the field, and the wide use of ICT by citizens and state bodies. In recent years, the ICT sector has become a leading and dynamically developing sector of the economy. During these years, the volume of the sector has doubled every three years with an average annual growth rate of approximately 20-25%, exceeding 1.9 billion US dollars, its share in GDP is 1.7%, and its share in non-oil GDP is 3 increased to 3%. Investment in the sector amounted to approximately 2.5 billion US dollars, of which 28% was invested by the state, and 72% by local business structures and foreign investors. The share of the private sector increased from 67.3% to 80% compared to 2003. For the first time among the CIS countries, the landline telephone network in the Republic of Azerbaijan was fully electronic and all residential areas of the country were telephoned. All district centers of the republic are connected to the main fiber-optic telecommunication network. The mobile network has been expanded. Modern 3G services are provided by three mobile operators in    23. 6. 30. 오후 2:02 NATIONAL STRATEGY for the development of the information society in the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2014-2020 » Offici…  https://president.az/az/articles/view/11312/print 3/11  the Republic. Since 2012, 4G technology has been introduced in our country. There are 110 mobile subscribers for every 100 people in the country. According to the results of 2013, 70% of the population of Azerbaijan are Internet users, including 50% of them are broadband Internet users. Internet prices are decreasing every year, so compared to 2004, the price of 1 Mbit/s high-speed Internet connection has decreased from 1200 manats to 10 manats. The average cost of connecting to broadband services across the country is 3% of the average monthly wage, which means that the ITU target of less than 5% in developing countries by 2015 has already been achieved. In the last five years, the capacity of the international Internet channel has increased 12.9 times and reached 200 Gbit/s, the volume of the Internet services market has increased approximately 4 times. On February 8, 2013, the first telecommunication satellite of the Republic of Azerbaijan, \"Azerspace-1\", was put into orbit, which is one of the highest technical achievements achieved by our country during the period of independence. The commercial operation of the satellite, which allows providing telecommunication, internet, television-radio broadcasting services to the countries of Europe, Middle East, Central Asia and Africa, has already started and it is managed by Azerbaijani specialists through the created infrastructure. In accordance with the recommendations of the ITU to ensure the transition to digital broadcasting by 2015, the works carried out in our country are nearing completion. During these years, consistent work has been done in the direction of increasing the range and quality of postal services, modernizing the infrastructure, strengthening the personnel potential, and liberalizing activities in the field. In 2005-2010, as a result of the implementation of the \"Development of Financial Services\" project with the support of the World Bank, using the network of the national postal operator \"Azerpocht\" LLC, in addition to traditional services, banking and financial services were provided to the population through post offices. The production of computer and electronic equipment and software products in the Republic of Azerbaijan is increasing year by year. During the last 5 years, the country's information technology (hereinafter - IT) sector has expanded approximately 2 times and the average annual growth rate has been 17%.

The necessary infrastructures of \"electronic government\" have been created in the country. The \"Electronic Government\" portal is already operational, information is exchanged between the information systems of state bodies through a special infrastructure, infrastructure and certificate service centers have been created for the use of electronic signatures. As a result, the application of e-signature is expanding, various electronic services are provided by state bodies. Currently, the electronic services of the state institutions connected to the \"Electronic Government\" portal are provided to the population on the basis of the \"one-stop shop\" principle. In addition to the above, the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, July 13, 2012, with the aim of providing services to citizens with better quality, convenient, unified space and applying modern innovations, mutual integration of information bases of state bodies, speeding up the process of organizing electronic services, and improving the management system in this field 685, the State Agency for Citizen Service and Social Innovations under the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan and \"ASAN service\" centers under it were established, which proved to be a positive experience in a short time. Based on this development, information security issues are of great importance in terms of organizing the protection of created infrastructures, information systems, and collected data, as well as creating conditions for the free use of these facilities by citizens and other users. In order to improve the activity in this field, protect the information resources and systems of state bodies from possible threats, and increase the nationwide training and awareness on cyber security, the Special Communications and Information Security State Agency of the Special State Protection Service of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Electronic Security Center under the Ministry of Communications and High Technologies of the Republic of Azerbaijan is operating. In order to ensure the continuity of the work done and to strengthen the national potential, the training of highly qualified personnel in the field of ICT is expanding. The training of highly qualified personnel in the field of ICT was considered a priority in the \"2007-2015 State Program for the Education of Azerbaijani Youth in Foreign Countries\" approved by the Order No. 2090 of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan dated April 16, 2007.

No longer are disruptive technologies in the realm of science fiction; they are creating an abundance of possibilities for business, Government and humankind itself. 2 Foreword We are also acutely aware of the dangers lurking within this field and recognise that it would be an exercise in futility if we do not ensure the maximum security and resilience possible in the face of relentless cyber threats. With the extensive growth of digitalisation, the exposure to cybercrime will increase inevitably and therefore the National Cyber Security Strategy 2023-2026 has been designed with our country’s future wellbeing in mind. It lays the groundwork for further investment by Government in cyber security for the next three years. Government has a clear leadership role in cyber security, but it cannot act alone. Together, we can foster increased confidence and trust in the digital world. This includes a greater propensity towards cyber hygiene, a drive towards attracting minds within the cyber security domain as well as further co-operation on a national, European and global scale. Ultimately, the cyber threat can never be discounted or ignored. The consequences of suffering a cyberattack would be massive, resulting in data loss, system outage and reputational damage. Unfortunately, it is a threat that can never be fully eradicated. The open nature of the cyber world shall always expose us to such risk, irrespective of measures taken. Nonetheless, together, we can minimise the level and impact of these threats, whilst successfully forging ahead in digitalisation. This Strategy will pave the way for such action. Hon. Silvio Schembri Minister for the Economy, European Funds and Lands 3 Malta’s political will to embrace, adapt and adopt these seismic changes has positioned our country at the forefront of the technological revolution. Only a negligible number of countries have managed to emulate the pace of our country’s progress in digitalisation and even fewer have recognised and fully embraced the potentiality of new technologies. Our pioneering stance, with a wholehearted commitment to continue with the further implementation of technologies, has placed Malta as a leading digital innovator, a cut well above the rest of its European peers. The recent global health and economic challenges demonstrated our reliance on information and communications technology. Malta, by dint of its solid and unwavering commitment to digitalisation, has weathered the storm quite competently. However, as empowering as our vision is, we also recognise that with great power comes great responsibility. While interconnectedness, through further implementation of technologies, shall allow us to forge further ahead in our administrative, business and personal activities, we shall continue to launch fiscal measures to strengthen Malta’s appeal as a hub for foreign investment in this sector, while identifying the underlying skill base and infrastructure required for it to flourish. But not only this. As we have done in the past, with the launching of AI, Space, E-Commerce and E-Skills strategies, we shall continue to identify regulatory policies for the implementation of ethically aligned, transparent and socially responsible technologies. National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 Foreword by the Minister for Home Affairs, Security, Reforms and Equality The significant leaps we have made in digitalisation on a national scale in recent years has made us increasingly aware of the danger of threats within cyber space. Foreword4 next three years. The attainment and success of the Strategy is contingent upon a variety of diverse participants, not only within Government but also the private sector and Maltese society as a whole. I am confident that we shall use this Strategy as an opportunity to all work together as one nation in a responsible and coordinated manner. Ultimately, cyber security not only protects our assets but ensures vigilance to the essential tenets of our free, European and democratic society in a time of heightened global digital transformation. Hon. Dr Byron Camilleri Minister for Home Affairs, Security, Reforms and Equality 5 Cyber space is ever evolving, and it is an ever-growing dependency for our national security. It does not eliminate spatial boundaries. Its cross-border nature allows for anonymity, bringing about issues and challenges of jurisdiction, conflict and criminality. Cyber criminals are fully aware of this and are causing damage and harm, stealthily and craftily infiltrating systems from anywhere around the globe, stealing identity and sensitive data and defrauding unsuspecting organisations and individuals. They are targeting critical infrastructures upon which our day to day lives and activities depend and are exploiting vulnerable situations we face on a personal or wider scale, even fuelling uncertainty, fear and distrust through the spread of fake information. The National Cyber Security Strategy 2023-2026 aims to protect our national interests in a planned and coordinated fashion for the National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 Heightened online activity at social and economic levels, spurred by further developments and applicability of Internet based technologies and concepts have led to bolder and more complex cyber threats. A global focus on health and economic risks has aggravated further the susceptibility to wider and bolder attacks by criminals. Cyber attacks are also being increasingly orchestrated as part of a mixed array of tools by external state and non-state actors aimed at interfering with the stability, effectiveness, and legitimacy of the European Union and Member States. This calls for cyber security to be addressed as part of a broader whole-of- government approach which recognises the existence of such multi-faceted and multi-layered hybrid threats. Government and society needs to be prepared and resilient. There is a need for cyber security to be addressed on a national scale with a planned, collective and systemic effort from all stakeholders. The National Cyber Security Strategy 2023-2026 follows an initial one published in 2016, which laid the foundation blocks for such an approach in Malta. Several regulatory activities and initiatives in cyber security have occurred, or are in process, on a national, EU and global scale in areas such as network and information systems, electronic communications, technology and research competency, cross border public service delivery and information sharing and diplomacy. Digitalisation, including wider diffusion and consumption of broadband, mobile technologies and data, has progressed further in Malta, with the Public Administration being at the forefront of related service provision, along with increased use of social and business digital interactions. The National Cyber Security Strategy 2023-2026 is being articulated with such considerations in place, whilst allowing for evolving challenges and realities. The Strategy is based upon four key principles: Shared responsibility of stakeholders in tackling cyber security. This is necessary to protect against and deter potential cyber- attacks as well as to respond to disruptions that do occur. An inclusive, comprehensive and integrative approach whereby cooperation, coordination and collaboration are ensured on a national, European and global scale. Balanced risk management that assesses cyber risk and takes a proportionate degree of measures, ensuring that innovation is not stifled in the process. A balanced compliance approach that engenders conformance to cyber security standards commensurate to the context and focus to which they are intended. The principles need to be put into practice by the Maltese public administration, the private sector and all Maltese society including a community of cyber security experts and practitioners. Indeed, these stakeholders constitute the core of the Strategy’s overall vision that: Malta is more secure and resilient to cyber threats, leading to more trust and confidence within the digital world. Executive Summary Executive Summary6 and training aspects of cyber security in various professions and the need to establish a strong security first ethos. The establishment of a National Coordination Centre, in line with EU legal requirements, shall be instrumental. It shall also promote research development and innovation in cyber security. Domain 4: International Cooperation  This domain aims to foster active cooperation and engagement by Malta at bi-lateral, multi-lateral, European and international levels in areas of international security in cyberspace, cyber capacity building, cyber response and cybercrime. The actions proposed by each of the four domains translate into more specific activities which are assigned to respective owners for implementation within stipulated timelines, as part of an Action Plan. In general, though, resources in cyber security on a national scale are limited, and technology and its use keep on evolving, leading to new cyber security challenges. Additionally, the regulatory landscape in cyber security is evolving, particularly at EU level, leaving its mark on Malta as a Member State. Thus, coordination and monitoring of progress of the Action Plan, through the National Cyber Security Steering Committee, shall be accompanied by regular reviews to reflect these considerations over the next three years. Whilst the National Cyber Security Strategy 2023-2026 acts as the national focal point on cyber security from a strategic perspective, it shall not exclude related strategies focusing on sectors/ disciplines of Maltese society and its economy. Cybersecurity is a global concern of national importance. Hence it is in everyone’s interest to ensure that it is addressed effectively. 7 The Vision reflects continuity in Malta’s pursuit of bolstering its cyber security and capability to return to normality within the shortest time possible in case of disruption due to a cyber-attack. No country, entity or individual can be totally immune from potential cyber-attack despite measures taken to protect against such an event. Ultimately, as indicated by the Vision, such a dual strategic thrust should lead to increased confidence and trust in a digital environment that enhances economic and societal activity.   The Vision reaches fruition through a number of proposed actions based upon sub‑objectives emanating from the following four domains: Domain 1: Cyber Security Governance Capacity This domain aims to promote and maintain a robust cyber security governance framework so as to ensure that risks effecting Malta in cyberspace are adequately addressed. They are to be tackled from legislative, regulatory, policy, standard and best practice aspects and, most importantly, from a risk management and supplier management perspective. Domain 2: Cyber Defence Capacity  This domain is based upon the premise that the complexity of cyberspace makes it hard to prevent all attacks, which, in a number of instances, are likely to be more disruptive and costly than natural disasters. Hence, it aims for a stronger multi-stakeholder concerted effort, in terms of operations, for dealing with cybersecurity challenges from a reactive as well as a proactive perspective, including consolidating and sharing cyber threat intelligence. Domain 3: Cyber Competence and Culture  This domain recognises that cyber security needs to be addressed from a human resource and cultural perspective. It focuses on the academic National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 Acronyms AI Artificial Intelligence ASEAN Association of Southeast Asian Nations ARF ASEAN Regional Forum AU African Union CBM Confidence Building Measures CoE Council of Europe CSIRT Computer Security and Incident Response Team DORA Digital Operational Resilience Act DSP Digital Service Providers ENISA European Union Agency for Cyber Security  EC European Commission EU European Union EU CCCN European Cyber Security Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre and Network of National Coordination Centres EuroQCI European Quantum Communication Infrastructure FDI Foreign Direct Investment GDPR General Data Protection Regulation ICT Information and Communications Technology IOC Indicators of Compromise Acronyms8 ITA Innovative Technology Arrangements IXP Internet Exchange Points LN Legal Notice NATO North Atlantic Treaty Organisation NIS Network and Information Security OAS Organisation of American States OES Operators of Essential Services OSCE Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe OECD Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OOP Once Only Principle R&D Research and Development RDI Research Development and Innovation SOC Security Operations Centre SME Small to Medium sized Enterprises UN United Nations UN GGE UN Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace in the context of International Security UN OEWG UN Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTs in the context of International Security National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 9 10 chapter 01 Strategic Context 11 1.1 Background The demands of cyber security1 on society and the economy are an increasingly evolving challenge in an era of digital transformation. The global pandemic has further accentuated the use of digital activity with remote ways of working, interacting and doing business. It has increased dependency on digital platforms and technologies by organisations and individuals. chapter 01 Strategic Context12 Cyber-attacks2 have increased relentlessly, in sophistication and in ubiquity. They have been spurred by further growth in internet connected technologies such as e-commerce, the Internet of Things, social media, mobile payments and cloud computing. International conflicts show that, escalated disputes between nation states are incorporating cyber space. Thus wars are being fought through rigorous cyber- attacks on nation states, with the intent to disrupt a country’s stability. An increased dependency on technology in matters from health to the economy aggravates further the susceptibility to wider and bolder attacks by criminals. Therefore, cyber-security cannot be tackled in isolation. There needs to be a concerted and strategic approach that keeps in view of the increasingly digital ecosystem nationally and internationally. This Strategy is Malta’s second in cyber security, following the previous one published in 2016. The first Strategy provided the foundation, outlining a series of actions that need to be addressed. It sought to align itself to the requirements of the EU 2016/1148 Directive of the European Parliament and Council of 6 July 2016 concerning ‘measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the European Union’ (EU)3. This was the first piece of EU-wide legislation on cyber security which, at the time of publication of the Strategy, was still not applicable across Member States 13National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 chapter 01 Strategic Context but which has since been transposed into Maltese network and information security legislation as L.N. 216 of 20184. Awareness of the need to deal with cyber security on a national scale came with the implementation of a strategic awareness and education campaign, which, along with other measures such as those related to cybercrime and further activities involving multi-stakeholder cooperation, were proposed by the initial Strategy. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has also come into force since then, increasing awareness on cyber matters, albeit from a privacy perspective, particularly within businesses5. One cannot discount the further evolution of digitalisation in all of the nation’s economic and societal spheres which, though positive, also pose higher probabilities of cyber risk. 14 In recent years, a higher share of online sales has been indicated by Maltese businesses relative to their EU counterparts6, whilst there has been a consistent growth in online purchases by Maltese consumers7. Indeed, online social8 and business interaction9 have maintained an upward trend, spurred by an increased growth in broadband penetration10, mobile telephony usage and data consumption11. Government maintained momentum in being at the forefront in digital service provision of public services12. The digitalisation of Malta’s Public Administration13, enabled by strategic approaches in its adoption of mobile telephony and technologies including AI14, continues at a steady pace, in line with EU related developments. The Single Digital Gateway Regulation, now in force, provides the basis for EU-wide implementation of the once-only principle (OOP) and is expected to be applied at cross border level by 2023. The 2020 legislation Re-use of Public Sector Information Act (CAP 546) facilitates implementation of the OOP, whilst extending the definition and concept of re-use of documents within the Public Administration. Additionally, the implementation of the EU Digital Single Market Strategy calls for high-speed, secure and trustworthy infrastructures and services supported by the right regulatory conditions. Indeed, in 2018, Malta took a proactive stance by introducing a new regulatory framework on innovative technologies15. All such developments call for various multi-disciplinary cyber security measures to counter increased possibilities of technology, data and, ultimately, service compromise. Furthermore, it is increasingly clear that cooperation and coordination at a European and international level is crucial in addressing cyber security effectively. National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 15 In December 2020, the European Council and the European Parliament reached a provisional agreement on a proposal to set up a European Cyber Security Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre and a network of national coordination centres to invest in stronger and pioneering cyber security capacity in the EU. Additionally, new EU regulations set out a European cyber security certification framework for Information and Communications Technology (ICT) products, services and processes, in addition to granting a permanent mandate to the European Union Agency for Cyber Security (ENISA). The European Commission (EC) has also presented a new EU Cyber Security Strategy which aims to introduce an agile means for detecting and deflecting cyberattacks across Europe while strengthening internet security globally, fostering information sharing and collective responses, enhancing cyber defence cooperation, strengthening further the EU cyber diplomacy toolbox, strengthening external cyber capacity building, actively contributing to international security in cyberspace at UN level and ensuring security in the Internet of Things16. The Strategy complements a number of legislative proposals that have been made at European level such as those related to an EU wide cyber diplomacy toolbox, 5G cyber security and a wider in scope Network and Information Security Directive, among other proposals some of which are largely sectorial in nature. Therefore, whilst the strategic approaches of the initial National Cyber Security Strategy are still valid, societal, political, economic and technological evolvements at a national and European level need to be kept in view. Ultimately, increasing complexity, coupled with a constantly changing scenario within cyber security, calls for a multi-disciplinary effort that factors in the relevance and horizontal nature of cyber security, addressing it in a systemic, comprehensive and coordinated manner. chapter 01 Strategic Context16 1.2 Purpose and Scope This Strategy intends to serve as a continuation to the National Cyber Security Strategy 2016. It aims to deliver further progress by: Aligning to specific domestic, EU and international regulatory requirements. Taking into account of present realities, challenges and evolvements in cyber security on a national and global scale through a number of strategic, operational and cultural measures, beyond the regulatory ones. Whilst encouraging the articulation of Cyber Security Strategies and their subsequent implementation at an organisational or even business sectoral level, the National Cyber Security Strategy 2023‑2026 is wider in scope, ensuring that its overall implementation has a nationwide impact. It has several objectives with timely, speci ic and actionable measures, aimed at: Strengthening protection of digital infrastructure and its dependencies on a national scale, not only from a technological point of view but also from strategic, operational, legal and regulatory perspectives. Ensuring a cyber risk assessment approach across the business and economic sector. Ensuring national cyber security consciousness and increased capabilities in cyber security. Fostering cooperation in cyber security on a national, European and international scale. 1. 2 These measures apply for all stakeholders of the Maltese economy and society as increasingly active participants in cyber space as well as contributors to its security and resilience. National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 17 chapter 02 Overall Direction 18 19 2.1 Introduction This Chapter sets the scene for the National Cyber Security Strategy 2023-2026, in light of the considerations detailed in the previous Chapter. It outlines the principles underpinning the Vision of the Strategy for the next three years. The Vision is seen to come into fruition by means of a Model with four domains, each encapsulating a number of objectives to be reached. chapter 02 Overall Direction20 2.2 Guiding Principles The Strategy shall be guided by four principles, all of which call for a balanced, multi- disciplinary and multi- stakeholder approach, encapsulating the notions of subsidiarity, complementarity and proportionality. 21National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 Shared responsibility In essence, this is a principle of subsidiarity, whereby cyber security is a shared responsibility between all stakeholders. The Government assumes a leading role but cannot have sole responsibility and accountability given that the private sector, as well as society as a whole are also users, beneficiaries and owners of infrastructure. They too contribute to a secure and stable cyber space. Hence, all users have the responsibility of taking steps to protect the cyber landscape on an individual and collective basis. They all need to be aware of privacy protection methods and of ensuring security against cyberattacks. Inclusive, Comprehensive and Integrative Approach The interdependencies inherent within the connectedness of cyber space, and the potential consequent spread of impact from a related incident, call for complementarity action and shared trust. This is enabled by cooperation, collaboration and coordination mechanisms amongst the various stakeholders on a domestic, European and international scale. Balanced Risk Management The continuous growth and evolvement of cyber space renders it impossible to guarantee a scenario devoid of risks from any form of threat. Risk management is an ongoing concern that covers all elements of cyberspace in terms of their constitution as well as their use. It does not come without cost. Thus, the allocation and adequacy of resources needs to be proportionate to the risk identified, within its particular context, and to the course of action to be taken. Overall, risk management should not stifle innovation but reflect a proportionate level of investment that allows for its secure utilisation. Balanced Compliance Approach Additionally, apart from risk management, within the notion of proportionality is the need to establish and ensure compliance to necessary security safeguards and measures that are commensurate to the context and to what needs to be protected within the cyber space domain. chapter 02 Overall Direction22 Malta is more secure and resilient to cyber threats leading to more trust and confidence within the digital world. 2.3 Vision Taking into perspective these principles, the overall cyber security scenario, as well as Malta’s drive towards attaining further social and economic progress through digital evolution, the following overall Vision shall guide the National Cyber Security Strategy for the next three years: The drive towards further cyber resilience and cyber security will serve to underpin trust and confidence in the use of digital facilities which can enhance economic and societal activity for all. National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 23 2.4 Model The components bringing the Vision to fruition can be summed up through the following model which encompasses the: Key National Stakeholders at its core. Four Key Domains, all inter‑related, that need to be tackled. Public Administration Private Sector Society Cyber Security Community CYBER SECURITY GOVERNANCE CAPACITY INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION CYBER DEFENCE CAPACITY CYBER COMPETENCE AND CULTURE chapter 02 Overall Direction24 2.5 Key National Stakeholders The vision is all encompassing in that it involves the main national stakeholders, entailing that: The Public Administration leads the way in ensuring secure and resilient cyber space on a nationwide scale. The Private Sector cooperates with the Public Administration, securing its product/service portfolios and protecting its client bases from known cyber vulnerabilities. Society practices secure online behaviour and makes informed decisions on digital transactions and interactions. The Cyber Security Community of individuals and organisations, that significantly contribute to the Maltese cyber‑security scene in a professional capacity or otherwise, is encouraged to grow further to play an increasingly crucial role. Not everything can be protected against every type of threat and risk but each of the stakeholders has roles and responsibilities which clearly reflect the underlying principles of shared responsibility and cooperation and coordination by all. Technical security needs to be further strengthened, but human factors have to be taken into account too since they are the underlying cause of cyber incidents or the key vector to exploit for cyber-attack. Hence, stakeholders’ obligations inherently carry such needs and expectations by the stakeholders themselves that need to be fulfilled accordingly. The four domains presented within the model embody such perspectives to ensure a comprehensive and inclusive approach. National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 25 2.6 Key Domains Four domains, which aim to address the domestic and international evolvement of the cyber security landscape, have been identified. Domain 1: Cyber Security Governance Capacity Governance is a key element in cyber security as it determines the responsibility and accountability structure, ensuring oversight to mitigate cyber risks. On a national scale, it stipulates the laws, regulations, policies, processes, standards and best practices required to determine how the country can respond to and limit cyber incidents effectively. Domain 2: Cyber Defence Capacity Cyberspace has become so complex that preventing all attacks is impossible. Such attacks can be exponentially more harmful and costly than damage caused by natural disasters. This challenge is addressed through the capacity to conduct continuous monitoring for potential threats, rapid detection of potential attacks, ensuring a network of information sharing and coordination and, ultimately, being in a position to respond to occurrences of cyber disruptions effectively. Technology, along with the suitable skills and processes to detect and respond, acts as one key enabler to defend against cyber threats. Domain 3: Cyber Competence and Culture In addition to political, technological, organisational and legal measures, a progressive digital culture is needed and this comes from a strong capacity building regime. Capacity building includes ongoing and comprehensive cyber security awareness programmes to promote and foster a security-first culture. It also includes competence and knowledge development through certifications, increased academic focus on cyber security and professional training and educational programmes targeting not only ICT practitioners but also professions in other fields. Human and institutional capacity building in cyber security and its human, socio-economic and political implications cannot be side-stepped so cyber security must not be addressed from a technological perspective only. Domain 4: International Cooperation Cyber security is a global challenge. It knows no bounds of national territory or sectoral scope. Thus, it requires a multi-stakeholder approach involving cooperation from various functions and disciplines, nationally and internationally. It calls for strategic engagements such as bi-lateral and multi-lateral agreements, participation in European and international fora, co-operation and information sharing frameworks and agreed international/European related norms of behaviour. Apart from indicating a country’s willingness and commitment to the peaceful use of cyberspace, international cooperation can strengthen capacity building, threat detection and deterrence capabilities as well as increase the scope of enforcement and judicial powers in tackling cybercrime. chapter 02 Overall Direction26 2.7 Focus for each Key Domain The next four Chapters expand each corresponding domain in further detail. Each domain shall carry an overall objective, in line with what the domain embodies. In turn, the overall objective embodies a number of sub- objectives, each of which include a strategic context and rationale, leading to a number of proposed high-level actions that are envisaged for realisation of the Strategy. 27National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 chapter 03 Cyber Security Governance Capacity 28 29 3.1 The Key Objective Promote and maintain a robust cyber security framework of responsibility, accountability and strategic direction to protect, respond to and minimise threats and challenges that compromise the security of Malta in cyberspace. chapter 03 Cyber Security Governance Capacity30 3.2 The Sub- objectives A. Adaptation of the domestic legal framework to meet changing needs and challenges in cyber security. The legal framework, including legislation and regulation, ensures Malta’s ongoing preparedness in terms of response through investigation and prosecution of cybercrimes, the imposition of appropriate sanctions for non-compliance or breach of law as well as the basis for a level of appropriate behaviour expected within cyberspace. The increasingly global, complex and dynamic nature of cyber security challenges necessitate the need for a domestic review and update of such legal measures to ensure their currency and relevance, including alignment with EU legal developments. 31National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 The transposition of EU Directive (EU) 1148 of 2016 (NIS) into Legal Notice L.N. 216 of 2018 led to the identification of its National Competent Authority of the National Computer Security and Incident Response Team (CSIRT). It has also defined the Operators of Essential Services (OESs) and the Digital Service Providers (DSPs) within the local context. This led to the implementation of security and notification requirements and several cooperation and coordination mechanisms. Such activities shall continue, with a focus on having a more comprehensive list of OESs, as well as further policy direction regarding the obligations of both OESs and DSPs. The transposition of the legal framework for security and integrity of networks and services, as well as other related EU regulatory requirements, complements this further. Specifically, in early 2020, the EC called on Member States to take steps to implement the set of measures recommended in the 5G toolbox conclusions17. The growth of 5G will enable newer connection and service opportunities spurred by higher transmission rates and lower latency, their potential criticality of which would render them highly susceptible to cyberattack. Other legislative proposals, related to cyber security, have been made at European level during 2020, such as that for a renewed Network and Information Security Directive and a Digital Operational Resilience Regulation (DORA) for the Financial Sector. The latter sector is increasingly reliant upon information and communications technologies through an increased demand in Europe for remote access to financial services18. This has led to a significant rise in cyberattacks on financial institutions19, which call for increased risk mitigation in their digital transformation so as to ensure stronger operational resilience through the Regulation. The Regulation also complements the EU Digital Finance Strategy which, as part of an EC Digital Finance Package, aims to foster customer access to innovative financial products whilst ensuring consumer protection and financial stability20. Thus, the importance for such robust cyber security regulation within the financial sector, as well as in sectors such as gaming and the services industry, is vital within the Maltese economic context21. One particular notion that is gaining importance at EU level is vulnerability disclosure. This would enable well-intentioned individuals to investigate and report, in a safe and transparent manner, systems vulnerabilities they have detected without incurring the risk of criminal action against them. chapter 03 Cyber Security Governance Capacity32 However, cyber security legal frameworks cannot simply be devised around interests of legal entities and the personal lives of individuals. It is increasingly the case that cyber breaches may be specifically intended to impair the security, sovereignty and integrity of a nation. This is compounded by the fact that cybercrime knows no geographical boundaries and the inherent possibilities of anonymity in cyber space make it harder to attribute with certainty. This in turn may potentially cause grave diplomatic consequences between states, calling for increased focus on nation state behaviour in cyber space as well as diplomatic preparedness in case of related transgression. Developments at a European scale have become increasingly crucial following the introduction in June 2017 of the EU cyber diplomacy toolbox through the Conclusions on the Framework for a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber activities. In addition to participating at a European level, Malta is also actively contributing to work being done by the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing responsible state behaviour in cyberspace and by the UN-mandated Open-Ending Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTS within the context of International Security. However, Malta still needs to clarify its position with respect to the applicability of international law in cyberspace. Malta would then be in a stronger position to play a role in international cyberspace policy. National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 33 International legal and regulatory developments have had an impact upon various parts of the Maltese legal framework. Cyber security has also been addressed in other parts of the domestic legal framework such as the Criminal Code. Hence there is a need for a consolidated view of the various legal and regulatory references on cyber security within the Maltese legal framework for a better and more comprehensive understanding of its coverage and its applicability. ACTIONS 1.1 Establish a consolidated view of the coverage and applicability of cyber security within the Maltese legal framework. 1.2 Review and update the national legal framework to ensure its currency with respect to the cyber security challenges in an increasingly digital economy and society in areas including: Cybercrime investigations and electronic evidence. Transposition of new EU cyber related Legislation (sectoral or otherwise), within stipulated timeframes, following agreement by the EU Council and European Parliament. 1.3 Adopt and implement measures resulting from cyber/cyber-related regulations and legislation nationally. 1.4 Establish Malta’s position on (i) cyberoperations against it in peacetime and (ii) applicability of international law with respect to cyberoperations in armed conflict situations, keeping in view related EU requirements. 1.5 Issue a Vulnerability Disclosure policy covering critical areas falling within the scope of Maltese network and information systems security legislation for reporting parties such as security experts and consultants. 1.6 Issue vulnerability disclosure policies or guidelines, as well as other cyber security specific policies or guidelines within specific economic sectors, as applicable. chapter 03 Cyber Security Governance Capacity34 B B. Ensure consolidation of national cyber security at a strategic level. The publication of a National Cyber Security Strategy alone is not sufficient for ensuring effective harmonisation in cyber security strategic development. The National Cyber Security Committee, composed of diverse national stakeholders in cyber security, is one means of facilitating the conduct of cyber security efforts in a coordinated fashion. However, as the cyber security challenge becomes more intense, there is a need for a stronger strategic role to ensure improved governance, including more effective implementation of the Strategy. There is a need to promote further engagement and interaction with other stakeholders within the realm of national cyber security to ensure the dissemination of cyber security knowledge, best practice and expertise. ACTIONS 1.7 Work to consolidate further the National Cyber Security Committee’s role, ensuring consolidation of national cyber security at a strategic level. 35National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 C. Strengthen cyber security in the supply chain. A high level of security of network and information systems and, ultimately, trust of digital processes and services calls for a supply chain that complies with widely recognised security standards and protocols. Such degree of security compliance is expected from the inception of digital products, processes or services, calling in effect for the implementation of the security by design concept. The EU Cyber Security Act, which entered into force in 2019, reinforces such notion of quality assurance in the supply chain through a proposed introduction of EU wide rules for cyber security certification of products, processes and services, which are currently being followed by Malta. Furthermore, the European Electronic Communications code, being transposed on the domestic front, shall ensure that the integrity and security of public communications networks are maintained with risks related to the security of networks and services appropriately managed. The code includes further regulatory powers to enforce security provisions. Malta has taken its own regulatory initiatives that contribute to bolstering cyber security within the supply chain, especially in innovative technologies being adopted in day-to-day business and personal life at a rapid pace. In 2018, it introduced a new regulatory framework for the voluntary certification of Innovative Technology Arrangements (ITA). Among other activities, the Regulation led to the introduction of an ITA Certification Programme for Digital Ledger Technology/ Blockchain based systems. An equivalent programme for Artificial Intelligence-based systems, to ensure ethical alignment, transparency and social responsibility in their development, was also devised 22. Moreover, network and information systems security legislation supports the use of internationally recognised cyber security related standards by entities falling within its scope of applicability. From a policy perspective, in 2017 a Government Information Security Policy23, based upon the internationally recognised ISO 27001 Information Security standard, came into force. This policy is applicable to all of the Public Administration. Further entity specific information security initiatives have taken place to promote a cyber security ethos within the Public Administration. Other economic sectors are also applying such a security standard. Increasingly, regulatory technical standards related to cyber security are being mandated as part of regulation in sectors such as financial services24. However, EU Regulation 2019/452, which became applicable in October 2020 and aims to establish a common system among EU Member States to screen foreign direct investments (FDI), calls for an even more in- depth focus on cyber security from a supply chain perspective at a national level. This comes from a desire to exercise greater control over economic activities within Member states, in light of recent economic and global health developments25. This Regulation allows for ad hoc screening mechanisms on operations where this is potential impact on security and public order, with an additional instrument to protect strategic activities.  According to Article 4 of the Regulation, the potential effects on critical infrastructure (whether physical or virtual), critical technologies, including cyber security26, and access to sensitive information are factors to be considered in determining whether or not a foreign direct investment may affect security or public order. chapter 03 Cyber Security Governance Capacity36 C ACTIONS 1.8 Actively participate in the design of the European wide cyber security evaluation and certification framework, eventually ensuring its implementation in Malta. 1.9 Adopt and promote sector specific standards, best practices and/ or guidelines related to the security of networks and information systems in collaboration with the national body for accreditation and standardisation27. 1.10 Further promote Government ICT Policy on Information Security within the Public Administration and review it periodically to ensure that it reflects the evolving cyber security profile within Government. 1.11 Propose a standard set of information security provisions within Government procurement framework for digital products and services. National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 37 D. Implement cyber risk management on a national scale. The increasing digital inter-connectedness between infrastructures, networks and various organisations – several of which are essential to the country’s day to day running - implies that a deficiency in one area can cause major disruption across others. Hence, risk management must focus on cyber, as well as natural and human hazards that may compromise a country’s stability and security. Recent proposals at EU level, with respect to the new five-year term EU Cyber Security Strategy as well as to a Directive on the resilience of critical entities, highlight such a need. Network and information systems security legislation addresses the need for cyber risk assessment exercises nationally, and specifically within the critical areas it identifies. However, cyber risk assessments are not a one-off exercise and should not be limited to those falling within the scope of legislation. Risk factors in any digitalisation process within organisations are numerous; they include concerns about the nature of the security of new systems introduced, privacy of data and ethical use of technology or its data. The risk is amplified by emerging technologies since the unknowns are greater than with mature technologies. The requirement for appropriate oversight of digital transformations intensifies the need for a strong cyber risk management regime within organisations. Additionally, the proposed EU Cyber Security Certification framework should contribute to the development of tailored and risk-based EU certification schemes that would specify the intended level of assurance of products, services and processes. These are crucial for the proper functioning of the European Digital Single Market, of which Malta forms part. 28 The same goes for certification frameworks introduced in Malta with respect to Innovative Technology Arrangements, referred to in the previous sub- objective, related to cyber-security in the supply chain. Above all, a watchful eye on a national scale for any noted emerging misuse or malign use of digital technologies and data and collective efforts to mitigate such risks is needed. chapter 03 Cyber Security Governance Capacity38 ACTIONS 1.12 Ensure regularly updated cyber risk assessments, both nationally and on a sectoral scale, with the implementation of measures required. 1.13 Ensure regular conduct of individual cyber risk assessment exercises by all organisations falling within the scope of Maltese network and information systems security legislation. 1.14 Seek to encourage the management of cyber risk in organisations nationally. 1.15 Seek ways nationally to mitigate risks related to emerging misuse or malign use of digital technologies and data. D 39National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 40 chapter 04 Cyber Defence Capacity 41 4.1 The Key Objective Strengthen commitment to augment operational and cooperation capacity to prevent and defend against cyber threats and address cybercrime, including cyber-attacks that may undermine Malta’s security. chapter 04 Cyber Defence Capacity42 4.2 The Sub- objectives A. Maximise national security and defence information capabilities to ensure technical and operational capability as well as national and international cooperation and coordination in cyberspace. Any organisation or even a nation thriving upon digitalisation derives value not only from preventing cyber-attack but also from responding promptly and coherently when an attack occurs, so as to minimise its effect. Through network and information systems security legislation, an incident management process, especially for significant cyber incidents in critical areas in Malta as well as incident reporting requirements at EU level, has been established. The primary incident responder, in case of a major cyber incident involving Government, has also been identified. Such developments have been an essential step in bolstering security in areas where cyber activity is critical. 43National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 However, the need to ensure a more inclusive response to threats and hazards is growing as the ramifications of cyber-attacks are felt domestically and worldwide. Indeed, recent EU Council conclusions called for such a need in the light of increased vulnerability to hybrid threats29 posed through ‘malicious cyber activities, disinformation and threats to economic security‘30. Ultimately, cyber security is like a chain - it is as strong as its weakest link. Hence, the need to identify and engage more multi-functional stakeholders not necessarily covered by present cyber legislation. Ultimately, this exercise is aimed at fostering national cooperation to detect threats, mitigate vulnerabilities, share cyber threat intelligence and coordinate responses to cyberattacks, as expounded further within the following sub-objective. ACTIONS 2.1 Ensure that all stakeholders of Malta’s national security and defence information systems and networks are identified on an ongoing basis, keeping in view pertinent legislation. B. Establish a National Cyber Security Response Centre. Closely tied to the requirement for comprehensive identification of all national stakeholders in cyberspace is the need for a centralised operations, cooperation and coordination framework, utilising all expertise. Through such framework, stakeholder organisations shall still operate independently on a day-to-day basis, whilst stronger mutual collaboration is ensured, when and where necessary. Apart from serving as a means to a more structured and effective response to cyber security incidents, the framework will serve as a powerful collective mechanism to better understand a constantly changing cyberspace, as well as serve towards further education and increased cyber security preparedness. In the process, it may also serve to promote cyber threat intelligence on a wider national scale. Cyber criminals and attackers scale up their efforts through stealth and sophistication whilst defenders gradually update their security measures. Cyberspace is diverse in its topological structures, networks and types of users. It is an uncertain place characterised by difficulties in traceability of perpetrators, inconsistencies and constant change. The sheer scale of data generated in online activity and traffic make it very hard, if not impossible, to inspect each and every event. From the defence perspective, this calls for an early warning system to alert cyber perpetration. Such a system should not simply rely on the availability chapter 04 Cyber Defence Capacity44 of the appropriate technology and skills. It calls for cooperation, streamlined coordination and collaboration processes, especially for data sharing and fusion. This may be achieved through the proposed centralised operations and cooperation framework and could be facilitated further by the promotion of voluntary information sharing about security breaches and incidents31. The early warning system could serve as the central mechanism for handling creeping, slow-burn and sudden crises32 from cyber-attacks with the potential to cripple parts or all of the country’s economic and social systems. Ultimately, it should contribute to the development of integrated cyber threat intelligence capabilities involving multiple sources. The Government is actively contributing to cyber threat intelligence online through CSIRTs, Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and threat and malware information so as to facilitate effective detection and preventive action in real time. Additional multi-stakeholder collaboration would see further contributions. The ultimate aim of this sub-objective is to intensify cooperation and cyber security information sharing. ACTIONS 2.2 Define, agree and implement an operations, coordination and cooperation framework for cyber security response on a national scale, incorporating all identified stakeholders. 2.3 Establish an early warning system as part of the formation of an operational, cooperational and coordination framework for cyber security response. 2.4 Seek ways to promote further cyber security information sharing, voluntary or otherwise, involving the Public Administration, the private sector and society. This could be enabled through policy direction, agreed procedures and information sharing tools. 45National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 C. Conduct security monitoring of cyberspace. CSIRTs and Security Operations Centres (SOCs) are important means of constant monitoring and analysis to detect intrusions and anomalies in real-time, in addition to allowing cyber threat intelligence exchange amongst stakeholders. The National CSIRT and Government CSIRT already play important roles in coordinating incident management and in contributing to cyber threat intelligence at a national level. This is facilitated by cooperation networks of EU and international counterparts, as well as by investments in tools for detection and data dissemination. However, this does not exclude the need for other CSIRTs at organisation and sectoral level. Collaboration and sharing among various CSIRTs would further strengthen their role and the sustainability of the country’s cyber security ecosystem. A SOC has been established for enhanced cyber monitoring and threat detection capabilities within Government. It is a vital tool for contributing to information security investigations within the Public Administration, such as for law enforcement and auditing purposes. Further investments to consolidate security monitoring of cyberspace are envisaged. The proposed development of an EU wide network of SOCs, as part of the EU Cyber Security Strategy, may consolidate further the establishment of such centres. This in turn would enhance collective knowledge, sharing of best practice and, ultimately, more comprehensive situational awareness. The establishment of the national cyber security response centre, referred to earlier, should also complement further to such sub-objective. chapter 04 Cyber Defence Capacity ACTIONS 2.5 Plan further and secure investments to monitor cyber security of critical infrastructures and critical information infrastructures, including Government. 2.6 Ensure ongoing risk management and resilience of such key areas. 2.7 Establish a network of SOCs and a community of CSIRTs in Malta. 46 D. Investigation and prevention of crimes committed in cyber space. According to the 2019 Eurobarometer survey on Europeans’ attitudes towards cybercrime, fewer Europeans feel they can protect themselves sufficiently: 59%, down from 71% in 2017, even though cybercrime awareness is rising. Cybercrime continues to be a global menace, increasing in terms of sophistication and expense. The recent surge in the world’s population working remotely and online33 has opened further avenues for cyber-criminals34. In the case of Malta, experiences of cybercrime registering a higher incidence than the EU average were claimed, particularly in relation to online fraud involving ransomware, virus and malware exposure, fraudulent emails or phone calls and online banking35. One of the three priority areas of the EU’s Security Union Strategy 2020-2025 is fighting crime in a digital age, ensuring Member States have the necessary tools to do so and to engage in information exchange. Further investments and capacity building are taking place, nationally, including enhancing laboratory facilities for cybercrime investigations. ACTIONS 2.8 Invest in new tools and equipment to enhance cybercrime capabilities in investigation and prevention, both from a proactive and reactive perspective. National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 47 E. Conduct ongoing threat and vulnerability analysis. An essential element of cyber security is having the capability to assess threats and vulnerabilities within and across organisations to ensure proactivity and preparedness. Various measures using processes, standards, best practices and technical tools need to be applied. Network and information systems security legislation specifically calls for simulated runs of operator security plans in the critical areas identified. A number of cyber simulation exercises, forming part of wider EU-wide initiatives, have been conducted since the launch of the initial Strategy. Cyber simulation exercises act as training processes, making management, employees and organisations aware of potential threats and how to respond efficiently. The Government regularly conducts scans and penetration tests on its web applications, looking for known vulnerabilities as well as to determine the degree to which a malicious attacker might impact confidentiality, integrity and availability. There is a need to promote such threat and vulnerability analysis in the private sector too, in collaboration with Government stakeholders and service providers, taking into consideration human and financial resource limitations, particularly among Small to Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs). The Government also issues advisories related to vulnerabilities on devices and software, together with relevant mitigation measures and security updates. The proposed actions shall further develop and intensify efforts in the establishment of ongoing monitoring of vulnerabilities and threats so as to maintain a level of cyber security that is proportionate to the risk. chapter 04 Cyber Defence Capacity48 ACTIONS 2.9 Sustain a programme of regular testing of digital networks and automated scans of Government critical infrastructure and services and devise a framework to facilitate a similar programme for testing of Government non- critical infrastructure and services. 2.10 Conduct pen testing and red-teaming exercises in critical areas. 2.11 Actively promote the conduct of vulnerability assessment exercises within the private sector. 2.12 Promote further an automated National Cyber Notification System whereby notifications on security vulnerabilities are sent to Internet Exchange points (IXPs) for their onward communication to respective customer bases. 2.13 Plan and conduct national and sectoral cyber simulation exercises at operational, management and political levels. 2.14 Issue annual information on national cyber threats and vulnerabilities. 2.15 Actively consider the adoption of an internationally or EU recognised framework for multi-disciplinary stakeholders36 to collaborate in performing controlled cyber-attack tests. 49National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 50 chapter 05 Cyber Competence and Culture 51 5.1 The Key Objective Increase national cyber competence, capability, knowledge and ongoing awareness of cyber security. chapter 05 Cyber Competence and Culture52 5.2 The Sub- Objectives A. Establish a National Coordination Centre. In September 2018, the EC presented a proposal for a Regulation establishing a European Cyber Security Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre and a Network of National Coordination Centres (EU CCCN). The proposal aimed to strengthen technology and industrial cyber security capabilities of the EU and help create a safe online environment. Political agreement on this initiative was reached by EU institutions in December 202037. Specifically, the EU CCCN Regulation provides for the setting up of a National Coordination Centre in each Member State. 53National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 Malta has made its nomination for a National Coordination Centre. Along with its EU network and EU Cyber Competence Centre, the National Coordination Centre would contribute in areas of cyber security capabilities, research, industry competitiveness and EU grants to support national ecosystems. ACTIONS 3.1 Establish a National Coordination Centre, in line with the EU Regulation of the European Parliament and of the European Council, European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centres and a Network of National Coordination Centres. B. Promote cyber security awareness at a national level. Awareness of cyber security risks and issues, and how to deal with them, are essential in building a more resilient society and economy. The knowledge gained through ongoing awareness amongst all members of society, especially business – from management to employees – is the cornerstone of cyber security culture. Indeed, Skills and Awareness raising is identified in ‘A strong European security ecosystem’ as one of the four strategic priority areas of the EU Cyber Security Strategy. This focus is crucial as, unfortunately, a considerable percentage of European firms do not understand the extent of their exposure to cyber risks38. In Malta, recent survey findings indicate a degree of cyber security awareness among businesses that is comparable to the EU population average 39 and an increasing percentage of Maltese respondents say they are fairly well or well informed about cybercrime40. A national cyber security awareness and education campaign was launched in 2018, aimed at various audiences such as academia, the Public Administration, the private sector, professionals, policy makers and the general public, and is still ongoing. The delivery method depends upon the particular audience targeted. Prevalent cyber risks at the time are highlighted so as to ensure effectiveness. The campaign involves collaboration on the domestic front and at EU level for consistency as well as to facilitate the sharing of guidance and support. Focussed campaigns, such as those specifically on cybercrime and public relations exercises including the issue of cyber security advisories targeting stakeholders within particular sectors, are also carried out. Such campaigns are needed on an ongoing basis to cover developments within the cyber security threat landscape as well as increased trends in digitalisation, remote working41 and online business interactions. Initiatives by various stakeholders is also actively encouraged such as through fora within and/or across economic sectors. Such initiatives could involve sharing of cyber security best practice, helping organisations to deal with: Cyber risk management measures, including the applicability of the basic tenets of cyber hygiene. Cyber security related legislative or regulatory requirements in specific sectors and how to enact them. New digital work patterns requiring respect for employee privacy. chapter 05 Cyber Competence and Culture54 Most importantly, awareness needs to reinforce the notion of cyber security as a behavioural concern in all work disciplines, recognising human weaknesses, rather than as an afterthought or as a technical issue to be delegated to IT practitioners. It is only through such a comprehensive and intensive awareness campaign that a ‘security first’ culture amongst everyone in Maltese society can be guaranteed42. This would, in turn, lead to a stronger recognition and inculcation of security in skills and product and service development and delivery. ACTIONS 3.2 Further pursue an intensive cyber security education and awareness campaign on a national scale. 3.3 Establish a national forum for sharing of best practice and experiences related to cyber security. C. Upgrade the skills of the current workforce and revisit the academic framework to bring it into line with cyber security industry requirements. The cyber security industry is in a continuous state of flux. The global demand for cyber security skills continues to exceed supply as threats become more sophisticated43. From an ICT specialist perspective, Eurostat44 indicates a growth in the number of ICT specialists in the EU that is more than 6 times as high as the increase of total employment in the EU between 2011 and 2019. Of these, about two thirds completed a tertiary education. The profession is male dominated with only 17.9% of ICT specialists in the EU being women45. The EC’s Country Report Malta 2020 records that Malta had the highest share of ICT graduates within the EU in 2019, with the percentage of ICT specialists representing a high proportion of the workforce46 relative to the EU47. It said that although “the share of female ICT specialists is slightly above the EU average, it is important to further increase the participation of women in this field, given the focus of the country on the ICT sector”. Additionally, the EC ’s Country Report Malta 2019 states that “although some measures back technical and highly qualified training and provision in environmental, engineering or ICT studies (e.g. Malta’s College of Arts Science and Technology training programmes), they are modest in scope and budget. The majority of schemes (e.g. PhD support) are generic and they would benefit from targeting specific disciplines or sectors. In addition, systematic coordination between the different governmental bodies on this issue would benefit from further strengthening.” The areas requiring improvement underline cyber security as a specialist area within ICT. There is a need for more focus within the educational curriculum48, from primary schoolyears up to post-tertiary level, and collaboration between educational and training institutions. Additionally, cyber security needs to be covered in more depth in academic and work disciplines. National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 55 Cyber security education and training should not only cover cybercrime from a law enforcement perspective but also from a judicial point of view. From a teaching perspective, cyber security needs to be seen not just as something for review of existing curricula but as a training issue for all educators. Cyber security training and education needs to cover handling of cyber crisis response situations, with simulation exercises and public relations activity. Such development of cyber security expertise is especially important within the Public Administration given the sector’s extensive use of sensitive data. In this regard, a drive towards more transparent and secure handling of data within the Public Administration should contribute positively. It is important that, in addition to training and development, cyber security is actively considered across all of an organisation’s human resource functions including performance management, recruitment and job development. Indeed, for cyber security to be imbued within an organisational culture, it needs to be fully embraced within all management disciplines, starting with human resources, and actively supported by senior management. Furthermore, soft skills are not to be overlooked in the security and technology field, as they are the tenets that shape a more security responsive culture. Several actions shall aim to address the need to ensure skills capacity in the short, medium and long term, covering various segments of society and economic sectors. chapter 05 Cyber Competence and Culture56 ACTIONS 3.4 Plan and execute cyber security training and development in Government, targeting both ICT specialists as well as non-ICT professionals who need a level of knowledge of cyber security to carry out their duties. 3.5 Support staff certification and accreditation of professional development curricula in cyber security, seek to address human resources gaps and the establishment of specialist teams related to cyber security. 3.6 Encourage the participation of women in cyber initiatives49. 3.7 Provide training support initiatives to assist management and employees within the private sector. 3.8 Consider education plans at primary and secondary levels which may include further curriculum enhancement as well as continuous teacher training on cyber security and digital skills. 3.9 Consider new opportunities in higher level education such as development of new related modules, research, promotion of advanced technical training and partnership agreements with national and overseas bodies and institutions. 57National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 D. Promote a heightened security posture within private industry. Private industry is increasingly capitalising on trade opportunities that digitalisation offers, which should potentially lead to new job opportunities, enhanced competitiveness and sustainable growth. But trade activity, that depends upon free cross-border data flows requires security safeguards and the attraction of investment requires robust infrastructure and well developed cyber security. A recent surge in online operational and trading activities, to counter a global health emergency, accentuated this need for ways to safeguard the livelihood, competitiveness, development and innovation potential of industry. The cyber security landscape in Malta features regulation, policy and supervisory functions, particularly within regulated sectors. But legislation and regulation may not cover all aspects of cyber security necessarily, particularly considering resource constraints in small organisations. Hence, support initiatives and incentives are necessary to encourage organisations to make a voluntary commitment to improving their cyber security. At the National Cyber Security Summit, in October 2019, the Government launched the B SECURE Scheme, to help businesses assess their vulnerability against cyber security threats and train employees at various levels of the organisation. Further initiatives and incentives – including by the private sector itself - are to be actively promoted to meet the guidance and support needs of SMEs in particular. ACTIONS 3.10 Actively consider and embark upon various initiatives and incentives to promote good cyber security posture within the private sector in Malta. E. Support Research, Development and Innovation initiatives in cyber security. Investment, skills development and innovation are required to sustain economic growth50. This includes further Research and Development (R&D) expenditure51 , to support innovation potential. ‘A Strong European security ecosystem’ - one of the four priority areas of the EU Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2025 - includes a specific objective of ‘strengthening research and innovation’ to contribute to further capacity building in cyber security. Related efforts, initiatives and funding programmes, facilitated through the National Coordination Centre, as well as from various national and EU entities at academic and industrial levels, should help Malta improve its Research, Development and Innovation (RDI) capabilities in cyber security. Establishing a research cluster relevant to the Maltese landscape should be explored. Indeed, Malta views cyber security as a niche area in digital technology. It is identified as a smart specialisation area, carrying high RDI potential52. Of particular value would be for the results of RDI to be used to actively promote a wider understanding of the potentialities of cyber security on a national scale. Through the chapter 05 Cyber Competence and Culture58 potential use of pre-commercial procurement procedures, the Public Administration could become a first customer of Maltese cyber security RDI, kickstarting its growth. One area of innovation where Malta stands to gain is in quantum computing and quantum communications. EU Member States, including Malta, have committed to working with the EC for the deployment of a secure quantum communication infrastructure for Europe (EuroQCI). Quantum communication infrastructure aims to offer secure transmission of confidential information to public authorities using an ultra-secure form of encryption to shield against cyberattack. The specifically assigned EuroQCI board - which is co-chaired by Malta - is finalising an action plan for a way forward in the creation of the EuroQCI and related industry, seeking EU funds in the process. Ultimately, Malta would need to gauge its overall national cyber security capacity regularly so as to ensure that cyberspace, and its constituents, were increasingly resilient. The application of standard, widely recognised models may help in this regard. ACTIONS 3.11 Foster research, development and innovation, with respect to cybersecurity tools and secure network infrastructure, by institutions in Malta. 3.12 Facilitate investment in tools and equipment to tackle various aspects of cyber security through national and/or EU funding programmes. 3.13 Foster Government plans to bolster cybersecurity research, development and innovation. 3.14 Undertake a review of Malta’s maturity in cyber security capacity. National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 59 60 chapter 06 International Cooperation 61 6.1 The Key Objective Promote and maintain a strong presence in the cyber security field internationally, in cooperation with all relevant stakeholders. chapter 06 International Cooperation62 6.2 The Sub- objectives A. Strategic engagement with key partners and international organisations. There are mounting concerns about the dual-use nature of today’s emerging technology, for public safety and national security, considering global geopolitical tensions. Since countries view such technologies as central to their security, they recognise that their malignant use or misuse could lead to adverse consequences on a large scale. Greater economic integration and connectivity has meant that the effects and consequences of technological advances are far less localised than before. Indeed, they can spread to countries and industries worldwide. Hence, it is crucial for a nation state to foster international cooperation in order to reduce its vulnerability and enhance resilience. Cyber space discussions have taken place in various international organisations, including the United Nations (UN), the Council of Europe (CoE), the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in 63National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 Europe (OSCE), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Commonwealth, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), the African Union (AU), the Organisation of American States (OAS), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and the EU. Malta, as a member of both the EU and UN, is engaging with these organisations to further cooperation in cyber security, especially in the areas of training, education, cyber defence and technology innovation. In February 2021, Malta appointed its first-ever Ambassador for Digital Affairs, a move which has strengthened its relationship with international partners and multinational organisations. Malta participates in the EU cyber dialogue, consultations and outreach programmes with third countries to build trust and exchange best practice.  Close working relationships on aspects of cyber security have also been established with a number of EU counterparts. Malta appreciates the need for close international collaboration so as to foster the exchange of cyber security defence intelligence and best practice, ensuring a strong knowledge base and enhanced cyber security competencies. ACTIONS 4.1 Continue to foster cooperation and support, including through bilateral and multilateral agreements, in the field of cyber security. 4.2 Consolidate the role of the Ambassador for Digital Affairs in strengthening Malta’s relations with international like-minded partners. B. Participation and cooperation in European and international fora. Participation in European and international fora contribute to the successful actualisation of foreign policy in the sphere of cyber security whilst building the nation’s image as a competent player. Malta is pursuing increased co-operation within the EU and other groupings, institutions and bodies in which it is a member, such as the CoE, the OSCE, the Commonwealth, and the UN. Such matters pertain to awareness, confidence chapter 06 International Cooperation64 building measures, crisis management, and hybrid threats53. Effective participation calls for a multi-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder approach, requiring shared expertise, co-operation and coordination. ACTIONS 4.3 Intensify participation in EU, regional and international cyber related fora. 4.4 Co-operate with other countries to instill greater awareness of the threat of cyber malicious activities that may contribute to a wider hybrid threat campaign. C. Application of existing international law and measures promoting responsible state behaviour in cyberspace within the context of international security. As part of its international commitment, Malta has participated in the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security (UN GGE) and the UN-mandated Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTs in the context of International Security (UN OEWG). The UN GGE’s efforts led to the introduction of the UN Framework of Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace consisting of the applicability of international law - in particular the Charter of the UN - to cyberspace, as well as voluntary norms, rules, principles, Confidence Building Measures (CBMs)54 and capacity building. The UN OEWG, for its part, promoted the establishment of an open, multi-stakeholder approach as well as the further development and application of the rules, norms, principles, CBMs and capacity building for responsible behaviour in cyberspace. The development of CBMs for cyberspace proves to be more difficult, given that by its very nature, cyberspace does not erase spatial boundaries and the transnational dimension allows for anonymity55. Hence, CBMs for cyberspace, along with political commitment to them, are significant for the progressive development of international law56 within such realm. Whilst Malta has committed itself to such instruments, it still needs to develop a national position on the applicability of international law and states’ behaviour on the world stage. Such development, along with supporting tools and resources, should enable Malta to play a stronger role in international cyberspace policy. ACTIONS 4.5 Pursue and improve upon active participation in international meetings on responsible state behaviour in cyberspace within the context of international security and implement outcomes accordingly. 65National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 D. EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox. Cyber-attacks can paralyse a Government’s decision-making systems, cripple a country’s essential infrastructure and cause panic, potentially leading to unrest and inadvertent wars. Hence diplomacy plays a crucial role. In recent years, efforts at an EU level has intensified in this regard. The Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox introduced by the EC’s draft Conclusions on the Framework for a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber Activities seeks to provide the EU and its Member States, in a transparent and resolute manner, a set of instruments of diplomatic, political and economic nature, for adequate and determined responses to malicious cyber activities. Through it, the EU has steadily committed itself to promote the benefits of adhering to norms of responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. It has equipped itself with restrictive measures, as a response to malicious cyber activities, and is determined to change the behaviour of state and non-state actors acting against the responsible norms of cyberspace. The fact that EU restrictive measures against cyber-attack is a horizontal sanctions regime, as opposed to a geographical sanctions regime, means that persons and entities that satisfy the designation criteria may be listed from whichever country they hail from, thus rendering the tool effective and wide reaching. Malta, as an EU member state, has the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox at its disposal, alongside other instruments of cyber diplomacy, to use as a deterrent against overseas actors contemplating malicious activities in cyberspace. chapter 06 International Cooperation66 Malta, along with other EU Member states, is being invited to place emphasis on the further development and sophistication of the decision‑making and invocation processes of the Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox by drawing lessons from its initial applications. ACTIONS 4.6 Contribute to the further development and sophistication of the EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox. 67National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 chapter 07 Way Forward 68 The Strategy has outlined high‑level priority actions for attaining the sub-objectives identified for each domain for the next three years. The actions translate into specific activities assigned to respective owners for implementation within stipulated timelines as part of an Action Plan. Strong cyber security capability and capacity is a strategic priority for Government and, in collaboration with stakeholders, it shall continue striving to ensure that the country is well equipped and prepared to manage digital risk. Both the Public Administration and the private sector have finite resources, technology is constantly evolving and measures to address cyber security threats may not remain highly effective as technological advances bring with them a plethora of new cyber threat vectors. Additionally, further regulatory cyber security related developments at EU level, impacting upon Member States, including Malta, are envisaged. Hence, the course of action for implementation of this Strategy cannot be cast in stone. Therefore, the National Cyber Security Steering Committee shall coordinate the Strategy’s implementation by various stakeholders whilst taking measures to continually enhance Malta’s security posture. It shall monitor the progress registered with respect to the action plan whilst keeping an eye on developments within the cyber security sphere at a domestic, EU and international level so as to update the Plan accordingly. Widely recognised or nationally set performance indicators may be applied to gauge Malta’s relative maturity in this sphere. Whilst the National Cyber Security Strategy shall act as the national reference point for cyber security matters, it shall not exclude, but rather encourage, the establishment of aligned strategic frameworks and/or initiatives in cyber security focusing on the various sectors/ disciplines in Maltese society and economy. Ultimately, cyber security is a global concern and it is in everyone’s interests to ensure a multi-disciplined, yet common and unified, approach to its ever-evolving challenges. 69 Glossary The following definitions apply for the purposes of this Strategy. Confidence Building Measures Measures to address, prevent or resolve uncertainties among states. They are designed to prevent wanted, and especially unwanted, escalations of hostilities and build mutual trust. They can be formal or informal, unilateral, bilateral, or multilateral, military or political, and can be state-to-state or non-governmental57.  Cyber Attack Cyber incident triggered by malicious intent where damage, disruption or dysfunctionalities are caused58. Cybercrime  Encompasses criminal acts committed in cyber space59, which are:  Cyber-dependent or new forms of crimes made possible with the advent of the Internet and Internet-enabled digital devices60. Cyber-enabled or hybrid crimes where traditional, real-world crimes, such as online fraud, are perpetrated in cyberspace61.  Cyber Hygiene Covers several practices that should be implemented and carried out regularly to protect persons and organisations online62. Cyber Incident Any occurrence that has impact on any of the components of cyber space or on the functioning of cyber space, independent of whether it’s natural or human made; malicious or of non-malicious intent; deliberate, accidental or due to incompetence; development or operational interactions.63. Cyber Defence Ability to prevent, mitigate or respond to cyber attacks64. Cyber Security All activities necessary to protect cyber space and its users from cyber threats65.   Cyber Space A time-dependent interacting set of physical and logical (non-physical) assets which store and/or transfer digital data66. Cyber Threat Circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact an asset through unauthorised access, destruction, disclosure, modification of data, and/or denial of service67. Glossary70 Hybrid Threat Action conducted by state or non-state actors, whose goal is to undermine or harm a target by influencing its decision-making at the national, regional, state or institutional level. Such actions are coordinated and synchronised and deliberately target democratic states’ and institutions’ vulnerabilities. Activities can take place in the political, economic, military, civil or information domains. They are conducted using a wide range of means and designed to remain below the threshold of detection and attribution68.

No longer are  disruptive technologies  in the realm of science  fiction; they are  creating an abundance  of possibilities for  business, Government  and humankind itself.   2 Foreword    We are also acutely aware of the dangers lurking  within this field and recognise that it would be an  exercise in futility if we do not ensure the maximum  security and resilience possible in the face of  relentless cyber threats. With the extensive growth  of digitalisation, the exposure to cybercrime will  increase inevitably and therefore the National  Cyber Security Strategy 2023-2026 has been  designed with our country’s future wellbeing in  mind. It lays the groundwork for further investment  by Government in cyber security for the next three  years. Government has a clear leadership role in  cyber security, but it cannot act alone. Together,  we can foster increased confidence and trust in the  digital world. This includes a greater propensity  towards cyber hygiene, a drive towards attracting  minds within the cyber security domain as well as  further co-operation on a national, European and  global scale.  Ultimately, the cyber threat can never be  discounted or ignored. The consequences of  suffering a cyberattack would be massive,  resulting in data loss, system outage and  reputational damage. Unfortunately, it is a threat  that can never be fully eradicated. The open  nature of the cyber world shall always expose us to  such risk, irrespective of measures taken.  Nonetheless, together, we can minimise the level  and impact of these threats, whilst successfully  forging ahead in digitalisation. This Strategy will  pave the way for such action.  Hon. Silvio Schembri Minister for the Economy, European Funds and Lands  3  Malta’s political will to embrace, adapt and adopt  these seismic changes has positioned our country  at the forefront of the technological revolution.  Only a negligible number of countries have  managed to emulate the pace of our country’s  progress in digitalisation and even fewer have  recognised and fully embraced the potentiality of  new technologies.  Our pioneering stance, with a wholehearted  commitment to continue with the further  implementation of technologies, has placed  Malta as a leading digital innovator, a cut well  above the rest of its European peers. The recent  global health and economic challenges  demonstrated our reliance on information and  communications technology. Malta, by dint of its  solid and unwavering commitment to  digitalisation, has weathered the storm quite  competently.  However, as empowering as our vision is, we also  recognise that with great power comes great  responsibility. While interconnectedness, through  further implementation of technologies, shall allow  us to forge further ahead in our administrative,  business and personal activities, we shall continue  to launch fiscal measures to strengthen Malta’s  appeal as a hub for foreign investment in this  sector, while identifying the underlying skill base  and infrastructure required for it to flourish.  But  not only this. As we have done in the past, with the  launching of AI, Space, E-Commerce and E-Skills  strategies, we shall continue to identify regulatory  policies for the implementation of ethically aligned,  transparent and socially responsible technologies.  National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026    Foreword by the Minister  for Home Affairs,  Security, Reforms and  Equality  The significant leaps  we have made in  digitalisation on a  national scale in recent  years has made us  increasingly aware of  the danger of threats  within cyber space.  Foreword4    next three years. The attainment and success  of the Strategy is contingent upon a variety of  diverse participants, not only within Government  but also the private sector and Maltese society  as a whole.   I am confident that we shall use this Strategy  as an opportunity to all work together as one  nation in a responsible and coordinated manner.  Ultimately, cyber security not only protects our  assets but ensures vigilance to the essential  tenets of our free, European and democratic  society in a time of heightened global digital  transformation.   Hon. Dr Byron Camilleri Minister for Home Affairs, Security, Reforms and Equality  5  Cyber space is ever evolving, and it is an  ever-growing dependency for our national  security.  It does not eliminate spatial  boundaries. Its cross-border nature allows for  anonymity, bringing about issues and challenges  of jurisdiction, conflict and criminality. Cyber  criminals are fully aware of this and are causing  damage and harm, stealthily and craftily  infiltrating systems from anywhere around  the globe, stealing identity and sensitive data  and defrauding unsuspecting organisations  and individuals. They are targeting critical  infrastructures upon which our day to day  lives and activities depend and are exploiting  vulnerable situations we face on a personal or  wider scale, even fuelling uncertainty, fear and  distrust through the spread of fake information.  The National Cyber Security Strategy  2023-2026 aims to protect our national interests  in a planned and coordinated fashion for the   National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026     Heightened online activity at social and economic  levels, spurred by further developments and  applicability of Internet based technologies and  concepts have led to bolder and  more complex  cyber threats. A global focus on health and  economic risks has aggravated further the  susceptibility to wider and bolder attacks by  criminals.   Cyber attacks are also being increasingly  orchestrated as part of a mixed array of tools  by external state and non-state actors aimed  at interfering with the stability, effectiveness, and  legitimacy of the European Union and Member  States.  This calls for cyber security to be  addressed as part of a broader whole-of- government approach which recognises the  existence of such multi-faceted and multi-layered  hybrid threats.    Government and society needs to be prepared  and resilient. There is a need for cyber security  to be addressed on a national scale with a  planned, collective and systemic effort from all  stakeholders.  The National Cyber Security  Strategy 2023-2026 follows an initial one  published in 2016, which laid the foundation  blocks for such an approach in Malta.   Several regulatory activities and initiatives in  cyber security have occurred, or are in process, on  a national, EU and global scale in areas such as  network and information systems, electronic  communications, technology and research  competency, cross border public service delivery  and information sharing and diplomacy.  Digitalisation, including wider diffusion and  consumption of broadband, mobile technologies  and data, has progressed further in Malta, with  the Public Administration being at the forefront of   related service provision, along with increased use  of social and business digital interactions.  The National Cyber Security Strategy 2023-2026 is  being articulated with such considerations in place,  whilst allowing for evolving challenges and realities.   The Strategy is based upon four key principles:  Shared responsibility of stakeholders in  tackling cyber security. This is necessary to  protect against and deter potential cyber- attacks as well as to respond to disruptions  that do occur.  An inclusive, comprehensive and integrative  approach whereby cooperation, coordination  and collaboration are ensured on a national,  European and global scale.  Balanced risk management that assesses  cyber risk and takes a proportionate degree  of measures, ensuring that innovation is not  stifled in the process.  A balanced compliance approach that  engenders conformance to cyber security  standards commensurate to the context and  focus to which they are intended.  The principles need to be put into practice by  the Maltese public administration, the private  sector and all Maltese society including a  community of cyber security experts and  practitioners. Indeed, these stakeholders  constitute the core of the Strategy’s overall   vision that:  Malta is more secure and resilient to  cyber threats, leading to more trust  and confidence within the digital  world.  Executive Summary  Executive Summary6    and training aspects of cyber security in various  professions and the need to establish a strong  security first ethos. The establishment of a  National Coordination Centre, in line with EU legal  requirements, shall be instrumental. It shall also  promote research development and innovation in  cyber security.  Domain 4: International Cooperation   This domain aims to foster active cooperation and  engagement by Malta at bi-lateral, multi-lateral,  European and international levels in areas of  international security in cyberspace, cyber  capacity building, cyber response and cybercrime.   The actions proposed by each of the four  domains translate into more specific activities  which are assigned to respective owners for  implementation within stipulated timelines, as  part of an Action Plan.   In general, though, resources in cyber security on  a national scale are limited, and technology and  its use keep on evolving, leading to new cyber  security challenges.  Additionally, the regulatory  landscape in cyber security is evolving, particularly  at EU level, leaving its mark on Malta as a Member  State. Thus, coordination and monitoring of  progress of the Action Plan, through the National  Cyber Security Steering Committee, shall be  accompanied by regular reviews to reflect these  considerations over the next three years.   Whilst the National Cyber Security Strategy   2023-2026 acts as the national focal point on  cyber security from a strategic perspective, it shall  not exclude related strategies focusing on sectors/ disciplines of Maltese society and its economy.  Cybersecurity is a global concern of national  importance.  Hence it is in everyone’s interest to  ensure that it is addressed effectively.  7  The Vision reflects continuity in Malta’s pursuit  of bolstering its cyber security and capability to  return to normality within the shortest time possible  in case of disruption due to a cyber-attack.  No country, entity or individual can be totally  immune from potential cyber-attack despite  measures taken to protect against such an event.  Ultimately, as indicated by the Vision, such a  dual strategic thrust should lead to increased  confidence and trust in a digital environment that  enhances economic and societal activity.    The Vision reaches fruition through a number  of proposed actions based upon sub‑objectives  emanating from the following four domains:   Domain 1: Cyber Security Governance Capacity  This domain aims to promote and maintain a  robust cyber security governance framework so as  to ensure that risks effecting Malta in cyberspace  are adequately addressed. They are to be tackled  from legislative, regulatory, policy, standard and  best practice aspects and, most importantly, from  a risk management and supplier management  perspective.   Domain 2: Cyber Defence Capacity   This domain is based upon the premise that the  complexity of cyberspace makes it hard to prevent  all attacks, which, in a number of instances,  are likely to be more disruptive and costly than  natural disasters. Hence, it aims for a stronger  multi-stakeholder concerted effort, in terms  of operations, for dealing with cybersecurity  challenges from a reactive as well as a proactive  perspective, including consolidating and sharing  cyber threat intelligence.  Domain 3: Cyber Competence and Culture   This domain recognises that cyber security needs  to be addressed from a human resource and  cultural perspective. It focuses on the academic   National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026     Acronyms  AI Artificial Intelligence  ASEAN Association of Southeast Asian Nations  ARF ASEAN Regional Forum  AU African Union  CBM Confidence Building Measures   CoE Council of Europe  CSIRT Computer Security and Incident Response Team  DORA Digital Operational Resilience Act  DSP Digital Service Providers  ENISA European Union Agency for Cyber Security   EC European Commission  EU European Union  EU CCCN European Cyber Security Industrial, Technology and Research Competence  Centre and Network of National Coordination Centres  EuroQCI European Quantum Communication Infrastructure  FDI Foreign Direct Investment   GDPR General Data Protection Regulation  ICT Information and Communications Technology  IOC Indicators of Compromise  Acronyms8    ITA Innovative Technology Arrangements  IXP Internet Exchange Points  LN Legal Notice  NATO North Atlantic Treaty Organisation   NIS Network and Information Security  OAS Organisation of American States  OES Operators of Essential Services  OSCE Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe  OECD Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  OOP Once Only Principle  R&D Research and Development  RDI Research Development and Innovation  SOC Security Operations Centre  SME Small to Medium sized Enterprises  UN United Nations  UN GGE UN Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing Responsible State Behaviour  in Cyberspace in the context of International Security  UN OEWG UN Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of  ICTs in the context of International Security  National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 9    10    chapter 01   Strategic  Context  11    1.1  Background  The demands of cyber  security1 on society and the  economy are an increasingly  evolving challenge in an era  of digital transformation. The  global pandemic has further  accentuated the use of digital  activity with remote ways of  working, interacting and doing  business. It has increased  dependency on digital  platforms and technologies by  organisations and individuals.  chapter 01 Strategic Context12    Cyber-attacks2 have increased relentlessly, in sophistication and in ubiquity. They  have been spurred by further growth in internet connected technologies such as  e-commerce, the Internet of Things, social media, mobile payments and cloud computing.  International conflicts show that, escalated disputes between nation states are  incorporating cyber space. Thus wars are being fought through rigorous cyber- attacks on nation states, with the intent to disrupt a country’s stability.  An increased dependency on technology in matters from health to the economy  aggravates further the susceptibility to wider and bolder attacks by criminals.  Therefore, cyber-security cannot be tackled in isolation. There needs to be a  concerted and strategic approach that keeps in view of the increasingly digital  ecosystem nationally and internationally.  This Strategy is Malta’s second in cyber security, following the previous one  published in 2016.  The first Strategy provided the foundation, outlining a series  of actions that need to be addressed. It sought to align itself to  the requirements of the EU 2016/1148 Directive of the European Parliament and  Council of 6 July 2016 concerning ‘measures for a high common level of security  of network and information systems across the European Union’ (EU)3. This was  the first piece of EU-wide legislation on cyber security which, at the time of  publication of the Strategy, was still not applicable across Member States   13National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026     chapter 01 Strategic Context  but which has since been transposed into Maltese network  and information security legislation as L.N. 216 of 20184.  Awareness of the need to deal with cyber security on a  national scale came with the implementation of a strategic  awareness and education campaign, which, along with  other measures such as those related to cybercrime and  further activities involving multi-stakeholder cooperation,  were proposed by the initial Strategy.   The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has also  come into force since then, increasing awareness on cyber  matters, albeit from a privacy perspective, particularly  within businesses5.  One cannot discount the further  evolution of digitalisation in all of the nation’s economic  and societal spheres which, though positive, also pose  higher probabilities of cyber risk.  14    In recent years, a higher share of online sales has been indicated by  Maltese businesses relative to their EU counterparts6, whilst there has  been a consistent growth in online purchases by Maltese consumers7.  Indeed, online social8 and business interaction9 have maintained  an upward trend, spurred by an increased growth in broadband  penetration10, mobile telephony usage and data consumption11.  Government maintained  momentum in being at the forefront in  digital service provision of  public services12. The digitalisation of  Malta’s Public Administration13, enabled by strategic approaches  in its adoption of mobile telephony and technologies including AI14,  continues at a steady pace, in line with EU related developments.  The Single Digital Gateway Regulation, now in force, provides the  basis for EU-wide implementation of the once-only principle (OOP)  and is expected to be applied at cross border level by 2023. The  2020 legislation Re-use of Public Sector Information Act (CAP 546)  facilitates implementation of the OOP, whilst extending the definition  and concept of re-use of documents within the Public Administration.  Additionally, the implementation of the EU Digital Single Market  Strategy calls for high-speed, secure and trustworthy infrastructures  and services supported by the right regulatory conditions. Indeed, in  2018, Malta took a proactive stance by introducing a new regulatory  framework on innovative technologies15.  All such developments call for various multi-disciplinary  cyber security measures to counter increased possibilities  of technology, data and, ultimately, service compromise.  Furthermore, it is increasingly clear that cooperation and  coordination at a European and international level is crucial  in addressing cyber security effectively.  National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 15    In December 2020, the European Council and  the European Parliament reached a provisional  agreement on a proposal to set up a European  Cyber Security Industrial, Technology and  Research Competence Centre and a network of  national coordination centres to invest in stronger  and pioneering cyber security capacity in the  EU.  Additionally, new EU regulations set out a  European cyber security certification framework  for Information and Communications Technology  (ICT) products, services and processes, in  addition to granting a permanent mandate to  the European Union Agency for Cyber Security  (ENISA).  The European Commission (EC) has also  presented a new EU Cyber Security Strategy which  aims to introduce an agile means for detecting  and deflecting cyberattacks across Europe  while strengthening internet security globally,  fostering information sharing and collective  responses, enhancing cyber defence cooperation,  strengthening further the EU cyber diplomacy  toolbox, strengthening external cyber capacity  building, actively contributing to international  security in cyberspace at UN level and ensuring  security in the Internet of Things16. The Strategy  complements a number of legislative proposals  that have been made at European level such as  those related to an EU wide cyber diplomacy  toolbox, 5G cyber security and a wider in scope  Network and Information Security Directive,  among other proposals some of which are largely  sectorial in nature.  Therefore, whilst the  strategic approaches  of the initial National  Cyber Security Strategy  are still valid, societal,  political, economic and  technological evolvements  at a national and  European level need to be  kept in view.   Ultimately,  increasing complexity, coupled with a  constantly changing scenario within cyber security,  calls for a multi-disciplinary effort that factors  in the relevance and horizontal nature of cyber  security, addressing it in a systemic, comprehensive  and coordinated manner.  chapter 01 Strategic Context16    1.2  Purpose and Scope  This Strategy intends to serve as a continuation to the  National Cyber Security Strategy 2016.  It aims to deliver  further progress by:    Aligning to specific domestic, EU and international  regulatory requirements.  Taking into account of present realities, challenges and  evolvements in cyber security on a national and global  scale through a number of strategic, operational and  cultural measures, beyond the regulatory ones.  Whilst encouraging the articulation of Cyber Security  Strategies and their subsequent implementation at an  organisational or even business sectoral level, the  National Cyber Security Strategy 2023‑2026 is wider in  scope, ensuring that its overall implementation has a  nationwide impact. It has several objectives with timely,  speci ic and actionable measures, aimed at:    Strengthening protection of digital infrastructure and  its dependencies on a national scale, not only from a  technological point of view but also from strategic,  operational, legal and regulatory perspectives.  Ensuring a cyber risk assessment approach across the  business and economic sector.  Ensuring national cyber security consciousness and  increased capabilities in cyber security.  Fostering cooperation in cyber security on a national,  European and international scale.  1. 2  These measures apply for all stakeholders of the Maltese  economy and society as increasingly active participants in cyber  space as well as contributors to its security and resilience.  National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 17    chapter 02   Overall   Direction  18    19    2.1  Introduction This Chapter sets the scene for  the National Cyber Security  Strategy 2023-2026, in light  of the considerations detailed  in the previous Chapter.  It outlines the principles  underpinning the Vision of  the Strategy for the next three  years. The Vision is seen to  come into fruition by means  of a Model with four domains,  each encapsulating a number  of objectives to be reached.  chapter 02 Overall Direction20    2.2  Guiding  Principles   The Strategy shall be guided  by four principles, all of  which call for a balanced,  multi- disciplinary and multi- stakeholder approach,  encapsulating the notions of  subsidiarity, complementarity  and proportionality.   21National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026     Shared responsibility   In essence, this is a principle of subsidiarity,  whereby cyber security is a shared responsibility  between all stakeholders. The Government  assumes a leading role but cannot have sole  responsibility and accountability given that  the private sector, as well as society as a whole  are also users, beneficiaries and owners of  infrastructure. They too contribute to a secure  and stable cyber space. Hence, all users have the  responsibility of taking steps to protect the cyber  landscape on an individual and collective basis.  They all need to be aware of privacy protection  methods and of ensuring security against  cyberattacks.  Inclusive, Comprehensive and  Integrative Approach  The interdependencies inherent within the  connectedness of cyber space, and the potential  consequent spread of impact from a related  incident, call for complementarity action and  shared trust.  This is enabled by cooperation,  collaboration and coordination mechanisms  amongst the various stakeholders on a domestic,  European and international scale.  Balanced Risk Management  The continuous growth and evolvement of  cyber space renders it impossible to guarantee  a scenario devoid of risks from any form  of threat.  Risk management is an ongoing  concern that covers all elements of cyberspace  in terms of their constitution as well as their  use.  It does not come without cost.  Thus, the  allocation and adequacy of resources needs to  be proportionate to the risk identified, within its  particular context, and to the course of action to  be taken.  Overall, risk management should not  stifle innovation but reflect a proportionate level  of investment that allows for its secure utilisation.   Balanced Compliance Approach  Additionally, apart from risk management,  within the notion of proportionality is the need  to establish and ensure compliance to necessary  security safeguards and measures that are  commensurate to the context and to what needs  to be protected within the cyber space domain.  chapter 02 Overall Direction22    Malta is more secure  and resilient to cyber  threats leading  to more trust and  confidence within the  digital world.  2.3  Vision  Taking into perspective these principles, the overall cyber  security scenario, as well as Malta’s drive towards attaining  further social and economic progress through digital  evolution, the following overall Vision shall guide the  National Cyber Security Strategy for the next three years:  The drive towards further cyber resilience and cyber  security will serve to underpin trust and confidence in the  use of digital facilities which can enhance economic and  societal activity for all.   National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 23    2.4  Model   The components bringing the Vision to fruition can be summed up  through the following model which encompasses the:   Key National Stakeholders at its core. Four Key Domains, all inter‑related,   that need to be tackled.  Public Administration  Private Sector  Society  Cyber Security  Community  CYBER SECURITY GOVERNANCE CAPACITY  INTERNATIONAL  COOPERATION  CYBER  DEFENCE   CAPACITY  CYBER  COMPETENCE  AND CULTURE  chapter 02 Overall Direction24    2.5  Key National  Stakeholders   The vision is all encompassing in that it involves the main national  stakeholders, entailing that:  The Public Administration leads the way in ensuring  secure and resilient cyber space on a nationwide scale.   The Private Sector cooperates with the Public  Administration, securing its product/service portfolios  and protecting its client bases from known cyber  vulnerabilities.  Society practices secure online behaviour and makes  informed decisions on digital transactions and  interactions.  The Cyber Security Community of individuals and  organisations, that significantly contribute to the  Maltese cyber‑security scene in a professional capacity  or otherwise, is encouraged to grow further to play an  increasingly crucial role.   Not everything can be protected against every type of threat and  risk but each of the stakeholders has roles and responsibilities which  clearly reflect the underlying principles of shared responsibility and  cooperation and coordination by all. Technical security needs to  be further strengthened, but human factors have to be taken into  account too since they are the underlying cause of cyber incidents  or the key vector to exploit for cyber-attack. Hence, stakeholders’  obligations inherently carry such needs and expectations by the  stakeholders themselves that need to be fulfilled accordingly. The  four domains presented within the model embody such perspectives  to ensure a comprehensive and inclusive approach.  National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 25    2.6  Key Domains   Four domains, which aim to address the domestic  and international evolvement of the cyber security  landscape, have been identified.   Domain 1: Cyber Security Governance Capacity  Governance is a key element in cyber security as  it determines the responsibility and accountability  structure, ensuring oversight to mitigate cyber  risks. On a national scale, it stipulates the laws,  regulations, policies, processes, standards and  best practices required to determine how the  country can respond to and limit cyber incidents  effectively.  Domain 2: Cyber Defence Capacity    Cyberspace has become so complex that  preventing all attacks is impossible. Such attacks  can be exponentially more harmful and costly  than damage caused by natural disasters.  This  challenge is addressed through the capacity  to conduct continuous monitoring for potential  threats, rapid detection of potential attacks,  ensuring a network of information sharing and  coordination and, ultimately, being in a position  to respond to occurrences of cyber disruptions  effectively. Technology, along with the suitable  skills and processes to detect and respond, acts as  one key enabler to defend against cyber threats.  Domain 3: Cyber Competence and Culture  In addition to political, technological,  organisational and legal measures, a progressive  digital culture is needed and this comes from  a strong capacity building regime. Capacity   building includes ongoing and comprehensive  cyber security awareness programmes to promote  and foster a security-first culture. It also includes  competence and knowledge development  through certifications, increased academic focus  on cyber security and professional training and  educational programmes targeting not only ICT  practitioners but also professions in other fields.  Human and institutional capacity building in  cyber security and its human, socio-economic  and political implications cannot be side-stepped  so cyber security must not be addressed from a  technological perspective only.  Domain 4: International Cooperation  Cyber security is a global challenge. It knows no  bounds of national territory or sectoral scope.  Thus, it requires a multi-stakeholder approach  involving cooperation from various functions  and disciplines, nationally and internationally. It  calls for strategic engagements such as bi-lateral  and multi-lateral agreements, participation in  European and international fora, co-operation  and information sharing frameworks and  agreed international/European related norms  of behaviour. Apart from indicating a country’s  willingness and commitment to the peaceful use  of cyberspace, international cooperation can  strengthen capacity building, threat detection  and deterrence capabilities as well as increase the  scope of enforcement and judicial   powers in tackling cybercrime.   chapter 02 Overall Direction26    2.7  Focus for each  Key Domain   The next four Chapters expand each  corresponding domain in further detail. Each  domain shall carry an overall objective, in line  with what the domain embodies. In turn, the  overall objective embodies a number of sub- objectives, each of which include a strategic  context and rationale, leading to a number of  proposed high-level actions that are envisaged  for realisation of the Strategy.  27National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026     chapter 03   Cyber Security  Governance   Capacity  28    29    3.1  The Key  Objective  Promote and maintain  a robust cyber security  framework of responsibility,  accountability and strategic  direction to protect, respond  to and minimise threats and  challenges that compromise  the security of Malta in  cyberspace.  chapter 03 Cyber Security Governance Capacity30    3.2  The Sub- objectives  A. Adaptation of the domestic legal framework  to meet changing needs and challenges in cyber  security.  The legal framework, including legislation and  regulation, ensures Malta’s ongoing preparedness  in terms of response through investigation and  prosecution of cybercrimes, the imposition of  appropriate sanctions for non-compliance or breach  of law as well as the basis for a level of appropriate  behaviour expected within cyberspace. The  increasingly global, complex and dynamic nature of  cyber security challenges necessitate the need for a  domestic review and update of such legal measures  to ensure their currency and relevance, including  alignment with EU legal developments.  31National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026     The transposition of EU Directive (EU) 1148  of 2016 (NIS) into Legal Notice L.N. 216 of  2018 led to the identification of its National  Competent Authority of the National Computer  Security and Incident Response Team (CSIRT).  It has also defined the Operators of Essential  Services (OESs) and the Digital Service Providers  (DSPs) within the local context. This led to the  implementation of security and notification  requirements and several cooperation and  coordination mechanisms. Such activities  shall continue, with a focus on having a more  comprehensive list of OESs, as well as further  policy direction regarding the obligations of both  OESs and DSPs.  The transposition of the legal framework for  security and integrity of networks and services, as  well as other related EU regulatory requirements,  complements this further. Specifically, in early  2020, the EC called on Member States to  take steps to implement the set of measures  recommended in the 5G toolbox conclusions17.  The growth of 5G will enable newer connection  and service opportunities spurred by higher   transmission rates and lower latency, their  potential criticality of which would render them  highly susceptible to cyberattack.    Other legislative proposals, related to cyber  security, have been made at European level  during 2020, such as that for a renewed  Network and Information Security Directive  and a Digital Operational Resilience Regulation  (DORA) for the Financial Sector. The latter  sector is increasingly reliant upon information  and communications technologies through an  increased demand in Europe for remote access to  financial services18.  This has led to a significant  rise in cyberattacks on financial institutions19,  which call for increased risk mitigation in their  digital transformation so as to ensure stronger  operational resilience through the Regulation.  The Regulation also complements the EU Digital  Finance Strategy which, as part of an EC Digital  Finance Package, aims to foster customer access  to innovative financial products whilst ensuring  consumer protection and financial stability20.  Thus, the importance for such robust cyber  security regulation within the financial sector, as  well as in sectors such as gaming and the services  industry, is vital within the Maltese economic  context21.  One particular notion that is gaining  importance at EU level is vulnerability disclosure.  This would enable well-intentioned individuals to  investigate and report, in a safe and transparent  manner, systems vulnerabilities they have  detected without incurring the risk of criminal  action against them.   chapter 03 Cyber Security Governance Capacity32    However, cyber security legal frameworks cannot  simply be devised around interests of legal entities and  the personal lives of individuals. It is increasingly the  case that cyber breaches may be specifically intended  to impair the security, sovereignty and integrity of a  nation. This is compounded by the fact that cybercrime  knows no geographical boundaries and the inherent  possibilities of anonymity in cyber space make it harder  to attribute with certainty.   This in turn may potentially cause grave diplomatic consequences  between states, calling for increased focus on nation state behaviour  in cyber space as well as diplomatic preparedness in case of related  transgression. Developments at a European scale have become  increasingly crucial following the introduction in June 2017 of the EU  cyber diplomacy toolbox through the Conclusions on the Framework  for a Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber activities.  In  addition to participating at a European level, Malta is also actively  contributing to work being done by the UN Group of Governmental  Experts on Advancing responsible state behaviour in cyberspace and by  the UN-mandated Open-Ending Working Group on Developments in  the Field of ICTS within the context of International Security. However,  Malta still needs to clarify its position with respect to the applicability  of international law in cyberspace. Malta would then be in a stronger  position to play a role in international cyberspace policy.  National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 33    International legal and regulatory developments have had an impact upon various  parts of the Maltese legal framework. Cyber security has also been addressed in  other parts of the domestic legal framework such as the Criminal Code.  Hence  there is a need for a consolidated view of the various legal and regulatory  references on cyber security within the Maltese legal framework for a better and  more comprehensive understanding of its coverage and its applicability.    ACTIONS   1.1 Establish a consolidated view of the coverage and applicability of  cyber security within the Maltese legal framework.   1.2 Review and update the national legal framework to ensure its currency  with respect to the cyber security challenges in an increasingly digital  economy and society in areas including:  Cybercrime investigations and electronic evidence.  Transposition of new EU cyber related Legislation  (sectoral or otherwise), within stipulated timeframes,  following agreement by the EU Council and   European Parliament.  1.3 Adopt and implement measures resulting from cyber/cyber-related  regulations and legislation nationally.  1.4 Establish Malta’s position on (i) cyberoperations against it in  peacetime and (ii) applicability of international law with respect to  cyberoperations in armed conflict situations, keeping in view related  EU requirements.  1.5 Issue a Vulnerability Disclosure policy covering critical areas falling  within the scope of Maltese network and information systems security  legislation for reporting parties such as security experts   and consultants.   1.6 Issue vulnerability disclosure policies or guidelines, as well as other  cyber security specific policies or guidelines within specific economic  sectors, as applicable.  chapter 03 Cyber Security Governance Capacity34    B B. Ensure consolidation of national cyber security at a strategic level.  The publication of a National Cyber Security Strategy alone is not  sufficient for ensuring effective harmonisation in cyber security  strategic development. The National Cyber Security Committee,  composed of diverse national stakeholders in cyber security, is  one means of facilitating the conduct of cyber security efforts in  a coordinated fashion. However, as the cyber security challenge  becomes more intense, there is a need for a stronger strategic  role to ensure improved governance, including more effective  implementation of the Strategy. There is a need to promote further  engagement and interaction with other stakeholders within the  realm of national cyber security to ensure the dissemination of  cyber security knowledge, best practice and expertise.   ACTIONS   1.7 Work to consolidate further the National Cyber  Security Committee’s role, ensuring consolidation of  national cyber security at a strategic level.  35National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026     C. Strengthen cyber security in the supply  chain.  A high level of security of network and  information systems and, ultimately, trust of  digital processes and services calls for a supply  chain that complies with widely recognised  security standards and protocols. Such degree  of security compliance is expected from the  inception of digital products, processes or  services, calling in effect for the implementation  of the security by design concept.      The EU Cyber Security Act, which entered  into force in 2019, reinforces such notion of  quality assurance in the supply chain through a  proposed introduction of EU wide rules for cyber  security certification of products, processes and  services, which are currently being followed by  Malta.  Furthermore, the European Electronic  Communications code, being transposed on the  domestic front, shall ensure that the integrity and  security of public communications networks are  maintained with risks related to the security of  networks and services appropriately managed.  The code includes further regulatory powers to  enforce security provisions.  Malta has taken its own regulatory initiatives  that contribute to bolstering cyber security  within the supply chain, especially in innovative  technologies being adopted in day-to-day  business and personal life at a rapid pace. In  2018, it introduced a new regulatory framework  for the voluntary certification of Innovative  Technology Arrangements (ITA). Among other  activities, the Regulation led to the introduction  of an ITA Certification Programme for Digital  Ledger Technology/ Blockchain based systems.  An equivalent programme for Artificial   Intelligence-based systems, to ensure ethical  alignment, transparency and social responsibility  in their development, was also devised 22. Moreover, network and information systems  security legislation supports the use of  internationally recognised cyber security related  standards by entities falling within its scope of  applicability.  From a policy perspective, in 2017  a Government Information Security Policy23,  based upon the internationally recognised ISO  27001 Information Security standard, came  into force. This policy is applicable to all of the  Public Administration.  Further entity specific  information security initiatives have taken place  to promote a cyber security ethos within the  Public Administration. Other economic sectors  are also applying such a security standard.  Increasingly, regulatory technical standards  related to cyber security are being mandated  as part of regulation in sectors such as financial  services24.  However, EU Regulation 2019/452,  which became applicable in October 2020 and  aims to establish a common system among  EU Member States to screen foreign direct  investments (FDI), calls for an even more in- depth focus on cyber security from a supply  chain perspective at a national level. This comes  from a desire to exercise greater control over  economic activities within Member states, in  light of recent economic and global health  developments25. This Regulation allows for ad hoc  screening mechanisms on operations where this  is potential impact on security and public order,  with an additional instrument to protect strategic  activities.  According to Article 4 of the Regulation,  the potential effects on critical infrastructure  (whether physical or virtual), critical technologies,  including cyber security26, and access to sensitive  information are factors to be considered in  determining whether or not a foreign direct  investment may affect security or public order.  chapter 03 Cyber Security Governance Capacity36    C ACTIONS   1.8 Actively participate in the design of the European wide cyber  security evaluation and certification framework, eventually ensuring  its implementation in Malta.  1.9 Adopt and promote sector specific standards, best practices and/ or guidelines related to the security of networks and information  systems in collaboration with the national body for accreditation and  standardisation27.  1.10 Further promote Government ICT Policy on Information Security  within the Public Administration and review it periodically to ensure  that it reflects the evolving cyber security profile within Government.  1.11 Propose a standard set of information security provisions within  Government procurement framework for digital products and  services.  National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 37    D. Implement cyber risk management on a  national scale.  The increasing digital inter-connectedness  between infrastructures, networks and  various organisations – several of which are  essential to the country’s day to day running  - implies that a deficiency in one area can cause major disruption across others. Hence, risk management must focus on cyber, as well as natural and human hazards that may compromise a country’s stability and security. Recent proposals at EU level, with respect to the new five-year term EU Cyber Security Strategy as well as to a Directive on the resilience of critical entities, highlight such a need.  Network and information systems security  legislation addresses the need for cyber risk  assessment exercises nationally, and specifically  within the critical areas it identifies. However,  cyber risk assessments are not a one-off exercise  and should not be limited to those falling within  the scope of legislation. Risk factors in any  digitalisation process within organisations  are numerous; they include concerns about  the nature of the security of new systems  introduced, privacy of data and ethical use  of technology or its data. The risk is amplified   by emerging technologies since the unknowns  are greater than with mature technologies.  The requirement for appropriate oversight of  digital transformations intensifies the need for  a strong cyber risk management regime within  organisations.  Additionally, the proposed EU Cyber Security  Certification framework should contribute to  the development of tailored and risk-based EU  certification schemes that would specify the  intended level of assurance of products, services  and processes. These are crucial for the proper  functioning of the European Digital Single  Market, of which Malta forms part. 28 The same  goes for certification frameworks introduced  in Malta with respect to Innovative Technology  Arrangements, referred to in the previous sub- objective, related to cyber-security in the supply  chain.  Above all, a watchful eye on a national  scale for any noted emerging misuse or  malign use of digital technologies and  data and collective efforts to mitigate  such risks is needed.  chapter 03 Cyber Security Governance Capacity38    ACTIONS   1.12 Ensure regularly updated cyber risk assessments,  both nationally and on a sectoral scale, with the  implementation of measures required.   1.13 Ensure regular conduct of individual cyber  risk assessment exercises by all organisations  falling within the scope of Maltese network and  information systems security legislation.   1.14 Seek to encourage the management of cyber risk  in organisations nationally.  1.15 Seek ways nationally to mitigate risks related  to emerging misuse or malign use of digital  technologies and data.  D 39National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026     40    chapter 04   Cyber   Defence   Capacity  41    4.1  The Key Objective  Strengthen commitment to  augment operational and  cooperation capacity to  prevent and defend against  cyber threats and address  cybercrime, including  cyber-attacks that may  undermine Malta’s security.  chapter 04 Cyber Defence Capacity42    4.2  The Sub-  objectives      A. Maximise national security and defence  information capabilities to ensure technical and  operational capability as well as national and  international cooperation and coordination in  cyberspace.  Any organisation or even a nation thriving upon  digitalisation derives value not only from preventing  cyber-attack but also from responding promptly  and coherently when an attack occurs, so as to  minimise its effect.  Through network and information systems security  legislation, an incident management process,  especially for significant cyber incidents in critical  areas in Malta as well as incident reporting  requirements at EU level, has been established.  The primary incident responder, in case of a major  cyber incident involving Government, has also  been identified. Such developments have been an  essential step in bolstering security in areas where  cyber activity is critical.  43National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026     However, the need to ensure a more inclusive response to threats and hazards  is growing as the ramifications of cyber-attacks are felt domestically and  worldwide. Indeed, recent EU Council conclusions called for such a need in the  light of increased vulnerability to hybrid threats29 posed through ‘malicious cyber  activities, disinformation and threats to economic security‘30. Ultimately, cyber  security is like a chain - it is as strong as its weakest link. Hence, the need to  identify and engage more multi-functional stakeholders not necessarily covered  by present cyber legislation.   Ultimately, this exercise is aimed at fostering national cooperation to detect  threats, mitigate vulnerabilities, share cyber threat intelligence and  coordinate responses to cyberattacks, as expounded further within the following  sub-objective.   ACTIONS   2.1 Ensure that all stakeholders of Malta’s national security and defence  information systems and networks are identified on an ongoing  basis, keeping in view pertinent legislation.  B. Establish a National Cyber Security Response Centre.  Closely tied to the requirement for comprehensive identification of all national  stakeholders in cyberspace is the need for a centralised operations, cooperation  and coordination framework, utilising all expertise. Through such framework,  stakeholder organisations shall still operate independently on a day-to-day basis,  whilst stronger mutual collaboration is ensured, when and where necessary.  Apart from serving as a means to a more structured and effective response  to cyber security incidents, the framework will serve as a powerful collective  mechanism to better understand a constantly changing cyberspace, as well as  serve towards further education and increased cyber security preparedness. In the  process, it may also serve to promote cyber threat intelligence on a wider national  scale.   Cyber criminals and attackers scale up their efforts through stealth and  sophistication whilst defenders gradually update their security measures.  Cyberspace is diverse in its topological structures, networks and types of users. It  is an uncertain place characterised by difficulties in traceability of perpetrators,  inconsistencies and constant change. The sheer scale of data generated in online  activity and traffic make it very hard, if not impossible, to inspect each and every  event. From the defence perspective, this calls for an early warning system to  alert cyber perpetration. Such a system should not simply rely on the availability   chapter 04 Cyber Defence Capacity44    of the appropriate technology and skills. It calls for cooperation,  streamlined coordination and collaboration processes, especially  for data sharing and fusion.  This may be achieved through the  proposed centralised operations and cooperation framework  and could be facilitated further by the promotion of voluntary  information sharing about security breaches and incidents31.  The early warning system could serve as the central mechanism  for handling creeping, slow-burn and sudden crises32 from  cyber-attacks with the potential to cripple parts or all of the  country’s economic and social systems. Ultimately, it should  contribute to the development of integrated cyber threat  intelligence capabilities involving multiple sources.  The Government is actively contributing to cyber threat  intelligence online through CSIRTs, Indicators of Compromise  (IOCs) and threat and malware information so as to facilitate  effective detection and preventive action in real time. Additional  multi-stakeholder collaboration would see further contributions.   The ultimate aim of this sub-objective is to intensify cooperation  and cyber security information sharing.   ACTIONS   2.2 Define, agree and implement an operations,  coordination and cooperation framework for cyber  security response on a national scale, incorporating  all identified stakeholders.   2.3 Establish an early warning system as part of the  formation of an operational, cooperational and  coordination framework for cyber security response.  2.4 Seek ways to promote further cyber security  information sharing, voluntary or otherwise,  involving the Public Administration, the private  sector and society. This could be enabled through  policy direction, agreed procedures and information  sharing tools.  45National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026     C. Conduct security monitoring of cyberspace.  CSIRTs and Security Operations Centres (SOCs)  are important means of constant monitoring  and analysis to detect intrusions and anomalies  in real-time, in addition to allowing cyber threat  intelligence exchange amongst stakeholders.    The National CSIRT and Government CSIRT  already play important roles in coordinating  incident management and in contributing to  cyber threat intelligence at a national level.  This is facilitated by cooperation networks of  EU and international counterparts, as well as  by investments in tools for detection and data  dissemination.  However, this does not exclude  the need for other CSIRTs at organisation and  sectoral level.   Collaboration and sharing among various  CSIRTs would further strengthen their role and  the sustainability of the country’s cyber security  ecosystem.  A SOC has been established for enhanced cyber  monitoring and threat detection capabilities  within Government. It is a vital tool for  contributing to information security investigations  within the Public Administration, such as for law  enforcement and auditing purposes. Further  investments to consolidate security monitoring  of cyberspace are envisaged. The proposed  development of an EU wide network of SOCs,  as part of the EU Cyber Security Strategy, may  consolidate further the establishment of such  centres. This in turn would enhance collective  knowledge, sharing of best practice and,  ultimately, more comprehensive situational  awareness.  The establishment of the national cyber security  response centre, referred to earlier, should also  complement further to such sub-objective.  chapter 04 Cyber Defence Capacity  ACTIONS   2.5 Plan further and secure investments to monitor cyber security of  critical infrastructures and critical information infrastructures,  including Government.   2.6 Ensure ongoing risk management and resilience of such key areas.  2.7 Establish a network of SOCs and a community of CSIRTs in Malta.  46    D. Investigation and prevention of crimes committed in cyber space.  According to the 2019 Eurobarometer survey on Europeans’ attitudes towards  cybercrime, fewer Europeans feel they can protect themselves sufficiently: 59%,  down from 71% in 2017, even though cybercrime awareness is rising. Cybercrime  continues to be a global menace, increasing in terms of sophistication and expense.  The recent surge in the world’s population working remotely and online33 has  opened further avenues for cyber-criminals34. In the case of Malta, experiences  of cybercrime registering a higher incidence than the EU average were claimed,  particularly in relation to online fraud involving ransomware, virus and malware  exposure, fraudulent emails or phone calls and online banking35.   One of the three priority areas of the EU’s Security Union Strategy 2020-2025 is  fighting crime in a digital age, ensuring Member States have the necessary tools  to do so and to engage in information exchange. Further investments and capacity  building are taking place, nationally, including enhancing laboratory facilities for  cybercrime investigations.   ACTIONS   2.8 Invest in new tools and equipment to enhance cybercrime  capabilities in investigation and prevention, both from a proactive  and reactive perspective.  National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 47    E. Conduct ongoing threat and vulnerability analysis.  An essential element of cyber security is having the capability to assess  threats and vulnerabilities within and across organisations to ensure  proactivity and preparedness. Various measures using processes,  standards, best practices and technical tools need to be applied.  Network and information systems security legislation specifically  calls for simulated runs of operator security plans in the critical areas  identified.  A number of cyber simulation exercises, forming part of  wider EU-wide initiatives, have been conducted since the launch of the  initial Strategy. Cyber simulation exercises act as training processes,  making management, employees and organisations aware of potential  threats and how to respond efficiently.  The Government regularly conducts scans and penetration tests on  its web applications, looking for known vulnerabilities as well as to  determine the degree to which a malicious attacker might impact  confidentiality, integrity and availability.  There is a need to promote such threat and vulnerability analysis in  the private sector too, in collaboration with Government stakeholders  and service providers, taking into consideration human and financial  resource limitations, particularly among Small to Medium sized  Enterprises (SMEs).   The Government also issues advisories related to vulnerabilities on  devices and software, together with relevant mitigation measures and  security updates.  The proposed actions shall further develop and intensify efforts in the  establishment of ongoing monitoring of vulnerabilities and threats so as  to maintain a level of cyber security that is proportionate to the risk.  chapter 04 Cyber Defence Capacity48    ACTIONS   2.9 Sustain a programme of regular testing of  digital networks and automated scans of  Government critical infrastructure and services  and devise a framework to facilitate a similar  programme for testing of Government non- critical infrastructure and services.   2.10 Conduct pen testing and red-teaming exercises  in critical areas.  2.11 Actively promote the conduct of vulnerability  assessment exercises within the private sector.  2.12 Promote further an automated National Cyber  Notification System whereby notifications  on security vulnerabilities are sent to Internet  Exchange points (IXPs) for their onward  communication to respective customer bases.  2.13 Plan and conduct national and sectoral  cyber simulation exercises at operational,  management and political levels.  2.14 Issue annual information on national cyber  threats and vulnerabilities.  2.15 Actively consider the adoption of an  internationally or EU recognised framework for  multi-disciplinary stakeholders36 to collaborate  in performing controlled cyber-attack tests.   49National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026     50    chapter 05   Cyber   Competence  and Culture  51    5.1  The Key Objective  Increase national cyber  competence, capability,  knowledge and ongoing  awareness of cyber security.  chapter 05 Cyber Competence and Culture52    5.2  The Sub- Objectives  A. Establish a National Coordination Centre.  In September 2018, the EC presented a proposal for a  Regulation establishing a European Cyber Security Industrial,  Technology and Research Competence Centre and a  Network of National Coordination Centres (EU CCCN). The  proposal aimed to strengthen technology and industrial cyber  security capabilities of the EU and help create a safe online  environment. Political agreement on this initiative was reached  by EU institutions in December 202037.  Specifically, the EU CCCN Regulation provides for the setting  up of a National Coordination Centre in each Member State.  53National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026     Malta has made its nomination for a National  Coordination Centre. Along with its EU network  and EU Cyber Competence Centre, the National  Coordination Centre would contribute in areas  of cyber security capabilities, research, industry  competitiveness and EU grants to support  national ecosystems.  ACTIONS   3.1 Establish a National Coordination  Centre, in line with the EU  Regulation of the European  Parliament and of the European  Council,  European Cybersecurity  Industrial, Technology and  Research Competence Centres  and a Network of National  Coordination Centres.  B. Promote cyber security awareness at a national level.  Awareness of cyber security risks and issues, and  how to deal with them, are essential in building  a more resilient society and economy.  The  knowledge gained through ongoing awareness  amongst all members of society, especially  business – from management to employees – is  the cornerstone of cyber security culture. Indeed,  Skills and Awareness raising is identified in ‘A  strong European security ecosystem’ as one  of the four strategic priority areas of the EU  Cyber Security Strategy. This focus is crucial as,  unfortunately, a considerable percentage of  European firms do not understand the extent of  their exposure to cyber risks38.  In Malta, recent  survey findings indicate a degree of cyber  security awareness among businesses that  is comparable to the EU population average  39 and an increasing percentage of Maltese   respondents say they are fairly well or well  informed about cybercrime40.  A national cyber security awareness and  education campaign was launched in 2018,  aimed at various audiences such as academia,  the Public Administration, the private sector,  professionals, policy makers and the general  public, and is still ongoing. The delivery method  depends upon the particular audience targeted.  Prevalent cyber risks at the time are highlighted  so as to ensure effectiveness. The campaign  involves collaboration on the domestic front  and at EU level for consistency as well as to  facilitate the sharing of guidance and support.  Focussed campaigns, such as those specifically  on cybercrime and public relations exercises  including the issue of cyber security advisories  targeting stakeholders within particular sectors,  are also carried out.  Such campaigns are needed on an ongoing  basis to cover developments within the cyber  security threat landscape as well as increased  trends in digitalisation, remote working41 and  online business interactions. Initiatives by  various stakeholders is also actively encouraged  such as through fora within and/or across  economic sectors. Such initiatives could involve  sharing of cyber security best practice, helping  organisations to deal with:  Cyber risk management measures,  including the applicability of the basic  tenets of cyber hygiene.  Cyber security related legislative or  regulatory requirements in specific  sectors and how to enact them.  New digital work patterns requiring  respect for employee privacy.  chapter 05 Cyber Competence and Culture54    Most importantly, awareness needs to   reinforce the notion of cyber security as a  behavioural concern in all work disciplines,  recognising human weaknesses, rather than  as an afterthought or as a technical issue to be  delegated to IT practitioners.  It is only through such a comprehensive and  intensive awareness campaign that a ‘security  first’ culture amongst everyone in Maltese society  can be guaranteed42. This would, in turn, lead to  a stronger recognition and inculcation of security  in skills and product and service development  and delivery.  ACTIONS   3.2 Further pursue an intensive cyber  security education and awareness  campaign on a national scale.  3.3 Establish a national forum for  sharing of best practice and  experiences related to cyber  security.  C. Upgrade the skills of the current workforce and revisit the academic framework to bring it into line with cyber security industry requirements.  The cyber security industry is in a continuous  state of flux. The global demand for cyber  security skills continues to exceed supply as  threats become more sophisticated43.   From an ICT specialist perspective, Eurostat44   indicates a growth in the number of ICT   specialists in the EU that is more than 6 times as  high as the increase of total employment in the  EU between 2011 and 2019. Of these, about  two thirds completed a tertiary education. The  profession is male dominated with only 17.9% of  ICT specialists in the EU being women45.   The EC’s Country Report Malta 2020 records that  Malta had the highest share of ICT graduates  within the EU in 2019, with the percentage of  ICT specialists representing a high proportion of  the workforce46 relative to the EU47. It said that  although “the share of female ICT specialists is  slightly above the EU average, it is important to  further increase the participation of women in  this field, given the focus of the country on the  ICT sector”. Additionally, the EC ’s Country Report  Malta 2019 states that “although some measures  back technical and highly qualified training  and provision in environmental, engineering or  ICT studies (e.g. Malta’s College of Arts Science  and Technology training programmes), they  are modest in scope and budget. The majority  of schemes (e.g. PhD support) are generic  and they would benefit from targeting specific  disciplines or sectors. In addition, systematic  coordination between the different governmental  bodies on this issue would benefit from further  strengthening.”    The areas requiring improvement underline  cyber security as a specialist area within  ICT. There is a need for more focus within  the educational curriculum48, from primary  schoolyears up to post-tertiary level, and  collaboration between educational and training  institutions. Additionally, cyber security needs to  be covered in more depth in academic and work  disciplines.   National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 55    Cyber security education and training should not only cover cybercrime  from a law enforcement perspective but also from a judicial point of view.  From a teaching perspective, cyber security needs to be seen not just as  something for review of existing curricula but as a training issue for all  educators. Cyber security training and education needs to cover handling  of cyber crisis response situations, with simulation exercises and public  relations activity.   Such development of cyber security expertise is especially important within  the Public Administration given the sector’s extensive use of sensitive data.  In this regard, a drive towards more transparent and secure handling of  data within the Public Administration should contribute positively.  It is important that, in addition to training and development, cyber  security is actively considered across all of an organisation’s human  resource functions including performance management, recruitment  and job development. Indeed, for cyber security to be imbued within  an organisational culture, it needs to be fully embraced within all  management disciplines, starting with human resources, and actively  supported by senior management. Furthermore, soft skills are not to be  overlooked in the security and technology field, as they are the tenets that  shape a more security responsive culture.  Several actions shall aim to address the need to ensure skills capacity in  the short, medium and long term, covering various segments of society and  economic sectors.  chapter 05 Cyber Competence and Culture56    ACTIONS   3.4 Plan and execute cyber security training and  development in Government, targeting both ICT  specialists as well as non-ICT professionals who  need a level of knowledge of cyber security to carry  out their duties.   3.5 Support staff certification and accreditation of  professional development curricula in cyber security,  seek to address human resources gaps and the  establishment of specialist teams related to cyber  security.  3.6 Encourage the participation of women in cyber  initiatives49.  3.7 Provide training support initiatives to assist  management and employees within the private  sector.  3.8 Consider education plans at primary and secondary  levels which may include further curriculum  enhancement as well as continuous teacher training  on cyber security and digital skills.  3.9 Consider new opportunities in higher level education  such as development of new related modules,  research, promotion of advanced technical training  and partnership agreements with national and  overseas bodies and institutions.  57National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026     D. Promote a heightened security posture  within private industry.  Private industry is increasingly capitalising on  trade opportunities that digitalisation offers,  which should potentially lead to new job  opportunities, enhanced competitiveness and  sustainable growth. But trade activity, that  depends upon free cross-border data flows  requires security safeguards and the attraction  of investment requires robust infrastructure and  well developed cyber security.   A recent surge in online operational and trading  activities, to counter a global health emergency,  accentuated this need for ways to safeguard the  livelihood, competitiveness, development and  innovation potential of industry.   The cyber security landscape in Malta features  regulation, policy and supervisory functions,  particularly within regulated sectors. But  legislation and regulation may not cover  all aspects of cyber security necessarily,  particularly considering resource constraints in  small organisations. Hence, support initiatives  and incentives are necessary to encourage  organisations to make a voluntary commitment  to improving their cyber security.  At the National Cyber Security Summit, in  October 2019, the Government launched the  B SECURE Scheme, to help businesses assess  their vulnerability against cyber security threats  and train employees at various levels of the  organisation. Further initiatives and incentives  – including by the private sector itself - are to  be actively promoted to meet the guidance and  support needs of SMEs in particular.   ACTIONS   3.10 Actively consider and embark  upon various initiatives and  incentives to promote good  cyber security posture within the  private sector in Malta.  E. Support Research, Development and  Innovation initiatives in cyber security.  Investment, skills development and innovation  are required to sustain economic growth50. This  includes further Research and Development  (R&D) expenditure51 , to support innovation  potential.  ‘A Strong European security ecosystem’  - one of the four priority areas of the EU Cyber  Security Strategy 2020-2025 - includes a  specific objective of ‘strengthening research  and innovation’ to contribute to further capacity  building in cyber security.   Related efforts, initiatives and funding  programmes, facilitated through the National  Coordination Centre, as well as from various  national and EU entities at academic and  industrial levels, should help Malta improve its  Research, Development and Innovation (RDI)  capabilities in cyber security. Establishing  a research cluster relevant to the Maltese  landscape should be explored. Indeed,  Malta views cyber security as a niche area  in digital technology. It is identified as a  smart specialisation area, carrying high RDI  potential52. Of particular value would be for the  results of RDI to be used to actively promote  a wider understanding of the potentialities of  cyber security on a national scale. Through the   chapter 05 Cyber Competence and Culture58    potential use of pre-commercial procurement procedures, the  Public Administration could become a first customer of Maltese  cyber security RDI, kickstarting its growth.   One area of innovation where Malta stands to gain is in quantum  computing and quantum communications. EU Member States,  including Malta, have committed to working with the EC for the  deployment of a secure quantum communication infrastructure  for Europe (EuroQCI). Quantum communication infrastructure  aims to offer secure transmission of confidential information to  public authorities using an ultra-secure form of encryption to shield  against cyberattack. The specifically assigned EuroQCI board -  which is co-chaired by Malta - is finalising an action plan for a way  forward in the creation of the EuroQCI and related industry, seeking  EU funds in the process.   Ultimately, Malta would need to gauge its overall national cyber  security capacity regularly so as to ensure that cyberspace, and  its constituents, were increasingly resilient. The application of  standard, widely recognised models may help in this regard.  ACTIONS   3.11 Foster research, development and innovation, with  respect to cybersecurity tools and secure network  infrastructure, by institutions in Malta.  3.12 Facilitate investment in tools and equipment to  tackle various aspects of cyber security through  national and/or EU funding programmes.  3.13 Foster Government plans to bolster cybersecurity  research, development and innovation.   3.14 Undertake a review of Malta’s maturity in cyber  security capacity.  National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026 59    60    chapter 06   International  Cooperation  61    6.1  The Key  Objective  Promote and maintain a  strong presence in the cyber  security field internationally,  in cooperation with all  relevant stakeholders.  chapter 06 International Cooperation62    6.2  The Sub-  objectives   A. Strategic engagement with key partners and international organisations.  There are mounting concerns about the dual-use  nature of today’s emerging technology, for public  safety and national security, considering global  geopolitical tensions. Since countries view such  technologies as central to their security, they recognise  that their malignant use or misuse could lead to  adverse consequences on a large scale. Greater  economic integration and connectivity has meant  that the effects and consequences of technological  advances are far less localised than before.  Indeed, they can spread to countries and industries  worldwide. Hence, it is crucial for a nation state to  foster international cooperation in order to reduce its  vulnerability and enhance resilience.   Cyber space discussions have taken place in various  international organisations, including the United  Nations (UN), the Council of Europe (CoE), the  Organisation for Security and Co-operation in   63National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026     Europe (OSCE), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  (OECD), the Commonwealth, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), the  African Union (AU), the Organisation of American States (OAS), the Association  of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and the EU.  Malta, as a member of both the EU and UN, is engaging with these organisations to  further cooperation in cyber security, especially in the areas of training, education,  cyber defence and technology innovation. In February 2021, Malta appointed  its first-ever Ambassador for Digital Affairs, a move which has strengthened its  relationship with international partners and multinational organisations.   Malta participates in the EU cyber dialogue, consultations and outreach  programmes with third countries to build trust and exchange best practice.  Close  working relationships on aspects of cyber security have also been established with a  number of EU counterparts.   Malta appreciates the need for close international collaboration so as to foster the  exchange of cyber security defence intelligence and best practice, ensuring a strong  knowledge base and enhanced cyber security competencies.  ACTIONS   4.1 Continue to foster cooperation and support, including through  bilateral and multilateral agreements, in the field of cyber  security.  4.2 Consolidate the role of the Ambassador for Digital Affairs in  strengthening Malta’s relations with international like-minded  partners.  B. Participation and cooperation in European and international fora.  Participation in European and international fora contribute to the successful  actualisation of foreign policy in the sphere of cyber security whilst building the  nation’s image as a competent player.  Malta is pursuing increased co-operation within the EU and other groupings,  institutions and bodies in which it is a member, such as the CoE, the OSCE, the  Commonwealth, and the UN. Such matters pertain to awareness, confidence   chapter 06 International Cooperation64    building measures, crisis management, and  hybrid threats53. Effective participation calls  for a multi-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder  approach, requiring shared expertise,  co-operation and coordination.  ACTIONS   4.3 Intensify participation in EU,  regional and international  cyber related fora.  4.4 Co-operate with other  countries to instill greater  awareness of the threat of  cyber malicious activities that  may contribute to a wider  hybrid threat campaign.   C. Application of existing international law  and measures promoting responsible state  behaviour in cyberspace within the context of  international security.  As part of its international commitment,  Malta has participated in the UN Group of  Governmental Experts on Advancing responsible  State behaviour in cyberspace in the context  of international security (UN GGE) and the  UN-mandated Open-Ended Working Group on  Developments in the Field of ICTs in the context of  International Security (UN OEWG).   The UN GGE’s efforts led to the introduction  of the UN Framework of Responsible State  Behaviour in Cyberspace consisting of the  applicability of international law - in particular  the Charter of the UN - to cyberspace, as well as  voluntary norms, rules, principles, Confidence   Building Measures (CBMs)54 and capacity  building.  The UN OEWG, for its part, promoted  the establishment of an open, multi-stakeholder  approach as well as the further development  and application of the rules, norms, principles,  CBMs and capacity building for responsible  behaviour in cyberspace. The development  of CBMs for cyberspace proves to be more  difficult, given that by its very nature, cyberspace  does not erase spatial boundaries and the  transnational dimension allows for anonymity55.  Hence, CBMs for cyberspace, along with  political commitment to them, are significant for  the progressive development of international  law56 within such realm.   Whilst Malta has committed itself to such  instruments, it still needs to develop a national  position on the applicability of international law  and states’ behaviour on the world stage. Such  development, along with supporting tools and  resources, should enable Malta to play a stronger  role in international cyberspace policy.  ACTIONS   4.5 Pursue and improve upon  active participation in  international meetings on  responsible state behaviour in  cyberspace within the context  of international security  and implement outcomes  accordingly.  65National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026     D. EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox.  Cyber-attacks can paralyse a Government’s  decision-making systems, cripple a country’s  essential infrastructure and cause panic,  potentially leading to unrest and inadvertent wars.  Hence diplomacy plays a crucial role. In recent  years, efforts at an EU level has intensified in this  regard.   The Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox introduced by the  EC’s draft Conclusions on the Framework for a  Joint EU Diplomatic Response to Malicious Cyber  Activities seeks to provide the EU and its Member  States, in a transparent and resolute manner,  a set of instruments of diplomatic, political and  economic nature, for adequate and determined  responses to malicious cyber activities. Through  it, the EU has steadily committed itself to promote   the benefits of adhering to norms of responsible  state behaviour in cyberspace. It has equipped  itself with restrictive measures, as a response  to malicious cyber activities, and is determined  to change the behaviour of state and non-state  actors acting against the responsible norms of  cyberspace. The fact that EU restrictive measures  against cyber-attack is a horizontal sanctions  regime, as opposed to a geographical sanctions  regime, means that persons and entities that  satisfy the designation criteria may be listed from  whichever country they hail from, thus rendering  the tool effective and wide reaching.  Malta, as an EU member state, has the Cyber  Diplomacy Toolbox at its disposal, alongside  other instruments of cyber diplomacy, to use as a  deterrent against overseas actors contemplating  malicious activities in cyberspace.  chapter 06 International Cooperation66    Malta, along with other EU  Member states, is being invited  to place emphasis on the further  development and sophistication of  the decision‑making and invocation  processes of the Cyber Diplomacy  Toolbox by drawing lessons from its  initial applications.   ACTIONS   4.6 Contribute to the further  development and  sophistication of the EU Cyber  Diplomacy Toolbox.  67National Cyber Security Strategy 2023 - 2026     chapter 07   Way   Forward  68    The Strategy has outlined high‑level priority actions  for attaining the sub-objectives identified for each  domain for the next three years. The actions translate  into specific activities assigned to respective owners for  implementation within stipulated timelines as part of an  Action Plan.  Strong cyber security capability and capacity is a strategic priority for  Government and, in collaboration with stakeholders, it shall continue  striving to ensure that the country is well equipped and prepared to  manage digital risk.   Both the Public Administration and the private sector have finite  resources, technology is constantly evolving and measures to address  cyber security threats may not remain highly effective as technological  advances bring with them a plethora of new cyber threat vectors.  Additionally, further regulatory cyber security related developments  at EU level, impacting upon Member States, including Malta, are  envisaged. Hence, the course of action for implementation of this  Strategy cannot be cast in stone.  Therefore, the National Cyber Security Steering Committee shall  coordinate the Strategy’s implementation by various stakeholders  whilst taking measures to continually enhance Malta’s security  posture. It shall monitor the progress registered with respect to the  action plan whilst keeping an eye on developments within the cyber  security sphere at a domestic, EU and international level so as to  update the Plan accordingly. Widely recognised or nationally set  performance indicators may be applied to gauge Malta’s relative  maturity in this sphere.  Whilst the National Cyber Security Strategy shall act as the national  reference point for cyber security matters, it shall not exclude, but  rather encourage, the establishment of aligned strategic frameworks  and/or initiatives in cyber security focusing on the various sectors/ disciplines in Maltese society and economy.   Ultimately, cyber security is a global concern and it is in everyone’s  interests to ensure a multi-disciplined, yet common and unified,  approach to its ever-evolving challenges.  69    Glossary  The following definitions apply for the purposes of this Strategy.  Confidence Building   Measures   Measures to address, prevent or resolve uncertainties among states. They  are designed to prevent wanted, and especially unwanted, escalations of  hostilities and build mutual trust. They can be formal or informal, unilateral,  bilateral, or multilateral, military or political, and can be state-to-state or  non-governmental57.   Cyber Attack Cyber incident triggered by malicious intent where damage, disruption or  dysfunctionalities are caused58.  Cybercrime  Encompasses criminal acts committed in cyber space59, which are:  Cyber-dependent or new forms of crimes made possible with the advent  of the Internet and Internet-enabled digital devices60.  Cyber-enabled or hybrid crimes where traditional, real-world crimes,  such as online fraud, are perpetrated in cyberspace61.   Cyber Hygiene Covers several practices that should be implemented and carried out  regularly to protect persons and organisations online62.  Cyber Incident Any occurrence that has impact on any of the components of cyber space  or on the functioning of cyber space, independent of whether it’s natural or  human made; malicious or of non-malicious intent; deliberate, accidental  or due to incompetence; development or operational interactions.63.  Cyber Defence Ability to prevent, mitigate or respond to cyber attacks64.  Cyber Security All activities necessary to protect cyber space and its users from cyber  threats65.    Cyber Space A time-dependent interacting set of physical and logical (non-physical)  assets which store and/or transfer digital data66.  Cyber Threat Circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact an asset  through unauthorised access, destruction, disclosure, modification of data,  and/or denial of service67.  Glossary70    Hybrid Threat Action conducted by state or non-state actors, whose goal is to undermine  or harm a target by influencing its decision-making at the national,  regional, state or institutional level. Such actions are coordinated and  synchronised and deliberately target democratic states’ and institutions’  vulnerabilities. Activities can take place in the political, economic, military,  civil or information domains. They are conducted using a wide range  of means and designed to remain below the threshold of detection and  attribution68. Such means may include malicious cyber activities such as  cyber espionage, disinformation and hacking69.   Indicator of   Compromise  Activity or piece of forensic data observed on a network or device that  indicates a high probability of a system being compromised. Such an  indicator is used to detect malicious activity in its early stages as well as to  prevent known threats70.  Information Security Subset of cyber security that covers the principles of confidentiality,  integrity and availability of stored or transmitted data71.  Network and   Information Systems   Security legislation   National legislation that is transposed from the EU Directive on security  of network and information systems (NIS). In December 2020, the EC  presented a new EU legislative proposal that builds upon and repeals the  DIRECTIVE (EU) 2016/1148 or NIS Directive.  Public   Administration   The Government of Malta, including its ministries and departments,  specialised units and agencies, Government entities, commissions and  boards, referred to in the Public Administration Act.   https://legislation.mt/eli/act/2019/3/eng/pdf   Vulnerability The existence of a weakness, design, or implementation error that can  lead to an unexpected, undesirable event compromising the security of the  computer system, network, application, or protocol involved72.

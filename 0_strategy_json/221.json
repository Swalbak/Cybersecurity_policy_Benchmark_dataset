There is no doubt that Information and Communications Technology (ICT) has revolutionised the way that business is conducted; enhancing business effectiveness, widening competitive opportunities and generating opportunities for innovation within our national economy in the process. Indeed, Information and Communications Technology is, today, a key investment for the Malta’s economic well-being. However, threats to the safe and secure use of Information and Communications Technology are not to be under-estimated. Hence the need to safeguard one of Malta’s key economic pillars using a holistic and methodological approach on an ongoing basis. It is in this light that the Green Paper for a National Cyber Security Strategy has been prepared for feedback and consultation on a national scale. It proposes a way forward, based upon key goals and measures that focus on the need for related awareness, knowledge, expertise, good practice, regulatory and legislative updates as well as cooperation and collaboration on a national, European and on a global basis. Ultimately, it is the first step towards positioning cyber security as another investment towards the well-being of the Maltese economy from which we can all benefit. Hon. Dr. Chris Cardona Minister for the Economy, Investment and Small Business MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER 5 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY THIS GREEN PAPER, ALONG WITH ITS SUPPORTING DOCUMENT INTENDS TO INCULCATE AN AWARENESS OF CYBER SECURITY, ITS EXTENT AND ITS IMPLICATIONS WHICH MALTA NEEDS TO CONSIDER. Malta’s day to day interactivity, within and beyond its shores, is increasingly dependent upon the use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), to the extent that its disruption may affect service, business and potentially, life. Inherently, the technology, its logical and physical constituent elements, the data it carries, as well as its users, which together constitute cyber space - are far from perfect. Cyberspace is thus at risk of vulnerabilities, some of which involve genuine human error, whilst others are exposed to malicious intent. Hence the need for cyber security, that is, ensuring the safety, confidentiality, integrity and availability of cyberspace. This Green Paper, along with its supporting document intends to inculcate an awareness of cyber security, its extent and its implications of which Malta, as an integral part of cyberspace, needs to consider. Launching cyber security on a national scale, essentially calls for a planned, collective and systemic approach, thus leading to the need of a National Cyber Security Strategy. Digital Malta – the National Digital Strategy for the period 2O14-2O2O recognises and proposes the fulfilment of such need. Thus, the Green Paper presents a high level, strategic approach for cyber security on a national scale, for detailed consultation. The consultation is intended to consolidate further the proposals, thus leading to the launch of the first National Cyber Security Strategy. The Green Paper recognises that tackling cyber security, also entails the need to: • Safeguard fundamental human rights at all times • Adopt a multi-disciplinary approach • Ensure that all stakeholders of cyberspace – government, private sector, and civil society understand their shared responsibility and thus commit to collaborate and cooperate, to ensure a safe, stable and secure environment • Adopt a risk based approach, based upon the premise that it is impossible to guarantee immunity from any cyber attack All of the above constitute the fundamental principles upon which the overall vision is based. In essence, the vision covers the need and expectations of three key national stakeholders – the public sector, the private sector and civil society to ensure cyber security. Five dimensions enable articulation of the vision NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER “THE STRATEGIC DIRECTION OF THE GREEN PAPER PROPOSES 6 GOALS, EACH CARRYING A NUMBER OF MEASURES” 6 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY into the strategy. They are Policy, Legislation, Risk Management, Awareness and Education upon which the subsequent proposed strategy is based. Prior to proposing the strategy however, research and assessments have been made so as to enable a high level pragmatic approach towards cyber security within the local context. The Supporting Document is a compilation of such an activity, serving as a rationale for the Green Paper’s approach in the process. It focuses on the global cyber threat scenario, leading to concerns, experiences and current preparedness and a further focus on stakeholders on the domestic front. The ensuing strategic direction within the Green Paper is proposed to be attained by six goals, each of which carry a number of proposed measures, as follows: 1. Establish a governance framework - Is based upon the premise that a cyber security strategy needs to be established, and more importantly, be effectively implemented and maintained on a continuous basis. Hence the need to ensure the key coordination structures, processes, roles and practice with particular focus on risk management within the public and private sector. 2. Combat cyber crime - Aims to ensure and consolidate capabilities to tackle cyber crime 3. Strengthen national cyber defence - Aims to foster sharing of cyber security knowledge and intelligence, review current legislation and regulations in line with cyber space developments and ensure digital resilience on a national and organisation wide scale. 4. Secure cyberspace - Aims to foster self regulation and voluntary self commitment, bearing in mind that legislation is not a panacea to cyber security commitments. It also aims to stimulate use of standards and best practices that guarantee security whilst allowing for interoperability. Special focus is also given to promote security of online public services and to consolidate support to the private sector. 5. Cyber security Awareness and Education - Aims to target academia, the public and private sector and citizens as a means to sensitize awareness, knowledge as well as expertise in cyber security. A strategic approach towards a national awareness and advice campaign is especially recommended. 6. National and International Cooperation - Aims to ensure effective cooperation and collaboration on a national level, on a European and “DEFENDING AND PROTECTING NATIONAL INFORMATION INFASTRUCTURE FROM CYBER THREATS. ENSURING THE SECURITY, SAFETY AND PROTECTION OF USERS OF CYBER SPACE.” NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER 7 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY on a global basis, enabled by EU institutions and activities, based on the understanding that cyber security has no national boundaries. All six goals aim to cover two key strategic outcomes expected of the Strategy, namely: • Defending and protecting the national information infrastructure from cyber threats. • Ensuring the security, safety and protection of users of cyber space. The proposed strategic approach is by no means the end in itself. It aims to set the stage for feedback and detailed consultation. The consultation ensuing from the launch of this Green Paper is envisaged to: • Consolidate the high level requirements into more timely, specific and actionable measures • Potentially include further initiatives and requirements for cyber security within the local context The exercise is ultimately expected to lead to the launch of the National Cyber Security Strategy. The Strategy in itself would be expected to be periodically reviewed and updated so as to ensure its currency to evolving cyber security risks, realities and maturity of cyber security capabilities on the domestic front. NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER 8 INTRODUCTION - BACKGROUND NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER MALTA IS NO ISLAND WITHIN THE REALM OF CYBER SPACE! CYBER SPACE KNOWS NO BOUNDARIES. Up to a few decades ago, a country’s security interests focussed on protecting its borders, its waters and its airspace. Today, cyber space forms an integral part of a country’s day to day reality. Information and Communications Technology (ICT) leads the way in interaction within and outside of a country’s territory and its disruption may potentially affect life. Hence, cyber space cannot be left out of a country’s span of protection. Malta is no island within the realm of cyber space. Cyber space knows no boundaries. It transcends national borders, promoting online opportunities of dialogue and cooperation beyond our shores. However, the cyber world makes no distinction between its users of good intent or not. Therefore, as opportunities are limitless, so are cyber threats. Such malicious attempts in cyber space may be launched anywhere, in any vulnerable area of a digital network, instantaneously leaving no time for an appropriate response and with very minimal traceability or detection of its perpetrator. Ultimately, cyber space is man-made and like anything else of its sort, it is never perfect. The rapid advances of technology itself and the opportunities that arise from it do not allow it either. Malta’s security of cyber space ultimately calls for a planned, collective and systemic approach that respects fundamental rights and freedoms whilst ensuring confidentiality, integrity and availability of cyberspace on a day-to-day basis. Such is the intention of Digital Malta – the National Digital Strategy for the period 2O14 till 2O2O – which identifies a National Cyber Security Strategy as one of its required actions. “MALICIOUS ATTEMPTS IN CYBER SPACE MAY BE LAUNCHED ANYWHERE, IN ANY VULNERABLE AREA OF A DIGITAL NETWORK, INSTANTANEOUSLY LEAVING NO TIME FOR AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE AND WITH VERY MINIMAL TRACEABILITY OR DETECTION OF ITS PERPETRATOR” MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER 9 2 PURPOSE AND SCOPE NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER THIS GREEN PAPER IS INTENDED AT SETTING AN OVERALL, HIGH LEVEL DIRECTION IN CYBER SECURITY, ON A NATIONAL LEVEL, FOR CONSULTATION. It also intends to inculcate an awareness of the extent of the cyber security scenario and recognition of the need for a planned and concerted effort so as to protect Malta and its interests on a national scale. Consultation based upon this Paper should ultimately lead to the launch of the National Cyber Security Strategy. Hence, future updates based upon the consultations are envisaged to: • Consolidate the high level requirements into more timely, specific and actionable measures • Potentially include further initiatives and requirements for cyber security within the local context Apart from this Introductory Part, the Paper includes: • Part Two – Overall Direction sets a broad, high level direction for the National Cyber Security Strategy, through a definition of what is meant by cyber security and identification of the principles leading to the vision expected to be attained through the strategy • Part Three - Proposed Strategy outlines the proposed a way forward made up of a number of key goals and corresponding measures. It is based upon the overall direction and a current assessment in cyber security. The assessment of the current cyber security scenario, including a broad identification and assessment of related stakeholders can be seen into more detail in the Supporting Document of National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper which is also published along with the Paper. The supporting document serves to record the key rationale for the proposed strategy. THE CONSULTATION PROCESS Extensive research has been undertaken, as can be especially indicated by the Supporting Document of National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper. It is however understood that , both the need for a pragmatic approach to the strategy proposals as well as the national scope of the strategy call for a consultation process that involves various actors within the public sector, the private sector as well as civil society. Thus, all entities and members of the public are invited to consider the proposals of the Green Paper. Feedback is welcome, with opportunities for consultation to be announced in due course. “ESSENTIALLY, CYBER SECURITY IS BASED UPON THE FOUNDATIONS OF INFORMATION SECURITY, NAMELY CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY AND AVAILABILITY” MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER 10 3 OVERALL DIRECTION NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER WHAT IS MEANT BY CYBER SECURITY? Definitions for cyber security abound, however they all essentially point to the security of the cyber space; namely all: • Interconnected ICT hardware and software infrastructure • Data in transit and at rest on the networks • Connected users • Logical connections established among them In view of the above1, the following definition of cyber security is being adopted: It is the safeguards and actions that can be used to protect cyber domain from those threats that are associated with or that may harm its interdependent networks and information infrastructure. It strives to preserve the availability and integrity of the networks and infrastructure and the confidentiality of the information contained therein. Essentially, cyber security is based upon the foundations of information security, namely confidentiality, integrity and availability. However, whilst information security is business driven and results in prudent investment in safeguards and countermeasures, cyber security is threat driven where all cyber space is at risk. The inherent interconnectedness of cyber space exposes all of its constituents to a failure of their most vulnerable elements2. Additionally effective cyber security cannot be reached by technological measures alone as modern cyber attacks could bypass all defence layers by exploiting the human factors through techniques such as social engineering3. Hence, safeguards and actions hereby refer to ongoing and planned measures which may potentially be of technical, governance, legal, educational, behavioural or disseminative nature. Above all, cyber security cannot be seen from a technological aspect only, but needs to cover the needs and expectations of the state, the economy and society, all of which are increasingly active participants in an interactive digital world. “ABOVE ALL, CYBER SECURITY CANNOT BE SEEN FROM A TECHNOLOGICAL ASPECT ONLY, BUT NEEDS TO COVER THE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF THE STATE, THE ECONOMY AND SOCIETY, ALL OF WHICH ARE INCREASINGLY ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN AN INTERACTIVE DIGITAL WORLD.” MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER 11 3 OVERALL DIRECTION NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER GUIDING PRINCIPLES Within this context, the following principles are proposed: Rule of Law The approach on cyber security shall respect and promote fundamental rights and freedoms as chartered within European Union and national legislation. All measures shall comply with the principles of necessity, proportionality and legality, with appropriate safeguards to ensure accountability and redress. Multi-stakeholder, cooperative and collaborative approach The pervasive nature of cyber space, essentially calls for a multi-stakeholder approach towards its security – both at a national level as well as beyond Malta’s shores. Hence, on a national level, cooperation and collaboration of various stakeholders, including the public sector, the private sector, academia and civil society is necessary. A cooperative and collaborative approach at an EU and international level is also required. Shared responsibility Whilst leading in its commitment towards cyber security on a national scale, Government cannot assume sole responsibility for protecting all of cyberspace. All users of ICT are responsible to take reasonable steps to protect systems and data on an individual and on a collective basis. Risk Management The widely diffused use of cyberspace coupled with its rapid and continuous evolvement, renders it impossible to guarantee immunity from any form of cyber attack. Hence a risk-based approach to assess, prioritise and take measures to ensure cyber security, along with any technology investment is necessary. “ON A NATIONAL LEVEL, COOPERATION AND COLLABORATION OF VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING THE PUBLIC SECTOR, THE PRIVATE SECTOR, ACADEMIA AND CIVIL SOCIETY IS NECESSARY. A COOPERATIVE AND COLLABORATIVE APPROACH AT AN EU AND INTERNATIONAL LEVEL IS ALSO REQUIRED.” MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER 12 3 OVERALL DIRECTION NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER OVERALL VISION Within the context of the articulated principles, an overall vision for the Malta Cyber Security Strategy is: To ensure a secure, resilient and trusted digital interactive environment that supports Malta’s safety and security well-being whilst maximising on the benefits of a digital economy. In specific terms, the vision entails that: • Civil society is aware of cyber risks and undertakes necessary precautions to protect its confidentiality, personal integrity, identity and financial well-being • The Private Sector, whilst tapping the opportunities resulting from the technology developments, actively ensures that it operates in a secure and resilient digital economy, whilst ensuring effective delivery of their services and/or goods and protection of their customer’s privacy and integrity • The Public Sector leads the way in ensuring a secure and resilient digital environment for its interaction with and/or service delivery to civil society, private enterprise and with regional and international partners. The National Cyber Security Strategy will seek to address the needs and expectations of each of the above stakeholders, in the light of the proposed vision. MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER 13 OVERALL DIRECTION - PART TWO NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER A CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY MODEL As outlined in Figure 1, the strategy is enabled by five dimensions which are based upon those of the Cyber Security Capability Maturity Model of the Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre, University of Oxford. The Proposed goals and related measures underscore in more specific terms how the strategy is expected to be implemented. They are based upon a broad assessment of the current cyber security scenario, which is presented in the supporting document of this Paper. Policy Legislation Risk Management Culture Education Devising cyber security policy and strategy that sets the direction on a national level. Creating effective legal and regulatory frameworks to support all aspects of the strategy. Controlling risks through organisation, standards and technology. Fostering awareness to encourage a responsible cyber culture throughout society. Building cyber skills into the workforce and leadership through effective education. Figure 1 - A Cyber security Strategy Model for Malta MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER 14 4 PROPOSED STRATEGY NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER THE PROPOSED GOALS AND ACCOMPANYING MEASURES 4.1 THE PROPOSED GOALS Digital Malta, and in particular, Action 53, proposes four high level goals for a National Cyber Security Strategy, which are: • Combat Cyber Crime: Law enforcement agencies are to identify gaps and strengthen their capability to investigate and combat cyber crime. • Strengthen National Cyber Defence: Public and private entities are to be guided and assisted in strengthening their cyber defence capabilities. • Secure Cyberspace: Higher levels of trust are to be instilled through awareness programmes and the delivery of trustworthy, ICT-enabled services that assure confidentiality, integrity, availability and privacy. • Build Capacity (Cyber Security Awareness and Education): The skills and educational frameworks required are to be identified and developed. All four goals are essential building blocks for the National Cyber Security Strategy. Additionally, through the analysis conducted - and which can be found on the Supporting document - two other goals are identified as essential for inclusion. They are: • Establish a governance framework to attain a National Cyber Security Strategy – given that at this stage, only the technical and operational structures are in formation. The strategic level that focuses on the long term trends and analysis of cyber security is also necessary. • National and International Cooperation – given that the borderless nature of cyber-related activity, essentially calls for particular regard to the global and regional aspect, apart from the national focus of related security. In this manner, a holistic and comprehensive outlook towards a cyber security for Malta can be presented. Furthermore, all six goals aim to cover two key strategic outcomes expected from the Strategy, namely: • Defending and protecting the national information infrastructure from cyber threats • Ensuring the security, safety and protection of users of cyber space. 4.2 THE PROPOSED MEASURES A set of measures to each corresponding goal are proposed below. Apart from the analysis, they are also based upon: • Best practices noted in cyber security strategies within the European Union and worldwide, MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER 15 4 PROPOSED STRATEGY NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER • Official EU documentation • Relevant action items within Digital Malta and other local strategy documents such as e-Commerce Malta - the National e-commerce Strategy (2O14-2O2O) - published by the Malta Communications Authority. 1 GOAL: ESTABLISH A GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK The governance framework covers the necessary key functions and corresponding roles and responsiblities, as well as policies and processes necessary to constitute a robust foundation for an effective National Cyber Security Strategy. 1.1 ESTABLISH THE NECESSARY KEY COORDINATION STRUCTURES It is envisaged that the following functions (involving multiple stakeholders) shall be required to ensure sustainability of the Malta Cyber Security Strategy: a. At the strategic level: I. A function for the articulation and periodic review of the National Cyber Security Strategy. The creation of this function is required in the short term. This body would need to work in close cooperation with the strategy implementation function(s) referred to below II. A strategy implementation function to oversee implementation of the strategy and monitor cyber security operations. Such function needs to have the necessary funding, resources and mandate to: • Take a leading, active role in the implementation of the National Cyber Security Strategy • Ensure security preparedness of the public and private sector of their ICT, in line with established security requirements. The structure4 and responsibilities of these functions are subject to further consultations and may need to be aligned to any relevant European Union requirements. b. At the operational level, function(s) for the national coordination of cyber detection and response. Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) tend to be of such technical and operational nature. This entails ensuring consolidation of a top level coordinating CSIRT5. It also implies close communication and coordination of the CSIRT with the proposed strategy implementation function, given that it would need to be involved on: • Real-time information sharing and response to calls • Longer term planning⁶ Communication and coordination, as the need arises, with other CSIRTs existing in Malta may also be necessary. “THE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK COVERS THE NECESSARY KEY FUNCTIONS AND CORRESPONDING ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES, AS WELL AS POLICIES AND PROCESSES NECESSARY TO CONSTITUTE A ROBUST FOUNDATION FOR AN EFFECTIVE NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY.” MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER 16 4 PROPOSED STRATEGY NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER 1.2 FOSTER THE COORDINATION TO PROTECT NATIONAL CRITICAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE Measures of preparedness, response and recovery, including cooperation and ongoing coordination mechanisms are particularly necessary to protect national critical information infrastructure. It is thus necessary to ensure that such national coordination between all stakeholders concerned 7 is fostered. 1.3 ENSURE CLEAR DELINEATION AND COMMUNICATION OF ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES Cyber related roles and responsibilities - such as those identified above and potentially those arising from the proposed measures need to be clearly delineated and agreed upon accordingly. Communication of their establishment further ensures the effective coordination that may be necessary between the effected stakeholders themselves. 1.4 ENSURE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL CYBER RISK ASSESSMENT PLAN AND PROCESSES THAT ARE REGULARLY VALIDATED AND TESTED The Public Sector and key market operators8 need to identify cyber risks and assess impacts of potential incidents. This calls for the need to develop a national cyber risk assessment exercise as the basis to assess, prioritise and take measures to ensure cyber security. Such an assessment plan entails coordination between all stakeholders involved and it needs to be updated on a regular basis, so as to ensure its currency with: • The cyber threat vector landscape • Evolution in the adoption of existing and emerging ICT. The cooperation and communication processes needed to ensure prevention, detection, response, repair and recovery (including communication), that are modulated according to the alert level are to be ensured. Such processes also refer to national incident cyber handling procedures and business continuity plans to ensure resilience. Furthermore, it is understood that the above plans and processes need to be subject to a schedule of regular testing and validation exercises9 with the resulting outcome (including lessons learnt) used as a basis for any related updates. The emphasis made to the Public Sector and key market operators1O through such measures should not however construe that other organisations need not adopt similar activities. “THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND KEY MARKET OPERATORS NEED TO IDENTIFY CYBER RISKS AND ASSESS IMPACTS OF POTENTIAL INCIDENTS.” MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER 17 4 PROPOSED STRATEGY NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER An assessment of financial risks related to cyber-related incidents may also indicate the identification of a market in cyber insurance, which may in turn contribute to information sharing among its participants, apart from availability of financial coverage to mitigate consequential losses. 1.5 CONSOLIDATE THE INFORMATION SECURITY FRAMEWORK WITHIN THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND ENSURE AN AGREED PROTECTION LEVEL FOR KEY MARKET OPERATORS. The Government of Malta Information Security Policy is expected to come into force by the second quarter of 2O16. It is based upon ISO 27OO1 Information Security international standard and applies to all of the Public Sector. It also needs to be ascertained that all key market operators11 do apply an agreed level of information security. 2 GOAL: COMBAT CYBER CRIME 2.1 ESTABLISH FORUM FOR INTERNET SAFETY AND PROTECTION OF MINORS This measure is referred to in Digital Malta, and it proposes a number of relevant public sector stakeholders and industry respresentatives as the Forum’s members. The Forum aims to: • Share knowledge • Monitor developments • Put forward policy ideas • Represent Malta on European bodies working in this field This Forum could potentially help out in reviewing the Cyber Security Strategy itself with respect to combating cyber crime activity. 2.2 IDENTIFY GAPS AND STRENGTHEN CAPABILITY TO INVESTIGATE AND COMBAT CYBER CRIME A regular assessment of present state cyber crime capability in Malta among all relevant law enforcement authorities is indeed a prerequisite in the light of the continuously evolving threat vector landscape. Internal security is crucial. Yet, it also needs to be borne in mind that threats to EU citizens are increasingly cross border and varied in nature. EU Member states, including Malta, can thus no longer succeed on their own. The European Agenda on Security – the EU’s strategy to tackle security threats in the EU for period 2O15-2O2O12 is intended to contribute in this respect. Cybercrime is one of the Agenda’s priority for the years 2O15-2O2O. “INTERNAL SECURITY IS CRUCIAL. YET, IT ALSO NEEDS TO BE BORNE IN MIND THAT THREATS TO EU CITIZENS ARE INCREASINGLY CROSS BORDER AND VARIED IN NATURE. EU MEMBER STATES, INCLUDING MALTA, CAN THUS NO LONGER SUCCEED ON THEIR OWN.” MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER 18 4 PROPOSED STRATEGY NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER The Agenda aims to strengthen and make more effective the exchange of information and operational cooperation between Member states, EU Agencies and the critical information infrastructure sector; by aiming to: • Reinforce the capacity of law enforcement authorities in Member states, in particular through the Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre • Address obstacles to criminal investigations on cybercrime, notably with respect to access to evidence • Prioritise the implementation of existing legislation on attacks against information systems and on combating child abuse. 2.3 ASSESS AND CONSOLIDATE ON-LINE MECHANISM TO REPORT CYBERCRIME The mechanism is needed to report illicit online activity for the required action to be taken as well as to determine the extent of cybercrime. It entails: • The ability of the mechanism to track cybercrime at a national level • Ensuring nation-wide awareness and use of the mechanism, especially among citizens and small businesses. It is also recommended to ensure that a strategic approach on the applicability of hotlines related to cyber crime handling is taken, so as to facilitate the one-stop shop concept, whilst maximising the use of resources. 3 GOAL: STRENGTHEN NATIONAL CYBER DEFENCE 3.1 ESTABLISH A COLLECTIVE APPROACH FOR SHARING CYBER SECURITY KNOWLEDGE AND INTELLIGENCE A collective approach, involving both the public and private sector, potentially through the use of ICT is needed to: • Exchange information on cyber threats and to strengthen response to cyber incidents efficiently and effectively • Analyse new trends and identify opportunities and emerging threats • Work to strengthen cyber security • Provide framework for sharing best practice • Potentially improve professionalism in information assurance and cyber defence across the private and public sector through schemes for certifying related competence and specialist training. “CYBERCRIME IS ONE OF THE AGENDA’S PRIORITY FOR THE YEARS 2015-2020.” MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER 19 4 PROPOSED STRATEGY NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER The approach may also allow for intra-business sectoral communication, particularly in areas where particular information may be deemed as of a highly sensitive nature to be shared across all participants. 3.2 REVIEW EXISTING LEGISLATION AND PROVIDE MEASURES THROUGH LEGISLATION AND REGULATION TO ENSURE RELEVANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS TO THE CYBER WORLD This measure builds upon two objectives of Digital Malta, as follows: • Objective 43 – review existing legislation to ensure relevance and effectiveness in the cyber world. • Objective 44 – provide measures to maintain privacy, safety and security while surfing, transacting and operating on-line. Legislation will address several matters such as safeguarding intellectual property rights, patents, sensitive and personal information, cloud computing and data ownership, contentious content, net neutrality, vendor lock-in and exit management strategies; online contracts and license agreements. The measure is also highly relevant taking into consideration: • The requirements arising from the European Agenda on Security, referred to in Measure 2.2. • Action 38 - Digital Single Market – of Digital Malta, which states Government’s intention to maximise the benefits and opportunities deriving from legislation adopted within the EU such as those related to data protection, electronic identification and trust, etc. • Relevant EU Directive and regulation developments arising. 3.3 ENSURE THE COUNTRY’S DIGITAL RESILIENCE TO CYBER ATTACK AS WELL AS THE CAPABILITY TO PROTECT ITS INTERESTS Such a measure entails ensuring that the following are addressed: • Cyber space defences • Structures to counter terrorist attacks • Ability and capacity to detect threats in cyber space • Capability to disrupt attacks on the country from cyber space MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER 20 4 PROPOSED STRATEGY NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER 3.4 CONDUCT CYBER DEFENCE EXERCISES Cyber defence exercises are to be scheduled and conducted from time to time. Such a measure contributes to the need to review the ability to anticipate, prepare for, identify and attribute, combat hostile cyberspace acts. Apart from technical considerations, cyber defence exercises should also assess non-technical areas both at an operational, tactical as well as at a strategic level such as testing national and international coordination and any relevant Standard Operational Practices. Although crucial for stakeholders such as the public sector and key market operators13, such exercises should also be conducted by other organisations. 4 GOAL: SECURE CYBERSPACE 4.1 ESTABLISH REGULATION AND VOLUNTARY SELF-COMMITMENT FOR GUARANTEEING CYBER SECURITY The current scenario analysis of cyber security in Malta indicates areas of regulation and policy particularly within the local regulated industry sectors. Focus appears to be mainly on policy frameworks covering the licensing approaches which seek to mitigate risk. Whilst legislation may help, Maltese regulatory authorities may also need to address further emerging technology such as cloud computing applicability, through regulation within their respective sectors. On the other hand, it is understood that legislation and regulation cannot necessarily cover all aspects of cyber security; particularly considering potential financial and human resource constraints for robust cyber security. Voluntary self commitment is, thus, also key to cyber security. The notion of the applicability of a European trust mark, applied also in a number of EU states14 may encourage voluntary self commitment and may therefore be one item to considered locally. Local national strategy may already serve as potential opportunities for further consideration in fostering self commitment, such as: • e-Commerce Malta which highlights three pillars as its basis: I. Engendering trust in ecommerce II. Transforming micro-enterprises III. Taking Small to Medium sized Enterprises and industry to the next level; which specifically also refers to an audit-kit – through a Specialist advisory service (Measure 2) and the European trust-mark (Measure 9) “SUCH MEASURE {CONDUCT CYBER DEFENCE EXERCISES) CONTRIBUTES TO THE NEED TO REVIEW THE ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE, PREPARE FOR, IDENTIFY AND ATTRIBUTE, COMBAT HOSTILE CYBER ACTS.” MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER 21 4 PROPOSED STRATEGY NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER Digital Malta which refers to the Forum for the transformation of industries through ICT that aims to raise awareness about how ICT can help industries transform themselves and to discuss items such as self-regulation. 4.2 STIMULATE USE OF INTEROPERABLE AND SECURE STANDARDS ON THE BASIS OF GOOD PRACTICE Digital Malta, through Action 42 – Standards and Good Practice, states Government’s intention to collaborate with stakeholders to support and promote National and EU cross-border interoperability, ICT standards based on industry best practices and Green ICT. The implementation of ISO 27OO1 controls through the Information Security Policy across the Public Sector, as well as implementation of the standard within industries, may potentially contribute to further secure ICT on the local scenario. With respect to the notion of nationally and EU recognised interoperability, which also effectively promotes the use of safe secure standards, Digital Malta states as one of its objectives, Government’s commitment to revise and revamp the current National Interoperability Framework including related policies. On the other hand, such a measure cannot depend solely on Government for its implementation, but requires private sector collaboration. Whilst standards like ISO 27OO1 may serve as a good initial basis, however consideration of industry led standards and guidance that put in place a series of measures specifically aimed to address cyber threats15 are to be encouraged for use. This could form an integral part of what is proposed in Measure 4.1. In particular, special consideration needs to be given by operators and users of emerging technologies such as those referred to by the threat landscape of the Supporting Document. In such areas, related standards and security controls, may still be in the very early stages of maturity and may thus pose cyber security vulnerability challenges for interoperability which need to be carefully assessed. 4.3 PROMOTE ROBUST LEVELS OF CYBER SECURITY IN ONLINE PUBLIC SERVICES Such a measure may alleviate concerns expressed within Euro barometer findings with respect to Maltese accessing online services. The applicabilityof interoperable and secure standards, as referred to in Measure 4.2, may potentially contribute for the attainment of such a measure. MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER 22 4 PROPOSED STRATEGY NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER 4.4 CONSOLIDATE SUPPORT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR ON CYBER SECURITY Measure 4.1 outlines how cyber security can be facilitated in the private sector. Furthermore, private sector participation in awareness and advice programmes as well as cyber related exercises to specific sectors may additionally help. For example, ways may potentially be sought with business service providers (e.g. lawyers, insurers) of how they can potentially develop services to help businesses manage and reduce risks16. 5 GOAL: CYBER SECURITY AWARENESS AND EDUCATION 5.1 ENSURE CYBER SECURITY AWARENESS AND EDUCATION Such measures may primarily entail: • Review of existing curricula that includes cyber security along with ICT and media competencies • Academic programmes designed to consolidate cyber security expertise Action 2 - Empowering the young through a safer Internet - of Digital Malta may contribute in this respect. The action item states that “Digital Citizenship will become part of the National Education Curriculum, to equip children and youths with the abilities to interact and use the Internet safely and intelligently. Parents and carers will be involved together with educators and youth workers. This action will stimulate the production of creative online content, empower the younger generation and help create a safer environment. With the support of competent authorities this measure will help combat cyber child abuse and exploitation”. Additionally Action 6O - Building national capacity in specialist skill sets - of Digital Malta states Government’s commitment, through educational institutions and industry to support the creation of specialist educational pathways, addressing labour market requirements and to develop the curriculum and provide technical materials. The possibility of cyber security expertise within such initiative needs to be actively considered. Within the current cyber security scenario, there appear to be related awareness campaigns in schools. It is important that such campaigns are sustained on the long term, potentially through a concerted strategic approach. “WITHIN THE CURRENT CYBER SECURITY SCENARIO, THERE APPEAR TO BE RELATED AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS IN SCHOOLS. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT SUCH CAMPAIGNS ARE SUSTAINED ON THE LONG TERM, POTENTIALLY THROUGH A CONCERTED STRATEGIC APPROACH.” MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER 23 4 PROPOSED STRATEGY NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER 5.2 ENSURE RELEVANT EDUCATION AND TRAINING TO PUBLIC SECTOR STAFF AND THOSE WORKING WITHIN CRITICAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE Training and education on cyber security is one key priority within the public sector, especially given the sector’s wider extensive use of ICT and sensitive data, compared to other sectors. In any office environment it needs to be kept in view, that technology controls are not sufficient to protect data from related cyber security threats as outlined in the Supporting Document. The controls need to go hand in hand with human resource, awareness and employee guidance programs17. The development of cyber security expertise within the public sector is another key area that merits particular attention. In the process, it also needs to be ensured that a comprehensive list of public sector professionals certified under internationally recognised certification programs in cyber security is established and maintained. Furthermore, it needs to be ensured that ICT personnel are trained so as to enable them to recognise cyber incidents, to detect anomalies in their ICT systems and to report them accordingly. 5.3 FOSTER APPLICATION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ON CYBER SECURITY Such a measure aims to ensure cyber security as among key research priorities. It effectively calls for encouragement and support for research in any national and EU research projects and initiatives on cyber security. Essentially, it entails participation not only from Government but also from the private sector and the academia. It also calls for an emphasis to ensure security and privacy in the design of ICT products and services for Government as well as in other areas of application. 5.4 A STRATEGIC, TARGET-ORIENTED NATIONAL AWARENESS AND ADVICE CAMPAIGN It is highly recommended that a concerted strategic approach is undertaken, potentially through a nationwide Communications strategy for cyber security18; aimed at addressing the various strata of society, business and public sector during the short, medium to long term. Such an approach may ensure: • Avoiding piecemeal, potentially one-off approaches to awareness campaigns • No duplication of effort MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER “IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT A CONCERTED STRATEGIC APPROACH IS UNDERTAKEN, POTENTIALLY THROUGH A NATIONWIDE COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY FOR CYBER SECURITY”. 24 4 PROPOSED STRATEGY NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER • Maximisation of cyber security related financial and human resources • Imparting effective awareness and knowledge that is commensurate to the target audience and to the medium used19 • A measure of the extent of national awareness and understanding of cyber security over time. Most measures highlighted within Goals 4 and 5 of this strategy as well as any established national way of sharing related knowledge, experience and insight as referred to in Measure 3.12O may potentially serve as key sources for the establishment and maintenance of such a concerted strategic campaign. Ultimately, the key factor in any training and awareness programmes on cyber security is: • Finding the right way to raise awareness • Establishing training programmes that effectively increase security level of an organisation and maintaining such increased level of security in the long term • Ensuring motivation of users to learn and pay particular attention to various signals of fake communications on a day to day basis (particularly to counter social engineering threats). Prior and post assessment of such programmes is one way of ensuring their effectiveness. However, consideration should also be taken that such programmes may not necessarily focus only on traditional modes of education and awareness but also on experimentation of innovative ways of their conduct21. 5.5 ENCOURAGE ‘CYBER HYGIENE’ AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY Ultimately, citizens are expected to apply at least some form of basic ‘cyber hygiene’ in using ICT, such as through careful disposition and use of personal information on-line, installing software updates, using basic security controls such as passwords and anti-virus software. The national awareness campaign as highlighted earlier should help in reaching this objective. In particular, a responsible disclosure policy that enables well-intentioned citizens to safely inform Government, businesses or institutions about detected vulnerabilities in their ICT systems or services may also be considered22. MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER 25 4 PROPOSED STRATEGY NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER 6 GOAL: NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION 6.1 EFFECTIVE COOPERATION AND COLLABORATION ON CYBER SECURITY ON A NATIONAL , EUROPEAN AND GLOBAL BASIS Malta is no island in cyberspace. Hence the ongoing cooperation and collaboration on cyber security on a national, European and on a global basis needs to be sustained on the long term. Above all, a co-ordinated approach, among all key local stakeholders in cyber security interacting locally and overseas needs to be ensured so as to ensure synergy of national and international effort, knowledge and expertise within the domain. Cyber related activities such as those conducted by ENISA is one area of national and international cooperation that may potentially involve both local public as well as private sector organisations. On a national level, most of the measures highlighted earlier essentially call for national cooperation and coordination. On a wider international perspective, activities such as those undertaken by the Council of the European Union on cyber-diplomacy23 aim to foster increased global cyber capacity building, as well as international cooperation and judicial capacity on cyber crime. ‘MALTA IS NO ISLAND IN CYBERSPACE.

There is no doubt that Information and Communications Technology (ICT)  has revolutionised the way that business is conducted; enhancing business  effectiveness, widening competitive opportunities and generating opportunities  for innovation within our national economy in the process. Indeed, Information  and Communications Technology is, today, a key investment for the Malta’s  economic well-being.  However, threats to the safe and secure use of Information and  Communications Technology are not to be under-estimated. Hence the  need to safeguard one of Malta’s key economic pillars using a holistic and  methodological approach on an ongoing basis.   It is in this light that the Green Paper for a National  Cyber Security Strategy has  been prepared for feedback and consultation on a national scale. It proposes  a way forward, based upon key goals and measures that focus on the need  for related awareness, knowledge, expertise, good practice, regulatory and  legislative updates as well as cooperation and collaboration on a national,  European and on a global basis.   Ultimately, it is the first step towards positioning cyber security as another  investment towards the well-being of the Maltese economy from which we can all benefit.  Hon. Dr. Chris Cardona Minister for the Economy, Investment and Small Business  MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER    5  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  THIS GREEN PAPER, ALONG WITH ITS SUPPORTING DOCUMENT  INTENDS TO INCULCATE AN AWARENESS OF CYBER SECURITY, ITS  EXTENT AND ITS IMPLICATIONS WHICH MALTA NEEDS TO CONSIDER.  Malta’s day to day interactivity, within and beyond its shores, is increasingly  dependent upon the use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT),  to the extent that its disruption may affect service, business and potentially, life.  Inherently, the technology, its logical and physical constituent elements, the data  it carries, as well as its users, which together constitute cyber space - are far  from perfect. Cyberspace is thus at risk of vulnerabilities, some of which involve  genuine human error, whilst others are exposed to malicious intent. Hence the  need for cyber security, that is, ensuring the safety, confidentiality, integrity and  availability of cyberspace.  This Green Paper, along with its supporting document intends to inculcate an  awareness of cyber security, its extent and its implications of which Malta, as an  integral part of cyberspace, needs to consider. Launching cyber security on a  national scale, essentially calls for a planned, collective and systemic approach,  thus leading to the need of a National Cyber Security Strategy. Digital Malta – the  National Digital Strategy for the period 2O14-2O2O recognises and proposes the  fulfilment of such need. Thus, the Green Paper presents  a high level, strategic  approach for cyber security on a national scale, for detailed consultation. The  consultation is intended to consolidate further the proposals, thus leading to the  launch of the first National Cyber Security Strategy.   The Green Paper recognises that tackling cyber security, also entails the need to:   •  Safeguard fundamental human rights at all times •  Adopt a multi-disciplinary approach •   Ensure that all stakeholders of cyberspace – government, private sector, and   civil society understand their shared responsibility and thus commit to  collaborate and cooperate, to ensure a safe, stable and secure environment  •   Adopt a risk based approach, based upon the premise that it is impossible  to guarantee immunity from any cyber attack  All of the above constitute the fundamental principles upon which the overall  vision is based. In essence, the vision covers the need and expectations of three  key national stakeholders – the public sector, the private sector and civil  society to ensure cyber security. Five dimensions enable articulation of the vision   NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER  MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER  “THE STRATEGIC DIRECTION OF THE  GREEN PAPER PROPOSES 6 GOALS, EACH  CARRYING A NUMBER OF MEASURES”    6  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  into the strategy. They are Policy, Legislation, Risk Management, Awareness  and Education upon which the subsequent proposed strategy is based.   Prior to proposing the strategy however, research and assessments have been  made so as to enable a high level pragmatic approach towards cyber security  within the local context. The Supporting  Document is a compilation of such an  activity, serving as a rationale for the Green Paper’s approach in the process. It  focuses on the global cyber threat scenario, leading to concerns, experiences and  current preparedness and a further focus on stakeholders on the domestic front.   The ensuing strategic direction within the Green Paper is proposed to be attained  by six goals, each of which carry a number of proposed measures, as follows:  1.  Establish a governance framework - Is  based upon the premise that a  cyber security strategy needs to be established, and more importantly, be  effectively implemented and maintained on a continuous basis. Hence the  need to ensure the key coordination structures, processes, roles and practice  with particular focus on risk management within the public and private  sector.   2.  Combat cyber crime - Aims to  ensure and consolidate capabilities to tackle  cyber crime  3.  Strengthen national cyber defence - Aims to foster sharing of cyber  security knowledge and intelligence, review current legislation and  regulations in line with cyber space developments and ensure digital  resilience on a national and organisation wide scale.  4.  Secure cyberspace - Aims to foster self regulation and voluntary self  commitment, bearing in mind that legislation is not a panacea to cyber  security commitments. It also aims to stimulate use of standards and best  practices that guarantee security whilst allowing for interoperability. Special  focus is also given to promote security of online public services and to  consolidate support to the private sector.   5.  Cyber security Awareness and Education - Aims to target  academia,  the public and private sector and citizens as a means to sensitize awareness,  knowledge as well as expertise in cyber security. A strategic approach towards  a national awareness and advice campaign is especially recommended.  6.  National and International Cooperation - Aims to ensure effective  cooperation and collaboration on a national level, on a European and   “DEFENDING AND PROTECTING NATIONAL  INFORMATION INFASTRUCTURE FROM  CYBER THREATS. ENSURING THE  SECURITY, SAFETY AND PROTECTION OF  USERS OF CYBER SPACE.”  NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER  MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER    7  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  on a global basis, enabled by EU institutions and activities, based on the  understanding that cyber security has no national boundaries.  All six goals aim to cover two key strategic outcomes expected of the Strategy,  namely:  •   Defending and protecting the national information infrastructure from  cyber threats.  •  Ensuring the security, safety and protection of users of cyber space.  The proposed strategic approach is by no means the end in itself. It aims to set the  stage for feedback and detailed consultation. The consultation ensuing from the  launch of this Green Paper is envisaged to:  •   Consolidate the high level requirements into more timely, specific and  actionable measures  •   Potentially include further initiatives and requirements for cyber security  within the local context  The exercise is ultimately expected to lead to the launch of the National Cyber  Security Strategy. The Strategy in itself would be expected to be periodically  reviewed and updated so as to ensure its currency to evolving cyber security  risks, realities and maturity of cyber security capabilities on the domestic front.  NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER  MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER    8  INTRODUCTION -  BACKGROUND  NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER  MALTA IS NO ISLAND WITHIN THE REALM OF CYBER SPACE!  CYBER SPACE KNOWS NO BOUNDARIES.  Up to a few decades ago, a country’s security interests focussed on protecting  its borders, its waters and its airspace. Today, cyber space forms an integral part  of a country’s day to day reality.  Information and Communications Technology  (ICT) leads the way in interaction within and outside of a country’s territory and its  disruption may potentially affect life. Hence, cyber space cannot be left out of a  country’s span of protection.  Malta is no island within the realm of cyber space. Cyber space knows no  boundaries. It transcends national borders, promoting online opportunities of  dialogue and cooperation beyond our shores. However, the cyber world makes  no distinction between its users of good intent or not. Therefore, as opportunities  are limitless, so are cyber threats. Such malicious attempts in cyber space may be  launched anywhere, in any vulnerable area of a digital network, instantaneously  leaving no time for an appropriate response and with very minimal traceability  or detection of its perpetrator. Ultimately, cyber space is man-made and like  anything else of its sort, it is never perfect. The rapid advances of technology itself and the opportunities that arise from it do not allow it either.  Malta’s security of cyber space ultimately calls for a planned, collective and  systemic approach that respects fundamental rights and freedoms whilst  ensuring confidentiality, integrity and availability of cyberspace on a day-to-day  basis. Such is the intention of Digital Malta – the National Digital Strategy for the  period 2O14 till 2O2O – which identifies a National Cyber Security Strategy as one  of its required actions.  “MALICIOUS ATTEMPTS IN CYBER SPACE  MAY BE LAUNCHED ANYWHERE, IN ANY  VULNERABLE AREA OF A DIGITAL NETWORK, INSTANTANEOUSLY LEAVING  NO TIME FOR AN APPROPRIATE  RESPONSE AND WITH VERY MINIMAL TRACEABILITY OR DETECTION OF ITS  PERPETRATOR”  MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER    9  2 PURPOSE AND SCOPE  NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER  THIS GREEN PAPER IS INTENDED AT SETTING AN OVERALL, HIGH  LEVEL DIRECTION IN CYBER SECURITY, ON A NATIONAL LEVEL, FOR  CONSULTATION.   It also intends to inculcate an awareness of the extent of the cyber security  scenario and recognition of the need for a planned and concerted effort so as to  protect Malta and its interests on a national scale.   Consultation based upon this Paper should ultimately lead to the launch of  the National Cyber Security Strategy.  Hence, future updates based upon the  consultations are envisaged to:  •   Consolidate the high level requirements into more timely, specific and  actionable measures  •   Potentially include further initiatives and requirements for cyber security  within the local context  Apart from this Introductory Part, the Paper includes: •   Part Two – Overall Direction sets a broad, high level direction for the   National Cyber Security Strategy, through a definition of what is meant  by cyber security and identification of the principles leading to the vision  expected to be attained through the strategy  •   Part Three - Proposed Strategy  outlines the proposed a way forward  made up of a number of key goals and corresponding measures. It is based  upon the overall direction and a current assessment in cyber security.  The assessment of the current cyber security scenario, including a broad  identification and assessment of related stakeholders can be seen into more  detail in the Supporting Document of National Cyber Security Strategy Green  Paper which is also published along with the Paper. The supporting document  serves to record the key rationale for the proposed strategy.  THE CONSULTATION PROCESS Extensive research has been undertaken, as can be especially indicated by the  Supporting Document of National Cyber Security Strategy Green Paper.  It is however understood that , both the need for a pragmatic approach to  the strategy proposals as well as the national scope of the strategy call for a  consultation process that involves various actors within the public sector, the  private sector as well as civil society.  Thus, all entities and members of the public are invited to consider the proposals  of the Green Paper. Feedback is welcome, with opportunities for consultation to  be announced in due course.  “ESSENTIALLY, CYBER SECURITY IS  BASED UPON THE FOUNDATIONS OF  INFORMATION SECURITY, NAMELY CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY AND  AVAILABILITY”  MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER    10  3 OVERALL DIRECTION  NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER  WHAT IS MEANT BY CYBER SECURITY?  Definitions for cyber security abound, however they all essentially point to the  security of the cyber space; namely all:  •  Interconnected ICT hardware and software infrastructure  •  Data in transit and at rest  on the networks •  Connected users •  Logical connections established among them  In view of the above1, the following definition of cyber security is being adopted:  It is the safeguards and actions that can be used to protect cyber domain from  those threats that are associated with or that may harm its interdependent  networks and information infrastructure.  It strives to preserve the availability  and integrity of the networks and infrastructure and the confidentiality of the  information contained therein.  Essentially, cyber security is based upon the foundations of information security,  namely confidentiality, integrity and availability. However, whilst information  security is business driven and results in prudent investment in safeguards and  countermeasures, cyber security is threat driven where all cyber space is at risk.  The inherent interconnectedness of cyber space exposes all of its constituents to  a failure of their most vulnerable elements2.  Additionally effective cyber security cannot be reached by technological  measures alone as modern cyber attacks could bypass all defence layers by  exploiting the human factors through techniques such as social engineering3.  Hence, safeguards and actions hereby refer to ongoing and planned measures  which may potentially be of technical, governance, legal, educational,  behavioural or disseminative nature.   Above all, cyber security cannot be seen from a technological aspect only, but  needs to cover the needs and expectations of the state, the economy and society,  all of which are increasingly active participants in an interactive digital world.  “ABOVE ALL, CYBER SECURITY CANNOT  BE SEEN FROM A TECHNOLOGICAL  ASPECT ONLY, BUT NEEDS TO COVER  THE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS OF THE  STATE, THE ECONOMY AND SOCIETY, ALL  OF WHICH ARE INCREASINGLY ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN AN INTERACTIVE  DIGITAL WORLD.”  MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER    11  3 OVERALL DIRECTION  NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER  GUIDING PRINCIPLES Within this context, the following principles are proposed:  Rule of Law  The approach on cyber security shall respect and promote fundamental rights  and freedoms as chartered within European Union and national legislation.  All measures shall comply with the principles of necessity, proportionality and  legality, with appropriate safeguards to ensure accountability and redress.  Multi-stakeholder, cooperative and collaborative approach  The pervasive nature of cyber space, essentially calls for a multi-stakeholder  approach towards its security – both at a national level as well as beyond Malta’s  shores. Hence, on a national level, cooperation and collaboration of various  stakeholders, including the public sector, the private sector, academia and civil  society is necessary. A cooperative and collaborative approach at an EU and  international level is also required.  Shared responsibility  Whilst leading in its commitment towards cyber security on a national scale,  Government cannot assume sole responsibility for protecting all of cyberspace.  All users of ICT are responsible to take reasonable steps to protect systems and  data on an individual and on a collective basis.   Risk Management  The widely diffused use of cyberspace coupled with its rapid and continuous  evolvement, renders it impossible to guarantee immunity from any form of cyber  attack. Hence a risk-based approach to assess, prioritise and take measures to  ensure cyber security, along with any technology investment is necessary.  “ON A NATIONAL LEVEL, COOPERATION  AND COLLABORATION OF VARIOUS  STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING THE PUBLIC SECTOR, THE PRIVATE SECTOR,  ACADEMIA AND CIVIL SOCIETY IS  NECESSARY. A COOPERATIVE AND  COLLABORATIVE APPROACH AT AN EU  AND INTERNATIONAL LEVEL IS ALSO  REQUIRED.”  MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER    12  3 OVERALL DIRECTION  NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER  OVERALL VISION  Within the context of the articulated principles, an overall vision for the Malta  Cyber Security Strategy is:   To ensure a secure, resilient and trusted digital interactive environment  that supports Malta’s safety and security well-being whilst maximising on  the benefits of a digital economy.  In specific terms, the vision entails that:  •   Civil society is aware of cyber risks and undertakes necessary precautions to  protect its confidentiality, personal integrity, identity and financial well-being  •   The Private Sector, whilst tapping the opportunities resulting from the  technology developments, actively ensures that it operates in a secure and  resilient digital economy, whilst ensuring effective delivery of their services  and/or goods and protection of their customer’s privacy and integrity  •   The Public Sector leads the way in ensuring a secure and resilient digital  environment for its interaction with and/or service delivery to civil society,  private enterprise and with regional and international partners.  The National Cyber Security Strategy will seek to address the needs and  expectations of each of the above stakeholders, in the light of the proposed vision.

Figure 1 - A Cyber security Strategy Model for Malta  MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER    14  4 PROPOSED STRATEGY  NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER  THE PROPOSED GOALS AND ACCOMPANYING MEASURES  4.1 THE PROPOSED GOALS Digital Malta, and in particular, Action 53, proposes four high level goals for a  National Cyber Security Strategy, which are:  •   Combat Cyber Crime: Law enforcement agencies are to  identify gaps and  strengthen their capability to investigate and combat cyber crime.  •   Strengthen National Cyber Defence: Public and private entities are to be  guided and assisted in strengthening their cyber defence capabilities.  •   Secure Cyberspace: Higher levels of trust are to be instilled through  awareness programmes and the delivery of trustworthy, ICT-enabled services  that assure confidentiality, integrity, availability and privacy.  •   Build Capacity (Cyber Security Awareness and Education): The skills and  educational frameworks required are to be identified and developed.  All four goals are essential building blocks for the National Cyber Security Strategy.  Additionally, through the analysis conducted  - and which can be found on the  Supporting document - two other goals are identified as essential for inclusion.  They are:  •   Establish a governance framework to attain a National Cyber Security  Strategy – given that at this stage, only the technical and operational  structures are in formation. The strategic level that focuses on the long term  trends and analysis of cyber security is also necessary.  •   National and International Cooperation – given that the borderless nature  of cyber-related activity, essentially calls for particular regard to the global and  regional aspect, apart from the national focus of related security.  In this manner, a holistic and comprehensive outlook towards a cyber security for  Malta can be presented. Furthermore, all six goals aim to cover two key strategic  outcomes expected from the Strategy, namely:  •   Defending and protecting the national information infrastructure from  cyber threats  •  Ensuring the security, safety and protection of users of cyber space.  4.2 THE PROPOSED MEASURES A set of measures to each corresponding goal are proposed below. Apart from the  analysis, they are also based upon:  •   Best practices noted in cyber security strategies within the European Union   and worldwide,  MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER    15  4 PROPOSED STRATEGY  NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER  •  Official EU documentation  •   Relevant action items within Digital Malta and other local strategy  documents such as e-Commerce Malta - the National e-commerce  Strategy (2O14-2O2O) - published by the Malta Communications Authority.  1 GOAL: ESTABLISH A GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  The governance framework covers the necessary key functions and  corresponding roles and responsiblities, as well as policies and processes  necessary to constitute a robust foundation for an effective National Cyber  Security Strategy.  1.1 ESTABLISH THE NECESSARY KEY COORDINATION STRUCTURES  It is envisaged that the following functions (involving multiple stakeholders) shall  be required to ensure sustainability of the Malta Cyber Security Strategy:  a. At the strategic level:  I.  A function for the articulation and periodic review of the National  Cyber Security Strategy. The creation of this function is required in the  short term. This body would need to work in close cooperation with the  strategy implementation function(s) referred to below  II.  A strategy implementation function to oversee implementation of the  strategy and monitor cyber security operations.  Such function needs  to have the necessary funding, resources and mandate to:  •   Take a leading, active role in the implementation of the National Cyber  Security Strategy  •   Ensure security preparedness of the public and private sector of their  ICT, in line with established security requirements.  The structure4 and responsibilities of these functions are subject to further  consultations and may need to be aligned to any relevant European Union  requirements.  b. At the operational level, function(s) for the national coordination of  cyber detection and response. Computer Security Incident Response Teams  (CSIRTs)  tend to be of such technical and operational nature. This entails  ensuring consolidation of a top level coordinating CSIRT5. It also implies close  communication and coordination of the CSIRT with the proposed strategy  implementation function, given that it would  need to be involved on:   •  Real-time information sharing and response to calls  •  Longer term planning⁶  Communication and coordination, as the need arises, with other CSIRTs existing in  Malta may also be necessary.  “THE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  COVERS THE NECESSARY KEY  FUNCTIONS AND CORRESPONDING  ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES, AS  WELL AS POLICIES AND PROCESSES  NECESSARY TO CONSTITUTE A ROBUST  FOUNDATION FOR AN EFFECTIVE  NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY.”  MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER    16  4 PROPOSED STRATEGY  NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER  1.2 FOSTER THE COORDINATION TO PROTECT NATIONAL CRITICAL  INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE  Measures of preparedness, response and recovery, including cooperation and  ongoing coordination mechanisms are particularly necessary to protect national  critical information infrastructure. It is thus necessary to ensure that such national  coordination between all stakeholders concerned 7 is fostered.   1.3 ENSURE CLEAR DELINEATION AND COMMUNICATION OF ROLES AND  RESPONSIBILITIES  Cyber related roles and responsibilities - such as those identified above and  potentially those arising from the proposed measures need to be clearly  delineated and agreed upon accordingly. Communication of their establishment  further ensures the effective coordination that may be necessary between the  effected stakeholders themselves.   1.4 ENSURE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL CYBER RISK  ASSESSMENT PLAN AND PROCESSES THAT ARE REGULARLY  VALIDATED AND TESTED  The Public Sector and key market operators8 need to identify cyber risks and  assess impacts of potential incidents. This calls for the need to develop a  national cyber risk assessment exercise as the basis to assess, prioritise and take  measures to ensure cyber security.  Such an assessment plan entails coordination between all stakeholders involved  and it needs to be updated on a regular basis, so as to ensure its currency with:  •  The cyber threat vector landscape  •  Evolution in the adoption of existing and emerging ICT.  The cooperation and communication processes needed to ensure prevention,  detection, response, repair and recovery (including communication), that are  modulated according to the alert level are to be ensured. Such processes also  refer to national incident cyber handling procedures and business continuity  plans to ensure resilience. Furthermore, it is understood that the above plans and  processes need to be subject to a schedule of regular testing and validation  exercises9 with the resulting outcome (including lessons learnt) used as a basis  for any related updates.  The emphasis made to the Public Sector and key market operators1O through such  measures should not however construe that other organisations need not adopt  similar activities.  “THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND KEY MARKET  OPERATORS NEED TO IDENTIFY CYBER  RISKS AND ASSESS IMPACTS OF POTENTIAL INCIDENTS.”  MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER    17  4 PROPOSED STRATEGY  NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER  An assessment of financial risks related to cyber-related incidents may also  indicate the identification of a market in cyber insurance, which may in turn  contribute to information sharing among its participants, apart from availability of financial coverage to mitigate consequential losses.  1.5 CONSOLIDATE THE INFORMATION SECURITY FRAMEWORK WITHIN  THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND ENSURE AN AGREED PROTECTION LEVEL  FOR KEY MARKET OPERATORS.  The Government of Malta Information Security Policy is expected to come into  force by the second quarter of 2O16. It is based upon ISO 27OO1 Information  Security international standard and applies to all of the Public Sector. It also needs to be ascertained that all key market operators11  do apply an agreed level of information security.  2 GOAL: COMBAT CYBER CRIME  2.1 ESTABLISH FORUM FOR INTERNET SAFETY AND PROTECTION OF  MINORS  This measure is referred to in Digital Malta, and it proposes a number of  relevant public sector stakeholders and industry respresentatives as the Forum’s  members. The Forum aims to:  •  Share knowledge  •  Monitor developments  •  Put forward policy ideas  •  Represent Malta on European bodies working in this field  This Forum could potentially help out in reviewing the Cyber Security Strategy  itself with respect to combating cyber crime activity.  2.2  IDENTIFY GAPS AND STRENGTHEN CAPABILITY TO INVESTIGATE  AND COMBAT CYBER CRIME  A regular assessment of present state cyber crime capability in Malta among all  relevant law enforcement authorities is indeed a prerequisite in the light of the  continuously evolving threat vector landscape.  Internal security is crucial. Yet, it also needs to be borne in mind that threats to  EU citizens are increasingly cross border and varied in nature. EU Member states,  including Malta, can thus no longer succeed on their own. The European Agenda  on Security – the EU’s strategy to tackle security threats in the EU for period  2O15-2O2O12 is intended to contribute in this respect. Cybercrime is one of the  Agenda’s priority for the years 2O15-2O2O.   “INTERNAL SECURITY IS CRUCIAL. YET, IT  ALSO NEEDS TO BE BORNE IN MIND THAT  THREATS TO EU CITIZENS ARE INCREASINGLY CROSS BORDER AND  VARIED IN NATURE. EU MEMBER STATES,  INCLUDING MALTA, CAN THUS NO LONGER SUCCEED ON THEIR OWN.”  MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER    18  4 PROPOSED STRATEGY  NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER  The Agenda aims to strengthen and make more effective the exchange of  information and operational cooperation between Member states,  EU Agencies and the critical information infrastructure sector; by aiming to:  •     Reinforce the capacity of law enforcement authorities in Member states,  in particular through the Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre  •   Address obstacles to criminal investigations on cybercrime, notably with  respect to access to evidence   •   Prioritise the implementation of existing legislation on attacks against  information systems and on combating child abuse.  2.3 ASSESS AND CONSOLIDATE ON-LINE MECHANISM TO REPORT  CYBERCRIME  The mechanism is needed to report illicit online activity for the required action to be taken as well as to determine the extent of cybercrime. It entails:  •  The ability of the mechanism to track cybercrime at a national level   •   Ensuring nation-wide awareness and use of the mechanism, especially  among citizens and small businesses.  It is also recommended to ensure that a strategic approach on the applicability of hotlines related to cyber crime handling is taken, so as to facilitate the one-stop shop concept, whilst maximising the use of resources.  3 GOAL: STRENGTHEN NATIONAL CYBER DEFENCE  3.1 ESTABLISH A COLLECTIVE APPROACH FOR SHARING CYBER  SECURITY KNOWLEDGE AND INTELLIGENCE  A collective approach, involving both the public and private sector, potentially  through the use of ICT is needed to:  •   Exchange information on cyber threats and to strengthen response to cyber  incidents efficiently and effectively  •  Analyse new trends and identify opportunities and emerging threats  •  Work to strengthen cyber security  •  Provide framework for sharing best practice  •   Potentially improve professionalism in information assurance and cyber  defence across the private and public sector through schemes for certifying  related competence and specialist training.  “CYBERCRIME IS ONE OF THE AGENDA’S  PRIORITY FOR THE YEARS 2015-2020.”  MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER    19  4 PROPOSED STRATEGY  NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER  The approach may also allow for intra-business sectoral communication,  particularly in areas where particular information may be deemed as of a highly sensitive nature to be shared across all participants.  3.2 REVIEW EXISTING LEGISLATION AND PROVIDE MEASURES THROUGH LEGISLATION AND REGULATION TO ENSURE RELEVANCE  AND EFFECTIVENESS TO THE CYBER WORLD  This measure builds upon two objectives of Digital Malta, as follows:  •   Objective  43 – review existing legislation to ensure relevance and  effectiveness in the cyber world.  •   Objective 44 – provide measures to maintain privacy, safety and security  while surfing, transacting and operating on-line. Legislation will address  several matters such as safeguarding intellectual property rights, patents,  sensitive and personal information, cloud computing and data ownership,  contentious content, net neutrality, vendor lock-in and exit management  strategies; online contracts and license agreements.  The measure is also highly relevant taking into consideration:  •   The requirements arising from the European Agenda on Security, referred  to in Measure 2.2.  •   Action 38 -  Digital Single Market – of Digital Malta, which states  Government’s intention to maximise the benefits and opportunities deriving  from legislation adopted within the EU such as those related to data  protection, electronic identification and trust, etc.   •  Relevant EU Directive and regulation developments arising.  3.3 ENSURE THE COUNTRY’S DIGITAL RESILIENCE TO CYBER ATTACK AS WELL AS THE CAPABILITY TO  PROTECT ITS INTERESTS   Such a measure entails ensuring that the following are addressed:  •  Cyber space defences  •  Structures to counter terrorist attacks  •  Ability and capacity to detect threats in cyber space  •  Capability to disrupt attacks on the country from cyber space  MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER    20  4 PROPOSED STRATEGY  NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER  3.4 CONDUCT CYBER DEFENCE EXERCISES  Cyber defence exercises are to be scheduled and conducted from time to time.  Such a measure contributes to the need to review the ability to anticipate,  prepare for, identify and attribute, combat hostile cyberspace acts. Apart  from technical considerations, cyber defence exercises should also assess  non-technical areas both at an operational, tactical  as well as at a strategic  level such as testing national and international coordination and any relevant  Standard Operational Practices.  Although crucial for stakeholders such as the public sector and key market  operators13, such exercises should also be conducted by other organisations.  4 GOAL: SECURE CYBERSPACE  4.1 ESTABLISH REGULATION AND VOLUNTARY SELF-COMMITMENT FOR GUARANTEEING CYBER SECURITY  The current scenario analysis of cyber security in Malta indicates areas of  regulation and policy particularly within the local regulated industry sectors. Focus appears to be mainly on policy frameworks covering the licensing  approaches which seek to mitigate risk.  Whilst legislation may help, Maltese regulatory authorities may also need to  address further emerging technology such as cloud computing applicability,  through regulation within their respective sectors.  On the other hand, it is understood that legislation and regulation cannot  necessarily cover all aspects of cyber security; particularly considering potential  financial and human resource constraints for robust cyber security. Voluntary self  commitment is, thus, also key to cyber security. The notion of the applicability of  a European trust mark, applied also in a number of EU states14 may encourage  voluntary self commitment and may therefore be one item to considered locally.  Local national strategy may already serve as potential opportunities for further  consideration in fostering self commitment, such as:  •  e-Commerce Malta  which highlights  three pillars as its basis:  I. Engendering trust in ecommerce  II. Transforming micro-enterprises  III.  Taking Small to Medium sized Enterprises and industry to the next  level; which specifically also refers to an audit-kit – through a Specialist  advisory service (Measure 2) and the European trust-mark (Measure 9)  “SUCH MEASURE {CONDUCT CYBER  DEFENCE EXERCISES) CONTRIBUTES  TO THE NEED TO REVIEW THE  ABILITY TO ANTICIPATE, PREPARE  FOR, IDENTIFY AND ATTRIBUTE,  COMBAT HOSTILE CYBER ACTS.”  MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER    21  4 PROPOSED STRATEGY  NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER  Digital Malta  which refers to the Forum for the transformation of industries  through ICT  that aims to raise awareness about how ICT can help industries  transform themselves and to discuss items such as self-regulation.  4.2 STIMULATE USE OF INTEROPERABLE AND SECURE STANDARDS ON  THE BASIS OF GOOD PRACTICE  Digital Malta, through Action 42 – Standards and Good Practice, states  Government’s intention to collaborate with stakeholders to support and promote  National and EU cross-border interoperability, ICT standards based on industry  best practices and Green ICT.  The implementation of ISO 27OO1 controls through the Information Security  Policy across the Public Sector, as well as implementation of the standard within  industries, may potentially contribute to further secure ICT on the local scenario.  With respect to the notion of nationally and EU  recognised interoperability, which  also effectively promotes the use of safe secure standards, Digital Malta states as  one of its objectives, Government’s commitment to revise and revamp the current  National Interoperability Framework including related policies.  On the other hand, such a measure cannot depend solely on Government for its  implementation, but requires private sector collaboration.   Whilst standards like ISO 27OO1 may serve as a good initial basis, however  consideration of industry led standards and guidance that put in place a series of  measures specifically aimed to address cyber threats15 are to be encouraged for  use. This could form an integral part of what is proposed in Measure 4.1.  In particular, special consideration needs to be given by operators and users of  emerging technologies such as those referred to by the threat landscape of the  Supporting Document. In such areas, related standards and security controls,  may still be in the very early stages of maturity and may thus pose cyber security  vulnerability challenges for interoperability which need to be carefully assessed.  4.3 PROMOTE ROBUST LEVELS OF CYBER SECURITY IN ONLINE PUBLIC  SERVICES  Such a measure may alleviate concerns expressed within Euro barometer findings  with respect to Maltese accessing online services. The applicabilityof interoperable  and secure standards, as referred to in Measure 4.2, may potentially contribute  for the attainment of such a measure.  MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER    22  4 PROPOSED STRATEGY  NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER  4.4 CONSOLIDATE SUPPORT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR ON CYBER  SECURITY  Measure 4.1 outlines how cyber security can be facilitated in the private sector.  Furthermore, private sector participation in awareness and advice programmes  as well as cyber related exercises to specific sectors may additionally help. For  example, ways may potentially be sought with business service providers (e.g.  lawyers, insurers) of how they can potentially develop services to help businesses  manage and reduce risks16.  5 GOAL: CYBER SECURITY AWARENESS AND EDUCATION  5.1 ENSURE CYBER SECURITY AWARENESS AND EDUCATION   Such measures may primarily entail:  •   Review of existing curricula that includes cyber security along with ICT and  media competencies  •  Academic programmes designed to consolidate cyber security expertise  Action 2 - Empowering the young through a safer Internet - of Digital  Malta may contribute in this respect. The action item states that “Digital  Citizenship will become part of the National Education Curriculum, to equip  children and youths with the abilities to interact and use the Internet safely and  intelligently. Parents and carers will be involved together with educators and  youth workers. This action will stimulate the production of creative online content,  empower the younger generation and help create a safer environment. With the  support of competent authorities this measure will help combat cyber child abuse  and exploitation”.  Additionally Action 6O - Building national capacity in specialist skill sets - of  Digital Malta states Government’s commitment, through educational institutions  and industry to support the creation of specialist educational pathways,  addressing labour market requirements and to develop the curriculum and  provide technical materials. The possibility of cyber security expertise within such  initiative needs to be actively considered.  Within the current cyber security scenario, there appear to be related awareness  campaigns in schools. It is important that such campaigns are sustained on the  long term, potentially through a concerted strategic approach.  “WITHIN THE CURRENT CYBER SECURITY  SCENARIO, THERE APPEAR TO BE  RELATED AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS IN  SCHOOLS. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT SUCH  CAMPAIGNS ARE SUSTAINED ON THE  LONG TERM, POTENTIALLY THROUGH A  CONCERTED STRATEGIC APPROACH.”  MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER    23  4 PROPOSED STRATEGY  NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER  5.2 ENSURE RELEVANT EDUCATION AND TRAINING TO PUBLIC SECTOR  STAFF AND THOSE WORKING WITHIN CRITICAL INFORMATION  INFRASTRUCTURE   Training and education on cyber security is one key priority within the public  sector, especially given the sector’s wider extensive use of ICT and sensitive data,  compared to other sectors.   In any office environment it needs to be kept in view, that technology controls are  not sufficient to protect data from related cyber security threats as outlined in  the Supporting Document. The controls need to go hand in hand with human  resource, awareness and employee guidance programs17.  The development of cyber security expertise within the public sector is another  key area that merits particular attention. In the process, it also needs to be  ensured that a comprehensive list of public sector professionals certified under  internationally recognised certification programs in cyber security is established  and maintained.  Furthermore, it needs to be ensured that ICT personnel are trained so as to enable  them to recognise cyber incidents, to detect anomalies in their ICT systems and to  report them accordingly.  5.3 FOSTER APPLICATION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ON CYBER SECURITY  Such a measure aims to ensure cyber security as among key research priorities.  It effectively calls for encouragement and support for research in any national  and EU research projects and initiatives on cyber security. Essentially, it entails  participation not only from Government but also from the private sector and the academia.  It also calls for an emphasis to ensure security and privacy in the design of ICT  products and services for Government as well as in other areas of application.  5.4 A STRATEGIC, TARGET-ORIENTED NATIONAL AWARENESS AND  ADVICE CAMPAIGN  It is highly recommended that a concerted strategic approach is undertaken,  potentially through a nationwide Communications strategy for cyber security18;  aimed at addressing the various strata of society, business and public sector  during the short, medium to long term. Such an approach may ensure:  •  Avoiding piecemeal, potentially one-off approaches to awareness campaigns  •  No duplication of effort  MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER  “IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT A  CONCERTED STRATEGIC APPROACH IS  UNDERTAKEN, POTENTIALLY THROUGH A NATIONWIDE COMMUNICATIONS  STRATEGY FOR CYBER SECURITY”.    24  4 PROPOSED STRATEGY  NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER  •  Maximisation of cyber security related financial and human resources  •   Imparting effective awareness and knowledge that is commensurate to the  target audience and to the medium used19  •   A measure of the extent of national awareness and understanding of cyber  security over time.  Most measures highlighted within Goals 4 and 5 of this strategy as well as any  established national way of sharing related knowledge, experience and insight  as referred to in Measure 3.12O may potentially serve as key sources for the  establishment and maintenance of such a concerted strategic campaign.  Ultimately, the key factor in any training and awareness programmes on cyber  security is:  •  Finding the right way to raise awareness  •   Establishing training programmes that effectively increase security level of an  organisation and maintaining such increased level of security in the long term  •   Ensuring motivation of users to learn and pay particular attention to various  signals of fake communications on a day to day basis (particularly to counter  social engineering threats).  Prior and post assessment of such programmes is one way of ensuring  their effectiveness. However, consideration should also be taken that such  programmes may not necessarily focus only on traditional modes of education  and awareness but also on experimentation of innovative ways of their conduct21.  5.5 ENCOURAGE ‘CYBER HYGIENE’ AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY  Ultimately, citizens are expected to apply at least some form of basic ‘cyber  hygiene’ in using ICT, such as through careful disposition and use of personal  information on-line, installing software updates, using basic security controls such  as passwords  and anti-virus software. The national awareness campaign as highlighted earlier should help in reaching this objective.   In particular, a responsible disclosure policy that enables well-intentioned  citizens to safely inform Government, businesses or institutions about detected  vulnerabilities in their ICT systems or services may also be considered22.  MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER    25  4 PROPOSED STRATEGY  NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER  6 GOAL: NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION  6.1 EFFECTIVE COOPERATION AND COLLABORATION ON CYBER  SECURITY ON A NATIONAL , EUROPEAN AND GLOBAL BASIS  Malta is no island in cyberspace. Hence the ongoing cooperation and collaboration  on cyber security on a national, European and on a global basis needs to be  sustained on the long term.  Above all, a co-ordinated approach, among all key local  stakeholders in cyber  security interacting locally and overseas  needs to be ensured so as to ensure  synergy of national and international effort, knowledge and expertise within  the domain.   Cyber related activities such as those conducted by ENISA is one area of national  and international cooperation that may potentially involve both local public as well  as private sector organisations.  On a national level, most of the measures highlighted earlier essentially call for  national cooperation and coordination.   On a wider international perspective, activities such as those undertaken by the  Council of the European Union on cyber-diplomacy23 aim to foster increased  global cyber capacity building, as well as international cooperation and judicial  capacity on cyber crime.  ‘MALTA IS NO ISLAND IN CYBERSPACE.

MALTA | NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER    29  PROPOSED STRATEGY -  PART THREE  NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY GREEN PAPER  5.2 LAUNCH OF THE STRATEGY  As highlighted earlier, the consultations are expected to consolidate the  formulation, leading to the launch of a National Cyber Security Strategy.   The launch of the Strategy is definitely not a one-off activity. Cybersecurity is a  continuous process. Hence the Strategy would be expected to be updated from  time to time24 so as to ensure its alignment with:  •  Rapid developments within the cyber threat vector landscape  •   Related ICT, legislative, regulatory, social and economic  developments on a  national scenario  •  Malta’s evolvement in the level of cyber security capability on a national scale.  “THE LAUNCH OF THE STRATEGY IS  DEFINITELY NOT A ONE-OFF ACTIVITY.

Adapted from the definition cited by the Cyber security Strategy of the European Union  2. Ross(2O15)  3. Puricelli (2O15)  4.  Which could take the form of (i) a centralised approach – whereby a national authority has in-house  responsibilities with all authorities reporting to it; OR (ii) a decentralised approach whereby roles and  responsibilities are spread across a variety of actors who coordinate together to share information and  exchange on a voluntary basis OR (iii) a semi-centralised (hybrid) approach whereby a central ministry  coordinates implementation of the strategy with designated authorities having the necessary roles and  responsibilities over operators and other stakeholders  and who report to the central ministry on a periodic  basis.  5.  A top level coordinating CSIRT that acts as a key support to the strategy implementation function. Among the  responsibilities of such CSIRT are:  •  Monitoring incidents at a national level •   Providing early warning, alerts, announcements and dissemination of information to relevant   stakeholders about risks and incidents •  Providing dynamic risk and incident analysis and situational awareness •  Establish cooperative relationships with the private sector •   Facilitate cooperation through use of common or standardised practices for incident and risk handling   procedures 6. European Commission (2O15), DSI Maturity Study, p.29  7.  Refer to Section 9 -  ‘Identification and Assessment of Stakeholders’of the Supporting document  8.  Key market operators refers to providers of information society services, operators of critical information  infrastructure and operators of Critical infrastructure that provide  essential or critical services to critical  information infrastructure.

Potential areas that can be seen to also relate to cyber insurance, due diligence to third party with which  businesses may seek strategic relationships,etc  17. Puricelli, op.cit  18. A similar approach has been taken by the Netherlands and Austria  19. For example social media, TV, radio, etc  20.  Part from regular Euro barometer surveys dealing with cyber security which provide a significant insight on  cyber security experiences and concerns on a domestic level.  21.  For example apart from use of visual methods, rewards, social engagement and direct feedback during  everyday working life; gamification may present one promising method. (Purcelli, op. cit, p.27)  22.  Such policy is currently mainly applied by global and large organisations, and also by some EU member states  such as the Netherlands. Reference is made to the Council of European Union meeting document ‘non-paper  on Fostering Cyber Security and Cyber defence in Europe by means of Responsible Disclosure Policies.  23.  Reference is made to the Council Conclsuions on Cyber Diplomacy (2O15) and to the Global Conference on  Cyberspace (2O15)  24.  Time of review to be determined, following the consultation period. It is noted that such strategies normally  have a time span of around two to three years.

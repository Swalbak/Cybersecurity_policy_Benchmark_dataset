These disruptive activities by cyber criminals has caused the debate on cyber security to be on the top of the agenda for almost every country, and many countries are strategizing on how to combat the cyber criminals. Several global initiatives are also addressing cyber crime and enhancement of cyber security. The ITU’s IMPACT program is providing several member countries early warning on cyber crimes and is helping these member countries secure their cyber space. The Commonwealth Cyber Initiative (CCI) is another initiative that seeks to help commonwealth countries adopt efficient cyber security policies and Infrastructure. At the continental level, the African (AU) has developed a cyber security convention which was ratified by African Presidents. The cyber menace in Ghana has been more of cyber fraud. The popular “sakawa” where cyber criminals defraud unsuspecting Internet users of large sums of money in Ghana and abroad remains prevalent because of inadequate laws on cyber crime to prosecute cyber criminals. The Electronic Transaction Act (2008) has provisions for law enforcement agencies to fight cyber crime. However, this is not adequate for law enforcement in the fight against cyber crime as there are legal gaps caused by rapidly change in the cyber landscape. There is, however, the need to fully address all aspects of cyber security, and apply a multi-stakeholder approach to fighting the cyber menace. Several initiatives are on-going to address the cyber menace, all of which need to be brought under one umbrella for Ghana. The Ministry of Communications, Ghana with the support of UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) began a process in 2011 to review some aspects of Ghana’s ICT for Accelerated Development (ICT4AD) policy to identify gaps as a result the changing ICT 8 | P a g e N a t i o n a l C y b e r S e c u r i t y P o l i c y & S t r a t e g y landscape and recent developments in ICTs that were not originally envisaged and put in the document. Cyber security is one of the four thematic areas under this review and the national cyber security policy and strategy for Ghana has been developed. The policy has nine policy pillars and includes effective governance, legal framework, technology framework, response readiness and international cooperation. Five special initiatives have been included in the first five year strategic plan. These initiatives includes establishment of institutional frameworks, creating awareness, ensuring coordination of cyber security initiatives and enforcement of cyber standards in Ghana. When fully implemented, Ghana will have a solid cyber security base framework to address its cyber needs. 9 | P a g e N a t i o n a l C y b e r S e c u r i t y P o l i c y & S t r a t e g y a.

OverviewOverviewOverviewOverview In recent times, Ghana has experienced a number of cyber attacks including defacing of a number of government websites by Internet hackers. These attacks have a denting effect on the cyber image of Ghana and are indications of security weakness of our cyber infrastructure and space. Cyber attacks have become very sophisticated and widespread and many countries are not only focusing on protecting their critical information infrastructure but also ensuring that there are very good incidence responds teams in place to respond to incidents cyber security incidents. Since the turn of the century, we have seen a rapid growth of the Internet in Ghana. The growth has brought in its wake extensive cyber activities and subsequently attacks on various information infrastructure as well as cyber fraud popularly known as “Sakawa”. The biggest challenge is that the designated central point in the country where victims of “Sakawa” can report to at the Police CID Cybercrime Unit is not visible nationally and is under resourced. In cases when these incidences had been reported, it has taken many years to apprehend any suspect because of the lack of expertise in tracking these criminals using computers–based forensic skills. To make matters worse, when such cyber criminals were apprehended and processed to court, there are, more often, not enough legal basis to prosecute these criminal, as the legal system is inadequate to convict and punish cyber criminals. Consequently, Ghana’s image continues dwindle in cyberspace and is therefore considered as a cyber crime prone country. For many years, cyber cafes have been the main source of Internet access, as many people could not afford the high cost of personal computers and Internet access and, as 11 | P a g e N a t i o n a l C y b e r S e c u r i t y P o l i c y & S t r a t e g y a result of lack of operational guideline, cyber cafes have become fertile ground for cyber crime. Ghana’s mobile penetration stood at 115.64% as at the end of March 2015. The high mobile penetration has brought about an increase in mobile phone threats and fraud. The increased use of smart phones, especially with the introduction of M-commerce, is likely to bring more incidents like hackings and other attacks to mobile phone users. There is therefore a need to create awareness of risk of cyber attacks and exploitations for mobile users. As a result of mobile fraud, the National Communications Authority registered all SIM card in Ghana but there still remain high crime in the mobile space as cyber criminal continue to engage SIM Box fraud and other fraudulent activities. Until recently, Ghana’s Internet backbone and resources have been largely private sector driven. This result has been that many government officials send and receiving highly sensitive government information using free email services such Yahoo and Google making it vulnerable to information theft. However, since 2008, with the establishment of the National Information Technology Agency (NITA), Ghana embarked on a massive government network rollout to ensure efficiency in government operations and improved service delivery to citizens. . The result is that NITA now has Internet and Data services to all Ministries Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and has national datacenter facilities that enable NITA provide email and webhosting services under government designated second level domain (.gov.gh) NITA is also implementing the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Digital Certificates to enhance secure communication within government. There is the need of a strong public private partnership in crafting our national cyber security policy to take care of the interests of the private and public sectors. 12 | P a g e N a t i o n a l C y b e r S e c u r i t y P o l i c y & S t r a t e g y ii.ii.ii.ii. GlobalGlobalGlobalGlobal Activities on Cyber SecurityActivities on Cyber SecurityActivities on Cyber SecurityActivities on Cyber Security Cyber Security is central to the Information and knowledge economy. Countries which have high levels of networked computers and automation stand greater risks than countries with less developed networked computer infrastructure. As many countries with less developed network infrastructure strive to become a knowledge society, many network infrastructures will be rolled out with automation. This is evidenced in many African countries where over the last few years, massive submarine fiber optic cable Internet transit have landed on the shores and massive in-country fiber optic backbones are being rolled out. An increase in network computer infrastructure will bring a proportionate risk to critical information infrastructure. For many years, many countries with high degree of networked computer infrastructure have been working around securing their critical information infrastructure and have developed cyber security policies and strategies to mitigate cyber incidences and crimes. No one country control cyber space and everyone from anywhere in the world can access information from the Internet. It is therefore very important that countries put in place robust security around critical national information infrastructure and set up very swift response systems as risk of attacks cannot be eliminated. Additionally using an international approach of cooperation to secure cyber space and mitigate cyber crimes is also essential. Many countries with high networked computer infrastructure and global companies already have Computer Security Incidents Response Teams (CSIRTs) in place where responses to cyber incidences are coordinated to mitigate the impact of cyber incidences. However in developing economies, very few CSIRTs have been setup, 13 | P a g e N a t i o n a l C y b e r S e c u r i t y P o l i c y & S t r a t e g y although it is top of the agenda for many of these countries as networked computer infrastructure expands. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) through the International Multilateral Partnership against Cyber Threat (IMPACT) program has over the last few years played a leadership role is providing early warning systems and training cyber security experts around the world. Today, IMPACT has over 152 countries members. ITU has indeed developed a framework for developing countries to help them kick start a process of developing policies and strategy around cyber security. Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST Inc.) is a global forum of Computer Security Incidents Response Teams (CSIRTs). Membership to FIRST is by recommendation and through a rigorous standards process. The Budapest Convention on Cyber Security which has been in force since 2004 was elaborated by the Council of Europe with the participation of Canada, Japan, South Africa and the USA. The Convention is open to any country which wants to participate. The convention is used as a guideline, reference standard or model law in more than 100 countries. iii.iii.iii.iii. RegionalRegionalRegionalRegional InitInitInitInitiativesiativesiativesiatives Governments in Africa today have moved the ICT discussion from infrastructure to cyber security. A decade ago, infrastructure was a major challenge to many African countries. Many countries have invested in massive in-country infrastructure and the connectivity and access challenge is waning. The networked computer infrastructure coming up in many African countries has opened up cyber space to many more citizens and accompanying this, the risk of using the Internet. A few countries like Tunisia, South Africa and Kenya already have a CERT in place. Many countries are also in the process 14 | P a g e N a t i o n a l C y b e r S e c u r i t y P o l i c y & S t r a t e g y of developing cyber security policy and strategy (including formation of CERTs). In order to harmonize the development of cyber security policy and strategy, the Africa Union (AU) and the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) have developed a cyber security and cybercrime convention and has been ratified by African heads of States. Ratification of the convention, it can be argued, will foster regional cooperation in the fight against cyber crime. In 2010, AfricaCERT was formed and have been undertaking capacity building program annually in different Africa countries on the establishment and management of CSIRTs for African countries. iv.iv.iv.iv. LocalLocalLocalLocal InitiativesInitiativesInitiativesInitiatives Today’s society thrives virtually on using the Internet for communication and business. As networked computer infrastructure expands in the country, there is an increasing threat to business and communication. Recent several cyber attacks on government websites in Ghana is a wake-up call for the development of a cyber security policy and strategy. Resolutions of cyber incidences have been uncoordinated and in many cases, there were no reporting structure put in place to guide in dealing with future attacks. The National Information Technology Agency (NITA)’s concern of ensuring security of the government network initiated discussion amongst stakeholder in the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to setup a NITA Computer Emergency Response team (nitaCERT) to coordinate cyber incidences and assist in resolving future incidences within the government network. 15 | P a g e N a t i o n a l C y b e r S e c u r i t y P o l i c y & S t r a t e g y The Ministry of Communication initiated the national Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) project in 2013 in collaboration with the ITU-IMPACT. The national CERT was established in August 2014 is fully operational handling incidents and sending out early warning to its constituents. The National Security Council and many other institutions such as Ghanaian Academic and Research Network (GARNET) in academia are working on different projects towards securing cyberspace. The SIM registration by NCA is another initiative to mitigate cyber crimes committed using mobile phones. The Ghana Police Service has also put in place the cybercrime Unit to alleviate cyber and other related crimes. The Economic and Organized Crime Office (EOCO) under the Attorney General’s Department and Financial Intelligence Center for the financial sector are all government initiatives geared towards mitigating crime in general and computer crime in particular. On the business side, the opening of an e-Crime Bureau in Ghana has greatly helped organizations investigate cyber crime thoroughly and improve protection of cyber space. In spite all these initiatives, the fact still remains that there is a general lack of education on cyber security amongst the consuming public of ICT products and services which needs to be addressed. II. II. II. II. NEED FOR POLICYNEED FOR POLICYNEED FOR POLICYNEED FOR POLICY As Ghana strives to become an information and knowledge economy, there is an increased emphasis on informational activities and the information industry. Businesses will compete on information and computer systems will work efficiently on the right 16 | P a g e N a t i o n a l C y b e r S e c u r i t y P o l i c y & S t r a t e g y information to produce the output required. It is becoming extremely necessary for nations to protect critical national information infrastructure to ensure national security in the wake of recent cyber wars, and ensure a safe cyber space to enable wealth creation for citizens. As networked computer infrastructure increases, there will be an increase in attacks on critical information infrastructure that is required to sustain the economy of the information and knowledge society. There is therefore an increasing need to protect critical national information infrastructure (CNII) and create a robust incidence response system when any attack is made on the CNII, to avoid loss of revenue due to down time and ensure national security. The need to create a security culture by creating awareness of the enormous threats that users, especially children, of the Internet are exposed to must be addressed by a national cyber security policy. Awareness creation (education) of the risks users of the Internet are exposed and the vulnerabilities on our phones, computers and PDAs to can drastically reduce cyber incidences with its consequential loss of revenue when business are involved. This will create a very conducive environment in the information economy where Ghanaians can create wealth in peace without fear of harassment by cyber criminal and fraudsters. Government business can be brought to a halt if the NITA infrastructure is attacked. In the same way, many businesses may grind to a halt if the infrastructure of ISPs and other public Internet and phone services are attacked. There is therefore the need to develop technical capacity of local technocrats to enable them manage the cyber security risks to government and private sector critical information infrastructure. In order to share knowledge on incidence response and ensure that there is a uniform risk management of all critical information infrastructures (both public and private), the policy 17 | P a g e N a t i o n a l C y b e r S e c u r i t y P o l i c y & S t r a t e g y must address the need for a central coordinating body and work with a public private partnership model. III. RELEVANT PROVISION – ICT4AD Pillar 14 of the ICT4AD policy relates to Security Agencies using ICT to combat cybercrime. The pillar among other things places emphasis on capacity building, international cooperation and building infrastructure for security agencies to enable them use ICT to combat crime. Additionally, the pillar is to ensure that the legal text of the policy is up to date to help law enforcement agencies prosecute any cyber crime offenders. The Electronic Transaction Act (ETA) 2008 has specific legislation on cyber crime and prescribes punishment for cyber crime perpetuators. The Act addresses issues on the fight against cyber crime. The Data Protection Act which has been passed by the Parliament of Ghana ensures protection of private data of government, citizens and businesses in Ghana. The Pillar 14 and the ETA fail to capture a holistic approach to securing the cyber space as a means of mitigating cyber incidences that may affect the ability of citizens to create wealth. The several on-going initiatives which are not coordinated makes it impossible to know what different agencies of Government, academia and business are doing to enhance cyber security. A National Cyber Security framework covering policy and implementation strategy done holistically will ensure coordination and greatly enhance the national cyber security of Ghana. 18 | P a g e N a t i o n a l C y b e r S e c u r i t y P o l i c y & S t r a t e g y b. SECTION TWO: CYBER SECURITY POLICY 19 | P a g e N a t i o n a l C y b e r S e c u r i t y P o l i c y & S t r a t e g y INTRODUCTION Ghana’s determination to secure its cyber space is driven by a desire to ensure that our people are free from cyber attacks with devastating effects. This is informed by the fact that a people with a culture of cyber security achieved through awareness creation and capacity building are in a better position to handle cyber attacks as and when they occur. Our ability to identify and understand threats and how they can be handled reduces the number of actual attacks significantly and enhances the continuous operation of the national infrastructure on which critical information are held in the interest and security of the nation. We also recognize that the threat is not restricted only to government but also to operators who provide public services to citizens and private networks, thus the need for private public partnership. DEFINITIONS For the purpose of this policy document, Critical National Information Infrastructure (CNII)Critical National Information Infrastructure (CNII)Critical National Information Infrastructure (CNII)Critical National Information Infrastructure (CNII) may be defined as those assets (real and virtual), systems and functions that are vital to the nations that their incapacity or destruction would have a devastating impact on: • National economic strengthNational economic strengthNational economic strengthNational economic strength Confidence that the nation's key growth area can successfully compete in global market while maintaining favorable standards of living. 20 | P a g e N a t i o n a l C y b e r S e c u r i t y P o l i c y & S t r a t e g y • National imageNational imageNational imageNational image Projection of national image towards enhancing stature and sphere of influence. • National defense and securityNational defense and securityNational defense and securityNational defense and security Guarantee sovereignty and independence whilst maintaining internal security. • Government capability to functGovernment capability to functGovernment capability to functGovernment capability to functionsionsionsions Maintain order to perform and deliver minimum essential public services. • Public health and safetyPublic health and safetyPublic health and safetyPublic health and safety Delivering and managing optimal health care to the citizen. CNII SECTORS FOR GHANA Countries identify the CNII based on the level of networked computers and how attacks on them can affect factors mentioned above. For the purpose of policy as it relates to Ghana, the following sectors have been identified as CNII sectors: 1. National Defense and Security 2. Banking and Finance 3. Information and Communications 4. Energy 5. Transportation 6. Water 7. Health Services 8. Government 9. Emergency services 21 | P a g e N a t i o n a l C y b e r S e c u r i t y P o l i c y & S t r a t e g y 10. Food and Agriculture VISION A secure and stable connected Ghana with Internet users working and creating wealth in a safe cyber space, with a well-researched and trained academic and professional community protecting Ghana’s cyber space equipped with global standards and responding swiftly to cyber incidents, and with up-to-date laws and systems in place to efficiently prosecute cyber criminals. MISSION STATEMENT To identify, analyze, address and remediate the immediate and potential cyber security threats posed on identified critical national information infrastructures (CNIIs) and put measures in place that will adequately regulate and secure the system infrastructures and meet the countries cyber security needs. POLICY SCOPE This policy covers all aspect of cyber security and national response including fight against cyber crime, creating public awareness, investment in education, scientific research, and development of cyber laws and legal measures, national security, , law enforcement and protection of critical national information infrastructures. (We can rephrase sentence) 22 | P a g e N a t i o n a l C y b e r S e c u r i t y P o l i c y & S t r a t e g y POLICY CONTEXT Ghana, like many developing economies faces the risk of cyber-attacks. Different uncoordinated initiatives are being put in place to secure the cyber space of Ghana. Many custodians of critical national information infrastructure are unaware of their roles in ensuring the maintenance of cyber security within the country. The driving force behind the national policy is the realization that a combination of persistent computer vulnerabilities and worldwide connectivity has placed the national critical information infrastructures at risks. In Africa, Governments are discussing how to secure their cyberspace in the wake of heightened threats to national information infrastructure. Several national initiatives are taking place to ensure that legal systems are updated to enable proper persecution of cyber criminals. The threat that cyber-attacks pose to African governments has prompted the African Union Commission to develop a convention at the regional level to harmonize the efforts of African countries in fighting cybercrime and ensuring cyber security. The cyber security policy will address major cyber risks facing Ghana from attacks on the national information infrastructure. The policy seeks to address the lack of awareness of risks users and businesses face doing business in cyber space. The problem of “Sakawa” which has tagged as a haven of cyber fraudsters will be addressed by the policy. The policy also addresses the need to develop knowledge base, systems and technology framework for combating cyber-attacks and capacity building for cyber security expects to make Ghana self–sufficient in the fight against cybercrime and in the near future create a culture of cyber security in Ghana. 23 | P a g e N a t i o n a l C y b e r S e c u r i t y P o l i c y & S t r a t e g y The National Cyber Security Policy (NCSP) seeks to address the risks to the Critical National Information Infrastructure (CNII) which comprises the networked information systems of ten critical sectors. The policy recognizes the critical and highly interdependent nature of the CNII and aims to develop and establish a comprehensive program and a series of frameworks that will ensure the effectiveness of cyber security controls over vital assets. It is being developed to ensure that the CNII are protected to a level that commensurate the risks faced. The policy has been designed to facilitate Ghana’s move towards a knowledge-based economy and will be based on a number of frameworks that comprises legislation and regulatory, technology, public-private cooperation, institutional, and international aspects. 24 | P a g e N a t i o n a l C y b e r S e c u r i t y P o l i c y & S t r a t e g y I. POLICY STATEMENT Effective Governance Government will centralize coordination of national cyber security initiatives and promote effective cooperation between public and private sectors. In order to sustain the gains from any initiatives, government will establish formal and encourage informal information sharing exchanges. Legislative & Regulatory Framework Government through the Attorney General’s department set up a periodic process of reviewing and enhancing Ghana’s laws relating to cyber space to address the dynamic nature of cyber security threats. In order to empower national law enforcement agencies to properly prosecute cyber security crimes, Government will establish progressive capacity building programs to acquire new skills and effective ways of enforcing cyber laws. Government will ensure that all applicable local legislation is complementary to and in harmony with international laws, treaties and conventions. Cyber Security Technology Framework Policy measures will be put in place to develop a national cyber security technology framework that specifies cyber security requirement controls and baselines for CNII 25 | P a g e N a t i o n a l C y b e r S e c u r i t y P o l i c y & S t r a t e g y elements. This will be accompanied will mechanism to implement an evaluation/certification program for cyber security product and systems. Culture of security and Capacity Building Government will invest every resource needed to develop, foster and maintain a national culture of security. As part of the process of development of culture of cyber security, government will support the standardization and coordination of cyber security awareness and education programmes across all elements of the CNII. Government will also: • Establish an effective mechanism for cyber security knowledge dissemination at the national level • Identify minimum requirements and qualifications for information security professionals Research & Development towards Self-Reliance In order for Ghana to become self-reliant in protecting the CNII to a level that is commensurate with the risk, Government will formalize the coordination and prioritization of cyber security research and development activities enlarge and strengthen the cyber security research community. Research and development will be encouraged by promoting the development and commercialization of intellectual properties, technologies and innovations through focused research and development. Government will also put measures in place to nurture the growth of cyber security industry. 26 | P a g e N a t i o n a l C y b e r S e c u r i t y P o l i c y & S t r a t e g y Compliance and Enforcement In order to ensure compliance and enforcement, policy measures and mechanism will be put in place to standardize cyber security systems across all elements of the CNII. Government will also strengthen the monitoring and enforcement of standards and develop a standard cyber security risk Management Framework. Child Online Protection Policy measures will be implemented through multi-stakeholder working by government industry, Civil Society, and relevant international child online protection agencies. Government will encourage dialogue at national and local levels to engage all concerned and create awareness of the possibilities and dangers of the Internet. Cyber Security Emergency Readiness To ensure cyber security emergency readiness, government together with all stakeholders will develop effective cyber security incident reporting mechanisms. This will include the development and strengthening of the national computer security incidence response team (CSIRT) and sector CSIRTs, dissemination of vulnerability advisories and threat warnings in a timely manner and the development of a standard business continuity management framework. The government will also encourage all elements of the CNII to monitor cyber security events and perform periodic vulnerability assessment programs. 27 | P a g e N a t i o n a l C y b e r S e c u r i t y P o l i c y & S t r a t e g y International Cooperation Policy measures will be put in place to encourage the active participation of Ghana in all relevant international cyber security bodies, panels and multi-national agencies. Government will make every effort to promote active participation in all relevant international cyber security activities by hosting an annual international cyber security conference. 28 | P a g e N a t i o n a l C y b e r S e c u r i t y P o l i c y & S t r a t e g y c.

These disruptive activities by cyber criminals has caused the debate on cyber security to be on the top of the agenda for almost every country, and many countries are strategizing on how to combat the cyber criminals. Several global initiatives are also addressing cyber crime and enhancement of cyber security. The ITU’s IMPACT program is providing several member countries early warning on cyber crimes and is helping these member countries secure their cyber space. The Commonwealth Cyber Initiative (CCI) is another initiative that seeks to help commonwealth countries adopt efficient cyber security policies and Infrastructure.   At the continental level, the African (AU) has developed a cyber security convention which was ratified by African Presidents.  The cyber menace in Ghana has been more of cyber fraud. The popular “sakawa” where cyber criminals defraud unsuspecting Internet users of large sums of money in Ghana and abroad remains prevalent because of inadequate laws on cyber crime to prosecute cyber criminals.  The Electronic Transaction Act (2008) has provisions for law enforcement agencies to fight cyber crime. However, this is not adequate for law enforcement in the fight against cyber crime as there are legal gaps caused by rapidly change in the cyber landscape.   There is, however, the need to fully address all aspects of cyber security, and apply a multi-stakeholder approach to fighting the cyber menace.  Several initiatives are on-going to address the cyber menace, all of which need to be brought under one umbrella for Ghana. The Ministry of Communications, Ghana with the support of UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) began a process in 2011 to review some aspects of Ghana’s ICT for Accelerated Development (ICT4AD) policy to identify gaps as a result the changing ICT     8 | P a g e     N a t i o n a l  C y b e r  S e c u r i t y  P o l i c y  &  S t r a t e g y       landscape and recent developments in ICTs that were not originally envisaged and put in the document. Cyber security is one of the four thematic areas under this review and   the national cyber security policy and strategy for Ghana has been developed. The policy has nine policy pillars and includes effective governance, legal framework, technology framework, response readiness and international cooperation. Five special initiatives have been included in the first five year strategic plan. These initiatives includes establishment of institutional frameworks, creating awareness, ensuring coordination of cyber security initiatives and enforcement of cyber standards in Ghana. When fully implemented, Ghana will have a solid cyber security base framework to address its cyber needs.     9 | P a g e     N a t i o n a l  C y b e r  S e c u r i t y  P o l i c y  &  S t r a t e g y                            a.

OverviewOverviewOverviewOverview     In recent times, Ghana has experienced a number of cyber attacks including defacing of a number of government websites by Internet hackers. These attacks have a denting effect on the cyber image of Ghana and are indications of security weakness of our cyber infrastructure and space. Cyber attacks have become very sophisticated and widespread and many countries are not only focusing on protecting their critical information infrastructure but also ensuring that there are very good incidence responds teams in place to respond to incidents cyber security incidents.  Since the turn of the century, we have seen a rapid growth of the Internet in Ghana. The growth has brought in its wake extensive cyber activities and subsequently attacks on various information infrastructure as well as cyber fraud popularly known as “Sakawa”.  The biggest challenge is that the designated central point in the country where victims of “Sakawa” can report to at the Police CID Cybercrime Unit is not visible nationally and is under resourced. In cases when these incidences had been reported, it has taken many years to apprehend any suspect because of the lack of expertise in tracking these criminals using computers–based forensic skills.  To make matters worse, when such cyber criminals were apprehended and processed to court, there are, more often, not enough legal basis to prosecute these criminal, as the legal system is inadequate to convict and punish cyber criminals.  Consequently, Ghana’s image continues dwindle in cyberspace and is therefore considered as a cyber crime prone country. For many years, cyber cafes have been the main source of Internet access, as many people could not afford the high cost of personal computers and Internet access and, as     11 | P a g e     N a t i o n a l  C y b e r  S e c u r i t y  P o l i c y  &  S t r a t e g y       a result of lack of operational guideline, cyber cafes have become fertile ground for cyber crime.   Ghana’s mobile penetration stood at 115.64% as at the end of March 2015. The high mobile penetration has brought about an increase in mobile phone threats and fraud. The increased use of smart phones, especially with the introduction of M-commerce, is likely to bring more incidents like hackings and other attacks to mobile phone users. There is therefore a need to create awareness of risk of cyber attacks and exploitations for mobile users. As a result of mobile fraud,  the National Communications Authority registered all SIM card in Ghana but there still remain high crime in the mobile space as cyber criminal continue to engage SIM Box fraud and other fraudulent activities.  Until recently, Ghana’s Internet backbone and resources have been largely private sector driven. This result has been that many government officials send and receiving highly sensitive government information using free email services such Yahoo and Google making it vulnerable to information theft. However, since 2008, with the establishment of the National Information Technology Agency (NITA), Ghana embarked on a massive government network rollout to ensure efficiency in government operations and improved service delivery to citizens. . The result is that NITA now has Internet and Data services to all Ministries Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and has  national datacenter facilities that enable NITA provide email and webhosting services under government designated second level domain (.gov.gh) NITA is also implementing the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Digital Certificates to enhance secure communication within government. There is the need of a strong public private partnership in crafting our national cyber security policy to take care of the interests of the private and public sectors.      12 | P a g e     N a t i o n a l  C y b e r  S e c u r i t y  P o l i c y  &  S t r a t e g y       ii.ii.ii.ii. GlobalGlobalGlobalGlobal    Activities on Cyber SecurityActivities on Cyber SecurityActivities on Cyber SecurityActivities on Cyber Security    Cyber Security is central to the Information and knowledge economy. Countries which have high levels of networked computers and automation stand greater risks than countries with less developed networked computer infrastructure. As many countries with less developed network infrastructure strive to become a knowledge society, many network infrastructures will be rolled out with automation. This is evidenced in many African countries where over the last few years, massive submarine fiber optic cable Internet transit have landed on the shores and  massive in-country fiber optic backbones are being rolled out. An increase in network computer infrastructure will bring a proportionate risk to critical information infrastructure.   For many years, many countries with high degree of networked computer infrastructure have been working around securing their critical information infrastructure and have developed cyber security policies and strategies to mitigate cyber incidences and crimes.   No one country control cyber space and everyone from anywhere in the world can access information from the Internet. It is therefore very important that countries put in place robust security around critical national information infrastructure and set up very swift response systems as risk of attacks cannot be eliminated. Additionally using   an international approach of cooperation to secure cyber space and mitigate cyber crimes is also essential. Many countries with high networked computer infrastructure and global companies   already have Computer Security Incidents Response Teams (CSIRTs) in place where responses to cyber incidences are coordinated to mitigate the impact of cyber incidences. However in developing economies, very few CSIRTs have been setup,     13 | P a g e     N a t i o n a l  C y b e r  S e c u r i t y  P o l i c y  &  S t r a t e g y       although it is top of the agenda for many of these countries as networked computer infrastructure expands. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) through the International Multilateral Partnership against Cyber Threat (IMPACT) program has over the last few years played a leadership role is providing early warning systems and training cyber security experts around the world. Today, IMPACT has over 152 countries members. ITU has indeed developed a framework for developing countries to help them kick start a process of developing policies and strategy around cyber security. Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST Inc.) is a global forum of Computer Security Incidents Response Teams (CSIRTs). Membership to FIRST is by recommendation and through a rigorous standards process. The Budapest Convention on Cyber Security which has been in force since 2004 was elaborated by the Council of Europe with the participation of Canada, Japan, South Africa and the USA. The Convention is open to any country which wants to participate. The convention is used as a guideline, reference standard or model law in more than 100 countries.  iii.iii.iii.iii. RegionalRegionalRegionalRegional    InitInitInitInitiativesiativesiativesiatives    Governments in Africa today have moved the ICT discussion from infrastructure to cyber security. A decade ago, infrastructure was a major challenge to many African countries. Many countries have invested in massive in-country infrastructure and the connectivity and access challenge is waning. The networked computer infrastructure coming up in many African countries has opened up cyber space to many more citizens and accompanying this, the risk of using the Internet. A few countries like Tunisia, South Africa and Kenya already have a CERT in place. Many countries are also in the process     14 | P a g e     N a t i o n a l  C y b e r  S e c u r i t y  P o l i c y  &  S t r a t e g y       of developing cyber security policy and strategy (including formation of CERTs). In order to harmonize the development of cyber security policy and strategy, the Africa Union (AU) and the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) have developed a cyber security and cybercrime convention and has been ratified by African heads of States. Ratification of the convention, it can be argued, will foster regional cooperation in the fight against cyber crime. In 2010, AfricaCERT was formed and have been undertaking capacity building program annually in different Africa countries on the establishment and management of CSIRTs for African countries. iv.iv.iv.iv. LocalLocalLocalLocal    InitiativesInitiativesInitiativesInitiatives        Today’s society thrives virtually on using the Internet for communication and business. As networked computer infrastructure expands in the country, there is an increasing threat to business and communication.    Recent several cyber attacks on government websites in Ghana is a wake-up call for the development of a cyber security policy and strategy. Resolutions of cyber incidences have been uncoordinated and in many cases, there were no reporting structure put in place to guide in dealing with future attacks.   The National Information Technology Agency (NITA)’s concern of ensuring security of the government network initiated discussion amongst stakeholder in the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to setup a NITA Computer Emergency Response team (nitaCERT) to coordinate cyber incidences and assist in resolving future incidences within the government network.     15 | P a g e     N a t i o n a l  C y b e r  S e c u r i t y  P o l i c y  &  S t r a t e g y        The Ministry of Communication initiated the  national Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) project in 2013 in collaboration with the ITU-IMPACT. The national CERT was established in August 2014 is fully operational handling incidents and sending out early warning to its constituents. The National Security Council and many other institutions such as Ghanaian Academic and Research Network (GARNET) in academia are working on different projects towards securing cyberspace.    The SIM registration by NCA is another initiative to mitigate cyber crimes committed using mobile phones. The Ghana Police Service has also put in place the cybercrime Unit to alleviate cyber and other related crimes. The Economic and Organized Crime Office (EOCO) under the Attorney General’s Department and Financial Intelligence Center for the financial sector are all government initiatives geared towards mitigating crime in general and computer crime in particular.  On the business side, the opening of an e-Crime Bureau in Ghana has greatly helped organizations investigate cyber crime thoroughly and improve protection of cyber space.   In spite all these initiatives, the fact still remains that there is a general lack of education on cyber security amongst the consuming public of ICT products and services which needs to be addressed.     II. II. II. II. NEED FOR POLICYNEED FOR POLICYNEED FOR POLICYNEED FOR POLICY    As Ghana strives to become an information and knowledge economy, there is an increased emphasis on informational activities and the information industry.  Businesses will compete on information and computer systems will work efficiently on the right     16 | P a g e     N a t i o n a l  C y b e r  S e c u r i t y  P o l i c y  &  S t r a t e g y       information to produce the output required. It is becoming extremely necessary for nations to protect critical national information infrastructure to ensure national security in the wake of recent cyber wars, and ensure a safe cyber space to enable wealth creation for citizens. As networked computer infrastructure increases, there will be an increase in attacks on critical information infrastructure that is required to sustain the economy of the information and knowledge society. There is therefore an increasing need to protect critical national information infrastructure (CNII) and create a robust incidence response system when any attack is made on the CNII, to avoid loss of revenue due to down time and ensure national security.  The need to create a security culture by creating awareness of the enormous threats that users, especially children, of the Internet are exposed to must be addressed by a national cyber security policy.  Awareness creation (education) of the risks users of the Internet  are exposed and the vulnerabilities on our phones, computers and PDAs to can drastically reduce cyber incidences with its consequential loss of revenue when business are involved. This will create a very conducive environment in the information economy where Ghanaians can create wealth in peace without fear of harassment by cyber criminal and fraudsters.   Government business can be brought to a halt if the NITA infrastructure is attacked. In the same way, many businesses may grind to a halt if the infrastructure of ISPs and other public Internet and phone services are attacked.  There is therefore the need to develop technical capacity of local technocrats to enable them manage the cyber security risks to government and private sector critical information infrastructure.  In order to share knowledge on incidence response and ensure that there is a uniform risk management of all critical information infrastructures (both public and private), the policy     17 | P a g e     N a t i o n a l  C y b e r  S e c u r i t y  P o l i c y  &  S t r a t e g y       must address the need for a central coordinating body and work with a public private partnership model.  III. RELEVANT PROVISION – ICT4AD Pillar 14 of the ICT4AD policy relates to Security Agencies using ICT to combat cybercrime. The pillar among other things places emphasis on capacity building, international cooperation and building infrastructure for security agencies to enable them use ICT to combat crime.  Additionally, the pillar is to ensure that the legal text of the policy is up to date to help law enforcement agencies prosecute any cyber crime offenders. The Electronic Transaction Act (ETA) 2008 has specific legislation on cyber crime and prescribes punishment for cyber crime perpetuators. The Act addresses issues on the fight against cyber crime.  The Data Protection Act which has been passed by the Parliament of Ghana ensures protection of private data of government, citizens and businesses in Ghana. The Pillar 14 and the ETA fail to capture a holistic approach to securing the cyber space as a means of mitigating cyber incidences that may affect the ability of citizens to create wealth.  The several on-going initiatives which are not coordinated makes it impossible to know what different agencies of Government, academia and business are doing to enhance cyber security. A National Cyber Security framework covering policy and implementation strategy done holistically will ensure coordination and greatly enhance the national cyber security of Ghana.      18 | P a g e     N a t i o n a l  C y b e r  S e c u r i t y  P o l i c y  &  S t r a t e g y                     b.

This is informed by the fact that a people with a culture of cyber security achieved through awareness creation and capacity building are in a better position to handle cyber attacks as and when they occur. Our ability to identify and understand threats and how they can be handled reduces the number of actual attacks significantly and enhances the continuous operation of the national infrastructure on which critical information are held in the interest and security of the nation. We also recognize that the threat is not restricted only to government but also to operators who provide public services to citizens and private networks, thus the need for private public partnership.   DEFINITIONS For the purpose of this policy document, Critical National Information Infrastructure (CNII)Critical National Information Infrastructure (CNII)Critical National Information Infrastructure (CNII)Critical National Information Infrastructure (CNII) may be defined as those assets (real and virtual), systems and functions that are vital to the nations that their incapacity or destruction would have a devastating impact on:  • National economic strengthNational economic strengthNational economic strengthNational economic strength    Confidence that the nation's key growth area can successfully compete in global market while maintaining favorable standards of living.       20 | P a g e     N a t i o n a l  C y b e r  S e c u r i t y  P o l i c y  &  S t r a t e g y       • National imageNational imageNational imageNational image Projection of national image towards enhancing stature and sphere of influence.     • National defense and securityNational defense and securityNational defense and securityNational defense and security Guarantee sovereignty and independence whilst maintaining internal security.     • Government capability to functGovernment capability to functGovernment capability to functGovernment capability to functionsionsionsions Maintain order to perform and deliver minimum essential public services.     • Public health and safetyPublic health and safetyPublic health and safetyPublic health and safety Delivering and managing optimal health care to the citizen.

Food and Agriculture  VISION A secure and stable connected Ghana with Internet users working and creating wealth in a safe cyber space, with a well-researched and trained academic and professional community protecting Ghana’s cyber space equipped with global standards and responding swiftly to cyber incidents, and with up-to-date laws and systems in place to efficiently prosecute cyber criminals.   MISSION STATEMENT  To identify, analyze, address and remediate the immediate and potential cyber security threats posed on identified critical national information infrastructures (CNIIs) and put measures in place that will adequately regulate and secure the system infrastructures and meet the countries cyber security needs.  POLICY SCOPE  This policy covers all aspect of cyber security and national response including fight against cyber crime, creating public awareness, investment in education, scientific research, and development of cyber laws and legal measures, national security, , law enforcement and protection of critical national information infrastructures. (We can rephrase sentence)                  22 | P a g e     N a t i o n a l  C y b e r  S e c u r i t y  P o l i c y  &  S t r a t e g y       POLICY CONTEXT  Ghana, like many developing economies faces the risk of cyber-attacks. Different uncoordinated initiatives are being put in place to secure the cyber space of Ghana. Many custodians of critical national information infrastructure are unaware of their roles in ensuring the maintenance of cyber security within the country.  The driving force behind the national policy is the realization that a combination of persistent computer vulnerabilities and worldwide connectivity has placed the national critical information infrastructures at risks.   In Africa, Governments are discussing how to secure their cyberspace in the wake of heightened threats to national information infrastructure.  Several national initiatives are taking place to ensure that legal systems are updated to enable proper persecution of cyber criminals.   The threat that cyber-attacks pose to African governments has prompted the African Union Commission to develop a convention at the regional level to harmonize the efforts of African countries in fighting cybercrime and ensuring cyber security.   The cyber security policy will address major cyber risks facing Ghana from attacks on the national information infrastructure. The policy seeks to address the lack of awareness of risks users and businesses face doing business in cyber space. The problem of “Sakawa” which has tagged as a haven of cyber fraudsters will be addressed by the policy. The policy also addresses the need to develop knowledge base, systems and technology framework for combating cyber-attacks and capacity building for cyber security expects to make Ghana self–sufficient in the fight against cybercrime and in the near future create a culture of cyber security in Ghana.     23 | P a g e     N a t i o n a l  C y b e r  S e c u r i t y  P o l i c y  &  S t r a t e g y       The National Cyber Security Policy (NCSP) seeks to address the risks to the Critical National Information Infrastructure (CNII)    which comprises the networked information systems of ten critical sectors. The policy recognizes the critical and highly interdependent nature of the CNII and aims to develop and establish a comprehensive program and a series of frameworks that will ensure the effectiveness of cyber security controls over vital assets. It is being developed to ensure that the CNII are protected to a level that commensurate the risks faced. The policy has been designed to facilitate Ghana’s move towards a knowledge-based economy and will be based on a number of frameworks that comprises legislation and regulatory, technology, public-private cooperation, institutional, and international aspects.          24 | P a g e     N a t i o n a l  C y b e r  S e c u r i t y  P o l i c y  &  S t r a t e g y        I. POLICY STATEMENT  Effective Governance     Government will centralize coordination of national cyber security initiatives and promote effective cooperation between public and private sectors. In order to sustain the gains from any initiatives, government will establish formal and encourage informal information sharing exchanges.  Legislative & Regulatory Framework  Government through the Attorney General’s department set up a periodic process of reviewing and enhancing Ghana’s laws relating to cyber space to address the dynamic nature of cyber security threats. In order to empower national law enforcement agencies to properly prosecute cyber security crimes, Government will establish progressive capacity building programs to acquire new skills and effective ways of enforcing cyber laws. Government will ensure that all applicable local legislation is complementary to and in harmony with international laws, treaties and conventions.      Cyber Security Technology Framework  Policy measures will be put in place to develop a national cyber security technology framework that specifies cyber security requirement controls and baselines for CNII     25 | P a g e     N a t i o n a l  C y b e r  S e c u r i t y  P o l i c y  &  S t r a t e g y       elements. This will be accompanied will mechanism to implement an evaluation/certification program for cyber security product and systems.    Culture of security and Capacity Building     Government will invest every resource needed to develop, foster and maintain a national culture of security. As part of the process of development of culture of cyber security, government will support the standardization and coordination of cyber security awareness and education programmes across all elements of the CNII. Government will also:  • Establish an effective mechanism for cyber security knowledge dissemination at the national level  • Identify minimum requirements and qualifications for information security professionals   Research & Development towards Self-Reliance In order for Ghana to become self-reliant in protecting the CNII to a level that is commensurate with the risk, Government will formalize the coordination and prioritization of cyber security research and development activities enlarge and strengthen the cyber security research community. Research and development will be encouraged by promoting the development and commercialization of intellectual properties, technologies and innovations through focused research and development. Government will also put measures in place to nurture the growth of cyber security industry.     26 | P a g e     N a t i o n a l  C y b e r  S e c u r i t y  P o l i c y  &  S t r a t e g y       Compliance and Enforcement  In order to ensure compliance and enforcement, policy measures and mechanism will be put in place to standardize cyber security systems across all elements of the CNII. Government will also strengthen the monitoring and enforcement of standards and develop a standard cyber security risk Management Framework.  Child Online Protection  Policy measures will be implemented through multi-stakeholder working by government industry, Civil Society, and relevant international child online protection agencies.  Government will encourage dialogue at national and local levels to engage all concerned and create awareness of the possibilities and dangers of the Internet.   Cyber Security Emergency Readiness  To ensure cyber security emergency readiness, government together with all stakeholders will develop effective cyber security incident reporting mechanisms. This will include the development and strengthening of the national computer security incidence response team (CSIRT) and sector CSIRTs, dissemination of vulnerability advisories and threat warnings in a timely manner and the development of a standard business continuity management framework. The government will also encourage all elements of the CNII to monitor cyber security events and perform periodic vulnerability assessment programs.      27 | P a g e     N a t i o n a l  C y b e r  S e c u r i t y  P o l i c y  &  S t r a t e g y                International Cooperation  Policy measures will be put in place to encourage the active participation of Ghana in all relevant international cyber security bodies, panels and multi-national agencies. Government will make every effort to promote active participation in all relevant international cyber security activities by hosting an annual international cyber security conference.        28 | P a g e     N a t i o n a l  C y b e r  S e c u r i t y  P o l i c y  &  S t r a t e g y                                                  c.

delight that my Government presents to the people of Brazil the National Defense White Paper, a transparency milestone in defense issues, which will allow our citizens to become acquainted with the deeds of the State in this area, as well as the Defense challenges of the country over the forthcoming decades. Civilian engagement is crucial to building a sovereign and democratic Brazil. The White Paper broadens the options of society as a whole to stay abreast of military affairs while conveying the potential and needs of our Defense to the public debate. The publication of this White Paper represents one step further in the consolidation process of civilian leadership and in making Defense matters public knowledge. It adds to the creation of the Defense Ministry and, more recently, to the establishment of the Armed Forces Joint Staff, its subordinate institution, as another significant symbol of institutional progress in the Defense field. The National Defense White Paper is one more outcome of the democratic development of Brazil. The rise of Brazil’s international status in the XXI century is already a reality. A fully developed country with increasing external presence will require a proper dissuasive military capacity. Committed to building a more peaceful and prosperous global order, Brazil cannot neglect Defense. Brazil proved, in the last decade, that growth and social inclusion should mutually reinforce each other. We must protect our abundant treasures that, in addition to industry, agriculture, minerals or pre-salt, are composed of millions of Brazilians who have the power to transform us into a great nation. For all these reasons, Defense will be increasingly present in the national agenda. The National Defense White Paper is an invitation for reflection and dialogue, its reading will show, above all, that Defense and Democracy form a virtuous cycle in the new Brazil that we are building. By enabling a comprehensive and thorough monitoring of our Defense Policy by society, this initiative contributes to the maturing of public reflection on the vital role of Defense in Brazil today and in the future. Dilma Rousseff mESSaGE FrOm THE PrESIDENT OF THE rEPuBLIC Complimentary Law 97 of 1999, amended by Complimentary Law 136 of 2010, establishes, in its 9th Article, third paragraph, the obligation of the Executive Branch to submit to Congress, in the first half of the regular legislative session of 2012, the first version of the National Defense White Paper. The National Defense White Paper adds to the National Defense Strategy and to the National Defense Policy as an enlightening document about defense related activities in Brazil. The expectation is that the White Paper will encourage the debate about defense topics within Congress, the federal bureaucracy, academia and the Brazilian society at large. It will also serve as a mechanism of accountability to society about the compatibility between the existing Defense structure and the goals set by the Government. The Armed Forces have the capacity to project military power beyond our borders. Such possibility, in itself, may generate insecurity in neighboring nations. The wide disclosure of the National Defense White Paper, and the clear way its chapters seek to express the defense objectives of the Brazilian state, represent mutual trust-building measures. By sharing national perceptions and interests concerning the defense field, Brazil seeks to ensure understanding of the motivations and aims of the military instrument. History records several cases of conflict resulting from miscommunication and misconceptions of others’ intentions. Hence, it is important that states adopt initiatives such as this to communicate their intentions effectively, provide transparency to defense policies and mitigate the risk of unwanted conflicts. The National Defense White Paper has been produced with the purpose of strengthening cooperation with South American countries. On this regard, it can be an instrument to foster the establishment of a peaceful and secure community in the region of South America, enabling the choice for peaceful solutions and the consequent elimination of war. Beyond this effort, we seek to demonstrate to countries outside the region that our defense has, essentially, a dissuasive spirit and it is structured to prevent threats against Brazil. We have striven to substantiate the view that defense is not delegable and we must be prepared to fight against any aggression. mESSaGE FrOm THE mINISTEr OF DEFENSE At present, topics related to National Defense should engage Brazilian society as a whole. Since the development of the National Defense Strategy, relating public policies must be defined jointly. By incorporating in its essence the idea that decisions concerning peace and war are not detached from popular sovereignty, the White Paper will allow a democratic approach to defense issues. The Defense Policy meets the interests of both society and state. The endeavor of creating and reviewing legal documents concerning national defense, including the Defense White Paper, shall contribute to tightening this bond even further. The White Paper represents a useful means for civilian leaders to deepen their understanding of the present and future of National Defense. At this time, when changes in the global strategic scenario are so fast and deep, the dialogue among different sectors gains greater relevance. The task of preparing the White Paper has not been developed within the offices of the Defense Ministry. We sought society’s participation in the reflection and debate of the themes herein. The implementation of thematic workshops, seminars and roundtables held with civilian and military representatives, Brazilians and foreigners took the discussion on defense matters to the five regions of the country. Such contributions were most valuable; hence I would like to express our most sincere appreciation to those who have engaged in these discussions. In addition to bringing internal and external transparency to the criteria of how our Armed Forces are used, the preparation of this document is relevant for the deepening of society’s pool of knowledge on the military field. I hope this initiative serves also as an invitation to engagement on National Defense related discussions. Only with close monitoring by society and with its essential contribution, will the National Defense Policy rise to the ever stronger, fairer and more democratic country we wish to build.

It has the world’s longest Atlantic coast and, with almost 191 million inhabitants1, the planet’s fifth largest population2. It is a great producer of renewable and non-renewable energy, from animal and vegetal protein. It owns large potable water reserves, huge biodiversity and vast mineral resources. The recent discoveries of pre-salt layer oilfields have raised the country to a new level in oil and natural gas reserves and production. Rated as the world’s sixth largest world economy by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)3, Brazil has increasingly reached expressive levels of development, while striving to eradicate poverty and reduce social inequality. Brazilian democracy is consolidated, free elections are a current procedure, there is growing public interest in the preparation and demand for public policies, and there is a commitment to fighting corruption and respecting human rights. Over the last years, Brazilian foreign policy has projected values and interests within the framework of global governance. Brazil has developed its own foreign agenda with greater autonomy to define priorities for its progress as a nation. This heritage requires defense. Brazil considers itself a friend of peace and is considered as such internationally, but it cannot do without its dissuasive military capacity and preparation for defense against foreign threats. It is not possible to assert that cooperation shall always prevail over conflict in the international arena. This chapter shall introduce some elements of the Brazilian state, which have immediate implications for National Defense. 1 IBGE — 2010 Census. 2 United Nations Population Fund — Report on World Population Situation 2011. 3 World Economic Outlook. 2012. THE BRAZILIAN STATE AND NATIONAL DEFENSE DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 1 — T H E B R A Z IL IA N S TA T E A N D N A T IO N A L D E F E N S E C H A P T E R 1 — T H E B R A Z IL IA N S TA T E A N D N A T IO N A L D E F E N S E 16 Basic Principles of State Brazil is a Federative Republic with a presidential system. The separation of powers — Executive, Legislative and Judicial — is, within the Brazilian legal system, a fundamental and necessary principle for the promotion of the common good. For this reason, the separation is based on the balance among the three Branches and their reciprocal and conscious collaboration and control. The Brazilian Federation is formed by the indissoluble union of states, the Federal District and the municipalities. Such federative entities have political autonomy, allowing them to make their own laws, to elect their political leaders and to manage their own resources, according to the separation of powers provided for in the Federal Constitution. As a democratic state observant of the rule of law, the country stands on constitutional principles, which are: sovereignty, citizenship, human dignity, labor rights, free enterprise, and political pluralism. Democratic values permeate all constitutional guarantees of the Brazilian state. Among such guarantees, human dignity serves as the basis for the Nation’s own existence, and is, simultaneously, the permanent purpose of all its activities. The state’s objectives, outlined in the 3rd Article of the Federal Constitution, reinforce the country’s political choice for the construction of a free, fair and just society, the promotion of national development, the eradication of poverty and social exclusion, the reduction of social and regional inequality and the promotion of the common good, without discrimination. In the international arena, Brazil acts in accordance to the principles established in the 4th Article of the Federal Constitution: national independence, preservation of human rights, self-determination of nations, non-intervention, equality among the states, defense of peace, peaceful settlement of conflicts, repudiation of terrorism and racism, cooperation among nations for the progress of mankind, and granting of political asylum. Brazilian foreign policy considers international dialogue and cooperation as essential instruments to overcome obstacles and to build confidence among states. With regards to other countries, Brazil gives priority to its immediate neighbors in South America, the South Atlantic region and Africa’s western coast. 17 C H A P T E R 1 — T H E B R A Z IL IA N S TA T E A N D N A T IO N A L D E F E N S E C H A P T E R 1 — T H E B R A Z IL IA N S TA T E A N D N A T IO N A L D E F E N S E DEFENSE WHITE PAPER Maritime Area Is constituted by both inland waters and maritime areas, where Brazil exerts some degree of jurisdiction over activities; persons, installations, ships and natural resources (alive or otherwise). The term applies to waters in the seabed and below the sea floor. It refers to waters that are subject to Brazilian control and inspection, within the limits set by international and national law. Such maritime spaces are comprised of a 200 nautical miles strip (one mile equivalent to approximately 1.85 km).

Map of South America and Africa Territory Located in South America, the Brazilian territory consists of approximately 8.5 million square kilometers of land and 4.5 million square kilometers of sea area. Brazil has frontiers with 9 other South- American countries and one of France’s oversea territories, which represent an extension of almost 17 thousand kilometers, approximately 12 thousand of which refer to the Legal Amazon border. The Brazilian seacoast stretches for nearly 7.4 thousand kilometers. Important navigation routes, vital for the national economy, cross Brazilian waters along the Atlantic Ocean. Located in this region, are the Brazilian pre- salt petroleum reserves, which are of great economic, political and strategic importance.

The territory is also subject to deep affection and sentiments of belonging. The definition of borders, through treaties and arbitration, was vital for the strengthening of diplomatic relations between Brazil and other South America countries. It contributed to the principle of peaceful solution of disputes among states. The vast area occupied by the national territory, cut by the Equator and the Tropic of Capricorn, comprises a wide variety of climates, landscapes and vegetation. Five great regions, with their own characteristics, form the national territory: North, Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and South. 19 C H A P T E R 1 — T H E B R A Z IL IA N S TA T E A N D N A T IO N A L D E F E N S E C H A P T E R 1 — T H E B R A Z IL IA N S TA T E A N D N A T IO N A L D E F E N S E DEFENSE WHITE PAPER Aquifers Guarani and Alter do Chão (Amazon) The Guarani Aquifer is one of the world’s largest underground fresh water reservoirs, 70% of it is located in Brazilian territory (840 thousand km2). With an estimated capacity of 45 thousand km3 of underground water, it is an important source of fresh water and for the development of economic activities. The Alter do Chão Aquifer, located under the world’s largest hydrographic basin (river Amazonas), extends under Brazilian ground with an estimate potential volume of 86 thousand km3. The Northern region makes up more than half of the national territory and its main features, among others, are its low population density and the length of its frontier. The Northeast is the third most densely populated geographical region, largely concentrated along the coastline, where main urban centers are located. The Midwest, the second largest region, also presents low population density. It has a border line of nearly 2 thousand kilometers long. The Southeast is the most densely populated, urbanized and developed region of the country and includes the largest population centers. The South region is the smallest in land area. It shares borders with nations of the River Plate. It also has a high level of urbanization and demographic density. The Amazon is one of the areas of highest interest to the Ministry of Defense. The Pan- Amazon, which is constituted by the entire Amazon forest in South America, consists of approximately 40% of the South American continental area and holds 20% of the world’s fresh water reserves. The largest area of the Pan-Amazon belongs to Brazil — around 70%. Brazil defends its unconditional sovereignty over the Brazilian Amazon, which comprises over 4 million square kilometers, shelters all kind of mineral reserves and the planet’s largest biodiversity. Brazil’s cooperation with other countries holding territory in the Pan-Amazon is essential for the preservation of this natural treasure. The “borderland”4 concept was adopted by Brazil, through the 1988 Federal Constitution and by law. Although this concept was initially linked to the area of National Defense, the concern with the consolidation and the gradual Brazilian presence in this borderland reflects the priority given by the state to sustainable development, national integration and cooperation with bordering countries in matters related to security and the fight against transnational contraband. 4 Federal Constitution Art. 20 § 2: “The strip up to one hundred and fifty kilometers width, alongside the terrestrial boundaries, designated as boundary zone, considered essential to the defense of the national territory and its occupation and utilization, shall be regulated by law.” DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 1 — T H E B R A Z IL IA N S TA T E A N D N A T IO N A L D E F E N S E C H A P T E R 1 — T H E B R A Z IL IA N S TA T E A N D N A T IO N A L D E F E N S E 20 Brazil’s Physical Map Source: IBGE.

The country has 12 large hydrographic basins. The four main basins are: to the north, the Amazon; in the center, the Araguaia-Tocantins and São Francisco; and, to the south, the sub-basins Parana, Paraguay and Uruguay, which form the Prata basin. There is a great potential for articulated actions that may facilitate intermodal transportation such as inland occupation and national integration, which directly affects South American Integration. The Brazilian oceanic coast has two clear segments: the segment extending from Cape São Roque5, in the Northeast, to the river Chui, in the South; and the segment from Cape São Roque to the river Oiapoque, in the North. The first segment links the country both physically and economically to the South Atlantic. In this region are located the most populated territory strip and the main national ports — Santos, Rio de Janeiro, Paranaguá, 5 Cape of São Roque is located in the municipality of Maxaranguape, 51 km from Natal, capital of the Brazilian State of Rio Grande do Norte. 21 C H A P T E R 1 — T H E B R A Z IL IA N S TA T E A N D N A T IO N A L D E F E N S E C H A P T E R 1 — T H E B R A Z IL IA N S TA T E A N D N A T IO N A L D E F E N S E DEFENSE WHITE PAPER Recife (Suape), Salvador and Vitoria — through which flow the largest part of foreign trade. This maritime segment is essential for political and economic ties with South Cone nations. An eastbound course leads to Western African countries, and there the Cape route stands out as a considerable strategic communication path from Asia and Africa to the North Hemisphere. The segment leading from Cape São Roque and the Oiapoque River projects Brazil to the northern part of Africa, to Western Europe, the Panama Canal, the Caribbean as well as Central and North Americas. Considering the abovementioned maritime segments and projections, it may be affirmed that Brazil’s strong link to the sea is substantial, from both political and economic perspectives. This has induced the country to exert a natural influence over the South Atlantic. The strong dependence on maritime traffic for foreign trade constitutes a relevant challenge to defense. The South Atlantic region over which Brazil has territorial rights and other exploration and control prerogatives is the country’s jurisdictional waters. These waters have recently been named the Blue Amazon, and are roughly equal, in geographic area, to the Brazilian Green Amazon. Oil reserves in deep water and ultra-deep water, so important for the country’s development, can be found under this region. Hence, the need to intensify monitoring and control of maritime traffic and of incidents in areas that are subject to Brazilian authority. Population Brazilian society is composed of a population with diverse geographic and ethnic origins. Since the colonial period, relations among American Indians, Europeans and African individuals have produced a mixed population. In the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, Brazil received new migration flows from several origins. During the 20th century, intense internal migration took place, following a growing urban and industrialization process. Such internal migration is associated with socioeconomic factors and policies of territorial occupation. Economic booms established areas particularly attractive for migrants in different regions. Subsequently, the industrialization process transformed the Southeast region into the main destination for migration. However, according to the 2010 census, the intensity of migration towards the great cities of the Southeast has decreased due, mainly, to the decentralization of industrial activity. Presently, one may observe the rise of business and job clusters in several regions. Thus, a new migration flow has resulted. DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 1 — T H E B R A Z IL IA N S TA T E A N D N A T IO N A L D E F E N S E C H A P T E R 1 — T H E B R A Z IL IA N S TA T E A N D N A T IO N A L D E F E N S E 22 Brasilia The main offices of the Federal Executive Branch (the Planalto Palace); of the Federal Legislative Branch (the National Congress), and of the Judicial Branch (the Federal Supreme Court) are located in Brasilia, the capital of Brazil. In 1957, the construction of the city took place in Brazil’s Central Plateau, in order to achieve a policy set by the 1891 Constitution, which sought national integration and the development of the interior. The new capital was inaugurated on the 21st of April, 1960. It was based on an urban plan by Lucio Costa and architectural projects by Oscar Niemeyer. Due to its architectural value, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) declared it a world heritage site. The Planalto Palace Parallel to such migration flows, the state set incentives for the occupation of less populated areas, with the objective of promoting national integration. The so-called “March to the West”, for instance, was a movement created by the first Administration of President Getulio Vargas (1930-1945) to foster the occupation of the Midwest. The subsequent transference of the country’s capital in the 1960’s to this region became a milestone in territorial occupation. The occupation of the Brazilian Northern region was propelled by a rubber extraction industry in the end of the 19th century. Miscegenation — of Portuguese, Indian and African heritages — and the harmonious interaction of several cultures have been responsible for Brazil’s particular and original identity. The Brazilian official language, Portuguese, is one of the main pillars of national identity and a means for the expansion of culture and traditions. Music, arts literature and sport also contribute to the building of national identity. Such elements embrace local characteristics, sayings and local knowledge, thus contributing to the development of a specific and diversified culture. 23 C H A P T E R 1 — T H E B R A Z IL IA N S TA T E A N D N A T IO N A L D E F E N S E C H A P T E R 1 — T H E B R A Z IL IA N S TA T E A N D N A T IO N A L D E F E N S E DEFENSE WHITE PAPER NATIONAL SYMBOLS Pursuant to Art. 13 of the Federal Constitution, the four official emblems of the Federative Republic of Brazil are: the national flag, the national anthem, the Republic’s coat of arms and the national seal. Emblems are graphic and musical manifestations of important historical value, designed to transmit the sentiments of national union and sovereignty. After the Republic was proclaimed on November 15, 1889, a new flag was created to represent the country’s achievements and historic moment. Inspired by the imperial flag, the new flag was designed by Jean Baptiste Debret (a French painter), Teixeira Mendes, Miguel Lemosand and Decio Vilares. It was approved by Decree No 4 of the Republic’s provisional government. The new flag kept the tradition of the yellow diamond on a green field, but introduced the blue sphere spotted with stars and a white slanting strip, descending from left to right, with the motto “Order and Progress”. The stars, including the Southern Cross constellation, represent each one of the Brazilian states. Pursuant to Law No 8,421, of May 11, 1992, should a state be created or removed, the group of stars must be updated. The Brazilian national anthem lyrics were written by Joaquim Osório Duque Estrada (1870-1927), a poet and journalist; and the music composed by Francisco Manuel da Silva (1795-1865), a conductor and professor. The anthem is regulated by Law No 5,700 of September 1st, 1971. National Flag National Anthem Engineer Artur Zauer, by order of President Deodoro da Fonseca, designed the Brazilian Coat of Arms. It is a sky blue shield, supported on a five-pointed star, with an upraised sword. Around it, there is a wreath made by a fructified coffee branch and a tobacco branch set over a golden radiance. The use of the coat of arms is mandatory for the Executive, Legislative and Judicial Branches, and it figures in all public buildings. The national seal of Brazil is based on the sphere of the national flag. Inside it there is a circle reading Federative Republic of Brazil. It is used to certify government acts, diplomas and certificates issued by official or certified schools.

In the 2010 census, according to the Brazilian National Geographic and Statistics Institute (IBGE), almost 191 million people were counted. The Brazilian population has practically multiplied ten times during the 20th century, demonstrating intense growth, which has transformed the country into the world’s fifth most populated. During the greater part of the second half of the 20th century, a time when population growth was most intense, Brazil’s demographic pyramid was characterized by a base enlargement and significant narrowing at the top, indicating a large economically dependent young population. The current configuration of the pyramid indicates the decrease of an economically dependent population, which, in practical terms, means that Brazil now lives the so- called “demographic bonus” or “window of opportunity”. It is a demographic transition 25 C H A P T E R 1 — T H E B R A Z IL IA N S TA T E A N D N A T IO N A L D E F E N S E C H A P T E R 1 — T H E B R A Z IL IA N S TA T E A N D N A T IO N A L D E F E N S E DEFENSE WHITE PAPER +100 95-99 90-94 85-89 80-84 75-79 70-74 65-69 60-64 55-59 50-54 45-49 40-44 35-39 30-34 25-29 20-24 15-19 10-14 5-9 0-4 20 15 10 5 5 10 15 20 20302007 Million Million years (age) Brazil’s Age Pyramid 2007 and 2030 Source: IBGE and United Nations. period where fecundity is at lower levels; the population does not show expressive aging, and, simultaneously, presents an increase in the economically active segment of society. Therefore, Brazil is now in a privileged situation to benefit from the opportunities produced by change in the international environment. Education is the basic pillar for the construction of a more fair, developed and fraternal society, where citizenship may be fully practiced. In accordance with guidelines provided in Article 205 of the Federal Constitution6, the country has invested significantly in educational projects that allow the Brazilian citizen to take a more critical stance facing the challenges of the 21st century. The situation of Brazil’s education has shown significant improvement in the last decades: there was a major fall in the illiteracy rate, and a steady increase in high school education and school attendance7. In this new century, a new social, political and economic environment has shown that proficiency in education is fundamental for the development of the country. 6 Art. 205 of the Federal Constitution states that: “Education, which is the right of all and duty of the state and of the family shall be promoted and fostered with the cooperation of society, with a view to the full development of the person, his preparation for the exercise of citizenship and his qualification for work.” 7 IBGE — Synthesis of Social Indicators 2002 and, Ministry of Education, School Census 2010.

It is the state’s duty to ensure that the nation does not face the risk of foreign aggression, or that it is exposed to political pressures or unbearable economic sanctions, and is free to care for its own development and progress. Brazil exercises complete and exclusive sovereignty8 over its land mass, its waters and overlying airspace, with no foreign interference whatsoever accepted in its decision making process. The Brazilian state works to increase confidence and understanding among the states in order to contribute to the prevention of conflicts that may intensify threats to National Security. National Defense, as defined in the National Defense Policy is the “set of state measures and actions, especially within the military field, to ensure the defense of the territory, sovereignty and national interests, mainly against foreign threats, potential or manifest”. 8 Sovereignty is the first fundamental principle stated in Art. 1 of the Brazilian Federal Constitution. Sovereignty is inalienable, indivisible, and imprescriptible. It must be exercised by general will and be preserved on behalf of the future generations and the country’s prosperity. It is a supreme order, not to be prevailed. 27 C H A P T E R 1 — T H E B R A Z IL IA N S TA T E A N D N A T IO N A L D E F E N S E C H A P T E R 1 — T H E B R A Z IL IA N S TA T E A N D N A T IO N A L D E F E N S E DEFENSE WHITE PAPER The Army in defense of the Amazon The Defense Policy established the following objectives: I. guarantee sovereignty, national treasures and territorial integrity; II. defend national interests, including Brazilian citizens assets and resources abroad; III. contribute to national cohesion; IV. contribute to regional stability; V. contribute to international peace and security; VI. intensify Brazil’s projection in the community of nations and increase its participation in international decisions; VII. maintain Armed Forces that are modern, joint, well trained, balanced, increasingly professional and adequately deployed throughout the national territory; VIII. raise awareness among the Brazilian people about the importance of defense matters for the country; IX. develop an Defense Industrial Base, to ensure autonomy in vital technologies; X. structure the Armed Forces around capabilities, providing them with personnel and material in accordance with strategic and operational planning; and XI. develop the potential for defense logistics and national mobilization.

The guidelines provided in the Strategy aim to develop the capabilities of the Armed Forces, in order to ensure national security, during peace and crisis. A purpose of the Strategy is to support the Armed Forces’ equipment needs, by favoring national expertise of state-of-the- art technologies and more technological independence. A proper Defense structure ensures greater stability for the country and, thus, a favorable environment for the Brazilian state to reach its national objectives, established in the 3rd Article of the Federal Constitution: build a free, just and supportive society; guarantee national development; eradicate poverty and social exclusion and reduce social and regional inequalities; promote the common good, without prejudice of origin, race, sex, color, age and any other form of discrimination.

Goal 2 — Oversee and protect the entire Brazilian airspace with aerospace resources that are compatible with National Defense needs. Goal 3 — Participate in peace operations and humanitarian actions which are of interest to the country, in compliance with United Nations Organization (UN) mandate and that are compatible with the geopolitical stature of the country. Goal 4 — Increase naval power to fully meet the tasks of controlling maritime areas, denying use of the sea and projecting power over land. Goal 5 — Oversee and protect the Brazilian territory, properly deploying the Land Force, with special emphasis on the country’s Amazon and Midwest regions.

This dynamic carries hope, but also brings new and formidable responsibilities, which the Armed Forces will know how to fulfill” President Dilma Rousseff Brasilia, April 5, 2011 The contemporary international system is marked by the exhaustion of the order which characterized the immediate period after the Cold War. This system has distinguished itself through a rapid process of reorganization of political relations between states. The advent of a multipolar order, marked by the coexistence of traditional and emerging powers, brings new opportunities and new challenges to nations in the area of defense. Although dialogue, cooperation, emphasis on multilateralism and respect for international law remain important and desirable qualities for the international environment, the rearrangement of the system on a multipolar basis is not, by itself, sufficient to guarantee that, in the current situation of transition, peaceful relations between states will prevail. In this context, Brazil sees, in its defense policy and in its calling for dialogue, essential components for its affirmative and cooperative insertion into the international environment. In face of uncertain future scenarios, the cost of inaction by Brazil in the construction of a new international order can be much larger than the immediate burden, i.e. investment in training, preparation and development of resources that are necessary for the exercise of sovereignty. The consolidation of representative multilateral governance structures of the new world order is of interest to the country and requires a strict coordination between foreign and defense policies. The second must provide the first with safeguards, support and logistics, which are essential for the fulfillment of Brazil’s role in the international arena. The defense policy determines the state’s capacity to offer protection to the Brazilian people and to ensure the absence of foreign interference in its territory and its jurisdictional waters, including the airspace above, the seabed and the subsoil. National sovereignty, economic competitiveness and full development demand a defense capacity that is compatible with the country’s potential and aspiration. In spite of fast growing changes in recent decades, the international order remains predominantly determined by relationships among states. For this reason, Brazil’s defense against external potential threats remains the Armed Forces’ essential mission. DEFENSE WHITE PAPER32 C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T New themes — or new approaches to traditional themes — became influential in the international environment in this century. The protection of sovereignty (an issue connected with the global challenge of drugs and related crimes); the protection of biodiversity, biopiracy, cyber defense; tensions derived from the increasing lack of resources, natural disasters, international crime, terrorism; and actions by unlawful armed groups all exemplify the growing interdisciplinary nature of security and defense issues. Considering this, Brazil acknowledges — in accordance with provisions in the Federal Constitution — the need for coordinated policies among different government agencies. Further challenges to the country include its ability to face so-called “future conflicts”, namely information warfare as well as small scale conflicts marked by uncertain origins and decentralized command and control structures that operate through social networks on the Internet. It is important to strengthen the country’s international relations. Sincere and open dialogue will contribute to foreign policy and to its interaction with defense policy, by building consensuses that foster ample and collective debate. The Brazilian society’s increased interest in defense issues, in the last few years, is a healthy tendency. The participation of several sectors of society in the national debate on defense enables a better assessment of such issues. An international scene marked by uncertainties has as much a direct influence on Brazilian foreign policy as on its defense policy. The phenomenon of globalization brought about the escalation of threats of different natures, like drug trafficking, weapons trafficking and maritime piracy, which tests the state’s ability. The aggravation of the international financial crisis also reveals possible damage to social, energy and environmental conditions, with evident effects on world peace and security. Brazil works for the construction of a participative and inclusive world community. The country commits itself to the promotion of “multipolar cooperation”, a term which summarizes the multipolar power structure consolidating worldwide. In this strategic environment, international action must excel in the consolidation of governance mechanisms that better represent this new international reality. Such mechanisms must ensure world peace and security for the good of mankind. The new power structure of the 21st century should not favor conflicting or excluding positions, inherited from the international orders that prevailed during the 20th century. 33DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T This political choice, however, cannot neglect the complexity of threats from the Post- Cold War period and uncertainties in the medium and long-term horizon. The country has been preparing for such realities since the National Defense Policy reformulation, in 2005, and the publication of the National Defense Strategy, in 2008, both revised in 2012. In South America, there has been a clear trend towards cooperation. This trend has been constantly strengthened since the establishment of the South American Nations Union (UNASUL) and, especially, its Council of Defense (CDS). A “Security Community”10, is blooming in South America, due to common historical experiences shared by neighbor countries, similar development challenges and democratic government systems, which enable mutual understanding and foster a peaceful accommodation of the different national interests. In sum, the Brazilian National Defense policy unites cooperative and dissuasive components. International crises may occur against the country’s will, and this demands an adequate level of readiness and modernization of the Armed Forces. In a global level, Brazil must have a capacity for defense that corresponds to its economic, political and strategic stature, in order to have its resources preserved, its voice heard, its position respected and its peaceful tradition safeguarded. Strategic Environment In the current composition of international centers of power, elements of unipolarity, such as the dominant military force in North America, coexist with elements of bipolarity, such as the economic interdependence between the United States of America and China, and of multipolarity, such as the financial G-20, the commercial G-20, the BRICS group, the IBAS Forum and the BASIC group11, among others. New and traditional global governance structures are coexisting. In this context new political 10 Concept presented by Karl W. Deutsch, at the end of the 50’s decade, in his classic work Political Community and the North Atlantic Area — International Organization in the Light of Historical Experience. According to Deutsch, a security community would rise from the relationships among states within the same region, as war would become an unthinkable solution to disputes among its members. 11 Financial G-20 — Group composed of: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom and United States of America, which form the G-8, and also Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, European Union, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey.

In the context of the strategic environment of this century, some scenarios may be noted: a) unipolarity: one nation dominant over the international system. Although unipolar reassertion cannot be dismissed, it is unlikely that any single force may be able to solely administer global phenomena, considering the structural crisis in the developed world and the growing presence of new actors; b) bipolarity or tripolarity: in this scenario, the competition and coordination between two or few powers will determine the actions of all other actors in the system. From a strategic viewpoint, it seems unlikely that this scenario, which occurred in the 20th century, will again determine the international system for the next decades; and c) multipolarity: represents the power structure which will probably mark the strategic environment in the next decades. The multipolar structure refers to the coexistence of several centers of power in the international system, each influencing the other’s actions. The balance of power checks the influence of nations with hegemonic intentions. In multipolarity, conflict and cooperation dynamics naturally coexist in relations among states. The multipolar structure, however, will be shaped by the prevailing dynamic. If conflict predominates over cooperation, multilateral coordination mechanisms would weaken. This is a scenario to be avoided. Should the reverse occur, however multilateral forums would be favored. In this new world order, Brazil must contribute with actions and opinions in favor of a multipolar and cooperative environment, in accordance with its historical defense of international law. 35DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T International System Brazil strives so that forums for multilateral consensus-building, especially those of the United Nations, become more representative of the new reality of the 21st century. The efficacy and legitimacy of decisions and policies adopted in these bodies will be greater, the more the UN express the interests of its member countries. The country’s claim, particularly regarding a comprehensive reform of the United Nations Security Council, refers to this inclusive project, which has motivated Brazilian foreign policy for decades. Since the 90s, the “securitization” of United Nations issues has become an important trend. This trend, mostly promoted by the permanent members of the Security Council, consists in bringing before the referred Council issues which actually should be dealt with in other UN bodies or in its specialized agencies. “Securitization” needs to be considered with caution. In specialized agencies – such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPQW) and the Convention for the Prohibition of Biological Weapons (CPBW) – the submission of a case to the Security Council should be limited to extreme situations. Regarding the UN Security Council, significant advances, reflecting a trend toward the strengthening of multilateralism, have not been observed, unlike what has been evidenced in other areas, such as the economic and financial dimensions. To assure the Council’s legitimacy and representativeness in issues related to international peace and security, its reform is urgent. The increasing force of multilateralism is also the result of the higher prominence of issues which require negotiated solutions among countries and also impact the security of nations, such as climate change, sustainable development and social inclusion. The notion that security and development are integrated has its roots in the ideals of the United Nations Charter. Brazil has actively participated in diplomatic efforts to find peaceful solutions to conflicts and to decrease tensions in the American continent and elsewhere. The most evident expression of Brazil’s growing importance in peace and security initiatives has is its role in peacekeeping operations. Such operations are the main tools available for the international community to deal with threat of conflict and to prevent post-conflict countries from returning to armed violence. Together with UN agencies, funds and programs, peacekeeping missions are an important expression of the Organization, since they represent the main legal and legitimate form of military action of the international community to guarantee collective security. DEFENSE WHITE PAPER36 C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T The three pillars of peacekeeping operations are: (i) the use of force only for self- defense or for defense of a mandate granted by the UN Security Council; (ii) impartiality; and (iii) consent of the main parties involved. As suggested in its name, UN peace missions are tools used by the Organization to preserve peace while it is threatened or to restore peace after a conflict. It is never an intervention in a military conflict favoring one side or another. Brazil understands that there are clear limits: peacekeeping missions should not seek to replace belligerent parties. The United Nations should help parties build conditions for peace and should do so in a strictly impartial way, in order to ensure legitimacy and greater political gains. UN peace missions offer parties a political and security environment, as well as the time they need to lay the foundations for an enduring peace. Currently, peacekeeping missions face important challenges. It is fundamental to guarantee the sustainability and success of their actions and to provide the necessary military resources and means for the fulfillment of their mandate. They must incorporate the commitment to sustain efforts, i.e. they must support the creation of political, institutional and socioeconomic bases for an enduring peace. A particularly important challenge is the protection of civilians in situations of conflict, a concept which must be improved to ensure that the use of force does not exceed United Nations Security Council mandates. In September 2011, during her opening speech at the UN General Assembly, President Dilma Rousseff coined the expression “responsibility while protecting”, which essentially refers to the following doctrine for the use of military force under UN aegis: “do not create more instability than that which is to be prevented or limited”. Brazil believes that peacekeeping operations must rely on four elements: security, strengthening of institutions, national reconciliation and development. Balance among these elements is a Brazilian priority in theoretical debates (which result in UN guidelines on the issue) and in practical terms when Brazilian forces are deployed in such missions. The actions undertaken by Brazil in peacekeeping missions have, whenever possible, emphasized the reconstruction of countries based on socially and economically sustainable foundations. Thus Brazil has sought, especially in the case of Haiti, to promote innovative programs for technical cooperation in areas such as food security, agriculture, professional education, health security and infrastructure. Brazil also intends to increase the participation of civilian professionals in these missions, in order to meet the growing demands for qualified personnel in public security, border control, the fight against drug trafficking, voting systems, penal systems and public administration among others. 37DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T Regional Systems South American integration remains a strategic objective for Brazilian foreign policy. The country acknowledges the deepening of political, social and economic relationships among South American countries as a fundamental element for social and economic development and for the preservation of peace in the region. Likewise, the consolidation of South American trade and the strengthening of governments’ ability to act in the international forums depend on the continuation of friendly relations among nations in the region. The South American region is little affected by conflicts among states. A peaceful regional environment has contributed, in the last decade, to economic growth in the continent. Brazil’s conciliatory position, for over 140 years, has contributed to the region’s stability. This legacy must be valued and preserved. Brazil’s stability and prosperity reinforce its security and produce positive effects on all South American nations. A country’s security is affected by the degree of instability in the region where it is located. Regional stability, therefore, is a national objective. Brazil considers it desirable that consensus, political harmony and convergence of action among South American countries prevails. This would make the region stronger and more coherent. This set of factors motivates the country to stress cooperation with neighboring states, including in the military area, with the aim of building an undivided block that may present itself united at a global level to deal with defense matters. Such a block should have the capacity to dissuade foreign interferences and reinforced power to negotiate in international forums. Therefore, the Union of South American Nations (UNASUL) is of great relevance. The UNASUL is a proven instrument for: the peaceful resolution of regional disputes, the protection of democracy in South America, the strengthening of dialogue among member-states and the progressive development of an industrial defense base in South America. In the institutional framework of the UNASUL, the establishment of the South American Defense Council (CDS) is of especial importance. Formally established on December 16, 2008, by decision of the heads of state of the member-countries, the CDS has the following objectives: • the consolidation of South America as a zone of peace and a basis for democratic stability and full development, and world peace; DEFENSE WHITE PAPER38 C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T • the construction of a South American identity in the realm of defense, which considers sub-regional and national aspects (the River Plata, the Andes, the Amazon, the Atlantic, the Caribbean and the Pacific) and that strengthens Latin American and the Caribbean unity; and • the generation of consensus in order to strengthen regional cooperation in defense matters. The CDS should therefore promote joint analysis of political and strategic issues, giving opportunity for a wider debate on global and hemispheric realities, from the South American viewpoint. It is important to note that the South American Defense Council is formed by other forums at regional and sub-regional level, such as the Meeting of the Armed Forces Chiefs of Staff and Heads of General Staffs; the Inter-American Defense Board; the Committee on Hemispheric Security; the Meeting of Ministers of Defense of the Americas; the Conference of American Armies; the Inter-American Naval Conference; and the System of Cooperation Among the American Air Forces. South Atlantic As the country with the largest Atlantic coast in the world, Brazil has, for the aforementioned reasons, special interest in South Atlantic peace and security. The Atlantic Ocean holds some relevant strategic areas, such as the “Atlantic Throat”, the area between the Brazilian Northeast Coast and Western Africa which is vital for world trade. The southern passages, which link the Atlantic to the Pacific, constitute an alternative route to the Panama Canal, mainly for large ships. The Cape of Good Hope’s route, connecting the South Atlantic to the Indian Ocean, is an alternative to the Suez Canal and also offers better maritime access to Antarctica. It is also worth noting the importance of the vast oil basin reserve in the Brazilian continental platform and the oil import routes from countries around the equator in the Atlantic. The strategic maritime areas of greater priority and importance to Brazil are represented by the Brazilian Jurisdictional Waters (AJB), which include the territorial waters (MT), the contiguous zone (ZC), the economic exclusive zone (ZEE) and the continental platform (PC), as well as the region delimited by the 16th parallel north, the west coast of Africa, Antarctica, the East coast of South America and the East coasts of the Lesser Antilles. Brazil also dedicates, together with its Western Africa neighbors, special attention to the building of a cooperative environment in the South Atlantic, under the aegis of the Peace 39DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T and Cooperation Zone for the South Atlantic (ZOPACAS).

In diplomatic terms, the reinforcement of ZOPACAS is important for the Country’s defense. The South Atlantic has an historical identity and its own strategic characteristics. Resolution No 41/11 of the United Nations General Assembly calls for militarily significant states of other regions to not introduce nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction in the South Atlantic. The military presence of these states in the Atlantic Ocean should be reduced and, in future, eliminated. States located in other regions should not project on the South Atlantic any conflicts and rivalries that are alien to it. By renewing its involvement in such multilateral precepts, Brazil wishes to contribute, in a responsible way and in collaboration with its partners in ZOPACAS, to the South Atlantic region’s potential socioeconomic development. Defense Related Treaties Brazil has a solid tradition of peaceful solution of conflicts and a commitment to international law. Brazil’s first democratic constitution (1891) prohibited wars of conquest and, since joining the Global forum, in the Second Hague Peace Conference (1907), Brazil has advocated legal equality among states, while refusing to enter into discriminatory treaties and agreements. The country’s territorial disputes were solved through diplomatic means and international arbitrage, which have consolidated its borders with ten neighbors. In this way, Brazil anticipated the principles which motivated the creation of the League of Nations (1919) and the United Nations Organization (1945). Art. 2 of the United Nations Charter affirms that “The Organization is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members”.

Due to clear security needs — dictated by its political, strategic and defense environment — Brazil understands that realistic and credible measures to reduce or eliminate weapons as well as transparent inspection processes may be adopted multilaterally to contribute to an environment of mutual confidence among sovereign states. Brazil, in its capacity as a member of the Geneva Disarmament Conference, defends the strengthening of said Conference as the only multilateral group in the field of disarmament. In this forum, the country has given highest priority to the elimination of nuclear weapons through the adoption of a series of complementary measures, in the bilateral, regional and multilateral spheres, which may result in the adoption of a nuclear disarmament convention. Among other measures, Brazil supports the initiation of treaty negotiations on the prohibition of fissile material production for explosive purposes, including pre-existent stocks. In this way, a significant step could be made in the direction of nuclear disarmament. Since the beginning of the 1990s, Brazil has participated, with personnel, in the landmines deactivation campaigns organized by the Program for Comprehensive Action against Antipersonnel Mines in the Americas and Africa with significant results in terms of deactivated landmines and swept areas. Brazil has also acted in favor of discussions pertaining to the prevention of an arms race in outer space, while upholding the adoption of a relevant legal international instrument on the matter. Concerning conventional armament, Brazil is a party to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons which may be deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects, better known as the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons. Brazil reaffirms its commitment to the following humanitarian principles: • prohibition of the use of weapons that release fragments within the human body that are not detectable by X-rays; • prohibition or restriction of the use of antipersonnel landmines, traps and other similar devices; • prohibition of laser weapons that can cause blindness; and • acceptance of responsibilities and obligations regarding explosive remnants of war. 41DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T Brazil is also a signatory of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, which forbids the development, production and storage of such weapons. It is also party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, which similarly forbids the development, production, acquisition, storage, holding, transference and use of chemical weapons. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Brazil understands that security, peace and development cannot be disassociated from the issue of disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This field is strongly stratified, as illustrated by the differentiation established in the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT)12 among states that have and states that do not have nuclear weapons. The possession of weapons of mass destruction (mainly nuclear) and their launching vehicles (long range missiles), as well as the participation in alliances, which contemplate the possibility — even as a last resort — of employing such weapons, remain a crucial factor in international relations, with direct implications for defense and security. The existence of countries with nuclear weapons capacity — not only de jure, but also de facto13, — is a menace to the NPT regime. Some states known to have possession of nuclear weapons are not parties to the Treaty. The signs of accommodation regarding the de facto status of these countries, emitted especially by some de jure, nuclear armed states, represent an element of instability in the system. Such factors add to the chronic unsteady compliance of obligations related to the NPT’s three pillars (non-proliferation, disarmament and right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes), with overwhelming emphasis on the first. The steps for nuclear disarmament provided in Article VI of the NPT were not implemented. The arsenal of de jure nuclear-armed states was not eliminated. Non-compliance with Article VI perpetuates the imbalance of the NPT. 12 The NPT was signed on July 1st, 1968 and became effective internationally on March 5th, 1970. Brazil adhered to the Treaty on September 18, 1998, through Decree No 2.864 of December 7, 1998. Legislative Decree No 65 of July 2nd, 1998, which approved the NPT text with the aim of adhering the Brazilian Government, highlighted in its Article 2 that “Brazil’s adhesion to the present treaty is bound to the understanding that, in accordance with Article VI, effective measures will be carried out to stop, in the near future, the nuclear arms race and to eliminate all atomic weapons”. 13 The Latin expressions de jure and de facto are applied as opposing ideas, and mean respectively: “legally” and “in fact”.

In this meeting, the nuclear states agreed to the Thirteen Practical Steps for Nuclear Disarmament, which are systematic and progressive efforts for implementing Article VI of the NPT. 14 NPT Article VIII states that, “Five years after the entry into force of this Treaty, a conference of Parties to the Treaty shall be held in Geneva, Switzerland, in order to review the operation of this Treaty with a view to assuring that the purposes of the Preamble and the provisions of the Treaty are being realized. At intervals of five years thereafter, a majority of the Parties to the Treaty may obtain, by submitting a proposal to this effect to the Depositary Governments, the convening of further conferences with the same objective of reviewing the operation of the Treaty”. The first NPT Review Conference was held in 1975. During the 8th NPT Review Conference, held in May 2010, a new Action Plan was adopted, with 64 steps to be complied with by the NPT member-states in the areas of non-proliferation, disarmament and nuclear energy, with special emphasis on nuclear disarmament. The 9th NPT Review Conference will be held in 2015. The Thirteen Steps to Nuclear Disarmament — VI NPT Review Conference 1. Sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. 2. Stop testing nuclear weapons. 3. Negotiate a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty. 4. Establish a body within the Conference on Disarmament to deal with nuclear disarmament. 5. Agree nuclear disarmament must be irreversible. 6. Abolish nuclear weapons. 7. Uphold existing treaties, including the Strategic Arms Treaty (START) II and III and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM). 8. Implement and complete the Trilateral Initiative between the United States, the Russian Federation and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 9. Implement a step-by-step approach to achieve nuclear disarmament. 10. Place excess fissile materials under IAEA control. 11. Reaffirm general and complete disarmament, under effective international control, as the ultimate objective of states. 12. Report regularly on progress toward nuclear disarmament. 13. Further develop verification capabilities to assure compliance with nuclear disarmament agreements. 43DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T Over a decade later, little was done. The decrease in numbers of nuclear weapons does not mean, in general, a reduction of the importance of such weapons in strategic doctrines. The progressive accommodation of de facto nuclear weapons states and the persistence of doctrines and alliances based on the possibility of nuclear weapons use seems to point in the direction of growing critique of the NPT and of a new international division based on three state categories: i) those who have nuclear weapons de jure or de facto; ii) those who do not have nuclear weapons, but profit from their protection, under alliances or “nuclear umbrellas”; and iii) those which, genuinely, may be called non-nuclear armed states. For this last category — which includes Brazil — there is a special concern, the difficult access to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, set forth in the Article IV of the NPT , and the development of new military doctrines that foresee the use of nuclear weapons not only against exclusively nuclear threats, but also against various other types of threats, including those related to conventional arms or non-state actors. The ambiguity of the so-called Negative Security Assurances’, granted by states which have nuclear arms, aggravates the already worrisome expansion of the threat spectrum that nuclear weapons would supposedly dissuade. States with nuclear weapons refuse to grant to states without such weapons security guarantees, which are not ambiguous, non-conditional and backed by binding international legislation. Among the goals set for Brazil, the following points stand out: • non-proliferation and disarmament are inter-related, mutually reinforcing processes; • the reversion of asymmetries inherent to the NPT and the effective reduction of risk of nuclear war can only happen through the complete elimination of nuclear weapons; and • disarmament and non-proliferation efforts should not be directed in detriment to the right to use, develop and research of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. Brazil holds consolidated credentials in the field of non-proliferation. The Federal Constitution forbids the use of nuclear energy for non-peaceful purposes. The arrangement instituted for the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC) is unprecedented and subjects the Brazilian Nuclear Program to two international organizations, which carry out auditing, accounting and the application of safeguards in an independent manner.

In a joint declaration, in January 2011, Brazil and Argentina stressed the high degree of integration reached by both countries through bilateral nuclear cooperation by means of significant projects in the scope of the Binational Nuclear Energy Commission (COBEN). Both nations also ratified all terms of the Joint Presidential Declaration on Nuclear Policy, signed in San Juan, Argentina, in August 2010, and promoted a political dialogue initiated in the Permanent Committee for Nuclear Policy ( CPPN). The purpose of this forum is to continue the exchange of information on the status of both countries’ nuclear programs, and also on the coordination of positions in international forums, such as the Nuclear Suppliers Group, among others, as well as the political evaluations of the bilateral nuclear cooperation and the performance of ABACC. Brazil’s international action in this area seeks to reinforce national independence and to guarantee that international rules against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction do not become incompatible with autonomous technological education, including in strategic areas such as the nuclear sector. 15 The Tlatelolco Treaty is the conventional name given to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, established on February 14, 1967, in Mexico City. The treaty came into force on April 25, 1969, and was signed and ratified by all 33 Latin American and Caribbean nations. Brazil signed the Treaty in 1967 and incorporated it into its legal system through Decree No 1.246 of 1994. Signatory states agreed to forbid and prevent the “testing, use, manufacture, production or acquisition by any means whatsoever of any nuclear weapons” as well as the “receipt, storage, installation, deployment and any form of possession of any nuclear weapon”. Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC) The ABACC is an independent international agency created by the Brazilian and Argentine governments. It is responsible for verifying the peaceful use of nuclear material, which may be used, direct or indirectly, in the production of nuclear weapons. The ABACC was instituted by the Agreement for the Exclusively Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy, signed in 1991, between Argentina and Brazil. By means of this agreement, the Common System of Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (SCCC) was also established and is administered by ABACC. Since June 2011, the Four Party Agreement signed by Brazil, Argentina, the ABACC and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been acknowledged by the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) as an agreement granting, in political terms, guarantees equivalent to those provided in the additional protocols of the IAEA’s safeguards agreements. 45DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T International Treaties on the Sea, Antarctica and Outer Space Differently from land frontiers, which have physical limits and references for their demarcation, in the sea there are no lines which permit the establishment of visible frontiers. This peculiarity demands the adoption of conventions that are accepted by the international community. In 1982, the resolutions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea — (UNCLS) were ratified by Brazil. The UNCLS resolutions established important concepts for the regulation of sea limits, i.e. a territorial waters (MT), where the state exercises full sovereignty, including the airspace above; a contiguous zone (ZC), where the coastal state may implement customs, sanitary and control measures as well as restrain legal infractions; and an economic exclusive zone (ZEE), where the state has the sovereign right to explore, exploit, maintain and manage natural resources, whether living or non-living. From the baseline where the MT originates until the external limit of the ZEE, the coastal state exercises its rights over a 200 nautical miles (370 km) area, the so-called “jurisdictional waters”, where sovereignty is exerted in differing degrees. The UNCLS has been ratified by 152 countries. However, there are still non-adherent nations, including great powers. This fact may become a source for conflict in the future. United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLS) The UNCLS established a sea territory (MT) of 12 nautical miles (22 kilometers), measured from the continental base line; a contiguous zone (ZC), adjacent to the MT, which extends to a further 12 nautical miles; and an economic exclusive zone (ZEE), a 188 nautical miles strip, adjacent to the MT (including the ZC). The UNCLS established moreover that states may claim an increase in their ZEE, if certain technical criteria are complied with, to a maximum extent of 350 nautical miles (648 kilometers). Internally, in 1993, Brazil adopted the 1982 and 1988 resolutions of the UNCLS, but only in 1994, with the ratification of the 60th country, did the UNCLS enter into force.

This forum discussed the future of Antarctica and a legal framework for the solution of emerging deadlocks. A significant part of the Brazilian coast is reached by the winds of the Antarctic region and the sea currents bring living resources, nourishment and oxygen to Brazil’s seashore, elements which directly influence the country’s southern coast. A great part of the available fishing in the Brazilian sea is influenced by the water mass originating in the Southern ocean. Thus, due to the unparalleled interest the region has for the country, the Brazilian Antarctic Program (PROANTAR) was approved in January 1982. In that same year, Brazil acquired the oceanographic support vessel “Barão de Teffé” for the Navy and commissioned it to carry out a hydrographic, oceanographic, and meteorological study in Antarctica, as well as to choose a site for a Brazilian research station. This initiative resulted in the international acknowledgement of the country’s presence in that territory, which resulted in the acceptance of Brazil as a consultative member in the Antarctic Treaty16 in 1983. The international framework for outer space is of great importance to the country. Its main instrument is the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS), created in 1958, soon after the launching of the first artificial satellite, the Sputnik-1. The UN General Assembly then formed an ad hoc Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, composed of 24 member states, including Brazil. Currently, the Committee has 71 member states. The COPUOS supervises the implementation of five treaties and agreements regarding the use of space. 16The Antarctic Treaty was signed in Washington D.C. on December 1st, 1959, by countries which claimed possessions in parts of the Antarctic continent. Signatory states committed themselves to suspend their claims for an undefined period, and thereby allowed scientific exploration to be conducted freely in the continent under a system of international cooperation. The Treaty came into force in June 1961. Brazil adhered to the Treaty on May 16, 1975. Adhesion to the Treaty was reiterated by Decree No 75.963 of July11, 1975. The Fernando de Noronha, São Pedro and São Paulo archipelagos and the Trindade Island, which are far from the coast, are also used as reference points for the Blue Amazon. The referred region extends to 200 nautical miles, measured from its baseline. In the São Pedro and São Paulo archipelagos, located 520 nautical miles from the coast of Rio Grande do Norte State, Brazil maintains a scientific research station, with support from the Navy. The station is permanently supplied and inhabited by Brazilian researchers and is considered to be a prerequisite for the archipelagos to contribute to the composition of the Blue Amazon. 49DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T The space sector, along with the cybernetic and nuclear sectors, is considered to be a fundamental strategic sector for National Defense, as noted in the National Defense Strategy. One of the main objectives of the Brazilian Space Program (PEB) is to reach autonomy in the development of space activities. The program has a strategic nature; it permits the monitoring and management of the vast national territory; it contributes to the mastering of communication and information technologies; it enables meteorological forecasting as well as air and sea traffic control; and it promotes the development of new space technology. Among the main projects within the scope of the Brazilian Space Program, the following are of note: • China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS): in July 1988, Brazil and China signed an agreement for the development of two advanced remote sensing satellites. Due to the combination of financial and technological resources, a shared responsibilities system was created (30% Brazilian and 70% Chinese), with the purpose of building a complete image captioning system at international level; • Brazilian Satellite Launching Vehicle (VLS-1)17: main Brazilian space project being developed by the Institute of Aeronautics and Space (IAE), of the Brazilian Air Force; • Cyclone-4 Project, in partnership with Ukraine: this project is managed by Alcantara Cyclone Space (ACS), a binational state enterprise of Brazilian and Ukrainian capital, set up in August 2006, with the objective of trading and launching satellites using the Ukrainian launching vehicle Cyclone-4 from the Alcantara Launching Centre in the Brazilian state of Maranhão; • Space Cooperation Project, Argentine-Brazilian Satellite for Oceanic Observation (Sabiá-Mar): in November 2007, Brazil and Argentina signed an agreement to design and launch a satellite for Earth observation for environmental and oceanic research purposes. The project, which will be managed by a committee with representatives from Argentina and Brazil, is in its initial phase. It is expected that the satellite for oceanic observation will be launched in 2015; and • Microsatellite Launching Vehicle Project (VLM-1): its objective is to develop a rocket for launching microsatellites (up to 150 kilograms) in equatorial and polar orbits or for reentry. The project will interface with others regarding the development of inertial platforms rocket engines, and satellite launching. It is coordinated by the Brazilian Space Agency and involves the Institute of Aeronautics and Space, foreign research institutes (one German and the other Swedish) and private Brazilian companies. 17The VLS project is detailed in chapter 5.

The protection of natural resources is a highlight of the National Defense Strategy, mainly in regard to the Amazon region. Brazil directs its environmental initiatives by “Principle 2”18 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, adopted during the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED Rio-92)19. This principle reasserts every nation’s sovereign right to exploit its natural resources in accordance with its own environmental and development policies. In return for the sovereign right of exploitation, every state must make a commitment to not damage the environment due to activities performed within its jurisdiction or under its authority. Brazil acknowledges the importance of international cooperation, especially with neighboring countries, for the purpose of preserving the environment and to promote the sustainable use of natural resources. The nation is part of several regional and bilateral agreements that establish cooperative relations for managing transboundary natural resources, such as the agreements that regulate the cooperation and use of the hydro resources in the Prata basin and the agreement that regulates the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (OTCA). In the scope of cooperation among Amazonian nations, it is worth noting the establishment, in 2010, of the New Amazonian Strategic Cooperation Agenda, which encompasses a series of cooperation initiatives in the area of preservation and sustainable use of renewable resources. Within the scope of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CDB), Brazil defends its interests by upholding a balance between the three pillars of this Convention: the preservation of biodiversity, the sustainable use of biodiversity and the distribution of benefits derived from the exploitation of genetic resources. Brazil considers that the establishment of an international agreement on the access to genetic resources and to the knowledge traditionally associated with this issue is an important measure to guarantee the rights of countries and communities which hold such resources, as well as to fight against biopiracy. 18 Principle 2: “States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental and developmental policies, and the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction”. 19 The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCSD) was held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. In 2012, the Conference Rio+20, or Earth Summit 2012, gave continuity to this issue, pursuant to Resolution No 64/236 of the United Nations General Assembly.”. 51DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T Brazil’s actions in forums on forests, especially in the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF), is aimed at strengthening international cooperation among states in order to increase the capacity of all states, especially those in development, to contribute to the protection, preservation and sustainable management of their forest resources. Brazil does not renounce its autonomy of decision-making regarding the formulation of public policies on the preservation and sustainable development of its forest resources. In the last few years, Brazil has amplified its actions to preserve its forests, as well as to improve regulation, monitoring, audit, technical assistance, training, credit availability, and incentives for sustainable production. The defense of this natural asset remains a commitment for the next decades. The preservation of the environment is an important objective. The modernization of Brazil’s defense structure is vital for protecting this enormous asset. The preservation of the environment in general, and the conservation of tropical rainforests and other biomes are responsibilities shared by government agencies in the municipal, state and federal levels. The Ministry of Defense is aware of its responsibility to contribute to the preservation, control and maintenance of the country’s forest areas. Foreign and Defense Policies The foreign and defense policies are complementary and inseparable. The maintenance of regional stability and the construction of a more cooperative international environment are in Brazil’s interest and will be favored by the joint action of the Ministry of Defense (MD) and the Ministry of Foreign Relations (MRE). The National Defense Policy (PND), the National Defense Strategy (END) and the Defense White Paper (LBDN) are historic milestones for the establishment and dissemination of the foundations and parameters of our defense. Policy and Strategy determine responsibilities in promoting the national, particularly in with regard to the country’s development and security. They evince a need for strengthening dialogue mechanisms between the MD and the MRE, in terms of sharing intelligence and joint planning. In the global level, the close participation of military officers and diplomats in multilateral forums (South American Defense Council and political-military dialogues) increases the country’s foreign policy and defense capacity to anticipate, in a coherent and strategic way, the international system and its governance structures, thus facilitating the defense of Brazilian interests abroad. This joint action must aim at diverse partnerships, in order to strengthen relationships among developing countries, without doing harm to DEFENSE WHITE PAPER52 C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T traditional relations with developed world partners. At the same time that Brazil seeks to optimize conditions to obtain technology from more developed countries, the profile of nations which comprise the BRICS group and the IBAS Forum demonstrates that there are great possibilities for cooperation among developing countries, even in areas of advanced technology. For instance, the Air-to-Air Missile Program with South Africa, the outer space cooperation with Russia, the CBERS program with China and the 145 aircraft project by the Brazilian Aeronautical Company, (EMBRAER) with Indian radar. The latter is of seminal importance for future cooperation with India in the defense field. At regional level, especially in South America, the relationship between foreign and defense policies must be strong in order to foster and expand integration to empower South American action in the international arena. It should also be an aggregating factor in enabling the interaction of neighboring governments in order to prevent threats to the peace and security of the region. The South Atlantic joins Brazil to Africa, a neighboring continent which significantly influenced the creation of the Brazilian nation. Brazil’s special attention to Africa is reflected in increasing trade and financing and investments, such as the cooperation for the production of food and other agricultural goods with the support of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA). The protection of communication lines and trade routes with Africa is of strategic importance to the country. It is one more element in the consolidation of cooperative relations within the South Atlantic. Air-to-Air Missile Program The Brazilian South African air forces are producing, in cooperation, a new missile called the A-Darter. The project began in 2006, with investments by both countries. The Brazilian team is supported by the Funding Authority for Studies and Projects (FINEP). The A-Darter is a fifth generation air-to-air, short-range defense missile, i.e. it is able to perform maneuvers to engage targets during flight with an infrared detection system. 53DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T C H A P T E R 2 — T H E 2 1 st C E N T U R Y S T R A T E G IC E N V IR O N M E N T Endowed with adequate defense capacity, Brazil will be in a position to dissuade aggressions against its territory, population and its interests, and thereby contribute to the maintenance of a peaceful environment in the region. At the same time, and in way that is coherent with the country’s policy on cooperation, the increasing coordination between South American states in defense issues will help to avoid hostility against the assets of nations in the region.

To ensure its defense, the Armed Forces are structured in accordance with the Federal Constitution and statutes. The National Defense Policy (PND)20 and the National Defense Strategy (END) are legal frameworks that guide the organization and modernization of the Brazilian military instrument, as well as its training and employment, in a manner that is compatible with Brazil’s political and strategic stature. These documents define the strategic dissuasive position adopted by the country. Said position relies on an active diplomatic policy which aims for peace and development, the preservation of friendship and cooperation with neighboring countries, and with the international community. It is based on mutual confidence and respect among nations. In accordance with legal guidelines, the Brazilian Armed Forces are structured on the basis of capabilities and not in accordance with identified enemies. Regarding the international arena, the preventive aspect of National Defense depends on the importance allocated to diplomatic action as the first instrument for the resolution of conflicts and on a strategic position based upon the existence of recognizable military capability which is able to generate a dissuasive effect. To amplify the country’s influence 20 The current National defense Policy (PdN) was approved by decree No 5,484 of June 30, 2005 and updated in 2012.

The Armed Forces21 — constituted by the Navy, the Army and the Air Force — are national permanent and regular institutions which are organized on the basis of hierarchy and discipline. These Forces are subordinated to the supreme authority of the President of the Republic and have as their mission the defense of the motherland, the protection of the constitutional branches of power and, by order of any of these branches, the protection of law and order, with the aim of preserving state sovereignty and federal union. The Armed Forces’ obedience to the democratically elected government, subject to the authority of the President of the Republic, through the Ministry of Defense, is an essential element for the republic and for national integrity. Besides this mission, the Armed Forces also cooperate with national development and civil defense. The Armed Forces also act, in partnership with the Judicial Police, against crime in the country’s borderlands, airspace, sea and rivers. These actions are also conducted in coordination with other Executive agencies, in accordance with specific duties legally assigned22 to the Navy, Army and Air Force. In case of aggression against the country, the state will employ all components of national power, with emphasis on military power, to exercise its right to legitimate self-defense, in accordance with the United Nations Charter23. The country’s military power depends on the capacity of its Armed Forces and the potential national resources that may be mobilized. The latter reflects not only material resources, but also Brazil’s ability to rapidly increase its military manpower, by calling up its military reserve. The Ministry of Defense coordinates joint effort in the area of National Defense. 21 Federal constitution, Art. 142. 22 Pursuant to complementary Law No 97 of June 9, 1999, Art. 16-A. 23 uN charter, Art. 51. 57DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T The Ministry of Defense The Ministry of Defense (MD) was created on June 10, 1999, substituting the Armed Forces’ Joint Staff and the military ministries. The former ministries of the Armed Forces were transformed into the Navy, Army and Air Force departments. These agencies are directed by General or Flag Officers of the highest military ranks, i.e. Admiral and General. The Ministry of Defense, as a government department of the federal public administration, is responsible for: coordinating joint defense efforts; for contributing to the protection of national sovereignty, the constitutional branches of powers, law and order, national assets and interests; and for promoting Brazil’s influence in the international arena. The Ministry of Defense has authority over various matters, some of great sensibility and complexity. These include joint military operations; defense budget; military policies and strategies; strategic intelligence; science, technology and innovation; health; national mobilization; remote sensors; command and control; and military service, among other issues. The MD is also a political actor responsible for the promotion of cooperation among other government agencies, which develop activities that are related to national defense. The MD aligns defense projects with programs developed by these other government agencies. Organizational structure The new perspectives derived from the National Defense Strategy, and the stronger protagonism of the Ministry of Defense in the Brazilian political scene has led to an ample restructuring of this government department. The rearrangement has promoted the role of the Armed Forces Joint Staff, the Secretariats, and other agencies within the Ministry. The organizational structure of the Ministry of Defense is currently as follows: • Defense Military Council (CMiD) — an advisory board; • Armed Forces Joint Staff (EMCFA); • Office of the Secretary General (SG); • Office of the Minister of Defense; • Planning Office (ASPLAN); • War College (ESG); • Legal Office (CONJUR); DEFENSE WHITE PAPER58 C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T • Internal Audit Office (CISET); • Office of Management (SEORI); • Office of Personnel, Education, Health and Sports (SEPESD); • Office of Matériel (Secretaria de Produtos de Defesa — SEPROD); and • Center for the Management and Operation of the Amazon Protection System (CENSIPAM).

In 2010, the then named Center for Peacekeeping Operations Training (CIOpPaz), a Brazilian Army unit, originally founded in 2005, was transformed into the CCOPAB. From then on it has integrated members from the three Armed Forces, Military Polices and Fire Departments. This integration has strongly favored the synergy of these professionals in complex peacekeeping missions. Defense Strategic Sectors The National Defense Strategy selected three strategic areas: the nuclear sector, the cybernetic sector and the space sector. The Ministry of Defense’s Ministerial Directive No 14 of 2009 resolved that the nuclear sector would be subject to the coordination of the Navy, the cyber sector would be managed by the Army and the space sector by the Air Force. The priority for all three sectors is to improve national scientific and technological education and to develop human resources. Nuclear Sector Brazil develops nuclear technology with its own knowledge, and it is today included among the main countries that have more fully mastered nuclear technology, with special note to energy generation, and medical and industrial applications. The country has mastered the entire nuclear fuel cycle and possesses enough uranium resources to meet all of its needs. Brazil’s main objective is the technological autonomy and consolidation of its nuclear industry as a state-of-the-art complex and promoter of development. As already mentioned in Chapter 2, nuclear technology in Brazil is exclusively used for peaceful purposes. It is also worthy of note that the Brazilian nuclear industrial park qualifies as an international reference, especially concerning the security and protection of its facilities, as well as its waste control. Since 1979, the Navy contributes to the Brazilian Nuclear Program, having fully mastered the nuclear fuel cycle31, It currently supplies centrifuges to the Nuclear Industries of Brazil (INB), with headquarters in Resende (RJ). 31 The nuclear fuel cycle is a set of stages in the industrial process which transforms the uranium element, in its natural state, into fuel for use in a nuclear plant. 71DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T The essential part of the Navy Nuclear Program is the construction of a reactor for the nuclear propelled Brazilian submarine, which will raise, considerably, the defense capacity of Brazil in the South Atlantic. It is important to highlight that only the submarine’s propulsion system will be nuclear, which is expressly permitted in the agreement signed with the International Atomic Energy Agency (AEIA). All of its weapons will be conventional, due to Brazil’s constitutional commitment to the use of nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful purposes. This commitment was reaffirmed in international agreements, such as the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Tlatelolco Treaty and the Brazil-Argentine treaty on the ABACC. The possession of a submarine with nuclear propulsion will contribute to the defense and preservation of national interests in water, particularly in the South Atlantic, and will also permit: • the protection of commercial routes; • the safeguarding of navigation freedom; • the protection of natural resources in the continental platform; and • technological development. Cybernetic Sector Cyber threat has become a concern, as it puts in risk the integrity of delicate infrastructures, which are essential for the operation and control of various systems and organizations directly linked to the field of national security. Cyberspace protection includes a great number of areas, such as education, intelligence, scientific research, doctrine, military development, employment and personnel management. It also comprises the protection of cyber assets and the capacity for acting in network. The cyber sector has both intra and inter-organizational elements. It is multidisciplinary and generates different technological services and products, besides management methods and processes, at all levels. Brazil’s efforts in the cyber sector has the purpose of ensuring confidentiality, availability, integrity and authenticity of data circulating in its networks, which are processed and saved. This project is a long-term effort which will positively influence the operational, scientific and technological areas. Under Army coordination, significant advances have been made in training specialized personnel and in the development of advanced technological solutions.

The Army Center for Cyber Defense is adding efforts to those of other existenting government organizations. It seeks to: • develop human resources; • update doctrine; • strengthen security; • respond to network incidents; • incorporate lessons learned; and • protect against cyber-attacks. Space Sector Brazil’s space projects aim for scientific technological development. More specifically, they seek to strengthen Brazilian air and space power, scientific research, innovation, national space launch operations and technological services in aviation, space and defense systems. The Satellite Launching Vehicle (VLS) is the main space project and requires higher investment. The Aeronautics and Space Institute (IAE), an organization subordinate to the Air Force Department of Aerospace Science and Technology (DCTA), has been developing, since 1966, a set of sounding rockets of the (Brazilian) Sonda group. The increasing improvement in space technology has allowed the development of the Satellite Launching Vehicle. The first stage of this vehicle consists of four equal S-43 propellant units. These devices, which operate simultaneously, are similar to the first stage of the Sonda IV rocket, of the last series of the Sonda group. Other space products have been developed by the national industry or in cooperation with foreign industries. The Alcantara Launching Center (CLA) and the Barreira do Inferno Launching Center (CLBI), located in the states of Maranhao and Rio Grande do Norte, respectively, are Air Force organizations, subordinate to the Department of Aerospace Science and Technology (DCTA). They operate launch missions, track aerospace devices, and collect and process data on payloads. Moreover, these institutions conduct tests and scientific experiments of interest to the Air Force and in accordance with the National Policy for Aerospace Development. 73DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T *brazil designed and built two data collection satellites (scd 1 and scd 2) to understand the environmental diversity of the national territory.

It has as its central agency the Brazilian Aerospace Defense Command (COMDABRA), a Combined Command directly subordinated to the Supreme Commander (the President of the Republic). It is part of the Military Structure of War (EMG), which, in peace time, is integrated to the Air Force, being directly subordinated to the Air Operations Command (COMGAR). Its mission is to ensure the sovereignty over Brazilian Airspace, through control and, if necessary, actions and interferences against movements in the Brazilian airspace that are contrary to laws in force, or which may represent a threat to national interests, whether in peace or in conflict. National mobilization National Mobilization System (SINAMOB) National mobilization32 is a set of activities that are planned and developed by the state, in a fast and mandatory manner, with the purpose of enabling the Country to carry on strategic actions in the field of National Defense. The decree for mobilization is a presidential prerogative. For these strategic actions to be a well prepared and executed, Law No 11.631 of 27 December of 2007 created the National Mobilization System (SINAMOB). This system is composed of a group of agencies which act in an integrated and orderly fashion, in order to plan and carry out all phases of national mobilization and demobilization. When decreeing national mobilization, the Executive Branch must specify the national geographic area where it will take place and the necessary steps for its execution, including: • the summoning of federal agencies to integrate the national mobilization effort; • the readjustment of production, trade, distribution, consumption and services; • the intervention in public and private production; • the requisition and occupation of goods and services; and • the drafting of civilian and military personnel. 32 The concept of mobilization is mentioned in item XXViii of Article 22, and item XiX of Article 84 of the Federal constitution. DEFENSE WHITE PAPER78 C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T The capacity for mobilization is tightly linked to the concept of elasticity, noted in the National Defense Strategy. Elasticity refers to the capacity to rapidly increase human and material resources available for defense purposes. This concept is linked to the issue of military service, which is a National Defense instrument capable of supplying the reserve troops required for military mobilization. Military Service Compulsory Military Service is a fundamental element for the mobilization of the Brazilian people in defense of national sovereignty. The legal basis for military service is provided in the Federal Constitution, in the Military Service Law; in the Law for Military Service in the Areas of Medicine, Pharmacy, Odontology and Veterinary Science; and in the Law for Alternative Service33. The Ministry of Defense is the central agency of the Military Service. According to the system now in force in Brazil, initial military service is mandatory for male citizens. Permanence of these individuals in the regular service is optional. Military service allows the nation to shape public spirit among citizens, instilling values of solidarity, and justice as well as principles of, ethics and national pride. It is also an important instrument for affirming national unity. 33 Alternative service refers to the practice of administrative, assistance, philanthropic or productive activities, instead of activities that are essentially military in nature.

The initial military service lasts for a year. The contingent is composed of enlisted and selected men 18 years old or older, and by doctors, pharmacists, dentists and veterinarians, from both sexes, which fit into the aforementioned law. From 2003 on, the phases of the recruiting process became common to the three Armed Forces, under the direction of the Ministry of Defense. At the end of the selection phase, citizens may be assigned to military service in a Navy, Army or Air Force organization, while registered in one of the Reserves Training Units (OFR), such as Reserve Officers Training Centers, Reserve Officers Training Units and Military Shooting Ranges. The Reserve Officers Training Centers (CPOR) and the Reserve Officers Training Units (NPOR) are military combat education institutions, dedicated to training reserve officers. The Military Shooting Ranges, known literally as “Shots of War”, are Army organizations that train reserve personnel. They permit draftees to undertake military service in their local area. This way, young draftees may combine military instruction with study and work. In Brazil, around 1.65 million young males annually reach the age required for military service enlistment and approximately 90 thou-sand are admitted into the Armed Forces.

The increasing technological complexity of weapons, as well as the fluidity of circumstances in which they are applied, generate ever growing demands on military personnel. This, in turn, elevates the necessity for qualified men and women in the Armed Forces. Defense Intelligence System (SINDE) Law No 9,883 of December 7th, 1999, states that the Ministry of Defense is a component of the Brazilian Intelligence System (SISBIN) and must supply data and specific knowledge related to the defense of national institutions and interests to the Brazilian Intelligence Agency (ABIN). In 2002, the Defense Intelligence System (SINDE) was created in the scope of the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces, with the objective of integrating the planning and execution of actions on defense intelligence. The Defense Intelligence System was developed to produce and safeguard knowledge of interest to the Ministry of Defense and which is strictly military-technical in nature. This system functions in two levels: • Defense Strategic Intelligence — aims at the production of necessary knowledge for the decision making process, as well as the formulation and direction of policies and plans in the highest levels; and • Defense Operational Intelligence — aims at the production and safeguarding of necessary knowledge for the planning, direction and support of military campaigns and operations, in order to achieve strategic objectives in the area of operations. Based on systemic relations, without links of subordination, the Defense Intelligence System is comprised of the highest-level intelligence organizations within the Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces. This System directs its activities in light of resolutions made by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and National Defense34chaired by the Minister of Institutional Security of the Presidency of the Republic (GSIPR), and in accordance with resolutions of the Government Council, chaired by the President of the Republic or, on his decision, by the President’s Chief of Staff. The Council is also integrated by the Ministers and the President’s Private Secretary. 34 The chamber is responsible for the formulation of public policies and guidelines of matters related to the Federal Government foreign affairs and National defense. 81DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T Brazilian Navy The Brazilian Navy was created on July 28, 1736, by authority of João V, King of Portugal, originally as a Secretariat of State for Naval Affairs and Overseas Territories, directly subordinated to the King. In 1808, as a result of the Napoleonic invasions, the Portuguese Royal Court fled to Rio de Janeiro, and the Prince Regent, João VI, appointed João Rodrigues de Sá e Menezes, Count of Anadia, as head of that Secretariat, officially transferring it to Brazil. In 1821, before returning to Portugal, João VI appointed the Fleet Chief Manoel Antonio Farinha, as Secretary of State for the Navy Department in Brazil. Despite the importance of the above mentioned facts, which established the legal foundations of the Brazilian Navy, it is important to note that the first Brazilian commander of a naval group, in an essentially military mission, was registered 123 years before. In 1613, during the French occupation of the State of Maranhão, Jeronimo de Albuquerque, born in Olinda, State of Pernambuco, commanded an expedition of approximately 100 men, on board of ships built in Brazil, known as “caravelões” (large caravels). This expedition, departing from Recife and with the help of indigenous people, played a significant role in the expulsion of the invaders.

The sea was the way to discovery, colonization, trade, foreign invasion and the consolidation of independence. It was also the arena for the defense of sovereignty in several occasions, including the two world wars. In the 21st century, the country’s geopolitical complexity and the importance of the sea for Brazil’s development induce multiple scenarios for the use of Naval Force. In addition to the vastness of Brazil’s maritime areas, the Brazilian Navy faces great challenges to its mission. Mission It is the Navy’s responsibility to: develop and employ Naval Power in the defense of the homeland, in accordance with the Federal Constitution and other laws; to safeguard the branches of state; and, by initiative of any of these branches, to ensure law and order. The Navy also acts under mandate of international organizations and in support of the country’s foreign policy. The Naval Force also fulfills subsidiary duties provided in law, especially those related to “Sea Authority”, for the protection of national interests. To fulfill its duties, the Navy directs its operational and support units according to the policies established by the Ministry of Defense. The Navy is assigned the following subsidiary tasks: • guide and control the Merchant Navy and its related activities in what concerns the Ministry of Defense; • ensure the safety of maritime navigation; • contribute to the formulation and direction of national maritime policies; • enforce compliance with laws and regulations on the sea and inland waters, in coordination with other departments of the Executive Branch from the federal and state levels; and • cooperate with federal departments on the repression of crimes with national or international repercussion, that occur at sea, in inland waters and in port areas, through logistical, intelligence, communications and training support. Due to these responsibilities, the Navy Chief of Staff is legally designated as the “Sea Authority”35. The roles of the Sea Authority are related to matters of Sea Power36. 35 state power over maritime areas, which are under national sovereignty and jurisdiction. 36 maritime Power is the segment of National Power that is related to navigation in seas, inland waters as well as waterway transport, fishing, deep-sea resource exploration, related industries, maritime public policy and, mainly, the people’s maritime vocation. Naval Power is the “armed branch” (or military segment) of maritime Power. 83DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T Organization and Equipment The Navy has the following organizational structure: a) An office of general management, the Navy Staff (EMA). b) A senior advisory office, the Admiralty. c) Six institutions of direct and immediate assistance to the Navy Chief of Staff: • Office of the Navy Chief of Staff (GCM); • Navy Intelligence Center (CIM); • Navy Office of Internal Audit (SecCIM); • Navy Special Attorney’s Office (PEM); • Inter-ministerial Commission for Maritime Resources (SECIRM); and • Navy Press Office (CCSM). d) Seven area specific institutions: • Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (ComOpNav); • Directorate-General for Navigation (DGN); • Navy Secretary-General (SGM); • Navy Directorate-General for Material (DGMM); • Navy Directorate-General for Personnel (DGPM); • Marine Corps Command (CGCFN); and • Navy Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation (SecCTM). organization chart of the Navy emA Admiralty comopNavsGmdGN dGmm Navy Commander direct and immediate Assistance offices cGcFN comemchcomemchcomemchcomemchcomemchcomemchcomemchcomemch General management office senior Advisory office Area specific institutions Naval Forces and marine corps comemchcomFFe comdN (9) comForAerNavcomForscomForsup comdiv-1 comdiv-2 dGPm seccTm DEFENSE WHITE PAPER84 C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (ComOpNav) The Office of the Chief of Naval Operations is responsible for readiness, training and employment of Naval, Naval Aviation and Marine Forces in military operations.

It was created in Portugal on August 28, 1797, by authority of Queen Maria I, who arrived in Rio de Janeiro on March 7, 1808, accompanying the rest of the Portuguese Royal family migrating to to Brazil. The Marine Corps’ baptism of fire37 took place during an expedition to French Guyana (1808/1809), with the takeover of Caienne38 In 1809, João Rodrigues Sá e Menezes, Count of Anadia, then Navy Minister, ordered the Navy Royal Brigade to occupy the São José Fortress, in the Island of Cobras, where to this day the Marine Corps Command has its headquarters. After King João VI’s return to Portugal, one battalion of the Navy Royal Brigade remained in Rio. Since then, marines have been present in all important events of the history of Brazil, whether in conflicts to consolidate national independence or in the Prata campaigns, or in other armed conflicts which the country has been engaged in. Over the years, the marines has been designated different names: Naval Artillery Battalion of Rio de Janeiro, Navy Artillery Corps, Naval Battalion, Navy Infantry Corps, Naval Regiment and, finally, since 1932, Marine Corps. In the 1950’s, the Marine Corps was structured for operational employment as a Landing Force, becoming a segment of the Navy assigned to naval campaigns requiring land operations. 37 First combat engagement. 38 brazil was then integral part of the Kingdom of Portugal. \r   Districts’ Naval Aviation Resources 95DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T The Marine Corps is a professional and volunteer military unit which is in permanent readiness for employment. It is expeditionary in character, par excellence, and essential for the defense of naval and port facilities; as well as ocean archipelagos and islands in Brazilian jurisdictional waters. The marines are also important for controlling river banks in riverine operations and for conducting peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. Organization The Marine Corps is part of the Navy organization. It is composed of a Marine Command (CGCFN) and its operational branch, the Fleet Marine Force Command (ComFFE), the latter under the Naval Operations Command. The Marine Corps Command has the purpose of contributing to the development and employment of Naval Power, regarding specific Marine Corps activities, in the areas of personnel, equipment and doctrine. The Fleet Marine Force (ComFFE) is a unit that is organized, trained and equipped for the execution of amphibious and land operations of limited range. These activities entail launching a military force, from ships or vessels at sea, and involves landing on hostile or potentially hostile beaches. An amphibious operation is characterized by the integration of trained, organized and equipped forces with different combat roles. Such operations, though generally concluded on land, aim at the objectives of a naval campaign.

It has three Infantry, one Artillery, one Armored, one Air Tactical Control, one Air Defense and one Command and Control battalions; • Reinforcement Unit — provides support for combat units. It is indispensable for marine missions. Its main battalions are: one Logistics, one Engineering, and one Amphibious Vehicles; • Landing Command — assigned to constantly monitor potential crises situations, in order to enable agility on the part of the Fleet Marine Force in the organization, activation and employment of its Marine Corps Operational Groups (GptOpFuzNav); • Marine Corps Special Operations Battalion — a special operations unit, adopted in hostile environments, with the purpose of: destroying or damaging relevant objectives in defended areas, capturing or rescuing personnel or material, recovering facilities, obtaining data, outwitting or producing psychological effects on the enemy; and • Rio Meriti Marine Corps Base — a support unit that supplies personnel and material for command, control and administrative purposes. The Marine Corps Groups (GptFN) are operational units designed to provide security to naval facilities and to undertake limited operations, compatible to their numbers, in support of Fleet Marine Corps Operational Groups. The Marine Corps Groups are located and subordinated to Naval Districts’ headquarters, except for the 8th Naval District which has no Marine Corps group.

It plans to gradually increase this number by 2030, in order to meet the requirements in the National Defense Strategy and, especially, the Defense Deployment and Equipment Plan (PAED), in particular the Navy Nuclear Program (PNM), the Submarines Development Program (PROSUB) and the Navy Re-equipment Program (PRM). The Navy should be able, whichever the situation, to fulfill four basic tasks concerning Naval Power: deny the enemy use of the sea, to control maritime areas, project power over land and contribute to determent. A Naval Force must be able to efficiently provide for its own defense, including against air threats. In such situations an operational aircraft carrier is indispensable. The capacity to control maritime areas cannot be reached only through escort ships, which are vital. The employment of interception and attack aircraft are also indispensable. 101DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T A Naval Force with different types of ships, commanded by an aircraft carrier, has the mobility, permanence, flexibility and versatility needed to enable it to meet a wide range of missions, from humanitarian to peacekeeping, as well as typical maneuvers in crises or armed conflict. A well-equipped Naval Force provides policymakers the capacity to calibrate the employment of force, at appropriate time and place, with proportional intensity to meet intended purposes. It is therefore an efficient determent element. Since the 1970’s, the Navy found that conventional submarines were not sufficient to face possible threats in the South Atlantic, its immediate naval operations environment. To comply with its constitutional mission of defending sovereignty, territorial integrity and the country’s sea interests, the Navy also requires nuclear propulsion submarines. The exceptional mobility of these vessels ensures the advanced defense of the farthest maritime frontier. The surface Naval Force will rely on medium and large sized ships, which are able to operate and remain for a long time at sea, as well as smaller sized ships, assigned to coastal patrol and the patrol of main navigable Brazilian waterways. In order to ensure readiness and security of Brazilian sovereignty and interests, inside the country and overseas, the Navy will keep forces in conditions of immediate employment (Fast Task Force) in naval war operations, in peace time, or in situations of crisis and conflict. The Navy, employing its naval, air force or amphibious resources, has the condition to conduct non-combatant evacuations, peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. It may also project amphibious forces, regardless of hostility levels and the type of mission to be achieved. Strategic vision and goals The Navy directs its activities with the aim of becoming a modern and well-balanced Force39, It seeks to possess naval, aircraft and amphibious resources, which are compatible with the country’s political and strategic standing in the international arena. 39 A modern Force is a military organization which is equipped with resources that are up-to-date, i.e. resources that are less than 20 years in use. To ensure this, quality must prevail over quantity. balance refers to the development of activities which ensure simultaneous employment at sea or in inland waters. balance also refers to the capacity of executing, gradually, the four basic tasks of Naval Power and naval war operations.

For the Navy, the availability of nuclear submarines adds a new dimension to Brazilian Naval Power, guaranteeing it deterrence capacity as required by its constitutional mission. During the formulation of projects for deployment, procurement and modernization of naval resources, the premises were contemplated. These principles were based on the guidelines established by the National Defense Strategy for the Navy: • the cyber, space and nuclear sectors are vital for National Defense; • the task of denying the use of the sea by the enemy guides the country’s naval strategy; • the reconfiguration of the Navy’s resources should balance between submarine, surface and aerospace elements; • the prioritization of the control of maritime areas which stretch from Santos (SP) to Vitória (ES) and the Amazon River delta; • the Naval Force will be organized around capabilities. It will be emphasize monitoring/ control, mobility and presence. In this manner, it will respond promptly through strategic mobility, having the operational capacity to monitor the sea from space; • Personnel will be relocated, particularly to the Amazon delta region, to the national borders and to the large hydro basins of the Amazon, and the Paraguay-Paraná rivers; • the capacity to assist undertake peacekeeping operations, humanitarian action and international commitments for search and rescue will be increased; • Brazil will project and manufacture its conventional or nuclear propulsion submarines, as well as surface, amphibious, naval air and space resources; • the Navy organizes itself and deploys its units in a manner that facilitates joint and singular operations; and • the Navy should act, primarily, through a strategic defensive position. Based on the aforementioned premises, short and long term projects of interest to the Navy were developed40, Some are listed below, in no particular order, although they and are all considered strategic and vital for the Naval Force: • ensure the continuity of the Navy’s Nuclear Program; • revitalize and reinvigorate the Navy’s current resources; 40 The main projects and sub-projects will be in detail in chapter 5. 103DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T • build a Second Fleet and a Second Marine Corps Force, with headquarters in the North/Northeast (including a naval base, a naval air base, an amphibious base and a supply base); • improve the current Submarine Force, by incorporating conventional resources (S-BR) and nuclear propulsion submarines (SN-BR). The Submarine Development Program (PROSUB) may be highlighted. It includes the launching of four “Scorpène”41conventional submarines from 2016 on and one nuclear propulsion submarine from 2022 on; the building of specific docks and naval base; and the continuity of the Submarine Modernization Program (MODSUB) for the five currently available conventional submarines of “Tupi” and “Tikuna” classes; • structure surface forces to increase the capacity for controlling maritime areas with cover demining, logistics and defense support; • renew the surface fleet by building, primarily in Brazil, escort ships, logistics support ships, patrol ships of various classes, aircraft carriers and multiple purpose ships; • refit the Fleet Air Arm with highly efficient defense aircraft; • increase the current Marine Corps manpower to two Fleet Marine Forces with two landing units — one an amphibious brigade in the First Fleet, the other an amphibious unit in the Second Fleet; • structure the Navy with riverine forces for the Amazon basin and the Pantanal region; • ensure the necessary resources and organizational structure to support subsidiary roles assigned to the Sea Authority, through the “Navigation Safety” Program. This program seeks to create and elevate (hierarchically) military port authorities, their branches and agencies. It also aims at the construction of riverine ships for patrolling transportation, medical assistance and assigned ships; • increase the capacity of the Navy to fulfill international commitments for search and rescue; • supply the Navy with appropriate resources to participate in peacekeeping operations and humanitarian actions, and to support the National Civil Defense System; • implement the “Blue Amazon” Management System, for monitoring and surveying Brazilian jurisdictional waters (AJB), with the purpose of improving the Navy’s capacity for controlling maritime traffic in the South Atlantic. This is meant to ensure the security of vessels engaged in strategic activities and to increase the capacity for search and rescue; 41 scorpène submarines are conventional submarines, i.e. they rely on diesel-electric engines. These vessels are derived from French technology, which will be transferred to the brazilian Navy as part of Prosub.

Over the years, the participation of women in the Navy has been notable. As officers and enlisted women, they act in various areas, such as medicine, odontology, health assistance (nursing, psychology, nutrition, physiotherapy and pharmacy), engineering, architecture, civil construction, pedagogy, accounting, administration, law, history, social communication, museology, librarianship, computer science, economics, social service, security of waterway traffic, physical education, oceanography and meteorology, among other fields relevant to the Navy. Women are now military organization heads or deputy heads and team leaders. They manage projects and the construction of warship and other equipment. They lead departments, divisions and sections in the administration, in hospitals, in technology centers, in naval districts and in the Navy’s specialized directorates. In the Navy’s Medical and Engineering Corps, in particular, women may rise to the rank of General Officer (Admiral), competing in equal conditions with male officers belonging to the same Corps. On November 25, 2012, Captain Dalva Maria Carvalho Mendes, of the Navy’s Medical Corps, became the first Brazilian woman appointed to the rank of Admiral.

The first Battle of Guararapes, on April 19, 1648, is considered the genesis of the Brazilian Army. On this occasion, the Forces fighting the invaders were genuinely formed by Brazilians (white, colored and Amerindians). In 1822, the Army cooperated with the quest for independence, supporting Emperor Pedro I in a struggle that consolidated the political emancipation of the country. The Army fought, under the Empire, in conflicts of the River Plata region and contributed to the consolidation of the Brazilian territory. Led by Marshall Deodoro da Fonseca, the Brazilian Army played a fundamental role in the establishment of a Republican government in 1889. The Army exercised a relevant role in maintaining the unity of the homeland, and it continues to do so. Its history is mixed with the country’s. The Army is present across the national territory and identifies itself with the people. In it men and women are represented without distinction of ethnic, religious, or social background.

The Army’s mission is conditioned by a territory of continental dimensions, by geographical diversity and by a vast border with 10 countries. Mission It is the Army’s responsibility to develop the Land Force in order to meet its constitutional mission of defending the homeland, protecting the three branches of state and upholding law and order when called upon. The Army must also fulfill subsidiary roles as provided in complementary law, such as: to support national development and civil defense, as well as the country’s foreign policy and to participate in international peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. The Army integrates the National Civil Protection and Defense System (SINPDEC), taking part, across the national territory, in aid and assistance to victims of natural disasters, whether in the phase of prompt response or in the stage of recovering and reconstructing. The following subsidiary duties are also assigned to the Army: • act, through preventive or repressive actions in the land frontiers, against border and environmental crimes, separately or jointly with agencies of the Executive Branch. This includes performing patrols; screening and inspecting people, land vehicles, ships and aircraft; and arresting flagrant offenses; • cooperate with federal agencies, whenever necessary, in the repression of crime, within the national territory, by providing logistical, intelligence, communications and training support; and • cooperate with federal, state and municipal agencies on engineering services. Organization and Equipment The Army has the following organizational structure: a) One general management office, the Army Staff (EME). b) Two advisory offices: • Army High Command; and • Economic and Finance Council. 115DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T c) Six offices of direct and immediate assistance to the Army Chief of Staff: • Office of the Army Chief of Staff (Gab Cmt Ex); • Office of the Secretary-General of the Army (SGEx); • Army Intelligence Center (CIE); • Army Press Office (CComSEx); • Army Office of Internal Audit (CCIEx); and • Army Office of Legal Affairs (CJACEx). d) Seven area specific institutions: • Logistics Command (COLOG); • Department of Engineering and Construction (DEC); • Department of Personnel (DGP); • Department of Education and Culture (DECEx); • Land Operations Command (COTER); • Department of Science and Technology (DCT); and • Economic and Finance Secretariat (SEF).

The Land Force has seven Army Divisions and twelve Military Regions, some of which are cumulative. The Amazon Command and the Northeastern Command have each an engineering group. The Army Divisions incorporate brigades and artillery units. The Army has 27 brigades and four artillery units (three in the Southern Command and one in the Eastern Command). The brigades may be subordinated to the Army Divisions or directly to the Area Commands. The basic combat module is the brigade, which may be one of several types, depending on the nature of its mission, the material utilized, or the operational area to which it is was designated. The brigade is a large unit based on a combined arms approach, which is able to perform missions in an autonomous manner. Normally, it is composed of: maneuverable units and sub-units (infantry and cavalry); suppressive fire units (field artillery): air defense units (anti-aircraft artillery); combat support units (engineering and communications); and logistics support units (supplies, medical services and combat materials). Brigades may receive, according to their needs, fractions of the Army’s aviation, electronic warfare, electronic intelligence, psychological operations, special operations, and anti-aircraft units, and also Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Brigades are characterized by the flexibility of their organization and diversity of weapons, munitions, vehicles and equipment, which, together with qualified personnel, are integrated to ensure adequate performance of complex operations. The main brigade types are: • Light Brigades: Jungle Infantry Brigade, Frontier Infantry Brigade, Motorized Infantry Brigade, Light Infantry Brigade and Parachute Infantry Brigade. The light brigades were created due to the Land Force’s need for units with great flexibility and operational capacity, which are able to move and act with celerity and efficiency anywhere in the national territory, and also to guarantee law and order, as provided in the Constitution; DEFENSE WHITE PAPER118 C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T CMS CMSE CML CMP CMNE CMO CMA Cascavel Dourados Campo Grande Curitiba Ponta Grossa Florianópolis Santa Maria Porto Alegre Pelotas Bagé Uruguaiana Santiago Corumbá Cuiabá Goiânia Cristalina Brasília Rio de Janeiro Belo HorizonteJuiz de Fora Salvador Recife João Pessoa Natal Fortaleza Belém Marabá Manaus Boa Vista Tefé São Gabriel da Cachoreira Porto Velho Campinas São Paulo Taubaté Caçapava Guarujá Area Command Headquarters Military Division and Region (unified) Military Region Armored Brigades Mechanized Brigades Motorized Brigades Parachute Brigades Light Brigade/Frontiers Mountain Brigades Anti-airspace Artillery Brigade Special Operations Brigades Army Aviation Command Engineering Group Division Key Deployment of brigades CMS CMSE CML CMP CMNE CMO CMA Cascavel Dourados Campo Grande Curitiba Ponta Grossa Florianópolis Santa Maria Porto Alegre Pelotas Bagé Uruguaiana Santiago Corumbá Cuiabá Goiânia Cristalina Brasília Rio de Janeiro Belo HorizonteJuiz de Fora Salvador Recife João Pessoa Natal Fortaleza Belém Marabá Manaus Boa Vista Tefé São Gabriel da Cachoreira Porto Velho Campinas São Paulo Taubaté Caçapava Guarujá Area Command Headquarters Military Division and Region (unified) Military Region Armored Brigades Mechanized Brigades Motorized Brigades Parachute Brigades Light Brigade/Frontiers Mountain Brigades Anti-airspace Artillery Brigade Special Operations Brigades Army Aviation Command Engineering Group Division Key CMS CMSE CML CMP CMNE CMO CMA Cascavel Dourados Campo Grande Curitiba Ponta Grossa Florianópolis Santa Maria Porto Alegre Pelotas Bagé Uruguaiana Santiago Corumbá Cuiabá Goiânia Cristalina Brasília Rio de Janeiro Belo HorizonteJuiz de Fora Salvador Recife João Pessoa Natal Fortaleza Belém Marabá Manaus Boa Vista Tefé São Gabriel da Cachoreira Porto Velho Campinas São Paulo Taubaté Caçapava Guarujá Area Command Headquarters Military Division and Region (unified) Military Region Armored Brigades Mechanized Brigades Motorized Brigades Parachute Brigades Light Brigade/Frontiers Mountain Brigades Anti-airspace Artillery Brigade Special Operations Brigades Army Aviation Command Engineering Group Division Key 119DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T • Medium Brigades: Mechanized Infantry Brigades and Mechanized Cavalry. Medium Brigades have armored vehicles on wheels. They are assigned to defense operations against foreign threats. During conflicts, they may be used in for scouting and security purposes. They delay potential aggressors until the Land Force deploys troops which are in better conditions to face the enemy; and • Heavy Brigades: Armored Cavalry Brigade and Armored Infantry Brigade. The Heavy Brigades are armored brigades. They are potent, highly mobile forces and, therefore, can be decisive in land conflicts. Their mission is to close in on the enemy, in order to destroy or neutralize, utilizing fire, maneuver and shock tactics. In the battlefield, they are particularly capable of conducting highly mobile offensive actions with great depth. There are also three specific brigade combat modules43: • Army Air Command; • Special Operations Brigade; and • Anti-aircraft Artillery Brigade. The strategic conception of employment and the operational environment indicate the nature, organization and material which are to be used by the Land Force. From this premise, brigades are organized and trained to act mainly in their areas of specialization. Equipment In addition to human resources, the Land Force possesses the following equipment, in order to meet its Constitutional mission: 43 A combat module of a brigade is the lowest ranking unit of the Land Force which gathers under a single command the main operational systems (maneuver, intelligence, command and control, fire suppression, mobility, counter-mobility and protection, anti-air aircraft defense and logistics), allowing combined training of arms and services. This combination must integrate combat units (infantry and cavalry), combat support units (engineering, artillery and communications) and logistics units, with specific tasks, which compose the operational systems. The combat module is able to act independently and to endure in action.

Military manpower, which is compatible with the Country’s political and strategic stature, is essential. The Army develops capabilities, whether jointly with the other Forces or separately, to meet three requirements simultaneously: secure the defense of the territory, project power in order to secure vital interests and meet foreign policy demands for security, international peace and regional integration. These capabilities require Forces at a high level of readiness, supported by others formed by the mobilization of material and human resources. Based on lessons learned from contemporary wars and trends of future conflicts, the Army develops its resources based on capabilities, since this approach provides the institution with effective tools to respond to diffuse challenges in future. \r   \r   \r   \r   DEFENSE WHITE PAPER124 C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T The following new capabilities are considered priorities for the Army: • land determent compatible with the country’s political and strategic status; • international projection of the Army in support of Brazil’s foreign policy; • performance in cyberspace with freedom of action; • Land Force logistics readiness; • interoperability (with other Forces) and complementarity (with other agencies); • integrated management at all levels; • effective military doctrine; • higher emphasis on the human dimension; • adequate budget; • defense products linked to operational capacity; and • systemic management of operational data. Strategic Vision and Goals The Army is a public and permanent national institution. It is a fundamental instrument for the security and defense of the Brazilian state. The internal and external acknowledgement of the Army’s capacity to fulfill its mission demonstrates the Force’s relevance to the society it serves. Such relevance must be permanently sustained through the understanding of the people’s needs, of the state’s demands and the conditions imposed by the environment. The Army has sought to modernize its equipment and armament, as well as the quality of its personnel. However, to meet strategic demands, it has become evident that, beyond adapting and modernizing, the Army must adopt the concept of transformation. Transformation refers to the development of capabilities to comply with new duties, whether derived from the present operational environment or from future challenges. This concept is detailed in chapter 5. Consistent with the dynamic development of the strategic environment, the Army started a Transformation Process which will be continuous and oriented by a Force Project. Both Process and Project are inserted into the Planning System of the Army. The Army Staff completed a diagnostic of the Land Force, based on the National Defense Strategy, and proposed actions for its adaptation to new demands of the state and the Brazilian people. This initiative has resulted in the Strong Arm Strategy (EBF). 125DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T The following premises, established by the National Defense Strategy, were considered in the preparation of the Strong Arm Strategy: • the Army will be organized under the aegis of the trinomial monitoring/control, mobility and presence; • it must have strategic mobility to response quickly to any threat or aggression; • it must deploy its strategic reserves in way that allows for fast concentration and employment of Forces; • it must deepen the presence of military units in the frontiers; • it must develop the concept of flexibility in combat in order to meet monitoring/ control, mobility and presence requirements; • it must develop the principle of elasticity, which is the capacity to quickly increase the quantity of troops; and • the Amazon region is of great interest for the Ministry of Defense and the Army must be able to deploy equipment and personnel in this area. The Strong Arm Strategy is composed of a Deployment Plan, which determines the positioning of personnel in order to meet the strategic concepts of employment, presence and determent, and to attend to requirements of an Equipment Plan. The former comprises the Protected Amazon Program and the Homeland Sentinel Program. The latter comprises the Strategic Mobility Program and the Brazilian Combatant Program. These plans are aligned to the Defense Deployment and Equipment Plan (PAED). The Strong Arm Strategy therefore comprehends the following programs: MODERNIZATION CRITICAL AREAS TRANSFORMATION/ STRENGTH PROJECT DEPLOYMENT PROTECTED AMAZON HOMELAND SENTINEL EQUIPMENT STRATEGIC MOBILITY BRAZILIAN COMBATANT CORE ACTIVITY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL DOCTRINE PREPARATION LOGISTICS ENGINEERING EDUCATION HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT PROCESS/ PRODUCTS BUDGET AND FUNDING MEM AND SCIENCE &TECHNOLOGY EM PL O YM EN T STRENGTH PROJECT Army’s Transformation Project DEFENSE WHITE PAPER126 C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T • Protected Amazon Program — a set of projects aimed at strengthening the presence of the Land Force in the Amazon. It includes the progressive installation of new Special Frontier Platoons, as well as the modernization of existent ones. In a second stage, the Program determines actions for the strengthening of the operational and logistics structure of the Amazon Command. Simultaneously, the Army will implement a Border Monitoring System (SISFRON), through the use of electronic and radar means, such as the SABER M60 and others to be developed, in integration with other military and civilian systems, with the purpose of optimizing the capacity of monitoring around 16 thousand kilometers of border area in the Amazon, Midwest and Southern regions; • Homeland Sentinel Program — includes the reorganization, the improvement and, especially, the integration of logistics and operational structures of the area commands. As aforementioned, the Amazon Command is contemplated in the Protected Amazon Program; • Strategic Mobility Program — aims to attend to the Army’s needs in terms of replacements and material modernization, in order to improve mobility, flexibility and interoperability with other Armed Forces; and • Brazilian Combatant Program — includes projects dedicated to the research and development of Defense products, the priority being the growth of nationalization and acquisitions in the internal market.

Education — Main Training Centers Army Academy (AMAN) The Army Academy originated in 1792, with the creation of the Royal Academy of Artillery, Fortification and Design, in Rio de Janeiro — the first military school of the Americas. During the 19th century, the name was successively changed to Royal Military Academy, Imperial Military Academy and Military Academy of the Royal Court. From 1906 to 1910, this institution functioned at the War School in Porto Alegre (State of Rio Grande do Sul), and in 1913, at the Military School of Realengo (State of Rio de Janeiro). It was only on January 1st 1944 that the Army Academy was installed in a permanent site in Resende (State of Rio de Janeiro). In 1951, the institution was officially designated the name of Army Academy. The Academy develops the Army’s career combat officers. The undergraduate program activities are carried out to develop necessary qualities for the military profession. The Program lasts five years. The first year is undertaken in the Army Cadets Preparatory School (EsPCEx), located in Campinas (State of São Paulo). The remaining four years are studies at the Army Academy itself. The curriculum includes subjects related to military and exact sciences, as well as humanities. On concluding the program, the graduate is declared officer candidate and is granted a military sciences degree. Admittance to the Army Academy occurs exclusive through national competitive exams for the Army Cadets Preparatory School. The founder of the Army Academy was Marshall José Pessoa Cavalcanti de Albuquerque, who chose the location for the new building, conceived the project for the institution and reinstated the title of “cadet”, which had been abandoned at the time of the proclamation of the Republic. He also determined the use of historic uniforms and created the “Short Sword of the Duke of Caxias”.

Throughout the teaching process, the cadet develops humanistic, scientific and technological knowledge necessary for a career in the Army. In the Academy, the cadet acquires a technical and military foundation, through training and exercises, in order to be able, as a future officer, to exert command and leadership of small groups (platoons and sections) and of subunits (companies, batteries or squads). Junior Officer School (EsAO) Founded in April 8, 1920, by the Minister of War Dr. João Pandiá Calógeras, the Junior Officer School has the mission of developing captains, enabling them to command and lead military units and preparing them for the exercise of staff duties which are not reserved for the active duty Army Staff group. The program offered by this School lasts two years. The first year is undertaken through distance learning, the second year requires class attendance.

Its mission is to prepare senior ranking officers for staff, command, leadership, management and advisory roles in the highest ranks of the Land Force. The College also cooperates with general and specialised organisations in the Army in the field of doctrine for force development and employment. All Command and Staff College programs are of graduate level and taught in accordance with the country’s legislation on university education and the Army’s education regulations. The Command and Staff College is increasing its relationship with similar military schools in the Navy (Naval War College), in the Air Force (Air Force Command and Staff College) and with civilian universities. Currently, it also accepts in its programs military personnel from friendly nations, mainly from South America and Africa. Military Engineering Institute (IME) Located in the city of Rio de Janeiro, the Military Engineering Institute originated from the merger of the Army’s Technical School and the Military Institute of Technology, in 1959. The Military Engineering Institute has the mission of developing officers for the Army’s Military Engineering Group (QEM). The following programs are offered: undergraduate degree, exclusively for officers from the Army Academy; undergraduate degree and basic military training for young civilians who finished high school; and basic training program for graduate engineers who wish to join the Army. It also offers Masters and PhD degrees for civilian and military personnel. Furthermore, the Institute plans, coordinates controls and executes competitive examinations for admittance and the selective recruitment process for the Army’s Military Engineering Group. The quality of the Institute’s programs is apparent from the excellent results which it regularly obtains in the Programs General Index (IGC)44. It is always among the 14 best institutions, out of over two thousand participants. The Army Technological Project determines the transfer of the Military Engineering Institute from its current facilities to Guaratiba (State of Rio de Janeiro), near the Army Technology Center (CTEx). New and modern buildings, with state-of-the-art equipment, and proximity to civilian and military research and development organization will allow the Institute to reach higher levels of excellence in its activities. The study on IME transfer and updating process is in a conclusion stage. 44 The Programs General index (iGc) evaluates the performance of university level institutions in the country. it synthesizes in one index the quality of all undergraduate, masters and Phd degrees in an educational institution. The index is published by the Anísio Teixeira National institute for educational studies and research (inep) of the ministry of education, immediately after the results of the National students Performance exam (enade) is published.

Its mission is to: develop active duty officers of the Medical Doctors’ Group of the Army’s Health Service; coordinate graduate programs for Health Service officers, as well as other programs for military personnel of the Complementary Group in the fields of Nursing, Veterinarian Science and Psychology; contribute to the development of military doctrine in the health area; carry out research in Health Studies, in cooperation with similar institutions; offer internships in the health area; and administrate competitive examinations for admittance into military health programs. Army School of Administrative and Technical Studies (EsFCEx) The Army Administrative and Technical School was created on April 5, 1988 with the name of Army School of Administration. Located in the city of Salvador (BA), the School began its activities by offering programs for Army career officers and enlisted men. On October 2, 1989, Law No 7,831 created the Complementary Officers Group to meet changes required by the modernization of the institution. From then on, the School took charge of the education of officers for this new Group. The School currently develops men and women with previous degrees in different fields from university level institutions acknowledged by the Ministry of Education. Applicants to the School must pass competitive exams, of national scope. Once admitted, they then attend the Program for Officers of the Complementary Group (CFO/QC) which enables them to perform and assume responsibilities and roles of Army officers, within their field of expertise. On November 8, 2010, the Ministerial Regulation No 1,080 transformed the Army School of Administration into the Army School of Administrative and Technical Studies, changing its mission and organization. Besides officers of the Complementary Group, the School began, from then on, to develop officers in the professions of dentistry and pharmacy. Combat Sergeant School (EsSA) Located in the city of Três Corações (State of Minas Gerais) the Combat Sergeant School is the military educational institution in charge of selecting and educating sergeants in the professions of Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery, Engineering and Communications. The program, which lasts one year and a half, develops students so that they are able to exercise roles in military organizations. 131DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T Logistics Sergeant School (EsSLog) Located in the city of Rio de Janeiro, this School was established in 2010 due to the transformation of the School of Military Materiel. It is the military educational institution responsible for selecting and educating sergeants in the professions of supply management, communications maintenance, vehicles maintenance, weapons maintenance, topography and music. The School’s main purpose is the professional development of the Army’s logistics sergeant. All curriculum activities seek to enable students to exercise specialized roles within Army organizations. Senior Combat Sergeant School (EASA) The Senior Combat Sergeant School was established on July 10, 1992, with the name of Sergeant Training Center — South, subordinated to the Southern Command, in the quarters of the 17th Infantry Battalion. The School has the mission of further educating sergeants of the Brazilian Army. To achieve this purpose, it offers the Further Studies Program for Sergeants (CAS) of the Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery, Engineering and Communications professions, thereby enabling them to exercise roles at their rank level, including in administrative areas. Scientific and Technological Institutions Army Technology Center (CTEx) Established in 1979, in Rio de Janeiro, the Army Technology Center is a military organization directly subordinated to the Department of Science and Technology. Its mission is to conduct research and development of defense products of interest to the Land Force. To accomplish this goal, the Center, on occasion, engages in partnerships with national companies for the joint development of products and receives financial support from the Studies and Projects Fund (FINEP) of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI). These partnerships were celebrated, for example, to develop the SABER M60 radars. Among the projects under development by the Army Technology Center, the following are noteworthy: • radar SABER M60 — the project contemplates a low altitude anti-aircraft defense system, which protects sensitive points and areas; C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T DEFENSE WHITE PAPER132 • anti-vehicle light weapon — developed by Army Technology Center in partnership with national companies, it is a weapon of individual use for anti-vehicle combat at close quarters; • missile MSS 1.2 AC — has the objective of attending to the demands of modern combat, including high level of mobility, strong fire power and the capacity to engage different types of targets; and • flight simulator for Esquilo and Fennec helicopters — a product of the Army Technology Center, developed in partnership with a national company, it aims to train Army pilots. Foreign Exchange and Cooperation The Army maintains a series of exchange and international cooperation activities with other nations.

Maria Quiteria is considered to be the first Brazilian woman to enlist in a military unit. However, it was only in 1943, during World War II, that women were officially admitted into the Brazilian Army. In that year 73 nurses (67 of them based in hospitals and six specialized in air transport) were recruited. These volunteers served in four different United States Army hospitals. After the war, as with the rest of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB), the majority of nurses were awarded medals, promoted to officer ranks and placed on leave from regular military service. In 1992, the Army Administration School in Salvador (BA) enrolled the Army’s first student cohort which included women — 49 in total, approved in competitive examinations. The Army instituted, in 1996, the female volunteer military service for medical doctors, dentists, pharmacists, veterinarians and nurses with undergraduate degrees. In the same year, the first class of 290 volunteer women was incorporated into the Army to render military service in the healthcare area. In 1997 the Military Engineering Institute enrolled its first 10 female students into the Military Engineers’ Group (QEM). Also in 1997, the Army Health School (EsSEx) enrolled and educated its first cohort of university-level female medical doctors, dentists, pharmacists, veterinarians and nurses for the Army Officer Health Group. In 1998, the Army instituted a technical traineeship for graduates from other fields. In that year, to meet institutional demands, it incorporated the first cohort of female lawyers, business administrators, accountants, teachers, systems analysts, engineers, architects, journalists, among other professionals, totaling 519 women.

In 2011 the Army Command and Staff College awarded, for the first time since its establishment, certificates to three female officers. The female officers (and medical doctors) concluded the Leadership and General Staff Program for officers of the Health Group. They therefore have the possibility to compete, in future, for promotion to General Officer rank. The Army’s greatest asset is motivated men and women, who are able to fulfill their missions. Therefore, in order to correct a legal gap, the Executive Branch has proposed a bill to allow women to be admitted into more military programs which develop Army career personnel, taking into account the peculiarities of military life.

In 1916 the Navy founded the Naval Aviation School, in the Island of Enxadas, in the city of Rio de Janeiro. In 1919, the Army created the Military Aviation School at Campo dos Afonsos, a neighborhood of the same city. In 1941, during World War II, the Ministry of Aeronautics45, was created from the merger of aerial and human resources from the Army, Navy and Civil Aviation Department. Its armed branch was initially called National Air Forces, and in June of same year, it became called Brazilian Air Force. It is noteworthy that, in 1932, the first flight of the Military Air Mail (CAM) departed from Campo dos Afonsos. This service was later replaced by the National Air Mail (CAN), which has been of great importance for national integration. 45 The first minister of the Air Force was a lawyer and political leader named Joaquim Pedro salgado Filho.

It took part in the anti-submarine campaign of the South Atlantic and in air combat over Italy, on the side of the Allies. With the establishment of the Ministry of Defense in 1999, the Ministry of Aeronautics, similarly to the other Armed Services, was subordinated to this new ministry and renamed Brazilian Air Force. The challenges faced by the Brazilian Air Force are proportional to the country’s dimensions. The continental dimensions of the Brazilian airspace which needs to be patrolled, controlled and defended, as well as the complexity of the international environment, generate multiple demands for the Air Force, which in turn requires modern and efficient means to meet these challenges. Mission The Air Force is responsible for maintaing sovereignty over the national airspace in order to defend the homeland. In particular, it must stop any acts hostile to national interests. To achieve its purpose, the Air Force relies on its capacity for surveillance, control, and defense of the national air space, through resources of detection, interception and destruction. The Air Force has the following subsidiary roles: • provide security for airspace navigation; • establish, equip and operate aerospace, aerial and airport infrastructure under its responsibility; • operate the National Air Mail; • cooperate with federal agencies in the area of law enforcement involving the use of airspace and airport areas, through the provision of logistics, intelligence, communications and training; and • act in a continuous and permanent manner, alongside the judicial police services, through airspace control, against all types of illicit air traffic, especially the traffic of drugs, weapons, ammunitions and illegal passengers. For the performance of this last role, the Air Force acts in cooperation with inspection agencies, which take action after landing of aircrafts involved in illegal air traffic. In the absence of lack of these agencies, the Air Force may inspect people, land vehicles, boats and aircrafts, as well as arrest individuals engaged in flagrant infractions. Considering the nature of these roles, the Air Force Chief of Staff is officially designated “Military Air Authority”.

The Air Force’s Strategic Military Plan (PEMAER) is a product of the Planning System. This Plan reaffirms projects and actions contained in the Defense Deployment and Equipment Plan (PAED), sets the objectives for the Air Force for an intended period and guides the prioritization process of budget resources, while defining duties and responsibilities. Based on a methodology developed by the Air Force, a strategy for planning and action was conceived, which sets three structural axes described below. I. Strengthening operational capacity This axis has the following main objectives: supply the necessary means for the safe and efficient circulation of both civilian and military air traffic in Brazilian airspace; and contribute to the defense of national sovereignty, through aircraft development, acquisition and modernization. Main benefits: • effective capacity for surveillance, control and defense of airspace over vulnerable points and areas of the national territory, based on resources for detection, interception and destruction; • stronger military capacity to integrate main efforts for defending the nation. Actions related to Air Force re-equipment would be prioritized; and • assimilation of knowledge which will allow the country to achieve technological independence in the airspace sector. II. Scientific-technological training and education Planning regarding the aerospace scientific-technological complex is guided by the continual effort to educate and train human resources, as well as acquire physical capital, in order to attain full knowledge over the technologies required. To achieve this purpose, the Air Force allocates special attention to research as well as technological and industrial development in the aerospace sector. Main benefits: • contribution to the reduction of foreign dependence, in straight cooperation with national industry, especially in the aerospace sector, through the gradual nationalization of equipment and services; 149DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T • adequate plans to support national industry by promoting associations, participations and acquisitions that secure competitiveness, with the aim of promoting exports; and • human resources development in the field of Air Force related technology. III. Organizational and operational transformation The Air Force transformation process seeks to identify the ideal dimensions and structure for the organization, in order to eliminate strategic vulnerabilities, and thereby allow the Air Force to carry out its mission of National Defense and of promoting the country’s development. Main benefits: • full knowledge of advanced technologies, through the modernization of human resources education and training systems; • maximization of operational and management effectiveness within the Air Force, in accordance with new operational capacities and concepts, which require organizational change; • appreciation of Air Force professionals through the improvement of support structures; and • promotion of relations that expedite planning and interoperability with other Armed Services, and that favors the deployment, employment and support to the Air Force. Education - Main Institutions Air Force Academy (AFA) The Air Force Academy replaced the Aeronautics School, an institution originally located in Campo dos Afonsos, which developed aviation and logistics officers for the Air Force since the creation of the Ministry of Aeronautics in 1941. The name changed from Aeronautics School to Air Force Academy in 1969. In 1971, the Academy was transferred to new facilities in Pirassununga (State of São Paulo). It is now responsible for developing cadets through the Pilot Officers Program (CFOAV), the Logistics Officers Program (CFOINT) and the Infantry Officers Program (CFOINF). These undergraduate degree programs last four years and prepare officers for the initial ranks of the Air Force in the aviation, logistics and infantry careers. The majority of first- year vacancies are filled by students from the Air Cadets Preparatory School (EPCAr), a high school level Air Force institution located in Barbacena (State of Minas Gerais), which DEFENSE WHITE PAPER150 C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T offers a three-year program. The remaining places are filled through an open competitive selection process. On concluding fourth year, the cadet is declared an officer candidate and is granted a Bachelor of Science in Aeronautical Science. Air Force University (UNIFA) Established in 1983 and located in the city of Rio de Janeiro, the Air Force University is linked to the Air Force Department of Education (DEPENS). It has the purpose of planning, guiding, coordinating and controlling programs aimed at further studies and advanced military studies, which are required for preparing officers for the highest ranks. The University also offers Master’s and PhD degrees as well as graduate certificates and internships. The Air Force Command and General Staff College (ECEMAR) and the Air Force Junior Officer School (EAOAR) are subordinated to the University. Air Force Command and Staff College (ECEMAR) The Air Force Command and Staff College was instituted in 1947, in Rio de Janeiro. It offers advanced studies programs to Air Force senior officers. The College is in charge of Air Force Academy — Pirassununga (State of São Paulo) 151DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T updating student knowledge on aerospace power, air war and management within the Air Force, through the Aerospace Policy and Strategy Program (CPEA) and the Command and Staff Program (CCEM). Air Force Junior Officer School (EAOAR) The Air Force Junior Officer School was established in 1953, in Guarulhos (State of São Paulo), and later transferred to Rio de Janeiro. It has the mission of educating and training junior officers, with the aim of developing specific competencies for the exercise of administrative, advisory and operational roles, through the Air Force Junior Officer Program (CAP). Technological Institute of Aeronautics (ITA) The Technological Institute of Aeronautics was established in 1950 and is located in São Jose dos Campos (State of São Paulo). It is a university-level institution specialized in the field of aerospace and managed by the Air Force. It has the purpose of promoting progress in science and technology related to the field of aerospace through education, training and research. In particular, the Institute is in charge of providing education to graduates in key areas of interest for the Air Force and the aerospace sector in general. The institute is subordinated to the Department of Aerospace Science and Technology (DCTA). It is an essential element for the development of the scientific-technological aerospace sector. The excellence of the programs offered by ITA are evidenced by the exceptional results which this institution regularly achieves in the Courses General Index (IGC).

It is currently being transferred from Pampulha, in Belo Horizonte (State of Minas Gerais), to Lagoa Santa (State of Minas Gerais). It is responsible for training civilians and military personnel for future employment as Air Force officers. Air Force Sergeant School (EEAR) The Air Force Sergeant School was created in 1941 through the merger of human and physical capital from the Navy and Army aviations. The Sergeant School was initially located in the Ponta do Galeão, Governor’s Island, in the city of Rio de Janeiro. In 1950, it was transferred to Guaratinguetá (State of São Paulo) where it remains to this day. This School is charged with developing Air Force sergeants. Scientific and Technological Institutions Aeronautics and Space Institute (IAE) The Aeronautics and Space Institute was created from the merger, in 1991, of the Research and Development Institute (IPD) and the Space Activities Institute (IAE). Its mission is to conduct research and development in the field of aerospace. This Institute has been developing scientific and technological solutions to strengthen Brazilian Aerospace Power. In particularly, it manages the satellite launching vehicle project, the sounding rockets project and the unmanned aerial vehicle project, among others. Advanced Studies Institute (IEAv) The Advanced Studies Institute originated from the fusion of the Advanced Studies Laboratory and the Advanced Studies Division, both belonging to the now extinguished Aerospace Technical Center (CTA). With the activation of the Technical Aerospace Command, the Advanced Studies Institute became a military organization of the Air Force, specifically assigned to the development of experimental technologies and the study of liquid propellants and supersonic combustion technology, among other affairs. 153DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T 153 Industrial Promotion and Coordination Institute (IFI) The Industrial Promotion and Coordination Institute was established in 1967. Its mission is to contribute to the performance, security and availability of aerospace products and systems that are of interest to the Air Force. It renders services in the areas of legislation, metrology, certification, intellectual property, technological transference and industrial coordination. Thus, this Institute promotes the Brazilian scientific-technological aerospace industry. The Institute is recognized by the International Accreditation Forum (IAF) as an organization that certifies quality management systems and aerospace quality management systems. Foreign Exchange and International Cooperation The Air Force maintains a series of exchange and cooperation activities with foreign nations, especially with South American and African countries. The Brazilian Air Force Technical Mission (MTAB) in Paraguay, established in 1982 is noteworthy. Its objective is to supply technical, operational and administrative assistance to the Air Force of said country.

In the following year the first cohort of this Corps was incorporated in Campo dos Afonsos, Rio de Janeiro. On that occasion, 150 women were admitted to the Air Force — psychologists, nurses, systems analysts, social assistants, phono-audiologists, nutritionists and librarians — selected from across the country. Women, therefore, have been part of the administrative life of the Air Force for three decades. In the Air Force Academy — where the military personnel that are allowed to achieve the highest ranks of the Air Force are trained and educated — women began to be admitted in 1996, in the Logistics Officer Program. In 2006, the Air Force graduated its first cohort of female military pilots. Female Air Force officers of the aviation, logistics, infantry, health and aeronautics engineering careers are allowed to be promoted to General Officer ranks, while competing in equal conditions for promotions with male officers. Currently, the Brazilian Air Force employs approximately four thousand women.

The Defense Structure is composed of the following officials: I. President of the Republic; II. Minister of Defense; III. Defense Council; IV. Armed Forces Chiefs of Staff; V. Chief of the Joint Staff; and VI. Commanders of Operational Commands. The President of the Republic, as commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces, assisted by the Minister of Defense, and by the Defense Council, is responsible for the employment of military resources and for the strategic direction of the Armed Forces, as provided in Article 2 of Complementary Law No 97 of June 9, 1999. The Armed Forces have their own structure and are subordinated to the Minister of Defense. The Joint Staff (EMCFA) is the permanent advisory institution of the Minister of Defense for the direction of the Armed Forces. The Joint Staff prepares and coordinates the planning of joint employment in operations that involve military personnel and resources. In face of crisis or armed conflict, the President of the Republic approves a strategic plan for employment and appoints Commanders of Operational Commands. Once activated, each Operational Command is responsible for a geographical area — Theater of Operations — where the Commander has the authority to conduct military operations in order to reach selected and approved objectives. The Operational Commanders present to the Minister of Defense an overview of operations to be conducted and a proposal for the allocation of resources to their respective Commands. The Armed Forces Chiefs of Staff supply the resources allocated by the Minister of Defense to the Operational Commanders and provide the necessary logistical support. 157DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T Joint Operations Doctrine The development of the Armed Forces, based on their operational capacities, allows the Ministry of Defense to possess military forces that are able to act jointly, with flexibility, versatility and mobility. Military operations of extended scope demand the employment of considerable resources from more than one Armed Service. To meet this challenge, the Armed Forces must join efforts, adopt compatible procedures and integrate actions in order to obtain greater efficiency and effectiveness in the execution of joint operations. The Joint Staff prepares the Strategic Plans for the Joint Employment of the Armed Forces (PECFA) and coordinates joint Armed Forces training and employment. The planning of a joint operation, though similar to any other operation, is distinct in terms of the heterogeneity of employment procedures and of the technical peculiarities of the participating Forces. Hence the importance of coordination and integration of planned actions through a joint operations doctrine. The joint operations doctrine sets conditions for the synchronization of naval, land and aerial actions, in order to attain strategic and operational objectives, in accordance with political, diplomatic and economic efforts. The goal is to be effective through the synergy of Force Components within the Operational Command operating in a certain Theater of Operations. Theater of Operations (TO) The Theater of Operations can be on land or sea and is comprised of the necessary area for operations to be conducted, including the respective logistical support. The Armed Forces that act in a TO are under a single Operational Command. The single Command allows the coordination of actions and greater interoperability among Forces, avoiding duplicate efforts and favoring the reduction of losses. An Operational Command will be of a joint nature whenever it is formed by more than one Force. On the other hand, each Force Component, integrating a Joint Operational Command, may be either of singular or joint nature. A Force Component will be of a singular nature whenever it is constituted of resources from just one of Force. In this case the Force Component will receive the name Naval Force Component, Land Force Component or Air Force Component.

In this case, they may be called Joint Task Force (Ft Cj) or Joint Force (F Cj), for example: Special Operations Joint Force (F Cj Op Esp), Logistic Command (C Log) etc. These military Forces must share areas of operation and carry out actions with a single objective, which requires a high degree of interoperability. This requires mutual knowledge and exchange of information and services regarding: employed forces; common procedures; standardization of plans and document; and equipment employed. Interoperability in Joint Operations Several Force Components coexist in the Theater of Operations, sharing the sea, land and aerial environments in a coordinated way, conducting actions for the achievement of missions. The Theater of Operations Command synchronizes the Force Components in order to reach strategic and operational objectives. The goal is to obtain effectiveness through the synergy of the various resources in the Theater.

The employment of the Armed Services in this type of operation is fundamentally different, in principles and doctrine, from their traditional employment in missions related to defense against foreign threats. In the latter, action is focused on enemy forces that are perfectly identifiable in the field and usually characterized by conventional military weaponry and uniforms. The peculiarities of this type of action has fostered the creation of a school for the study and research on the field. The Law and Order Operations Training Center (CIOpGLO), in Campinas (State of São Paulo), subordinated to the 11th Light Infantry Brigade, seeks to modernize doctrine and the development of human resources for this type of employment. The employment of the Armed Forces in law and order operations is the prerogative of the President of the Republic as provided in Article 15 of Complementary Law No 97 of 199947. The Law specifies that following presidential orders, the Armed Forces’ operational units will be activated to carry out the preventive and repressive actions necessary to ensure the expected results, in an episodic manner, within a previously established area and for a limited time. 47 Altered by complementary Laws No117 of 2004 and No136 of 2010.

The latter should establish an operations coordination center, comprised of representatives of the public agencies under his operational control or with related interests. Brazilian legislation highlights the subsidiary nature of the Armed Forces’ intervention, which should only occur “when all other means assigned to the preservation of public order and the safety of the people and their property are exhausted”, as determined in Article 144 of the Federal Constitution. Presidential Decree No 3,897 of 2001 determines that public security means are considered exhausted whenever, within a certain period of time, they become unavailable, inexistent or insufficient for the regular performance of their constitutional mission. It is also noteworthy that — as provided in Article 5 of same decree — the Armed Forces may be employed to ensure law and order in situations when disturbances are presumable, such as in official and public events, particularly those in which heads of states or of a foreign governments participate, or on elections, upon request by the Electoral High Court. Usually, the Armed Forces are employed to ensure law and order jointly with federal, state and municipal security agencies. Contemporary Examples of Military Force Employment Brazil’s Participation in the World Wars Brazil’s participation in the First World War was motivated by a series of episodes involving Brazilian ships in Europe. For example, in April of 1917, the merchant vessel “Paraná” was sunk near the English Channel. During the following months, other Brazilian merchant vessels were sunk as well. President Wenceslau Bras made an alliance with the countries of the Triple Entente and, even without substantial military power, Brazil supported them, logistically, with agricultural and raw materials. In compliance with commitments to the Inter-allied Conference, the Brazilian government sent a medical mission comprised of civilian and military surgeons, to act in campaign hospitals in the European Theater of Operations, a number of aviation officers, from the 161DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T Army and the Navy, to join the Allied Air Force and, also, part of the Fleet, essentially to conduct anti-submarine warfare. In order to meet the Navy’s duties, the organization of a task force named “Naval Division for Operations of War” (DNOG) was established. It was constituted of ships from the Brazilian Fleet divisions. The following vessels joined the DNOG: the cruisers “Rio Grande do Sul” and “Bahia”, the destroyers “Piauí”, “Rio Grande do Norte”, “Paraíba” and “Santa Catarina”, the supply ship “Belmonte” and the tugboat “Laurindo Pitta”. The total naval contingent was approximately 1.5 thousand men. The division was charged with patrolling an area within a maritime triangle, which extended from the city of Dakar, in the African coast to the island of São Vicente, in the Cape Verde archipelago, and Gibraltar, in the Mediterranean. The participation of Brazil in World War II was also strongly motivated by the successive sinking of Brazilian merchant vessels. In reaction to popular pressure, Brazil declared war on the Axis powers on August 1942. The participation of the country in this conflict was more significant than during the First World War. Brazilian operations in the South Atlantic started almost at once. The Navy controlled the navigation routes between North and South America. It also participated in joint and combined operations, including the air-naval patrol, protection and escort of naval convoys and preventive actions to impede attacks by the Axis powers on Brazilian soil.

It protected the country’s international trade and ensured necessary supplies for the nation. The Army sent approximately 25 thousand men to fight in Europe against the Axis powers. The Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB) integrated the Fifth US Army. After heavy losses, the FEB’s first successful operation was the siege Monte Castello Fortress, which was occupied and garrisoned by a highly capable enemy division. Following this success, the FEB carried out its subsequent missions with equally impressive results. The first enemy force to surrender in Italy did so to FEB personnel, the so called “Smoking Snakes”48. During the World War II Italian campaign, the FEB took custody of over 20 thousand prisoners. The Brazilian Air Force was created during World War II, in 1941. In 1942, it began to carry out engagements in the patrol of Brazilian waters. In 1943, the 1st Fighter Group was created. In the same year, a Brazilian Air Force aircraft sank an Axis submarine in the coast of Rio de Janeiro. The 1st Fighter Group operated in Italy from 1944 and integrated the 350th US Fighter Group. It executed over two thousand missions and distinguished itself as one of three foreign air units to be awarded a United States Presidential Unit Citation. 48 The brazilian expeditionary Force adopted the smoking snake as symbol due to what was said at the time: that it would be easier to see a snake smoking than to see brazil at war. illustration of a brazilian soldier in World War ii and the brazilian expeditionary Force symbol — the smoking snake 163DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T Also worth noting is the participation in Italy of the 1st Liaison and Observation Squadron, which acted jointly with the Divisionary Artillery, both units of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force. In this joint action, the aircraft crews were formed by Air Force pilots and by Army air observers, whose task it was to regulate artillery fire. Brazil’s Participation in Peacekeeping Missions Since 1947, the country participates in United Nations peacekeeping missions, having already contributed with over 30 thousand military and police personnel. It has integrated operations in Africa (Congo, Angola, Mozambique, Liberia, Uganda and Sudan), in Central America and the Caribbean (El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Haiti), in Asia (Cambodia and East-Timor) and in Europe (Cyprus and Croatia). Brazil assigned troops to Suez (UNEF), Angola (UNAVEM), Mozambique (ONUMOZ), East-Timor (UNTAET/UNMISET), Haiti (MINUSTAH) and, recently, in Lebanon (UNIFIL). An important example of Brazilian participation in peacekeeping missions is the presence of a contingent of the Armed Forces in Haiti, since 2004, in the United Nations Stabilizing Mission — MINUSTAH. Brazil supplies over two thousand Army, Navy and Air Force military personnel, the largest contingent among the 15 participating countries and holds the command of this Peacekeeping Force. The MINUSTAH was created by resolution of the United Nations Security Council. It contributes to the reestablishment of institutional normality in Haiti after a long period of political instability. illustration of an aircraft of the brazilian Air Force in World War ii and the symbol of the Air Force in the conflict DEFENSE WHITE PAPER164 C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T The MINUSTAH’s role in ensuring the presidential elections of 2006 and 2010, with peaceful transition of power, are noteworthy. As is the relevant role of the United Nations Mission in reconstructing Haiti after the severe earthquake of January 2010. The work undertaken by the Brazilian military is acknowledged by the Haitian people and by international authorities. This is due to the military’s particular form of action, a result of prior training received and its own professional expertise acquired with time. The Haiti mission also allows participating Forces to improve their operational and logistical systems, as well as maintain exchanges with troops from other nations. In coordination with the UN and other UNASUL countries which integrate the Mission, Brazil plans a gradual withdrawal of its troops from Haiti, in accordance with the desire and capacity of the Haitian government to guarantee the country’s security. Another recent example of Brazil’s participation in peacekeeping missions is the Brazilian presence in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). In February 2011, a Brazilian Admiral took office as Commander of the Maritime Task Force (MTF) of the UNIFIL. The MTF was established in 2006 and is the first Naval Task Force to integrate a UN Peacekeeping Mission. It is assigned to prevent the entrance of illegal brazilian participation in ongoing peacekeeping and humanitarian missions UNIOGBIS — 2010 Guinea-Bissau (PM only) UNOWA — 2007 Senegal MINURSO — 2007 Western Sahara UNIFICYP — 1995 Cyprus UNIFIL — 2011 Lebanon (Only MB) UNIMISS — 2011 UNISFA — 2011 South Sudan UNMIT — 2006 East Timor UNOCI — 2003 Ivory Coast UNMIL — 2004 Liberia MARMINAS — 2003 Ecuador and Peru GP Mon Inter — 2006 Colombia MINUSTAH — 2004 Haiti Key OAE UN 165DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T weapons into Lebanon, as well as to train the Lebanese Navy’s personnel.

Armed Forces’ Role in Ensuring Law and Order The participation of the Brazilian military in a Pacification Force for the Complexo do Alemão and Complexo da Penha — both low income suburban neighborhoods of the city of Rio de Janeiro — is another, of several, examples of the Armed Forces’ work aiming to fulfill their constitutional mission. This Pacification Force was created by the Ministry of Defense in 2010, by order of the President of the Republic, in order to cooperate with the Government of the State of Rio de Janeiro in the establishment of law and order, following illegalities committed by organized crime. The “Alemão-Penha” neighborhoods were occupied following coordinated action by the Army, Navy and the State of Rio de Janeiro’s Military Police Force. The Pacification Force, established under the authority of the Army’s Eastern Command, acted to ensure the safety of the population until police personnel could be prepared to occupy Police Pacification Units (UPP) in the communities. Besides these operations, the military also undertook civic and social activities (ACISO)49, with the aim of improving the quality of life of over 400 thousand dwellers in those neighborhoods. 49 concept in detail in chapter 4. 167DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T C H A P T E R 3 — D E F E N S E A N D T H E M IL IT A R Y I N S T R U M E N T Pacification Force Data Force Quantity of military personnel Expenditures (R$ Millions) 2011 2012 Total Navy 148 5,4 - 5,4 Army 1,800 198 135,4 333,4 The Ágata Operations are another recent example of Federal troops ensuring Law and Order.

This has significantly affected international relations, the security of the state and its defense system. This new environment requires a high capacity for critical analysis, in order to understand the present context, anticipate future scenarios as well as identify and transform relevant data into state strategy, based on available means. Such long-term demands require a deep and stable relation between society and state. The harmonious interaction between defense organizations and society generates greater dynamism in defense and security policy. This interaction contributes to the continuous improvement of the state’s ability to identify and analyze national security and defense demands. The implementation of the National Defense Policy requires the capacity to incorporate and process a wide range of interests and demands in the national and international spheres. Society must be involved in the moment of choosing priorities and strategies, as well as in monitoring and evaluating government action. The efficient management of the country’s defense resources requires balance between the adequate use of available financial resources and the capabilities desired for the defense establishment. The quality of the implementation of the National Defense Policy reflects the administrative capacity of the government, as well as relations between state and society.

Citizen-Soldier Project The project aims to socially and professionally develop conscripted recruits50 by complementing their civilian education and facilitating their admission into the job market. This initiative began in 2004 and covers the entire national territory. Already 100 thousand young people have benefitted from it. Courses are taught by institutions of good quality. They include introduction to entrepreneurship, ethics and citizenship. Courses are offered according to the demands of the local job market, and considering the preferences of the participants. The following areas, among others are prioritized: telecommunication, engine repair, food production, civil construction, graphic arts, sewing, textile production, electrical repair, commerce, public relations, transportation, information technology and health studies. Approximately 67% of participants enrolled in the Project are awarded professional employment upon completion of their military service. Northern Border Program (Calha Norte) Created by the Federal Government in 1985, the Northern Border Program was initially aimed at promoting the orderly and sustainable occupation and development of the region that lies north of the Amazon River. However, the program was recently extended to the Marajó Island (State of Pará) and to the Southern border of the rivers Solimões/Amazonas, up to the borders of the states of Rondônia and Mato Grosso. The accomplishment of the objectives of this program rely on several actions, such as the construction of highways, ports, bridges, schools, nurseries, hospitals, aerodromes, potable water wells and electric power grids. These actions are greatly beneficial to local communities. The Northern Border Program is of great importance for increasing the presence of public services in an area both poor and vulnerable. It contributes to national defense and integration. The program spans approximately 30% of the national territory, where there are about 8 million people are located, including 46% of Brazil’s indigenous population. 50 the obligatory military service, established by the first brazilian constitution in 1824, is an integration space for all brazilian social groups and their armed forces. the national defense strategy seeks to value the military service, stressing its republican and democratic nature. the military service is open to every citizen, with no class, race or religion distinction. livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y 171DEFENSE WHITE PAPER Besides budget resources directly transferred to the Armed Forces, the Northern Border Program relies on civilian agreements for resource allocation, involving the Ministry of Defense, and the region’s states and municipalities. The three Armed Services participate in the Northern Border as follows: Navy: • river navigation control and security; and • assistance to poor communities in the region. Army: • implementation of basic infrastructure in the region’s municipalities; • establishment of military units; • maintenance of highways; • maintenance of small power stations; and • maintenance of Special Border Platoons’ infrastructure. Air Force: • establishment of military units; • support through logistical air transportation; • maintenance of aerodromes; and • support for communities, with aeromedical evacuation. The Northern Border Program is of political and strategic interest. It is a governmental and multi-sector program involving several public agencies that reaches a wide segment of the Brazilian population in need. Armed Forces in Sports Program The Armed Forces in Sports Program is developed by the Ministry of Defense together with other departments. Its general objective is to promote social integration through the practice of sports. Tutoring, disease prevention and general educational orientation are among the activities of the program. Efforts are concentrated on social inclusion, promotion of public spirit, insertion in the job market as well as physical, sports and leisure activities. Currently, approximately 12 thousand children and adolescents between the ages of seven to seventeen are benefitting from this program. The Armed Forces provide: facilities; medical and odontological services; welfare assistance; coordinators; transportation; and auditors. The Ministry of Sports is responsible for offering sports equipment and paying livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y DEFENSE WHITE PAPER172 President Dilma Rousseff greets children participating in the Armed Forces in Sports Program teachers and trainees; the Ministry of Social Development and Hunger Alleviation is in charge of food provision; and the Ministry of Education is responsible for the supply of educational material. The Rondon Project The Rondon Project is led by the Ministry of Defense. It aims to enable college students to participate in processes of local and sustainable development in Brazilian municipalities, which also strengthen public spirit. The Project was created in 1967 as a result of a sociology paper produced by students from the University of the State Rio de Janeiro (formerly University of the State of Guanabara) and the Army Command and Staff College. The project grants selected municipalities the opportunity to receive professors and college students from different areas of study, who wish to contribute to the community and to collaborate with local leaders to improvement the wellbeing of locals and the efficiency of municipal administration. Participants, so called “rondonistas”, work to generate multipliers whenever possible — producers, public agents, teachers and local leaders — and perform actions with lasting effect for the local population, economy, environment and municipal administration. livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y 173DEFENSE WHITE PAPER College students in the Rondon Project assisting an Amazon community Due to the project’s vast reach, the Armed Forces’ logistical support is indispensable.

The Services act and participate directly with various segments of society. Examples include: the application of Army engineering to construct roads, railways, bridges and water reservoir; aeromedical evacuation by the Air Force in remote regions; and medical support provided by the Navy’s hospital ships. The military also provides humanitarian support in the occurrence of major accidents and calamities, such as: aircraft crashes, shipwrecks, floods, earthquakes and long lasting droughts. The military units of the Armed Forces are present in every region of the country and they actively interact with their local communities. Military personnel participate in a community’s life by engaging in public events and by providing civic and social services, including public health campaigns and support during calamities. They also render services related to: inspection of restricted products; protection of human life; navigational security; airspace control; and search and rescue activities. The employment of the Armed Forces contributes to speed up the Federal Government’s response to contingencies. Further examples of subsidiary and complementary activities are listed below by Armed Service: Navy: • supervises compliance with waterway traffic safety legislation; • controls professional maritime and port training, thereby contributing to the Merchant Navy professionals’ training across the country; • cares for human life at sea and in inland waters, through the Waterway Traffic Security System (ports authorities, maritime police stations and agencies), for navigation safety and for the control of water pollution by ships, drills and support facilities; • attends to poor communities in the Amazon and the Pantanal region (State of Mato- Grosso), through Hospital Ships (NAsH). These are known as Hospital Operations for Riverine Communities (ASSHOP). The Hospital Ships are commonly referred to as “ships of hope” by riverine inhabitants; livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y 175DEFENSE WHITE PAPER Navy hospital ship supporting a riverine community • performs Civic and Social Activities (ACISO) in several of the country’s poor communities, through the restoration of schools and shelters, medical and dental care, and blood donations to local health organizations; and • participates in human aid operations, by assembling campaign hospitals, at home and abroad. livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y DEFENSE WHITE PAPER176 Army assistance for victims of a natural disaster in the city of Nova Friburgo (State of Rio de Janeiro) Army: • supervises the production and trade of restricted products; • executes engineering works in several regions of the country, participating actively in the Growth Acceleration Program (PAC) of the Federal Government; • offers support in situations of public calamities, social emergencies and public health campaigns; • supports indigenous communities in the Amazon region, in the areas of health and education, through the Special Border Platoons; • distributes water in the Northeastern region; and • controls and inspects arms production and trade.

This event marked the 20th anniversary of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), which was held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, and the 10th anniversary of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), held in Johannesburg in 2002. The Conference was attended by approximately 120 heads of states and government. The Ministry of Defense, through the Joint Staff, was in charge of the security of: the authorities; the sites reserved for the events, Riocentro and Aterro do Flamengo; and the hotels, ports and airports in Rio do Janeiro. The Army’s Eastern Command was charged with implementing the Joint Staff’s security plan. Besides the Land Force, the Navy, the Air Force as well as federal and state security agencies, including the Federal Police, the Brazilian Intelligence Agency (ABIN), state police and the Municipal Police of Rio de Janeiro also participated in the security effort. The Conference Security Plan relied on troops especially trained for acting, preventing and reacting to terrorist attacks, including chemical and bacteriological threats. Futhermore, the Cyber Defense Center installed facilities in Riocentro in order to protect telecommunication systems from possible cyber-attacks. Altogether, around 24 thousand professionals — including 15 thousand Armed Services personnel military — were mobilized in this operation. No incident worthy of record took place during the Conference. operation Mountains Operation Mountains was an initiative by the Ministry of Defense to support Civil Defense in the city of Rio de Janeiro and the cities of the mountainous region of Rio de Janeiro State due to floods and land-slides, which occurred in January, 2011. The Amy’s Eastern Command was in charge of this operation, although officers from each of the Armed Services were also subordinated to this Command. The operational monitoring of federal troops was undertaken by the Chief of the Joint Staff. During the operation, the Armed Forces were engaged in: clearing paths and removing wreckages; supporting Civil Defense in the distribution of donations; medical assistance; and transporting victims, emergency personnel and medical doctors. Operation Mountains mobilized 1,200 federal military personnel. In 2011, the Armed Forces also supported Civil Defense in the States of Goiás, Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, in similar situations to that of Rio de Janeiro. livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y 179DEFENSE WHITE PAPER livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y Institutional Relations Ministry of Defense and the Executive Branch The Ministry of Defense, as part of the Executive Branch, interacts with other ministries in the formulation and implementation of public policies related to their constitutional and subsidiary responsibilities, through activities that benefit society.

The Ministry of Defense interacts with the National Congress particularly through the Legislative Branch’s two permanent commissions that deal specifically with the issue of National Defense: the House of Representatives’ Commission on Foreign Affairs and National Defense (CREDN) and the Senate Commission on Foreign Affairs and National Defense (CRE)51. The Congress has the following constitutional duties in matters concerning or related to National Defense: • testablish and alter the number of personnel in the Armed Forces (Art. 48); • ratify international treaties, agreements or acts that result in heavy onus or commitments to the national treasury (Art. 49); • authorize the President of the Republic to declare war, celebrate peace, allow foreign forces to transit national territory or to remain temporarily, except cases regulated by complementary law (Art. 49); • authorize states of emergency and federal intervention, or interrupt any of those measures (Art. 49); • approve initiatives of the Executive Branch concerning nuclear activities (art. 49); and • approve multiannual plans, budget guidelines laws, annual budget laws, as detailed in chapter six. Besides these responsibilities, the presidents of the House of Representatives and the Senate are members to the National Defense Council (Art. 91), a consultative body to the President of the Republic for issues concerning national sovereignty and the defense of democracy. The continuous empowerment of the National Congress in defense issues contributes to the increase of interest and engagement of society in this area. It is Congress’ duty, for instance, to review this National Defense White Paper. 51 since the establishment of the Ministry of defense in 1999, the incumbent and past Ministers of defense have participated in 53 public hearings and in three seminars organized by the permanent commissions of the national congress. livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y 181DEFENSE WHITE PAPER Ministry of Defense and the Judicial Branch The objective of the federal military courts is to judge military crimes. This body is comprised of 40 judges, distributed among 12 judicial districts spread across the national territory, as well as the Military High Court (STM), located in Brasília. The Federal Constitution establishes that the Armed Forces are organized based upon hierarchy and discipline, and have as their mission the defense of the Homeland, the protection of the three branches of state, and by initiative of any of these branches, the promotion of law and order. The national legal framework provides a body of norms to ensure that military institutions achieve their essential purposes. The Constitution is at the root of military criminal law. Chapter III of the Constitution refers to the Judiciary, listing the institutions that integrate that branch of the state, including the military courts and high courts (Art. 92, VI). The Constitution assigns to federal law the role of defining military crimes and to the military courts the competence of processing and judging compliance with these laws. (Art. 124). The Military Criminal Law is inscribed in the Military Criminal Code. The various roles of the Military High Court are provided in Art. 6th of Law No 8,457 of 1992 that regulates the military courts, in accordance with the Federal Constitution. The military justice system is composed, in the first instance, by auditors and, in the second instance, by the Military High Court, which deals with military crimes committed by civilians and military personnel, but not with administrative infractions or indiscipline. The Military High Court is composed by 15 permanent magistrates, nominated by the President of the Republic and subsequently approved by the Federal Senate. Of these fifteen magistrates, three are Flag Officers of the Navy, four are General Officers of the Army, and three are General Officers of the Air Force. All of these officers are in active service, within a special group, and exercise the highest rank of their respective military careers. The remaining five magistrates are civilians. The Ministry of Defense maintains tight cooperation with electoral courts. The Armed Forces act during electoral periods, upon authorization from the Electoral High Court (TSE), due to requests by regional courts for the use of federal force in support of elections. Thus, exceptionally, during the electoral period around 15 thousand military personnel from the Armed Forces are convened to participate in operations in over 300 Brazilian municipalities, to reinforce security and to ensure the transportation of cargo, voting machines in particular, and professionals from the electoral courts to remote regions of the country. livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y DEFENSE WHITE PAPER182 Defense and the Human Rights The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted and proclaimed by resolution 217 A (III) of the United Nations General Assembly in December 1948. This document was conceived to be a common ideal to be sought by all nations. Signatories must promote the respect for the rights and freedoms expressed in the Declaration. The document also adopts progressive measures, of national and international nature, to ensure its universal and effective recognition and observance52. The 5th Article of the Brazilian Constitution adopts the principles listed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, with stress on the equality to all before the law, without distinction of any kind. It guarantees to all Brazilians and foreigners residing in the country the inviolability of the rights to life, liberty, equality and property53. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Federal Constitution guarantee that human rights are respected when the Ministry of Defense, its military commands, and subordinated agencies undertake their various activities. To guide the employment of the Armed Forces, the Ministry of Defense issues guidelines which set the rules of engagement — these are operational procedures or general rules of action, which guide the individual and collective conduct of the troops employed, including in non-conventional operations. The rules of engagement are prepared in accordance with each mission that the Armed Forces are called to. Legal procedures in force in the country are faithfully observed, which limit the military’s freedom of action during self-defense and legitimate defense. The Armed Forces constitutional employment in international armed conflicts is also based on the International Law of Armed Conflicts (DICA)54. The International Law of Armed Conflict is a group of international norms applied to armed conflicts, which for humanitarian reasons, limits the right of the parties in conflict to freely choose methods and means to be employed in the conduct of hostilities. It also protects people and property affected by these conflicts55. The International Law of Armed Conflicts derives from the Geneva Conventions, a group of laws which regulates the protection of victims of armed conflicts, including combatants and non-combatants56. 52 the Universal declaration of human rights, 1948. 53 the 30 articles of the Universal declaration of human rights are expressed in the 78 items of 5th article. 54 other legal documents sustaining the armed forces: law of Geneva, law of hague, law of new York and the Military statute. 55 idac’s basic principles are: distinction, limitation, Proportionality, Military needs and humanity. these principles’ objective is to limit and assess, as much as possible, the war calamities, through the military needs conciliation with the requirements set by principles of humanitarian nature. armed conflicts employment Manual (idac) in the armed forces, 1st edition, eMcfa, Ministry of defense, 2011. 56 the first convention of Geneva took place in 1864 and introduced what became called the humanitarian right. other four livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y 183DEFENSE WHITE PAPER Support for human rights in Haiti (MINUSTAH) The International Law of Armed Conflict refers to relations between states and applies only to situations of armed conflict. Human rights, on the other hand, are characterized by the principles of universality and indivisibility, and therefore apply in any situation. In this context, the state must respect civil and political rights, and promote social, economic and cultural rights as well. Both the International Law of Armed Conflict and the laws on human rights are based on the respect for the physical and moral integrity to the human being. Among other factors, the growing participation of the Armed Forces in Peacekeeping Operations57 aand in Operations of Law and Order have demonstrated the need to improve the study of human rights and the International Law on Armed Conflicts in the various educational institutions of the Navy, Army and Air Force. Considering the importance of deepening studies on the subject and in accordance with the 3rd National Plan for Human Rights58, the Ministry of Defense established guidelines conventions were held in 1949, with the purpose to safeguard and protect the armed conflicts’ victims. 57 it is important to mark that the brazilian Joint center of Peacekeeping operations has already a series of stages on the human rights theme. Moreover, the Un distributed its own guidelines for Peacekeeping operations conduction. 58the Pndh-3 represents a permanent dialogue between state and society, securing transparency in all government spheres; human rights priority in internal policies and international relations; a laic state; the strengthening of the federative pact; universality, indivisibility and interdependence of civil, political, economic, social, cultural and environmental rights; a neat option for the sustainable development; respect to diversity, fight against inequality; hunger and extreme poverty eradication. livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y DEFENSE WHITE PAPER184 for the Armed Forces, in December 2011, for the implementation of a special Program on Human Rights. This program is to be held from 2012 on and it is mandatory for all military personnel appointed to Peacekeeping Missions, and Law and Order Operations. This program should also cover, as much as possible, to remaining Armed Forces officers and enlisted personnel in the various Military Organizations. The Human Rights Program is scheduled to be taught in undergraduate military schools from 2013 on. It will also be adapted into the curriculums of the Armed Services’ graduate schools. The Program therefore will contribute, along with other initiatives, towards increasing awareness and protection of human rights. It will also bring the Armed Forces closer to the Brazilian society as well as international treaties and conventions. Defense and the Access to Information Act On November 18, 2011, Law No 12,527 was sanctioned — the Access to Information Act — which regulates the constitutional right of citizens to obtain access to public information from federal, state and municipal offices of the Executive Branch, Congress (including the Court of Audit), the Judiciary and the Prosecutor General’s Office, including offices in central administration, decentralized agencies and state owned enterprises. The aforementioned Act treats access to information as a general rule, and confidentiality as an exception. It also alters the confidentiality periods and classification of documents59. The Ministry of Defense has adjusted the classification of all its documents according to the provisions of the new Act and has adopted measures in order to facilitate the access and consultation of data and documents under its responsibility, thus contributing to the consolidation of democracy and the strengthening of transparency policy. The Citizen’s Information Service (SIC) of the Ministry of Defense, inaugurated in May 2012, is part of this transparency effort. The Information Service, located in the ground floor of the Ministry building, is the sector responsible for providing guidance to people who are interested in procedures for consulting and accessing the Ministry’s public information. In addition to the Citizen’s Information Service, the National Defense White Paper and the website of the Ministry of Defense all promote and publicize Defense information which is of general and collective interest. 59 the Minister of defense has directed that the reclassification of confidential documents, within the scope of the Ministry of defense, should not result in the increase of confidentiality periods. livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y 185DEFENSE WHITE PAPER brazilian defense studies association (abed) The ABED was created in 2005 as a result of the joint efforts of a group of researchers from different regions and academic backgrounds. These researchers, all members of important institutions, shared a common concern for consolidating the related fields of: National Defense; National and International Security; Strategy; War and Peace; Civil-Military Relations; and Science and Technology. The objective of the Association is to promote the exchange of ideas, the debate of problems and the development of initiatives that are of common interest within the area of Defense Studies. The resulting intellectual production of this Association constitutes important technical material for supporting policy makers and the general public. The Association produces significant synergetic effects between academic sectors that study National Defense, thereby creating conditions for a renewal of national strategic thought. Defense and Academia In a democratic society, academia plays an important role jointly with state institutions by producing knowledge and analysis that challenge established concepts. The production of academic papers on National Defense has recently increased to a significant extent and has gained further importance with the creation of the Brazilian Association for Defense Studies (ABED). Although some scholars have, individually, produced studies and research on themes related to the National Defense, there were no courses, programs and infrastructure that would allow for a more robust academic production. The incentive to open academic space for critical reflection on defense issues and, consequently, the creation of institutional conditions necessary for related university activities has derived, in fair amount, from the flourishing of study and research on international relations. The awareness that the country is not immune to risks and threats, inherent to the relations between states, was reinforced and the integration of individual researchers was favored. In this context, new disciplines on Defense were created in International Relations and Political Sciences programs. The Ministry of Defense has sought to empower this phenomenon. The National Defense Strategy has as one of its strategic actions the necessity to develop civilian experts on defense and to support programs and courses on National Defense. The objective is to promote further integration and participation of civilian sectors of the government in debates related to defense issues, as well as to foster effective participation of the Brazilian society, through the academic environment and institutes and entities linked to strategic livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y DEFENSE WHITE PAPER186 defense issues. The Pandiá Calogeras Institute, a civilian institution, will have as its main mission the strengthening of relations with academia. Some initiatives of the Ministry of Defense to improve research in the field of Defense are described below. Pro-Defense Program With the aim of contributing to the development of academic activities, the Coordination for the Development of Graduates (CAPES) and the Ministry of Defense jointly launched, in 2005, the Program for the Support of Teaching and Scientific & Technological Research on National Defense (Pro Defense Program). The objectives of Pro-Defense are as follows: • timplement in Brazil academic cooperation networks in the area of National Defense; • develop human resources at the master and doctorate levels; • promote the exchange of knowledge within the Brazilian academic community; • stimulate partnerships among colleges, strategic studies centers and military institutions of education and research; and • promote dialogue on National Defense among civilian and military specialists.

Brazilian Antarctic Program (PROANTAR) The scientific activities of the PROANTAR, already noted in chapter 2, are proposed and developed by scholars from universities and research institutions of different regions of Brazil. Researchers conduct investigations, through an interdisciplinary and inter- institutional manner, on various fields including: Earth Sciences, Atmospheric Sciences, Life Sciences and Technology. Projects include research on: environmental change in the Antarctic continent and its global impacts; environmental monitoring; and complementary studies on local fauna and botany, among others matters. livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y DEFENSE WHITE PAPER188 The research engages a great number of Brazilian scientists, from different areas of expertise and educational and research institutions, who develop their activities in the Antarctic continent, using as support base the facilities of the Antarctic Station Comandante Ferraz60 and the Navy’s ships (Oceanographic Support Ship Ary Rangel and Polar Ship Admiral Maximiano). Academic Congress The Academic Congress is an initiative dedicated to the academic interaction between students of officer cadet schools of the three Forces and university students from across the country. Annually, the Ministry of Defense publishes, in nation-wide notices, the prerequisites for higher education institutions to participate. The Congress is held in military schools and has an average duration of one week. It includes debates on issues of national interest as well as cultural and social activities. Other Initiatives Besides the above-mentioned activities, the Ministry of Defense seeks, through various means, to raise its degree of interactivity with society and to encourage research in the area of National Defense. The most recent example of such an initiative was the preparation process of this National Defense White Paper. Five national seminars were held, in different cities of the country, and one of international scope, in Rio de Janeiro. A competition was also held to select exceptional papers on National Defense by young university students from across the country. Civilian Staff in the Ministry of Defense The manpower of the Ministry of Defense’s Central Administration is composed of 483 civilian and 680 military positions, 1,163 in total. The Ministry does not possess its own particular civilian staff. Its civilian positions are filled by 104 civilians from the extinct Armed Forces General Staff, 46 military reserve personnel hired for an indeterminate time period, 157 civil servants from other public agencies and 176 civil servants who are freely appointed to Senior Managerial and Advisory Offices (DAS), according to legislation in force. With the aim of providing the Ministry with its own particular staff, due to the importance and peculiarity of its activities, the National Defense Strategy determined a study to create 60 on february 25, 2012, the antarctic station comandante ferraz was partially destroyed by fire. the Provisional act no 560 of March 7, 2012, announced by the President of the republic, dilma rousseff, determined the recovery and reconstruction of the base with the aim of continuing the activities of Proantar. livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y 189DEFENSE WHITE PAPER a career of Defense Analyst, with professional requirements that are compatible with the activities of the Ministry. The bill for creating this career is currently being processed by the Ministry of Planning. These professionals, after being selected through open and competitive processes and having completed a specialization program on defense, will, in great part, take up positions in the Ministry of Defense. Some of them may be distributed to other ministries to develop projects and programs concerning National Defense. It is worth noting that the majority of civil servants in the Ministry of Defense work in offices which are civilian in nature, these include: the Office of the Minister of Defense, the Office of Management, the Office of Defense Materiel, the Office of Education, Health and Sports; the Center for the Management and Operation of the Amazon Protection System, the Office of Legal Affairs, and the Office of Internal Audit. A small quantity of civil servants also works in the Joint Staff. Defense and Industrial Development The National Defense Strategy (END) regards the development of the national defense industry and technological autonomy as essential guidelines for the adequate supply of the Armed Forces and for the development of the nation itself. The attendance of the equipment needs of the Armed Forces will prioritize the assimilation of advanced technologies by Brazilian nationals. The restructuring of the Brazilian defense industry is a direct consequence to this decision. Guideline No 22 of the National Defense Strategy determined the need to develop the nation’s defense industry in order to achieve autonomy in technologies that are vital for national defense. Within this context, the Ministry of Defense, through the Office of Defense Materiel has promoted means and participated in activities that favor the development of the Brazilian defense industry. Major initiatives are noted below: 1. Establishment of a Trade Promotion Center (NPC-MD) Guideline No 1,116, approved by the Minister of Defense in April 2012, instituted the Trade Promotion Center. This Center has the purpose of undertaking measures aimed at the promotion and development of trade of Brazilian defense products, and at the attraction of investments and technologies, which may be adopted in the development of defense or dual use products. 2. Assessment of the Defense Industrial Base and promotion of exports The Ministry of Defense and the Brazilian Agency for Industrial Development (ABDI) ae carrying out a complete assessment of the Defense Industrial Base in Brazil, with the objective of diagnosing the capabilities and potential of this important sector livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y DEFENSE WHITE PAPER190 of the national economy. This task is of fundamental importance for the establishment of incentive policies for the national industry. The Defense Industrial Base is currently comprised of approximately 500 companies. Currently, a large segment of Brazilian exports are based on low technology products and are, consequently, of low aggregate value. Considering world military expenditure is around US$1.5 trillion and that Brazilian exports are around US$1 billion American dollars — equal to 0.067% of world total — the growth potential opened to the nation’s Defense Industrial Base is considerable. The Industrial Defense Base can change this situation, and may contribute to the increase of technological content in Brazilian exports. The Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade (MDIC) and the Brazilian Agency for Exports and Investments (APEX) are seeking market segments where the Brazilian defense industry may be competitive as well as supporting Brazilian companies in world fairs and other international events. 3. Regulatory frameworks for strengthening the defense industry Guideline No 22 of the National Defense Strategy sets the necessity for establishing special legal, regulatory and tax frameworks to protect private national companies that manufacture defense products against commercial risks and to ensure the continuity of government purchases. To fulfill this guideline, the Ministry of Defense is preparing regulatory frameworks according to the public interest and the demands for incentives from the National Defense Base. These include: the National Policy for the Defense Industry (PNID), which will guide procedures of the Office of Defense Materiel; Law No 12,598 of March 22, 2012; and the National Policy for the Exportation of Defense Products (PNEPRODE), which innovates by creating a Program for Supporting Exports. 4. Development of science and technology The Ministry of Defense is acting together with the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI) to maximize and optimize research efforts in military institutions, dedicated to science and technology, with the aim of developing state-of-the-art technologies for the nation’s defense system. Some defense projects are being funded by the Studies and Projects Funding Agency (FINEP) of MCTI, such as the SABER M60 radar, the development of permanent magnetic engines for naval propulsion and the project for the development of precursor fiber for the fabrication of carbon fiber. 5. Dialogue with Brazilian companies involved in the defense sector livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y c h a P t e r 4 — d e f e n s e a n d s o c ie t Y 191DEFENSE WHITE PAPER National Board for Industrial Development The Minister of Defense is maintains close relations with the National Board for Industrial Development, which presents proposals to the President of the Republic regarding policies and measures aimed at the promotion of national industrial development. Such policies are focused on: infrastructure activities in support of production and trade; legislation which would improve competitiveness by industrial sector companies; and more consistent and lasting funding of entrepreneurial activities. The Board is therefore one more tool available for the promotion of the Defense Industrial Base. ABIMDE and Industries Federations The Ministry of Defense has established fruitful relationships with national defense industries, through representative organizations, such as the Brazilian Association of Defense and Security Industries (ABIMDE) and the Industries Federation. The Committee on the Defense Industry’s Production Chain (COMDEFESA) of the Industries Federation of the State of São Paulo (FIESP) holds plenary sessions for the appreciation of matters, policies and legislation related to defense. The Committee’s agenda of meetings is shared with the Office of Defense Materiel, which seeks mechanisms that may contribute to solving presented demands. Much of the Ministry of Defense’s interaction with the corporate sector is conducted through the ABIMDE. The Association is a non-profit, with the purpose of congregating, representing and protecting the interests of associated companies. Consequently, it contributes to the formulation of public policies within the Defense sector. Currently, the ABIMDE represents approximately two hundred companies. Contact with the aforementioned organizations allows the Ministry of Defense to interact widely with national industry. In this manner, the Ministry can obtain a better understanding of the industry’s potential and gather necessary knowledge for the appropriate direction of government industrial policies, as well as interact with foreign corporations interested in investing or celebrating partnerships in Brazil. C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N CHAPTER 5 STRATEGIC DEFENSE PROJECTS 193DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N DEFENSE TRANSFORMATION “We must conceive and approve mechanisms that will allow for predictability, stability and continuity of projects related to the equipment and technological development of the Armed Forces” Minister of Defense Celso Amorim Brasilia, August 8, 2011 The concept of transformation in the area of National Defense emerged in the decade of 1970, from discussions on the Evolution in Military Affairs (EAM) and the Revolution in Military Affairs (RAM), which pointed to the need to periodically break paradigms. By providing a better understanding of the limitations of current theories, the idea of transformation alters thought patterns, generates new concepts and capabilities. It enables one to respond innovatively to unexpected challenges. By aiding in the development of skills, it enables the fulfilment of new tasks and the execution of modern combat activities. The effectiveness of a transformation process is proportional to the capacity of acquiring and applying state-of-the-art technology in the phases of research and development of new weapons systems and platforms. As may be observed in various examples available, this is a long-term process, and may extend for 20 years or more. These changes require the development of new doctrines for the employment of troops, in order to make the military forces more apt to act in a multifaceted operating environment. In the case of Brazil, defense transformation, besides enabling greater capacity of its Armed Forces, will create a range of opportunities for economic growth. This will occur through three means: • Defense Deployment and Equipment Plan (PAED); • management modernization; and • reorganization of the Defense Industrial Base. DEFENSE WHITE PAPER194 C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N Virtual shipyard model — submarine base in Itaguai Defense Deployment and Equipment Plan (PAED) This Plan describes the strategic projects of the Armed Forces which aim to meet demands for new Defense capabilities. The acquisition and deployment projects of the Plan require specific budgetary resources to be made viable. Hence, these projects should integrate the programmatic budgetary structures established in the successive Multiannual Plans of the Union (PPA), within a time frame of 20 years (2012 to 2031). Some priority projects of the Armed Forces, directed by the Ministry of Defense, within PAED, are described below: Brazilian Navy The Navy, in order to increase Naval Power, in accordance with the guidelines of the National Defense Strategy, chose its priority strategic projects in a manner that would enable greater autonomy in terms of acquisition of means, in relation to the outside world. Thus, these projects have as one of their main objectives the strengthening of the Brazilian Defense Industrial Base, and thereby enabling it to design, develop and construct means and naval systems of high and medium complexity. The priority projects of the Navy in PAED are as follows: 195DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N Priority Projects of the Navy 1 – Recovery of Operational Capacity 2 – Navy Nuclear Program 3 – Development of the Navy’s Core Capabilities 5 – 2nd Fleet Complex4 – Blue Amazon Management System 7 –Navigation Safety6 – Personnel Navy Prioritiries 5 – 2nd Marine Force 1. Recovery of Operational Capacity This project consists of the revitalization and modernization of the Navy’s logistical and operational structures, including naval, naval aviation and amphibious means. It also includes the replenishment of conventional ammunition and maintenance of operational capacity. 2. Naval Nuclear Program (PNM) The Naval Nuclear Program includes the development of the nuclear fuel cycle, the construction and approval of a Nuclear-Electric Energy Generation Laboratory (LABGENE); the construction of a prototype pressurized water reactor62, which is the basis for the reactor of the first Brazilian Submarine with Nuclear Propulsion (SNBR); and the strengthening of the Navy’s Technological Center in São Paulo (CTMSP). The PNM and the Submarine Development Program (PROSUB) are closely linked. The success of the PROSUB depends on the development of the nuclear propulsion system through the Naval Nuclear Program. 62 Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). DEFENSE WHITE PAPER196 C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N 3. Development of the Navy’s Core Capabilities The project is absolutely necessary, not only to modernize the Navy, but, also, to enable the gradual substitution of the naval, naval aviation and amphibious combat means, which have a deactivation deadline due to natural deterioration and to the endurance limit of these means. The lifecycle limits of materiel are already established, which makes compliance with the program all the more essential. The program therefore aims to expand the operational capacity of the Brazilian Navy. The following actions, within its scope, are noteworthy: • The development of submarines (PROSUB), which includes the construction of four new conventional submarines and one nuclear propelled submarine, in addition to a shipyard and submarine base to support these units, as described in chapter 3; • The acquisition of surface means (PROSUPER), which aims to develop the ability to design and build, in Brazil, five escort vessels, five ocean patrol vessels of 1.8 thousand tons and one logistical support vessel. Proposals submitted by interested shipyards are currently under analysis; • The design and construction, in Brazil, of 27 patrol vessels of 500 tons, two of which have already been received and fiver others are under construction in the country, with expected delivery by 2014; • The acquisition of amphibious means — one combat vehicle landing ship (NDCC) or one dock landing ship (NDD). The Amphibious Ship Procurement Program (PROANF) has initiated research aimed at obtaining, abroad, a design of an amphibious ship, approved and operated by other navies, for future construction in a national shipyard; • The acquisition of aircraft carriers (PRONAE), which involves designing and building one unit for the First Fleet and another for the Second Fleet. The PRONAE is analyzing alternatives for developing the project nationally or with partnership abroad; • The creation of marine battalions for riverine operations. Once the Manaus Battalion is established, the transformation of the Marine Group of Belem will be completed by 2017; and • The recent acquisition of three ocean patrol vessels of 1.8 thousand tons that will be incorporated into the Navy by 2013. 4. Blue Amazon Management System (SisGAAz) This system should be fully implementation by 2024. It will allow monitoring and control of the Brazilian jurisdictional waters and provide the following benefits: 197DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N • greater security for the Blue Amazon; • increased efficiency in inspection and search & rescue operations in the Blue Amazon, and greater interagency operations (Federal Police, Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources etc); and • dual (civilian and military) employment structure, which may be applied to pollution prevention, meteorology, control of scientific research at sea, control of national genetic heritage, prevention and combat of illicit traffic, and security and defense of the pre-salt area. 5. 2nd Fleet Naval Complex & 2nd Marine Force (2nd FFE) The National Defense Strategy established specific guidelines for the installation of a fleet in the North/Northeast Regions of the country, in the closest possible location to the mouth of the Amazon River. For the implementation of this project, which is still under study, it will be necessary to establish an entire industrial and logistical infrastructure in the region to receive the new fleet. Project completion is scheduled for 2031. 6. Personnel Refers to the expansion of sectors of the Navy linked to the agencies of the System for Naval Education, Healthcare and Social Assistance. It also refers to the construction of residences for naval personnel, in order to address the needs resulting from the increase of the Naval Force’s personnel numbers. 7. Navigation Security This project calls for the expansion of Navy’s presence in the Amazon, in the Midwest and in border areas. It also favors the intensification of surveillance in large river basins, as well as the creation and expansion of military organizations linked to the Waterway Traffic Security System (SSTA)63, and the increase of naval means to support these activities. Full implementation is scheduled for 2031. The project’s goals are noted below: • create and elevate the rank of captaincies, stations and fluvial agencies; • increase the presence of Waterway Traffic Security System organizations in the Amazon basin and the Paraguay-Paraná basin; and • build fluvial and hydrographic ships and patrol boats. 63 SSTA is composed of Port Authorities, Naval Stations and Naval Agencies, either riverine or maritime, which have the purpose of acting to safeguard human life, to promote navigation security, both in the open sea and in inland waterways, and in the prevention of hydro pollution by embarkations, platforms or their support facilities, as well as to contribute to the guidance, coordination and control of activities related to the Merchant Navy and similar organizations.

Cyber Defense As mentioned on Chapter 3, the Army was assigned primary responsibility over the cybernetic strategic sector, which involves a series of ad hoc measures, of deployment and equipment to allow the consolidation of the sector. The capacity to preserve the integrity of strategic structures that may be the target of cyber-attacks of different modalities is very importance to the country. Some short term actions envisioned for the cyber defense are listed below: • construction of the permanent headquarters of the Cyber Defense Center and the acquisition of the supporting infrastructure; • acquisition of equipment and training of human resources; • acquisition of cyber defense hardware and software solutions; and • implementation of infrastructure projects of the Cyber Sector to increase the ability to respond to threats. 3. Guarani Project The Guarani Project consists of the implementation of the New Family of Armored Wheeled Vehicles (NFBR) of the Brazilian Army. The Project intends to provide mechanized units with new armored vehicles, which incorporate the most recent trends and technological developments. In the context of the National Defense Strategy, the project contributes to the acquisition of new capabilities, strengthening the Brazilian industry with the acquisition of dual-use technology. The Project calls for the acquisition of 2,044 Brazilian designed Guarani personnel carrier armored vehicles, over a period of 20 years. The new armored vehicles already passed evaluation tests and the Brazilian Army received its first unit in June of 2012. The Guarani Project also includes several subprojects, among which the following stand out: Research and Development, Integrated Logistic Support (SLI), Nationalization of Ammunition, Professional Development, Infrastructure, Command and Control, Simulation, Doctrine and Management. The NFBR includes a medium subfamily — reconnaissance, personnel transportation, mortar, rescue, command post, radio unit, fire coordination unit, workshop and ambulance — and one light subfamily — reconnaissance, anti-tank, mortar light, radar, command post and advanced observation. 201DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N Guarani Armored Vehicle 4. Integrated Border Monitoring System (SISFRON) The SISFRON is a monitoring system that is integrated with other similar systems and which will raise the capacity of command and control of the Land Force, allowing for the reduction of response time against possible threats in areas of interest, with special attention to the Amazon Region. Currently, the project is in the bidding stage for the implementation of a first module based on the 4th Mechanized Cavalry Brigade in Dourados (State of Minas Gerais). 5. Integrated Strategic Land Structures Protection System (PROTEGER) The PROTEGER is a complex System, composed of Land Force units, aimed at protecting Strategic Land Structures (EETer). These structures are defined as facilities, services, goods and systems, which — if disrupted or destroyed in total or in part — could generate significant damage to the security of the state and society in general. The relevance of the system is evident considering that 90% of strategic structures are on land and account for 56% of the energy grid and 96% of the country gross domestic product. The system will cooperate with other agencies through prevention, warning and protection activities intended to minimize risks resulting from natural or human causes, such as sabotage, terrorism and organized crime.

Air Force Organizational and Operational Management The objectives of this project are to ensure integration among the strategic areas involved; execute the Air Force’s strategic management; increase the efficiency of internal processes and systems; and adapt aeronautical and airport infrastructure. Among the actions planned, the following stand out: • adaptation of air bases and expansion of alternative runways; • merger and redistribution of logistics and administrative organizations; and • transference of air units to the North and Midwest regions. 205DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N 2. Recovery of Operational Capacity In a modern Air Force, the management of projects demands a constant process of performance evaluation and selection of alternatives to replace, modernize, develop or revitalize aircraft and their systems, in order to strengthen and maintain the operational capacity of the Force. This process is conventionally termed Recovery of Operational Capacity, and it observes international efficiency standards adopted by modern Air Forces. This project involves training and instruction of pilots, replenishment of weapons stocks and technological upgrading of aircraft, including: • the fighters AMX and F-5 — projects A-1M and F5-M; • maritime patrol P-95 — Project P-3-BR; • transportation and refueling — projects KC-130 and C-95M; • reconnaissance — Project R-99; and • airborne early warning and control — Project E-99. 3. Airspace Control The Brazilian Airspace Control System (SISCEAB) is based on a civil/military ambivalence and is the outcome of the integration of resources. It provides the necessary infrastructure to monitor and management Brazilian airspace, in order to ensure the continuity of general air traffic management, military operational traffic and aerospace defense, throughout the Brazilian territory. The increase of air traffic in general, and particularly in the terminal regions require the implementation of new technologies to support the safe and efficient operation of the country’s air transport. Some actions involve the modernization of the Aerospace Defense Operations Center (CODA) and the adaptation of aircraft to the new satellite control and navigation system CNS/ATM68. 68 CNS/ATM — A program of international scope program for modernizing air traffic control. The acronym CNS stands for Communications, Navigation and Surveillance. ATM stands for Air Traffic Management.

Air Force Operational Development This project has the objectives of optimizing processes, systems and operational activities, as well as supplying operational equipment to the Air Force. It is imperative that the Air Force possesses a dissuasive military capacity, which is effective, credible and apparent in order to defend the values and assets of the nation. • FX-2 — acquisition of 36 multirole fighters to replace the Mirage 2000 aircraft. The evaluation phase for the selection process has been concluded, and the initiative is now awaiting the government’s decision to proceed; • HX-BR — acquisition of 50 medium-sized helicopters EC-725 (H-36), produced in Brazil by HELIBRAS. The project is in the initial phase of aircraft distribution to the three Armed Services (16 for the Navy, 16 for the Army, 16 for the Air Force and 2 for the Presidency of the Republic); • AH-X — acquisition of 12 attack helicopters AH-2 Sabre (MI-35). Six units are already in operation in the Air Force. The delivery of six others and a flight simulator has been scheduled; • H-60 — acquisition of 16 medium-sized Black Hawk helicopters to replace the UH- 1H, which are being deactivated due to obsolescence. 14 aircraft have been received, the last two should be delivered in the short term; • KC-X2 — acquisition of two large transportation and aerial refueling, aircrafts for the purpose of replacing the KC-137 (Boeing 707). The initiative is in the selection phase, under the responsibility of the Air Force Department of Aerospace Science and Technology; • VU-Y — acquisition of 10 transport aircraft, privileging national industry, to replace the VU-35 aircraft (Lear-jet) of the Special Transportation Group (GTE) and the EC-93 (HS-800) of the Special Flight Inspection Group (GEIV), which are used in assessment of radio navigation equipment (flight inspection). Currently under study; • RPA — Remotely Piloted Aircraft, also referred to as UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle). Two units have been acquired for doctrinal development. The 1st Squadron of the 12th Aviation Group (1st/12nd) has been created for the operation of these means; • The national industry has begun to develop a national model in partnership with an international company, with a technological transference contractual clause; and 207DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N • CL-X — 2nd Lot: acquisition of six medium CASA 295 aircraft, three for transportation squadrons and three for search and rescue units. The acquisition is in progress under the responsibility of the Air Force Department of Aerospace Science and Technology. 5. Air Force Scientific and Technological Development This project aims at investing in capacities that ensure technological independence in the production of aerospace defense means. Other objectives to be pursued are the development of data link technology and the necessary capacity to allow the Air Force to operate in network, both internally and jointly. Among other activities, the project encompasses the development of the following aircraft: • R-X, for aerial reconnaissance missions; • E-X, for airborne early warning and control; • I-X, for flight inspection; • F-XBR, multirole fighter to replace the main combat aircraft currently in operation; and • UAV, to be developed for common use by the three Forces, which are currently developing together the necessary Joint Operational Requirements (ROC). 6. Strengthening of the Brazilian Aerospace and Defense Industry This project aims to strengthening the integration between the aerospace and defense industry, and the Ministry of Defense. It also aims to contribute to the competitiveness of products offered by that sector in internal and foreign markets. This project is nationally oriented. In this sense, the development and production of a National Aircraft for Transportation and Refueling (KC-390) is noteworthy. Said aircraft will open export opportunities for the country and permit the duplication of the industrial facilities of EMBRAER, a Brazilian company, in the interior of São Paulo State.

Development and Construction of Aerospace Equipment The space activities, within the Space Activities National Program (PNAE), seek the use of the outer space as a means of support for defense initiatives. Besides developing satellite launching vehicles, the Air Force, jointly with other areas of the Ministry of Defense, including the other two Armed Services, will set necessary requirements for the development of geostationary satellites for safe telecommunications and meteorology, in order to ensure effective command and control with national means. The project aims to develop launching vehicles (as noted in chapters 2 and 3), promote launching campaigns and optimize the necessary infrastructure for rendering these services. 8.Support for Air Force Military and Civilian Personnel Within the realm of the military profession, the maintenance of morale and determination, specifically for combat conditions, does not grow spontaneously. Therefore, actions that promote well-being and maintain morale are important, especially those pertaining to supplies for subsistence that support routine in the barracks, in times of peace or during crisis and conflict. Therefore, this project aims to provide better conditions for the human capital in the Air Force, in order to fully fulfill the Air Force’s mission. The following actions are worthy of note: • increase the availability of the military housing; • modernize the nutritional management of the Air Force; and • optimize the health and social assistance programs of the Air Force. 9. Modernization of Training Systems The increase of the number of military personnel in the Air Force will demand an increase of personnel to be trained in military schools. Therefore, it is important that these institutions are adequately prepared to provide teaching and support activities in a manner that is efficient and of a high standard. Among the activities encompassed in this project, the following stand out: the enlargement of educational infrastructure in general and the creation of facilities for training pilots in the physically hostile environment of a combat aircraft cabin. 209DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N Forecast of Project Completion and Estimated Global Value In order to meet the priority strategic programs set by the Air Force in its Deployment and Equipment Plan there will be a need for increasing the quantity of military and civilian personnel in the next 20 years.

Of these, four are allocated to the Joint Staff and two to the Center for the Management and Operation of the Amazon Protection System. The projects are as follows: • Military Communication System by Satellite (SISCOMIS); • Secure Military Communication System (SISTED); • Development of the Defense Logistics and Mobilization System (SISLOGD); • Modernization of Air Defense and the Defense of Strategic Structures69; • Modernization of the Amazon Protection System; and • Amazon Cartography. Positive Effects of the PAED’s Implementation When the projects inserted in the Deployment and Equipment Plan are completed, the country will be more prepared to face challenges to national defense. Projects in this Plan will benefit the Brazilian society and the Defense Industrial Base in various ways. Some identified gains are listed below: 1. In the military field • Elevation of the country’s dissuasive power and consequent avoidance of hostile actions by other states; • Greater possibility for cooperation with neighboring Armed Forces; and • Contribution to the prevention and fight against new threats, as well as the fight against drug trafficking, gun smuggling, border transgressions and organized crime. 69 The Modernization of Air Defense and the Defense of Strategic Structures project includes the following sub-projects: Modernization of the Air Defense and Coastal Artillery School and the Air Defense of Strategic Structures. The project differs from the Army’s Air Defense System project, which aims to supply anti-aircraft defense to military units in a Combat Zone (ZC) in a Theater of Operations (TO). 211DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N 2. In the political field • Strengthened national capacity to act autonomously in the international arena, with reduced vulnerabilities to external pressures; • Greater integration between government departments and agencies, facilitated through more effective coordination and control throughout the territory; • Increased capacity to control and secure river traffic, and to protect human life, in attendance of international agreements; and • Environmental preservation and repression of environmental offenses. 3.

In the social field • expansion of state services in poor communities; • Greater capacity to contribute to the security of urban centers; • Increased capacity to provide security to major events; and • Contribution to quality of life and increased security in smaller and remote cities. Modernization of Management In order to improve the national defense system, formalize a policy for sustainable defense and integrate the three Forces, the Ministry of Defense is implementing a strategic management process, termed Strategic Planning System (SISPED), which will indicate the direction to be followed by all components of the Ministry. This System will also analyze the area of National Defense from various angles and define its direction by means of vectors and goals which may be monitored. The Strategic Planning System will indicate out long-term goals and strategies of transformation. It will therefore be a guide to help visualize the goals that need to be achieved. The ultimate purpose of the System is the creation of future conditions for obtaining and constantly improving the operational capabilities of the Forces, in order to ensure permanent readiness. Defense Industrial Base (BID) The Defense’s Industrial Base (BID) is a set of industries and companies organized under Brazilian law that participate in one or more of the phases of research, development, production, distribution and maintenance of defense products. A competitive and consolidated defense industry generates high-level jobs and encourages technological development with productive links to other sectors of industry. The productive sector of defense possesses the following specific characteristics: the need for large-scale production and high expenditures on research and development; a long time frame for project maturation; a short life cycle of materials; and the existence of a market heavily influenced by government procurement and exports; and the presence of highly competitive institutions. The Defense Industrial Base, alone, does not possess the conditions or capacity to meet the supply demands of military products and services. The national capacity will only be fulfilled if the entire infrastructure of science, technology and innovation is well adequately activated and integrated. 213DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N President Dilma Rousseff during the promulgation of Law No 12,598 of March 22, 2012 The country’s science, technology and innovation infrastructure, which is dedicated to the production and supply of military technology, is much broader than the defense industry. Its components must act in a concatenated and integrated manner in activities of teaching, basic research, applied research, development, evaluation, design, manufacturing, services and logistics. The Defense Industrial Base has represented, for three decades, an important economic sector of the country, with relevant contributions to the balance of trade and the opening of new markets for innovative and high quality products. Until the promulgation of Provisional Measure No 544 of 2011, which originated Law No 12,598 of March 22, 2012, government policies for the sector were not compatible with the growth of the Brazilian economy, nor with the equipment needs of the Armed Forces. The commerce of defense products is restricted and highly regulated. Several countries develop industrial and technological policies aimed at their respective defense industries and government procurement is guided not only by technical and economic matters, but also by geopolitical interests. This aspect engenders the curtailment and restriction of transferences of various products and technologies from countries that possess these goods to those that lack them. The Brazilian Defense Industrial Base is responsible for 0.1% of all world exports of conventional weapons, as shown in the table below, which presents Brazil in the 27th position among countries that most export weapons. DEFENSE WHITE PAPER214 C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N Law 12,598 of March 22, 2012 This law establishes special rules for the procurement and development of defense products and systems, and for the promotion of the Brazilian Defense Industrial Base. The law contemplates: the government’s central administration; institutions that manage special funds; agencies; public foundations; state, private and mixed companies; state producers of defense products; and other agencies controlled directly or indirectly by the Union, the states, the Federal District and the municipalities of Brazil. The following definitions are adopted by this law: I - Defense Product (PRODE) - every good, service, product or information, including weapons, ammunition, means of transportation and communications, uniforms and materials for individual or collective use in defense activities, with the exception of those that are assigned to administrative use; II - Defense Strategic Product (PED) - all defense products that are of strategic importance for national defense, due to their technological content, scarcity or indispensability; III - Defense System (SD) - interrelated or interactive set of defense products that serves a specific purpose; IV - Strategic Defense Company (EED) - any legal entity accredited by the Ministry of Defense. These companies will have access to special tax schemes and funding for programs, projects and activities related to national defense goods, referred to in item I of Art. 8, and defense strategic products, in accordance with law; V - Innovation - introduction of novelty or improvement in the productive environment, which result in new defense products; VI - Compensation - all and any practices agreed by the parties, as a condition for the purchase of goods, services or technology, with the intention of generating technological, industrial or commercial benefits, as established by the Ministry of Defense; VII - Compensation agreement - legal instrument which formalizes the commitment and the obligations of the supplier to compensate purchases; VIII - Scientific and Technological Institution (ICT) - agency of the public administration, which has the institutional mission, among others, of performing activities of basic or applied research in the scientific or technological fields; IX - Brazilian partners or shareholders - Brazilian individuals, either native or naturalized, residing in Brazil or abroad, private institutions or investment funds or clubs, organized in accordance with Brazilian law; and X - Foreign partners or shareholders - individuals or private institutions, investment funds or clubs and any other institution not contemplated in item IX. 215DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N The Brazilian Defense Industrial Base is responsible for 0.1% of all world exports of conventional weapons, as shown in the table below, which presents Brazil in the 27th position among countries that most export weapons.

The TIV considers unit cost estimates of weapons production and not sales figures. More information: Regarding the internal market, the Defense Industrial Base has managed to meet the increasing demands of the Brazilian Armed Forces and this has kept imports of such products at reduced levels. The recovery and strengthening of the Defense Industrial Base are goals outlined in the National Defense Strategy. Besides the purpose of providing items and systems necessary to the Armed Forces, the industrial base will also function as an inducer of technological innovations with civilian applications, given the dual character of products. The integration of programs and activities between the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI) has intensified in recent years, with coordinated actions to promote priority projects that contemplate important technological innovations and that are inducers of the Defense Industrial Base. The joint efforts and initiatives in military and civilian research institutes, universities and technology centers result in the strengthening of the entire Defense Industrial Base. The Armed Forces offer, in terms of science, technology and innovation, valuable contributions for raising the level of technological autonomy of the country. The Forces maintain centers of excellence, particularly in applied research, which have been fundamental for scientific and technological achievements that have occurred in Brazil.

The creation of the Office of Defense Materiel70 in the Defense Ministry is included in this framework of fostering and promoting the Defense Industrial Base. Since 2011, the Greater Brazil Plan has given continuity to the Productive Development Policy (PDP), the National Defense Industry Policy (PNID) and the National Defense Strategy. It reconciles the needs of industrial development with the requirements of national defense. 70 Department of Defense Products — competencies and responsibilities described in chapter 3. 217DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N The following are the main objectives of these policies with regard to the Defense Industrial Base. Documents Main Goals National Defense Policy — PND (2012) • stimulate state investments in advanced technological sectors; • promote the continuous modernization and supply of the Armed Forces with emphasis on support for science and technology for the development of the Defense Industrial Base; • develop the Defense Industrial Base with a focus on achieving autonomy in critical technologies; • ensure that the industrial sector contributes to ensure that the needs of defense products are supported by technology under national domain; • ensure the development of the Defense Industrial Base, including the domain of dual technology use, in order to attend the supply of defense products; and • promote the integration of the defense industry in South America to ensure mutual benefit as well as training and technological autonomy. National Defense Strategy — eND (2012) • strengthen three sectors of strategic importance: space, cyber and nuclear; and • enable the industry of defense materiel to achieve autonomy in essential technologies. National Defense Industry Policy — PNID (2005) • strengthen the Defense Industrial Base; • raise general awareness about the need for the country to have a strong Defense Industrial Base; • gradually reduce external dependence on strategic defense products, by developing and producing these items internally; • expand the capacity of the Armed Forces to acquire strategic defense products from the national industry; • improve the technological quality of strategic defense products; • increase the international competitiveness of the Brazilian Defense Industrial Base; and • improve the capacity of industrial mobilization in the Defense Industrial Base. Productive Development Policy — PDP (2008) Greater Brazil Plan (2011) • relieve investments and exports; • expand and simplify the financing of investment and exports; • increase resources for innovation; • improve the regulatory framework for innovation; • stimulate the growth of small and microbusinesses; • strengthen trade protection; • create special schemes for adding value and technology in supply chains; and • create detailed regulations based on the law on government procurement in order to stimulate production and innovation in the country.

Recently new large companies have entered the defense sector, through merges with smaller companies that are traditionally part of the Defense Industrial Base. The most important sectors of this industry are noted in the table below: Sectors Products Light weapons, ammunition and explosives Pistols, revolvers, rifles, carbines, machine guns, mortars, ammunition of various calibers and military and industrial explosives. Non-lethal weapons Non-lethal ammunition and launchers, non-lethal grenades, sprayers, rockets and flares. Heavy weapons and ammunition Mortars, ammunition for mortars, cannons and howitzers, rockets and missiles. electronic systems and command and control systems Radars and sensors, communications equipment and data transmission, man/machine interface terminals and integrated command, control, communications, and intelligence (C3I) systems. Military naval equipment Patrol boats, corvettes, submarines and various military vessels. Military terrestrial equipment Utility vehicles and medium wheeled armored personnel carriers. Military aerospace equipment Military aircraft, drones, missiles, satellites, satellite launching vehicles and sounding rockets. Nuclear propulsion Fuel cycle project and nuclear-electric energy generation project. Source: Ministry of Defense. The prospect of expanding demand for strategic defense products offers an excellent opportunity to develop and strengthen the Defense Industrial Base. There are, however, challenges highlighted in Greater Brazil Plan and the National Defense Strategy that requires monitoring: • increase investments in research, development and innovation; • expand participation in domestic and foreign markets; and • strengthen the supply chain in Brazil. 219DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N C H A P T E R 5 — D E F E N S E T R A N S F O R M A T IO N Science, Technology and Innovation Sharing or curtailing scientific and technological knowledge is a political decision that directly interferes in trade negotiations between countries, including negotiations of defense products. To attend the guidelines of the National Defense Strategy, the Ministry of Defense, in coordination with other ministries and representatives of the business and academic communities, develops actions to integrate the existing science and technology systems in Brazil. Significant savings of resources and efforts may be achieved if there is greater integration among research and development institutions of the Armed Forces, not only in the implementation of projects that are of common interest, but also in exploring new opportunities in science and technology. Greater participation of the civilian scientific community in military projects, including the possibility of transfer of budgetary resources from the Ministry of Defense to civilian science and technology institutions can also streamline the management of projects that are of interest to the Ministry. The interaction between civilian and military research institutions, universities and companies is essential to integrate entrepreneurial efforts in creating centers of advanced technology in various areas. In Brazil, the technological centers are directly linked to planning processes involving government, universities and companies, with particular emphasis on state incentives for technological development. The Technological Center of São José dos Campos, which focuses on the field of space, can be considered an example of synergy in the sector of science and technology.

It has also grown stronger economically and acquired greater influence in the international arena. These changes imply greater responsibilities for security and defense in the global strategic environment. National defense is of interest to society and is related to the main objectives of national development. As noted in previous chapters, Brazil needs an efficient defense system to protect its extensive territory, inestimable wealth and vast population. The proper operation of the defense sector requires, in turn, an adequate allocation of budget resources, as well as efficient management. This chapter will present budgetary statistics and explain the main peculiarities of the Brazilian federal budget, particularly in the area of defense. All historical data is present in real terms, i.e. considering inflation. Defense Budget General Rules Complementary Law No 97 of 1999, amended by Complementary Laws No 117 of 2004 and No 136 of 2010, established four general rules for the defense budget: • tthe Ministry of Defense’s budget will contemplate priorities defined in the National Defense Strategy; • the Ministry of Defense’s budget will distinguish sums allocated to the Navy, Army and Air Force; • the budget proposals of the Armed Services will be prepared jointly with the Ministry of Defense, which will consolidate them; and • The Navy, Army and Air Force will manage, individually, their respective allocated budgetary resources. DEFENSE WHITE PAPER222 C H A P T E R 6 — D E F E N S E ’S E C O N O M Y C H A P T E R 6 — D E F E N S E ’S E C O N O M Y Brazilian law adopts the principles of budgetary unity and universality. The unity principle determines that there must only be one budget, i.e. each member of the Brazilian federation (Union, states, Federal District and municipalities) must prepare a single budget. Hence, the defense budget is part of the Union’s General Budget. The universality principle determines that the budget law of each member of the federation must contain all revenues and expenditures of every branch of state. The Budget Process The defense budget process, as part of the Union budget process, follows three main phases. In the first phase, the Executive branch prepares a bill which establishes a four year multiannual plan, in which all programs related to defense are inserted. This plan also sets objectives, goals, initiatives and indicators for each program. The President of the Republic is responsible for sending this bill to the National Congress, which, in turn, revises the document, approves it and returns it for presidential sanction. The current multiannual plan, called “More Brazil Plan”, comprises the period from 2012 to 2015. In a second phase, the President of the Republic, on a yearly basis, sends to the National Congress a bill on budget guidelines, which directs the preparation and the execution of the annual budget law. The Congress is also responsible for appreciating and approving this bill, and then returning it for presidential sanction. In the last phase, the Ministry of Defense and other organs of the Union detail the actions to be taken within their respective programs in an annual budget bill. These actions can be of three types according to the official budget classification: • projects: actions with a defined conclusion date; • activities: actions which do not have a defined date of conclusion; and • special operations: actions which do not generate products, such as debt payments. The annual budget bill estimates revenues and authorizes expenses in detailed form and in accordance with the budget guidelines law and the multiannual plan. It is the responsibility of the President of the Republic to send to the National Congress, for amendment and approval, the annual budget bill, which subsequently returns for presidential sanction. 223DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 6 — D E F E N S E ’S E C O N O M Y C H A P T E R 6 — D E F E N S E ’S E C O N O M Y Defense Budget Principles An efficient National Defense system requires large scale and long term investments, such as those applied on submarines, armored vehicles and aircraft. These materiel have a limited service life, due to natural decay and technological advances. Thus, they must be renewed periodically and, preferably, on pre-scheduled dates. Consequently, the allocation of budgetary resources to the Ministry of Defense must, ideally, contemplate the following three principles: • stability — resources allocated to the Ministry of Defense should not, in principle, be subject to drastic oscillations. Such practice contributes to the long term maintenance of defense projects, avoiding delays and possible losses of personnel, who are often developed along with projects; • regularity — resource disbursement should occur in a systematic manner, to permit the fulfillment of planned time schedules; and • predictability — this principle grants security to the long term planning of large scale projects, thereby assuring that resources are disbursed in a stable and regular manner. Defense Budget Programs The following chart shows the Ministry of Defense’s main programs in 2011, in proportion to the Ministry’s total expenditure in that year. 6.0%1.0% 1.6% 1.6% 1.6% 1.6% 1.9% 2.8% 4.1% 31.5% 46.3% Benefits for reserve personnel and pensioners from the Ministry of Defense Administrative support (comprised mostly of personnel payments) Brazilian airspace control and aviation safety Development and employment of the Air Force Others Equipment and adaptation of the Brazilian Army Equipment and adaptation of the Brazilian Army Development and employment of Naval Power Equipment and adaptation of the Army Armed Forces health services Equipment and adaptation of the Brazilian Navy Source: Senate — SIGA Brasil. 2011 budgetary programs of the Ministry of Defense DEFENSE WHITE PAPER224 C H A P T E R 6 — D E F E N S E ’S E C O N O M Y C H A P T E R 6 — D E F E N S E ’S E C O N O M Y The chart shows that the largest part of the resources allocated to the Ministry of Defense is assigned to the payment of benefits for reserve personnel and pensioners (46.3%) and for administrative support (31.5%), which includes, among other expenses, the payroll of active duty personnel. By contrast, in 2011, the total amount spent on investment and maintenance of equipment and training was 10.8%71. Defense Expenditures International Scope A comparison between the defense budgets of different countries permits a better understanding of scale and how financial resources are applied. However, it must be noted that there is a lack of uniformity in international budget rankings. A country may include certain expenditure in its budget (for instance technological development), while another may not. Brazil, in particular, includes expenditure on benefits for reserve personnel and pensioners in its defense budget. The exclusion of these expenses would represent a 46% decrease in the 2011 budget of the Ministry of Defense and similar values for the previous years. In the comparisons presented below, defense expenditure data was derived from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in Sweden. The analysis is meant to demonstrate the financial situation of the Brazilian Defense Ministry compared to similar sectors in other countries. In 2011, Brazil ranked tenth among countries with the largest defense expenditures in the world. However, the previous remark regarding spending on reserve personnel and pensioners, which may significantly misrepresent the country’s actual position, should be considered. It also must be noted that Brazil is the country with the smallest defense expenditure among the BRICS nations, except for South Africa, which did not expend enough to figure among the top ten spenders72. Among these top ten nations, Brazil was the sixth country that most increased its defense expenditure in the last decade. However, again, it may be noted that this growth was inferior to the that of the other BRICS nations. For example, there is a sharp discrepancy in the growth in expenditure of Brazil (19%) and China (170%) in this period. 71 Obtained through the sum of the percentage of re-equipment and adaptation of the Navy and Air Force plus preparation and employment of the three Forces. 72 Saudi Arabia’s budget values include spending with public security and may therefore be overestimated. 225DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 6 — D E F E N S E ’S E C O N O M Y C H A P T E R 6 — D E F E N S E ’S E C O N O M Y Source: SIPRI. 2011 ten countries with the highest defense expenditures in the world Defense Expenditure ( US$ billion) 0.0 100.0 200.0 300.0 400.0 500.0 600.0 700.0 800.0 USA 711.0 China 143.0 Russia 71.9 United Kingdom 62.7 France 62.5 Japan 59.3 India 48.9 Saudi Arabia 48.5 Germany 46.7 Brazil 35.4 US$Bi Source: SIPRI.

This chart makes evident that almost half of global expenditures on defense belong to the United States of America and that the defense expenditures of the BRICS, not including South Africa, corresponds to 17.1% of total global spending in the sector. 227DEFENSE WHITE PAPER C H A P T E R 6 — D E F E N S E ’S E C O N O M Y C H A P T E R 6 — D E F E N S E ’S E C O N O M Y National Scope The Ministry of Defense’s budget execution suffered a progressive reduction from 2000, reaching its lowest level in 2003. From then on, there was a process of gradual recovery until 2010, as shown in the following chart. In 2011, there was a slight fall, due to financial restraining measures imposed by the macroeconomic environment. The differences in the budget execution between the Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defense’s Central Administration74 reflects their respective differences and peculiarities, particularly concerning the number of personnel of each, as described in chapter 3. The newest Annual Budget Law (LOA), in its Volume IV, allocates R$ 64,794,765,301 to the Ministry of Defense in 201275. 74 The expression “Central Administration” includes the organizational structure described in chapter 3, as well as the War College (ESG), the Armed Forces Hospital (HFA) and the Civil Aviation Secretariat (SAC), which, in March 2011, was transferred to the Presidency of the Republic. 75 The 2012 Annual Budget Law (LOA) is available in Source: SIAFI.

It is important to note that the recovery of the budget execution of the Ministry of Defense, previously mentioned, is less accentuated when one considers spending in proportion to GDP. This is due to the fact that defense spending did not closely follow the evolution of the Union’s primary expenses76 compared to GDP, which from 1995 to 2011 increased from 14.59% to 18.27%. In the same period, defense spending compared to GDP decreased from 1.79% to 1.48%. 76 Primary expenses, also known as non-financial expenditures, correspond to the combination of expenses that enable the provision of public services to society, excluding financial expenses. These include expenses with personnel, maintenance and investment.

Of these various types of expenditure, spending on personnel and social security represent the largest. Current investments are far below the level required to support the priority projects of the Ministry of Defense. As shown in chapter 5, in order to carry out a defense transformation, along the indicated lines, it is necessary to substantially increase this type of expenditure. Spending in maintenance must also rise, due to higher demands imposed by the acquisition of new equipment. In the personnel chart, presented below, it should be noted that the Army requires the largest amount of budgetary resources, since it possesses the largest quantity of personnel, as demonstrated in chapters 3 and 5.

It is a medium term plan , of only four years, which is subject to several annual adjustments, including restrictions, mostly due to external crises. Although the defense budget has slightly recovered in the last seven years, there is still much to be done. Brazilian defense spending has not risen proportionately to the economic growth experienced by the country. It is essential that society perceives expenses on national defense as necessary investments for socioeconomic development, for the protection of natural resources and for the defense of national sovereignty. Not having Armed Forces in full readiness is a risk, and could result in higher costs for the nation in future. Despite its peaceful tradition, Brazil cannot be seen as a defenseless and disarmed nation. National Defense is a type of insurance which the Brazilian state should continually renew, in accordance with the principles of stability, regularity and predictability, so as to ensure a national environment that is favorable to full economic and social development. 77 Medium term from the budgetary perspective.

Civilian engagement is crucial to building a sovereign  and democratic Brazil.  The White Paper broadens the  options of society as a whole to stay abreast of military  affairs while conveying the potential and needs of our  Defense to the public debate.    The publication of this White Paper represents  one step further in the consolidation process of  civilian leadership and in making Defense matters  public knowledge.  It adds to the creation of the Defense Ministry and, more recently, to  the establishment of the Armed Forces Joint Staff, its subordinate institution, as another  significant symbol of institutional progress in the Defense field. The National Defense  White Paper is one more outcome of the democratic development of Brazil.  The rise of Brazil’s international status in the XXI century is already a reality.  A fully  developed country with increasing external presence will require a proper dissuasive  military capacity.  Committed to building a more peaceful and prosperous global order,  Brazil cannot neglect Defense.   Brazil proved, in the last decade, that growth and social inclusion should mutually  reinforce each other.  We must protect our abundant treasures that, in addition to industry,  agriculture, minerals or pre-salt, are composed of millions of Brazilians who have the power  to transform us into a great nation.    For all these reasons, Defense will be increasingly present in the national agenda.  The  National Defense White Paper is an invitation for reflection and dialogue, its reading will  show, above all, that Defense and Democracy form a virtuous cycle in the new Brazil that  we are building.  By enabling a comprehensive and thorough monitoring of our Defense  Policy by society, this initiative contributes to the maturing of public reflection on the vital  role of Defense in Brazil today and in the future.  Dilma Rousseff  mESSaGE FrOm THE PrESIDENT OF THE rEPuBLIC     Complimentary Law 97 of 1999, amended by  Complimentary Law 136 of 2010, establishes, in its 9th   Article, third paragraph, the obligation of the Executive  Branch to submit to Congress, in the first half of the  regular legislative session of 2012, the first version of  the National Defense White Paper.   The National Defense White Paper adds to the  National Defense Strategy and to the National Defense  Policy as an enlightening document about defense  related activities in Brazil.   The expectation is that the White Paper will  encourage the debate about defense topics within   Congress, the federal bureaucracy, academia and the Brazilian society at large.  It will also  serve as a mechanism of accountability to society about the compatibility between the  existing Defense structure and the goals set by the Government.  The Armed Forces have the capacity to project military power beyond our borders.  Such  possibility, in itself, may generate insecurity in neighboring nations.  The wide disclosure of  the National Defense White Paper, and the clear way its chapters seek to express the defense  objectives of the Brazilian state, represent mutual trust-building measures. By sharing  national perceptions and interests concerning the defense field, Brazil seeks to ensure  understanding of the motivations and aims of the military instrument.   History records several cases of conflict resulting from miscommunication and  misconceptions of others’ intentions. Hence, it is important that states adopt initiatives such  as this to communicate their intentions effectively, provide transparency to defense policies  and mitigate the risk of unwanted conflicts.    The National Defense White Paper has been produced with the purpose of strengthening  cooperation with South American countries.  On this regard, it can be an instrument to  foster the establishment of a peaceful and secure community in the region of South America,  enabling the choice for peaceful solutions and the consequent elimination of war.  Beyond  this effort, we seek to demonstrate to countries outside the region that our defense has,  essentially, a dissuasive spirit and it is structured to prevent threats against Brazil. We have  striven to substantiate the view that defense is not delegable and we must be prepared to  fight against any aggression.   mESSaGE FrOm THE mINISTEr OF DEFENSE     At present, topics related to National Defense should engage Brazilian society as a whole.   Since the development of the National Defense Strategy, relating public policies must be  defined jointly.  By incorporating in its essence the idea that decisions concerning peace and  war are not detached from popular sovereignty, the White Paper will allow a democratic  approach to defense issues.  The Defense Policy meets the interests of both society and state.   The endeavor of creating and reviewing legal documents concerning national defense,  including the Defense White Paper, shall contribute to tightening this bond even further.  The White Paper represents a useful means for civilian leaders to deepen their  understanding of the present and future of National Defense. At this time, when changes in  the global strategic scenario are so fast and deep, the dialogue among different sectors gains  greater relevance.   The task of preparing the White Paper has not been developed within the offices of the  Defense Ministry. We sought society’s participation in the reflection and debate of the  themes herein. The implementation of thematic workshops, seminars and roundtables held  with civilian and military representatives, Brazilians and foreigners took the discussion on  defense matters to the five regions of the country.  Such contributions were most valuable;  hence I would like to express our most sincere appreciation to those who have engaged in  these discussions.   In addition to bringing internal and external transparency to the criteria of how our  Armed Forces are used, the preparation of this document is relevant for the deepening of  society’s pool of knowledge on the military field.

It has the world’s longest Atlantic coast and, with  almost 191 million inhabitants1, the planet’s fifth largest population2. It is a great producer  of renewable and non-renewable energy, from animal and vegetal protein. It owns large  potable water reserves, huge biodiversity and vast mineral resources. The recent discoveries  of pre-salt layer oilfields have raised the country to a new level in oil and natural gas reserves  and production.  Rated as the world’s sixth largest world economy by the International Monetary Fund  (IMF)3, Brazil has increasingly reached expressive levels of development, while striving  to eradicate poverty and reduce social inequality.  Brazilian democracy is consolidated,  free elections are a current procedure, there is growing public interest in the preparation  and demand for public policies, and there is a commitment to fighting corruption and  respecting human rights.   Over the last years, Brazilian foreign policy has projected values and interests within the  framework of global governance. Brazil has developed its own foreign agenda with greater  autonomy to define priorities for its progress as a nation.  This heritage requires defense. Brazil considers itself a friend of peace and is considered as  such internationally, but it cannot do without its dissuasive military capacity and preparation  for defense against foreign threats. It is not possible to assert that cooperation shall always  prevail over conflict in the international arena. This chapter shall introduce some elements  of the Brazilian state, which have immediate implications for National Defense.  1 IBGE — 2010 Census. 2 United Nations Population Fund — Report on World Population Situation 2011. 3 World Economic Outlook. 2012.

The separation of powers —   Executive, Legislative and Judicial — is, within the Brazilian legal system, a fundamental  and necessary principle for the promotion of the common good.  For this reason, the  separation is based on the balance among the three Branches and their reciprocal and  conscious collaboration and control.  The Brazilian Federation is formed by the indissoluble union of states, the Federal District  and the municipalities. Such federative entities have political autonomy, allowing them to  make their own laws, to elect their political leaders and to manage their own resources,  according to the separation of powers provided for in the Federal Constitution.     As a democratic state observant of the rule of law, the country stands on constitutional  principles, which are: sovereignty, citizenship, human dignity, labor rights, free enterprise,  and political pluralism.   Democratic values permeate all constitutional guarantees of the Brazilian state. Among  such guarantees, human dignity serves as the basis for the Nation’s own existence, and is,  simultaneously, the permanent purpose of all its activities. The state’s objectives, outlined  in the 3rd Article of the Federal Constitution, reinforce the country’s political choice for  the construction of a free, fair and just society, the promotion of national development, the  eradication of poverty and social exclusion, the reduction of social and regional inequality  and the promotion of the common good, without discrimination.    In the international arena, Brazil acts in accordance to the principles established in the  4th Article of the Federal Constitution: national independence, preservation of human  rights, self-determination of nations, non-intervention, equality among the states, defense  of peace, peaceful settlement of conflicts, repudiation of terrorism and racism, cooperation  among nations for the progress of mankind, and granting of political asylum.   Brazilian foreign policy considers international dialogue and cooperation as essential  instruments to overcome obstacles and to build confidence among states. With regards  to other countries, Brazil gives priority to its immediate neighbors in South America, the  South Atlantic region and Africa’s western coast.          17  C H  A P  T E  R  1   —  T  H E     B  R A  Z IL  IA N     S  TA T  E     A N  D  N  A T  IO N  A L   D E  F E  N S  E  C H  A P  T E  R  1   —  T  H E     B  R A  Z IL  IA N     S  TA T  E     A N  D  N  A T  IO N  A L   D E  F E  N S  E  DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  Maritime Area  Is constituted by both inland  waters and maritime areas, where  Brazil exerts some degree of  jurisdiction over activities; persons,  installations, ships and natural  resources (alive or otherwise).

Brazil has frontiers with 9 other South- American countries and one of France’s  oversea territories, which represent an  extension of almost 17 thousand kilometers,  approximately 12 thousand of which refer  to the Legal Amazon border. The Brazilian  seacoast stretches for nearly 7.4 thousand  kilometers. Important navigation routes,  vital for the national economy, cross  Brazilian waters along the Atlantic Ocean.   Located in this region, are the Brazilian pre- salt petroleum reserves, which are of great  economic, political and strategic importance.

It contributed to  the principle of peaceful solution of disputes among states.

With an estimated  capacity of 45 thousand km3 of underground water, it is an important source of fresh  water and for the development of economic activities.  The Alter do Chão Aquifer,  located under the world’s largest hydrographic basin (river Amazonas), extends  under Brazilian ground with an estimate potential volume of 86 thousand km3.   The Northern region makes up more than half of the national territory and its main  features, among others, are its low population density and the length of its frontier. The  Northeast is the third most densely populated geographical region, largely concentrated  along the coastline, where main urban centers are located. The Midwest, the second largest  region, also presents low population density. It has a border line of nearly 2 thousand  kilometers long. The Southeast is the most densely populated, urbanized and developed  region of the country and includes the largest population centers. The South region is the  smallest in land area. It shares borders with nations of the River Plate. It also has a high level  of urbanization and demographic density.  The Amazon is one of the areas of highest interest to the Ministry of Defense. The Pan- Amazon, which is constituted by the entire Amazon forest in South America, consists of  approximately 40% of the South American continental area and holds 20% of the world’s  fresh water reserves. The largest area of the Pan-Amazon belongs to Brazil — around 70%.  Brazil defends its unconditional sovereignty over the Brazilian Amazon, which comprises  over 4 million square kilometers, shelters all kind of mineral reserves and the planet’s largest  biodiversity. Brazil’s cooperation with other countries holding territory in the Pan-Amazon  is essential for the preservation of this natural treasure.   The “borderland”4 concept was adopted by Brazil, through the 1988 Federal Constitution  and by law. Although this concept was initially linked to the area of National Defense,  the concern with the consolidation and the gradual Brazilian presence in this borderland  reflects the priority given by the state to sustainable development, national integration and  cooperation with bordering countries in matters related to security and the fight against  transnational contraband.   4 Federal Constitution Art. 20 § 2: “The strip up to one hundred and fifty kilometers width, alongside the terrestrial  boundaries, designated as boundary zone, considered essential to the defense of the national territory and its  occupation and utilization, shall be regulated by law.”      DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  1   —  T  H E     B  R A  Z IL  IA N     S  TA T  E     A N  D  N  A T  IO N  A L   D E  F E  N S  E  C H  A P  T E  R  1   —  T  H E     B  R A  Z IL  IA N     S  TA T  E     A N  D  N  A T  IO N  A L   D E  F E  N S  E  20  Brazil’s Physical Map  Source: IBGE.

The  country has 12 large hydrographic basins. The four main basins are: to the north, the Amazon;  in the center, the Araguaia-Tocantins and São Francisco; and, to the south, the sub-basins  Parana, Paraguay and Uruguay, which form the Prata basin.  There is a great potential for  articulated actions that may facilitate intermodal transportation such as inland occupation  and national integration, which directly affects South American Integration.   The Brazilian oceanic coast has two clear segments: the segment extending from Cape  São Roque5, in the Northeast, to the river Chui, in the South; and the segment from Cape  São Roque to the river Oiapoque, in the North. The first segment links the country both  physically and economically to the South Atlantic. In this region are located the most  populated territory strip and the main national ports — Santos, Rio de Janeiro, Paranaguá,   5 Cape of São Roque is located in the municipality of Maxaranguape, 51 km from Natal, capital of the Brazilian State of  Rio Grande do Norte.    21  C H  A P  T E  R  1   —  T  H E     B  R A  Z IL  IA N     S  TA T  E     A N  D  N  A T  IO N  A L   D E  F E  N S  E  C H  A P  T E  R  1   —  T  H E     B  R A  Z IL  IA N     S  TA T  E     A N  D  N  A T  IO N  A L   D E  F E  N S  E  DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  Recife (Suape), Salvador and Vitoria — through which flow the largest part of foreign trade.  This maritime segment is essential for political and economic ties with South Cone nations.  An eastbound course leads to Western African countries, and there the Cape route stands  out as a considerable strategic communication path from Asia and Africa to the North  Hemisphere.  The segment leading from Cape São Roque and the Oiapoque River projects  Brazil to the northern part of Africa, to Western Europe, the Panama Canal, the Caribbean  as well as Central and North Americas.    Considering the abovementioned maritime segments and projections, it may be  affirmed that Brazil’s strong link to the sea is substantial, from both political and economic  perspectives. This has induced the country to exert a natural influence over the South  Atlantic. The strong dependence on maritime traffic for foreign trade constitutes a relevant  challenge to defense.   The South Atlantic region over which Brazil has territorial rights and other exploration  and control prerogatives is the country’s jurisdictional waters. These waters have recently  been named the Blue Amazon, and are roughly equal, in geographic area, to the Brazilian  Green Amazon. Oil reserves in deep water and ultra-deep water, so important for the  country’s development, can be found under this region. Hence, the need to intensify  monitoring and control of maritime traffic and of incidents in areas that are subject to  Brazilian authority.     Population Brazilian society is composed of a population with diverse geographic and ethnic origins.   Since the colonial period, relations among American Indians, Europeans and African  individuals have produced a mixed population. In the end of the 19th century and the  beginning of the 20th, Brazil received new migration flows from several origins. During  the 20th century, intense internal migration took place, following a growing urban and  industrialization process.  Such internal migration is associated with socioeconomic factors and policies of territorial  occupation. Economic booms established areas particularly attractive for migrants in  different regions. Subsequently, the industrialization process transformed the Southeast  region into the main destination for migration. However, according to the 2010 census, the  intensity of migration towards the great cities of the Southeast has decreased due, mainly,  to the decentralization of industrial activity. Presently, one may observe the rise of business  and job clusters in several regions. Thus, a new migration flow has resulted.

In 1957, the construction of the  city took place in Brazil’s Central  Plateau, in order to achieve a policy  set by the 1891 Constitution, which  sought national integration and the  development of the interior.  The  new capital was inaugurated on the  21st of April, 1960. It was based on  an urban plan by Lucio Costa and architectural projects by Oscar Niemeyer. Due  to its architectural value, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural  Organization (UNESCO) declared it a world heritage site.  The Planalto Palace  Parallel to such migration flows, the state set incentives for the occupation of less  populated areas, with the objective of promoting national integration. The so-called “March  to the West”, for instance, was a movement created by the first Administration of President  Getulio Vargas (1930-1945) to foster the occupation of the Midwest. The subsequent  transference of the country’s capital in the 1960’s to this region became a milestone in  territorial occupation. The occupation of the Brazilian Northern region was propelled by a  rubber extraction industry in the end of the 19th century.  Miscegenation — of Portuguese,  Indian and African heritages — and the harmonious interaction of several cultures have  been responsible for Brazil’s particular and original identity.   The Brazilian official language, Portuguese, is one of the main pillars of national identity  and a means for the expansion of culture and traditions. Music, arts literature and sport also  contribute to the building of national identity. Such elements embrace local characteristics,  sayings and local knowledge, thus contributing to the development of a specific and  diversified culture.    23  C H  A P  T E  R  1   —  T  H E     B  R A  Z IL  IA N     S  TA T  E     A N  D  N  A T  IO N  A L   D E  F E  N S  E  C H  A P  T E  R  1   —  T  H E     B  R A  Z IL  IA N     S  TA T  E     A N  D  N  A T  IO N  A L   D E  F E  N S  E  DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  NATIONAL SYMBOLS Pursuant to Art. 13 of the Federal Constitution, the four official emblems of the Federative   Republic of Brazil are: the national flag, the national anthem, the Republic’s coat of arms and  the national seal. Emblems are graphic and musical manifestations of important historical  value, designed to transmit the sentiments of national union and sovereignty.   After the Republic was proclaimed on  November 15, 1889, a new flag was created  to represent the country’s achievements and  historic moment. Inspired by the imperial  flag, the new flag was designed by Jean  Baptiste Debret (a French painter), Teixeira  Mendes, Miguel Lemosand and Decio  Vilares. It was approved by Decree No 4 of  the Republic’s provisional government. The  new flag kept the tradition of the yellow  diamond on a green field, but introduced  the blue sphere spotted with stars and a  white slanting strip, descending from left to  right, with the motto “Order and Progress”.  The stars, including the Southern Cross  constellation, represent each one of the  Brazilian states. Pursuant to Law No 8,421,  of May 11, 1992, should a state be created  or removed, the group of stars must be  updated.   The Brazilian national anthem lyrics were  written by Joaquim Osório Duque Estrada  (1870-1927), a poet and journalist; and  the music composed by Francisco Manuel  da Silva (1795-1865), a conductor and  professor.  The anthem is regulated by Law  No 5,700 of September 1st, 1971.    National Flag  National Anthem  Engineer Artur Zauer,  by order of President  Deodoro da Fonseca,  designed the Brazilian  Coat of Arms. It is a sky  blue shield, supported on a five-pointed star,  with an upraised sword. Around it, there is a  wreath made by a fructified coffee branch and  a tobacco branch set over a golden radiance.  The use of the coat of arms is mandatory for the  Executive, Legislative and Judicial Branches,  and it figures in all public buildings.  The national seal of  Brazil is based on the  sphere of the national flag.  Inside it there is a circle  reading Federative Republic of Brazil. It is  used to certify government acts, diplomas  and certificates issued by official or certified  schools.

In the 2010 census, according to the Brazilian National  Geographic and Statistics Institute (IBGE), almost 191 million people were counted.   The Brazilian population has practically multiplied ten times during the 20th century,  demonstrating intense growth, which has transformed the country into the world’s fifth  most populated.  During the greater part of the second half of the 20th century, a time when population  growth was most intense, Brazil’s demographic pyramid was characterized by a base  enlargement and significant narrowing at the top, indicating a large economically  dependent young population.  The current configuration of the pyramid indicates the decrease of an economically  dependent population, which, in practical terms, means that Brazil now lives the so- called “demographic bonus” or “window of opportunity”.

Therefore, Brazil is now in a privileged situation to benefit from the opportunities  produced by change in the international environment.  Education is the basic pillar for the construction of a more fair, developed and  fraternal society, where citizenship may be fully practiced.   In accordance with guidelines provided in Article 205 of the Federal Constitution6,  the country has invested significantly in educational projects that allow the Brazilian  citizen to take a more critical stance facing the challenges of the 21st century.   The situation of Brazil’s education has shown significant improvement in the last  decades: there was a major fall in the illiteracy rate, and a steady increase in high school  education and school attendance7.   In this new century, a new social, political and economic environment has shown that  proficiency in education is fundamental for the development of the country.   6 Art. 205 of the Federal Constitution states that: “Education, which is the right of all and duty of the state and of the family  shall be promoted and fostered with the cooperation of society, with a view to the full development of the person, his  preparation for the exercise of citizenship and his qualification for work.”  7 IBGE — Synthesis of Social Indicators 2002 and, Ministry of Education, School Census 2010.

It is the state’s duty to ensure that the nation does not face  the risk of  foreign aggression, or that it is exposed to political pressures or unbearable  economic sanctions, and is free to care for its own development and progress.    Brazil exercises complete and exclusive sovereignty8 over its land mass, its waters  and overlying airspace, with no foreign interference whatsoever accepted in its decision  making process. The Brazilian state works to increase confidence and understanding  among the states in order to contribute to the prevention of conflicts that may intensify  threats to National Security.   National Defense, as defined in the National Defense Policy is the “set of  state measures  and actions, especially within the military field, to ensure the defense of the territory,  sovereignty and national interests, mainly against foreign threats, potential or manifest”.    8 Sovereignty is the first fundamental principle stated in Art. 1 of the Brazilian Federal Constitution. Sovereignty is  inalienable, indivisible, and imprescriptible. It must be exercised by general will and be preserved on behalf of the future  generations and the country’s prosperity. It is a supreme order, not to be prevailed.    27  C H  A P  T E  R  1   —  T  H E     B  R A  Z IL  IA N     S  TA T  E     A N  D  N  A T  IO N  A L   D E  F E  N S  E  C H  A P  T E  R  1   —  T  H E     B  R A  Z IL  IA N     S  TA T  E     A N  D  N  A T  IO N  A L   D E  F E  N S  E  DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  The Army in defense of the Amazon  The Defense Policy established the following objectives:   I. guarantee sovereignty, national treasures and territorial integrity;  II. defend national interests, including Brazilian citizens assets and resources abroad;   III. contribute to national cohesion;  IV. contribute to regional stability;  V. contribute to international peace and security;  VI. intensify Brazil’s projection in the community of nations and increase its participation  in international decisions;  VII. maintain Armed Forces that are modern, joint, well trained, balanced, increasingly  professional and adequately deployed  throughout the national territory;  VIII. raise awareness among the Brazilian people about the importance of defense  matters for the country;   IX. develop an Defense Industrial Base, to ensure autonomy in vital technologies;  X. structure the Armed Forces around capabilities, providing them with personnel and  material in accordance with strategic and operational planning; and  XI. develop the potential for defense logistics and national mobilization.

This dynamic carries hope, but also brings  new and formidable responsibilities, which the Armed  Forces will know how to fulfill”  President Dilma Rousseff  Brasilia, April 5, 2011  The contemporary international system is marked by the exhaustion of the order which  characterized the immediate period after the Cold War. This system has distinguished itself  through a rapid process of reorganization of political relations between states. The advent  of a multipolar order, marked by the coexistence of traditional and emerging powers,  brings new opportunities and new challenges to nations in the area of defense. Although  dialogue, cooperation, emphasis on multilateralism and respect for international law remain  important and desirable qualities for the international environment, the rearrangement of  the system on a multipolar basis is not, by itself, sufficient to guarantee that, in the current  situation of transition, peaceful relations between states will prevail.  In this context, Brazil sees, in its defense policy and in its calling for dialogue, essential  components for its affirmative and cooperative insertion into the international environment.  In face of uncertain future scenarios, the cost of inaction by Brazil in the construction of  a new international order can be much larger than the immediate burden, i.e.  investment  in training, preparation and development of resources that are necessary for the exercise of  sovereignty. The consolidation of representative multilateral governance structures of the  new world order is of interest to the country and requires a strict coordination between  foreign and defense policies. The second must provide the first with safeguards, support  and logistics, which are essential for the fulfillment of Brazil’s role in the international arena.    The defense policy determines the state’s capacity to offer protection to the Brazilian  people and to ensure the absence of foreign interference in its territory and its jurisdictional  waters, including the airspace above, the seabed and the subsoil.   National sovereignty, economic competitiveness and full development demand a defense  capacity that is compatible with the country’s potential and aspiration.  In spite of fast growing changes in recent decades, the international order remains  predominantly determined by relationships among states. For this reason, Brazil’s defense  against external potential threats remains the Armed Forces’ essential mission.     DEFENSE WHITE PAPER32  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  New themes — or new approaches to traditional themes — became influential  in the international environment in this century. The protection of sovereignty (an  issue connected with the global challenge of drugs and related crimes); the protection  of biodiversity, biopiracy, cyber defense; tensions derived from the increasing  lack of resources, natural disasters, international crime, terrorism; and actions by  unlawful armed groups all exemplify the growing interdisciplinary nature of security  and defense issues. Considering this, Brazil acknowledges — in accordance with  provisions in the Federal Constitution — the need for coordinated policies among  different government agencies.  Further challenges to the country include its ability to face so-called “future conflicts”,  namely information warfare as well as small scale conflicts marked by uncertain origins  and decentralized command and control structures that operate through social networks  on the Internet.  It is important to strengthen the country’s international relations. Sincere and open  dialogue will contribute to foreign policy and to its interaction with defense policy, by  building consensuses that foster ample and collective debate.   The Brazilian society’s increased interest in defense issues, in the last few years, is a  healthy tendency. The participation of several sectors of society in the national debate on  defense enables a better assessment of such issues.   An international scene marked by uncertainties has as much a direct influence on  Brazilian foreign policy as on its defense policy. The phenomenon of globalization brought  about the escalation of threats of different natures, like drug trafficking, weapons trafficking  and maritime piracy, which tests the state’s ability. The aggravation of the international  financial crisis also reveals possible damage to social, energy and environmental conditions,  with evident effects on world peace and security.   Brazil works for the construction of a participative and inclusive world community.  The country commits itself to the promotion of “multipolar cooperation”, a term which  summarizes the multipolar power structure consolidating worldwide.  In this strategic  environment, international action must excel in the consolidation of governance mechanisms  that better represent this new international reality. Such mechanisms must ensure world  peace and security for the good of mankind. The new power structure of the 21st century  should not favor conflicting or excluding positions, inherited from the international orders  that prevailed during the 20th century.      33DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  This political choice, however, cannot neglect the complexity of threats from the Post- Cold War period and uncertainties in the medium and long-term horizon. The country  has been preparing for such realities since the National Defense Policy reformulation,  in 2005, and the publication of the National Defense Strategy, in 2008, both revised in  2012.  In South America, there has been a clear trend towards cooperation. This trend has been  constantly strengthened since the establishment of the South American Nations Union  (UNASUL) and, especially, its Council of Defense (CDS). A “Security Community”10, is  blooming in South America, due to common historical experiences shared by neighbor  countries, similar development challenges and democratic government systems, which  enable mutual understanding and foster a peaceful accommodation of the different national  interests.   In sum, the Brazilian National Defense policy unites cooperative and dissuasive  components. International crises may occur against the country’s will, and this demands an  adequate level of readiness and modernization of the Armed Forces. In a global level, Brazil  must have a capacity for defense that corresponds to its economic, political and strategic  stature, in order to have its resources preserved, its voice heard, its position respected and  its peaceful tradition safeguarded.   Strategic Environment   In the current composition of international centers of power, elements of unipolarity,   such as the dominant military force in North America, coexist with elements of  bipolarity, such as the economic interdependence between the United States of America  and China, and of multipolarity, such as the financial G-20, the commercial G-20,  the BRICS group, the IBAS Forum and the BASIC group11, among others. New and  traditional global governance structures are coexisting. In this context new political   10 Concept presented by Karl W. Deutsch, at the end of the 50’s decade, in his classic work Political Community and the  North Atlantic Area — International Organization in the Light of Historical Experience. According to Deutsch, a security  community would rise from the relationships among states within the same region, as war would become an unthinkable  solution to disputes among its members. 11 Financial G-20 — Group composed of: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom and United  States of America, which form the G-8, and also Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, European Union, India, Indonesia,  Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey.  Commercial G-20 — Group composed of 23 countries from 3 continents: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, China, Cuba,  Egypt, Ecuador, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Paraguay, Philippines, South Africa,  Thailand, Tanzania, Uruguay, Venezuela and Zimbabwe;  BRICS — Group formed by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa;  IBAS — Group formed by India, Brazil and South Africa;  BASIC — Group composed by Brazil, India, China and South Africa;  Further detail on the creation and objectives of these groups may be found in the Glossary.

In the context of the  strategic environment of this century, some scenarios may be noted:  a) unipolarity: one nation dominant over the international system. Although unipolar  reassertion cannot be dismissed, it is unlikely that any single force may be able to solely  administer global phenomena, considering the structural crisis in the developed world  and the growing presence of new actors;  b)  bipolarity or tripolarity: in this scenario, the competition and coordination between  two or few powers will determine the actions of all other actors in the system.  From  a strategic viewpoint, it seems unlikely that this scenario, which occurred in the 20th  century, will again determine the international system for the next decades; and  c) multipolarity: represents the power structure which will probably mark the strategic  environment in the next decades. The multipolar structure refers to the coexistence  of several centers of power in the international system, each influencing the other’s  actions. The balance of power checks the influence of nations with hegemonic  intentions.   In multipolarity, conflict and cooperation dynamics naturally coexist in relations among  states. The multipolar structure, however, will be shaped by the prevailing dynamic.    If conflict predominates over cooperation, multilateral coordination mechanisms would  weaken. This is a scenario to be avoided. Should the reverse occur, however multilateral  forums would be favored.    In this new world order, Brazil must contribute with actions and opinions in favor of  a multipolar and cooperative environment, in accordance with its historical defense of  international law.      35DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  International System Brazil strives so that forums for multilateral consensus-building, especially those of the   United Nations, become more representative of the new reality of the 21st century. The  efficacy and legitimacy of decisions and policies adopted in these bodies will be greater, the  more the UN express the interests of its member countries.  The country’s claim, particularly  regarding a comprehensive reform of the United Nations Security Council, refers to this  inclusive project, which has motivated Brazilian foreign policy for decades.    Since the 90s, the “securitization” of United Nations issues has become an important  trend. This trend, mostly promoted by the permanent members of the Security Council,  consists in bringing before the referred Council issues which actually should be dealt with  in other UN bodies or in its specialized agencies. “Securitization” needs to be considered  with caution.  In specialized agencies – such as the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA), the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPQW) and the  Convention for the Prohibition of Biological Weapons (CPBW) – the submission of a case  to the Security Council should be limited to extreme situations.  Regarding the UN Security Council, significant advances, reflecting a trend toward the  strengthening of multilateralism, have not been observed, unlike what has been evidenced  in other areas, such as the economic and financial dimensions. To assure the Council’s  legitimacy and representativeness in issues related to international peace and security, its  reform is urgent.   The increasing force of multilateralism is also the result of the higher prominence of  issues which require negotiated solutions among countries and also impact the security of  nations, such as climate change, sustainable development and social inclusion.  The notion  that security and development are integrated has its roots in the ideals of the United Nations  Charter.   Brazil has actively participated in diplomatic efforts to find peaceful solutions to conflicts  and to decrease tensions in the American continent and elsewhere. The most evident  expression of Brazil’s growing importance in peace and security initiatives has is its role in  peacekeeping operations. Such operations are the main tools available for the international  community to deal with threat of conflict and to prevent post-conflict countries from  returning to armed violence. Together with UN agencies, funds and programs, peacekeeping  missions are an important expression of the Organization, since they represent the main  legal and legitimate form of military action of the international community to guarantee  collective security.      DEFENSE WHITE PAPER36  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  The three pillars of peacekeeping operations are: (i) the use of force only for self- defense or for defense of a mandate granted by the UN Security Council; (ii) impartiality;  and (iii) consent of the main parties involved.   As suggested in its name, UN peace missions are tools used by the Organization to  preserve peace while it is threatened or to restore peace after a conflict. It is never an  intervention in a military conflict favoring one side or another.   Brazil understands that there are clear limits: peacekeeping missions should not seek  to replace belligerent parties.  The United Nations should help parties build conditions  for peace and should do so in a strictly impartial way, in order to ensure legitimacy  and greater political gains.  UN peace missions offer parties a political and security  environment, as well as the time they need to lay the foundations for an enduring peace.   Currently, peacekeeping missions face important challenges. It is fundamental to  guarantee the sustainability and success of their actions and to provide the necessary  military resources and means for the fulfillment of their mandate. They must incorporate the  commitment to sustain efforts, i.e. they must support the creation of political, institutional  and socioeconomic bases for an enduring peace. A particularly important challenge is the  protection of civilians in situations of conflict, a concept which must be improved to ensure  that the use of force does not exceed United Nations Security Council mandates.   In September 2011, during her opening speech at the UN General Assembly,  President Dilma Rousseff coined the expression “responsibility while protecting”, which  essentially refers to the following doctrine for the use of military force under UN aegis:  “do not create more instability than that which is to be prevented or limited”.  Brazil believes that peacekeeping operations must rely on four elements: security,  strengthening of institutions, national reconciliation and development. Balance among  these elements is a Brazilian priority in theoretical debates (which result in UN guidelines  on the issue) and in practical terms when Brazilian forces are deployed in such missions.   The actions undertaken by Brazil in peacekeeping missions have, whenever possible,  emphasized the reconstruction of countries based on socially and economically  sustainable foundations. Thus Brazil has sought, especially in the case of Haiti, to  promote innovative programs for technical cooperation in areas such as food security,  agriculture, professional education, health security and infrastructure. Brazil also  intends to increase the participation of civilian professionals in these missions, in  order to meet the growing demands for qualified personnel in public security, border  control, the fight against drug trafficking, voting systems, penal systems and public  administration among others.     37DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  Regional Systems  South American integration remains a strategic objective for Brazilian foreign   policy. The country acknowledges the deepening of political, social and economic  relationships among South American countries as a fundamental element for social and  economic development and for the preservation of peace in the region. Likewise, the  consolidation of South American trade and the strengthening of governments’ ability to  act in the international forums depend on the continuation of friendly relations among  nations in the region.   The South American region is little affected by conflicts among states. A peaceful  regional environment has contributed, in the last decade, to economic growth in  the continent. Brazil’s conciliatory position, for over 140 years, has contributed to  the region’s stability. This legacy must be valued and preserved. Brazil’s stability and  prosperity reinforce its security and produce positive effects on all South American  nations.   A country’s security is affected by the degree of instability in the region where it is  located. Regional stability, therefore, is a national objective.   Brazil considers it desirable  that consensus, political harmony and convergence of action among South American  countries prevails. This would make the region stronger and more coherent. This set of  factors motivates the country to stress cooperation with neighboring states, including in the  military area, with the aim of building an undivided block that may present itself united at a  global level to deal with defense matters. Such a block should have the capacity to dissuade  foreign interferences and reinforced power to negotiate in international forums.   Therefore, the Union of South American Nations (UNASUL) is of great relevance.  The UNASUL is a proven instrument for: the peaceful resolution of regional disputes,  the protection of democracy in South America, the strengthening of dialogue among  member-states and the progressive development of an industrial defense base in South  America.   In the institutional framework of the UNASUL, the establishment of the South American  Defense Council (CDS) is of especial importance. Formally established on December 16,  2008, by decision of the heads of state of the member-countries,  the CDS has the following  objectives:  •  the consolidation of South America as a zone of peace and a basis for democratic  stability and full development, and world peace;    DEFENSE WHITE PAPER38  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  • the construction of a South American identity in the realm of defense, which  considers sub-regional and national  aspects (the River Plata, the Andes, the Amazon,  the Atlantic, the Caribbean and the Pacific) and that strengthens  Latin American  and the Caribbean unity; and   • the generation of consensus in order to strengthen regional cooperation in defense  matters.   The CDS should therefore promote joint analysis of political and strategic issues,  giving opportunity for a wider debate on global and hemispheric realities, from the South  American viewpoint.   It is important to note that the South American Defense Council is formed by other  forums at regional and sub-regional level, such as the Meeting of the Armed Forces Chiefs  of Staff and Heads of General Staffs; the Inter-American Defense Board; the Committee on  Hemispheric Security; the Meeting of Ministers of Defense of the Americas; the Conference  of American Armies; the Inter-American Naval Conference; and the System of Cooperation  Among the American Air Forces.  South Atlantic As the country with the largest Atlantic coast in the world, Brazil has, for the aforementioned   reasons, special interest in South Atlantic peace and security. The Atlantic Ocean holds  some relevant strategic areas, such as the “Atlantic Throat”, the area between the Brazilian  Northeast Coast and Western Africa which is vital for world trade. The southern passages,  which link the Atlantic to the Pacific, constitute an alternative route to the Panama Canal,  mainly for large ships. The Cape of Good Hope’s route, connecting the South Atlantic to  the Indian Ocean, is an alternative to the Suez Canal and also offers better maritime access  to Antarctica. It is also worth noting the importance of the vast oil basin reserve in the  Brazilian continental platform and the oil import routes from countries around the equator  in the Atlantic.   The strategic maritime areas of greater priority and importance to Brazil are represented  by the Brazilian Jurisdictional Waters (AJB), which include the territorial waters (MT), the  contiguous zone (ZC), the economic exclusive zone (ZEE) and the continental platform  (PC), as well as the region delimited by the 16th parallel north, the west coast of Africa,  Antarctica, the East coast of South America and the East coasts of the Lesser Antilles.   Brazil also dedicates, together with its Western Africa neighbors, special attention to the  building of a cooperative environment in the South Atlantic, under the aegis of the Peace     39DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  and Cooperation Zone for the South Atlantic (ZOPACAS).

In diplomatic terms,  the reinforcement of ZOPACAS is important for the Country’s defense.   The South Atlantic has an historical identity and its own strategic characteristics.  Resolution No 41/11 of the United Nations General Assembly calls for militarily significant  states of other regions to not introduce nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction in  the South Atlantic. The military presence of these states in the Atlantic Ocean should be  reduced and, in future, eliminated. States located in other regions should not project on the  South Atlantic any conflicts and rivalries that are alien to it.   By renewing its involvement in such multilateral precepts, Brazil wishes to contribute, in  a responsible way and in collaboration with its partners in ZOPACAS, to the South Atlantic  region’s potential socioeconomic development.  Defense Related Treaties  Brazil has a solid tradition of peaceful solution of conflicts and a commitment to   international law. Brazil’s first democratic constitution (1891) prohibited wars of conquest  and, since joining the Global forum, in the Second Hague Peace Conference (1907), Brazil  has advocated legal equality among states, while refusing to enter into discriminatory  treaties and agreements.   The country’s territorial disputes were solved through diplomatic means and  international arbitrage, which have consolidated its borders with ten neighbors. In this  way, Brazil anticipated the principles which motivated the creation of the League of  Nations (1919) and the United Nations Organization (1945).  Art. 2 of the United Nations Charter affirms that “The Organization is based on the  principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members”.

Due to clear security needs — dictated by its political,  strategic and defense environment — Brazil understands that realistic and credible measures  to reduce or eliminate weapons as well as  transparent inspection processes may be adopted  multilaterally to contribute to an environment of mutual confidence among sovereign states.   Brazil, in its capacity as a member of the Geneva Disarmament Conference, defends the  strengthening of said Conference as the only multilateral group in the field of disarmament.  In this forum, the country has given highest priority to the elimination of nuclear weapons  through the adoption of a series of complementary measures, in the bilateral, regional  and multilateral spheres, which may result in the adoption of a nuclear disarmament  convention. Among other measures, Brazil supports the initiation of treaty negotiations on  the prohibition of fissile material production for explosive purposes, including pre-existent  stocks. In this way, a significant step could be made in the direction of nuclear disarmament.   Since the beginning of the 1990s, Brazil has participated, with personnel, in the  landmines deactivation campaigns organized by the Program for Comprehensive Action  against Antipersonnel Mines in the Americas and Africa with significant results in terms  of deactivated landmines and swept areas.  Brazil has also acted in favor of discussions  pertaining to the prevention of an arms race in outer space, while upholding the adoption  of a relevant legal international instrument on the matter.   Concerning conventional armament, Brazil is a party to the Convention on Prohibitions  or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons which may be deemed to be  Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects, better known as the Convention  on Certain Conventional Weapons.  Brazil reaffirms its commitment to the following  humanitarian principles:  • prohibition of the use of weapons that release fragments within the human body that  are not detectable by X-rays;  • prohibition or restriction of the use of antipersonnel landmines, traps and other  similar devices;  • prohibition of laser weapons that can cause blindness; and    • acceptance of responsibilities and obligations regarding explosive remnants of war.     41DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  Brazil is also a signatory of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, which forbids  the development, production and storage of such weapons. It is also party to the Chemical  Weapons Convention, which similarly forbids the development, production, acquisition,  storage, holding, transference and use of chemical weapons.   The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  Brazil understands that security, peace and development cannot be disassociated from  the issue of disarmament and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This field  is strongly stratified, as illustrated by the differentiation established in the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT)12 among states that have and states that do not have nuclear  weapons. The possession of weapons of mass destruction (mainly nuclear) and their  launching vehicles (long range missiles), as well as the participation in alliances, which  contemplate the possibility —  even as a last resort —  of employing such weapons, remain  a crucial factor in international relations, with direct implications for defense and security.  The existence of countries with nuclear weapons capacity — not only de jure, but also de  facto13, —  is a menace to the NPT regime.  Some states known to have possession of nuclear  weapons are not parties to the Treaty. The signs of accommodation regarding the de facto  status of these countries, emitted especially by some de jure, nuclear armed states, represent  an element of instability in the system.   Such factors add to the chronic unsteady compliance of obligations related to the NPT’s  three pillars (non-proliferation, disarmament and right to use nuclear energy for peaceful  purposes), with overwhelming emphasis on the first.    The steps for nuclear disarmament provided in Article VI of the NPT were not implemented.  The arsenal of de jure nuclear-armed states was not eliminated. Non-compliance with Article  VI perpetuates the imbalance of the NPT.     12 The NPT was signed on July 1st, 1968 and became effective internationally on March 5th, 1970. Brazil adhered to  the Treaty on September 18, 1998, through Decree No 2.864 of December 7, 1998.  Legislative Decree No 65 of July  2nd, 1998, which approved the NPT text with the aim of adhering the Brazilian Government, highlighted in its Article 2  that “Brazil’s adhesion to the present treaty is bound to the understanding that, in accordance with Article VI, effective  measures will be carried out to stop, in the near future, the nuclear arms race and to eliminate all atomic weapons”. 13 The Latin expressions de jure and de facto are applied as opposing ideas, and mean respectively: “legally” and “in  fact”.

In  this meeting, the nuclear states agreed to the Thirteen Practical Steps for Nuclear Disarmament,  which are systematic and progressive efforts for implementing Article VI of the NPT.    14 NPT Article VIII states that, “Five years after the entry into force of this Treaty, a conference of Parties to the Treaty shall  be held in Geneva, Switzerland, in order to review the operation of this Treaty with a view to assuring that the purposes  of the Preamble and the provisions of the Treaty are being realized. At intervals of five years thereafter, a majority of the  Parties to the Treaty may obtain, by submitting a proposal to this effect to the Depositary Governments, the convening of  further conferences with the same objective of reviewing the operation of the Treaty”. The first NPT Review Conference  was held in 1975. During the 8th NPT Review Conference, held in May 2010, a new Action Plan was adopted, with 64  steps to be complied with by the NPT member-states in the areas of non-proliferation, disarmament and nuclear energy,  with special emphasis on nuclear disarmament. The 9th NPT Review Conference will be held in 2015.  The Thirteen Steps to Nuclear Disarmament —   VI NPT Review Conference  1. Sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.  2. Stop testing nuclear weapons.  3. Negotiate a Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty.  4. Establish a body within the Conference on Disarmament to deal with nuclear  disarmament.  5. Agree nuclear disarmament must be irreversible.  6. Abolish nuclear weapons.  7. Uphold existing treaties, including the Strategic Arms Treaty (START) II and III  and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM).  8. Implement and complete the Trilateral Initiative between the United States, the  Russian Federation and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).  9. Implement a step-by-step approach to achieve nuclear disarmament.  10. Place excess fissile materials under IAEA control.  11. Reaffirm general and complete disarmament, under effective international  control, as the ultimate objective of states.  12. Report regularly on progress toward nuclear disarmament.  13. Further develop verification capabilities to assure compliance with nuclear  disarmament agreements.    43DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  Over a decade later, little was done. The decrease in numbers of nuclear weapons does not  mean, in general, a reduction of the importance of such weapons in strategic doctrines.   The progressive accommodation of de facto nuclear weapons states and the persistence of  doctrines and alliances based on the possibility of nuclear weapons use seems to point in the  direction of growing critique of the NPT and of a new international division based on three  state categories: i) those who have nuclear weapons de jure or de facto; ii) those who do not  have nuclear weapons, but profit from their protection, under alliances or “nuclear umbrellas”;  and iii) those which, genuinely, may be called non-nuclear armed states.   For this last category — which includes Brazil — there is a special concern, the difficult  access to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, set forth in the Article IV of the NPT , and  the development of new military doctrines that foresee the use of nuclear weapons not only  against exclusively nuclear threats, but also against various other types of threats, including  those related to conventional arms or non-state actors.   The ambiguity of the so-called Negative Security Assurances’, granted by states which have  nuclear arms, aggravates the already worrisome expansion of the threat spectrum that nuclear  weapons would supposedly dissuade. States with nuclear weapons refuse to grant to states  without such weapons security guarantees, which are not ambiguous, non-conditional and  backed by binding international legislation.  Among the goals set for Brazil, the following points stand out:   • non-proliferation and disarmament are inter-related, mutually reinforcing processes;   • the reversion of asymmetries inherent to the NPT and the effective reduction of risk  of  nuclear war can only happen through the complete elimination of nuclear weapons; and  • disarmament and non-proliferation efforts should not be directed in detriment to the  right to use, develop and research of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.  Brazil holds consolidated credentials in the field of non-proliferation. The Federal  Constitution forbids the use of nuclear energy for non-peaceful purposes. The arrangement  instituted for the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear  Materials (ABACC) is unprecedented and subjects the Brazilian Nuclear Program to two  international organizations, which carry out auditing, accounting and the application of  safeguards in an independent manner.

In a joint declaration,  in January 2011, Brazil and Argentina stressed the high degree of integration reached by  both countries through bilateral nuclear cooperation by means of significant projects in the  scope of the Binational Nuclear Energy Commission (COBEN). Both nations also ratified all  terms of the Joint Presidential Declaration on Nuclear Policy, signed in San Juan, Argentina,  in August 2010, and promoted a political dialogue initiated in the Permanent Committee for  Nuclear Policy ( CPPN). The purpose of this forum is to continue the exchange of information  on the status of both countries’ nuclear programs, and also on the coordination of positions  in international forums, such as the Nuclear Suppliers Group, among others, as well as the  political evaluations of the bilateral nuclear cooperation and the performance of ABACC.  Brazil’s international action in this area seeks to reinforce national independence and to  guarantee that international rules against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  do not become incompatible with autonomous technological education, including in  strategic areas such as the nuclear sector.  15 The Tlatelolco Treaty is the conventional name given to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin  America and the Caribbean, established on February 14, 1967, in Mexico City.  The treaty came into force on April 25,  1969, and was signed and ratified by all 33 Latin American and Caribbean nations. Brazil signed the Treaty in 1967 and  incorporated it into its legal system through Decree No 1.246 of 1994.   Signatory states agreed to forbid and prevent the   “testing, use, manufacture, production or acquisition by any means whatsoever of any nuclear weapons” as well as the  “receipt, storage, installation, deployment and any form of possession of any nuclear weapon”.  Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of  Nuclear Materials (ABACC)  The ABACC is an independent international agency created by the Brazilian and  Argentine governments. It is responsible for verifying the peaceful use of nuclear  material, which may be used, direct or indirectly, in the production of nuclear weapons.  The ABACC was instituted by the Agreement for the Exclusively Peaceful Use of Nuclear  Energy, signed in 1991, between Argentina and Brazil. By means of this agreement,  the Common System of Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (SCCC) was also  established and is administered by ABACC.  Since June 2011, the Four Party Agreement signed by Brazil, Argentina, the ABACC  and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been acknowledged by  the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) as an agreement granting, in political terms,  guarantees equivalent to those provided in the additional protocols of the IAEA’s  safeguards agreements.    45DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  International Treaties on the Sea, Antarctica and   Outer Space  Differently from land frontiers, which have physical limits and references for their  demarcation, in the sea there are no lines which permit the establishment of visible frontiers.  This peculiarity demands the adoption of conventions that are accepted by the international  community.     In 1982, the resolutions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea —  (UNCLS) were ratified by Brazil. The UNCLS resolutions established important concepts  for the regulation of sea limits, i.e. a territorial waters (MT), where the state exercises full  sovereignty, including the airspace above; a contiguous zone (ZC), where the coastal state  may implement customs, sanitary and control measures as well as restrain legal infractions;  and an economic exclusive zone (ZEE), where the state has the sovereign right to explore,  exploit, maintain and manage natural resources, whether living or non-living. From the  baseline where the MT originates until the external limit of the ZEE, the coastal state  exercises its rights over a 200 nautical miles (370 km) area, the so-called “jurisdictional  waters”, where sovereignty is exerted in differing degrees.   The UNCLS has been ratified by 152 countries.  However, there are still non-adherent  nations, including great powers. This fact may become a source for conflict in the future.  United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLS)  The UNCLS established a sea territory (MT) of 12 nautical miles (22 kilometers),  measured from the continental base line; a contiguous zone (ZC), adjacent to the  MT, which extends to a further 12 nautical miles; and an economic exclusive zone  (ZEE), a 188 nautical miles strip, adjacent to the MT (including the ZC). The UNCLS  established moreover that states may claim an increase in their ZEE, if certain  technical criteria are complied with, to a maximum extent of 350 nautical miles (648  kilometers). Internally, in 1993, Brazil adopted the 1982 and 1988 resolutions of the  UNCLS, but only in 1994, with the ratification of the 60th country, did the UNCLS  enter into force.

This forum discussed  the future of Antarctica and a legal framework for the solution of emerging deadlocks.  A significant part of the Brazilian coast is reached by the winds of the Antarctic  region and the sea currents bring living resources, nourishment and oxygen to Brazil’s  seashore, elements which directly influence the country’s southern coast. A great part of  the available fishing in the Brazilian sea is influenced by the water mass originating in the  Southern ocean. Thus, due to the unparalleled interest the region has for the country, the  Brazilian Antarctic Program (PROANTAR) was approved in January 1982. In that same  year, Brazil acquired the oceanographic support vessel “Barão de Teffé” for the Navy and  commissioned it to carry out a hydrographic, oceanographic, and meteorological study  in Antarctica, as well as to choose a site for a Brazilian research station. This initiative  resulted in the international acknowledgement of the country’s presence in that territory,  which resulted in the acceptance of Brazil as a consultative member in the Antarctic  Treaty16 in 1983.  The international framework for outer space is of great importance to the country. Its main  instrument is the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS), created in  1958, soon after the launching of the first artificial satellite, the Sputnik-1. The UN General  Assembly then formed an ad hoc Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, composed  of 24 member states, including Brazil.   Currently, the Committee has 71 member states. The  COPUOS supervises the implementation of five treaties and agreements regarding the use of  space.  16The Antarctic Treaty was signed in Washington D.C. on December 1st, 1959, by countries which claimed possessions  in parts of the Antarctic continent. Signatory states committed themselves to suspend their claims for an undefined  period, and thereby allowed scientific exploration to be conducted freely in the continent under a system of international  cooperation. The Treaty came into force in June 1961. Brazil adhered to the Treaty on May 16, 1975. Adhesion to the  Treaty was reiterated by Decree No 75.963 of July11, 1975.  The Fernando de Noronha, São Pedro and São Paulo archipelagos and the Trindade  Island, which are far from the coast, are also used as reference points for the Blue  Amazon. The referred region extends to 200 nautical miles, measured from its  baseline.   In the São Pedro and São Paulo archipelagos, located 520 nautical miles from the  coast of Rio Grande do Norte State, Brazil maintains a scientific research station,  with support from the Navy. The station is permanently supplied and inhabited by  Brazilian researchers and is considered to be a prerequisite for the archipelagos to  contribute to the composition of the Blue Amazon.    49DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  The space sector, along with the cybernetic and nuclear sectors, is considered to be a  fundamental strategic sector for National Defense, as noted in the National Defense Strategy.  One of the main objectives of the Brazilian Space Program (PEB) is to reach autonomy  in the development of space activities. The program has a strategic nature; it permits the  monitoring and management of the vast national territory; it contributes to the mastering  of communication and information technologies; it enables meteorological forecasting as  well as air and sea traffic control; and it promotes the development of new space technology.  Among the main projects within the scope of the Brazilian Space Program, the following  are of note:  • China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS): in July 1988, Brazil and China signed  an agreement for the development of two advanced remote sensing satellites. Due to  the combination of financial and technological resources, a shared responsibilities  system was created (30% Brazilian and 70% Chinese), with the purpose of building a  complete image captioning system at international level;   • Brazilian Satellite Launching Vehicle (VLS-1)17: main Brazilian space project being  developed by the Institute of Aeronautics and Space (IAE), of the Brazilian Air Force;  • Cyclone-4 Project, in partnership with Ukraine: this project is managed by Alcantara  Cyclone Space (ACS), a binational state enterprise of Brazilian and Ukrainian capital,  set up in August 2006, with the objective of trading and launching satellites using the  Ukrainian launching vehicle Cyclone-4 from the Alcantara Launching Centre in the  Brazilian state of Maranhão;  • Space Cooperation Project, Argentine-Brazilian Satellite for Oceanic Observation  (Sabiá-Mar): in November 2007, Brazil and Argentina signed an agreement to design  and launch a satellite for Earth observation for environmental and oceanic research  purposes.  The project, which will be managed by a committee with representatives  from Argentina and Brazil, is in its initial phase. It is expected that the satellite for  oceanic observation will be launched in 2015; and   • Microsatellite Launching Vehicle Project (VLM-1): its objective is to develop a rocket  for launching microsatellites (up to 150 kilograms) in equatorial and polar orbits or  for reentry. The project will interface with others regarding the development of inertial  platforms rocket engines, and satellite launching. It is coordinated by the Brazilian  Space Agency and involves the Institute of Aeronautics and Space, foreign research  institutes  (one German and the other Swedish) and private Brazilian companies.  17The VLS project is detailed in chapter 5.

The protection of natural resources is a  highlight of the National Defense Strategy, mainly in regard to the Amazon region.   Brazil directs its environmental initiatives by “Principle 2”18 of the Rio Declaration  on Environment and Development, adopted during the United Nations Conference on  Environment and Development (UNCED Rio-92)19. This principle reasserts every nation’s  sovereign right to exploit its natural resources in accordance with its own environmental  and development policies.  In return for the sovereign right of exploitation, every state must  make a commitment to not damage the environment due to activities performed within its  jurisdiction or under its authority.   Brazil acknowledges the importance of international cooperation, especially with  neighboring countries, for the purpose of preserving the environment and to promote the  sustainable use of natural resources. The nation is part of several regional and bilateral  agreements that establish cooperative relations for managing transboundary natural  resources, such as the agreements that regulate the cooperation and use of the hydro  resources in the Prata basin and the agreement that regulates the Amazon Cooperation  Treaty Organization (OTCA). In the scope of cooperation among Amazonian nations, it  is worth noting the establishment, in 2010, of the New Amazonian Strategic Cooperation  Agenda, which encompasses a series of cooperation initiatives in the area of preservation  and sustainable use of renewable resources.  Within the scope of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CDB), Brazil defends its  interests by upholding a balance between the three pillars of this Convention: the preservation  of biodiversity, the sustainable use of biodiversity and the distribution of benefits derived  from the exploitation of genetic resources.   Brazil considers that the establishment of an international agreement on the access  to genetic resources and to the knowledge traditionally associated with this issue is an  important measure to guarantee the rights of countries and communities which hold such  resources, as well as to fight against biopiracy.  18 Principle 2: “States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law,  the sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own environmental and developmental policies, and  the responsibility to ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of  other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction”. 19 The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCSD) was held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. In  2012, the Conference Rio+20, or Earth Summit 2012, gave continuity to this issue, pursuant to Resolution No 64/236 of  the United Nations General Assembly.”.    51DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  Brazil’s actions in forums on forests, especially in the United Nations Forum on Forests  (UNFF), is aimed at strengthening international cooperation among states in order to  increase the capacity of all states, especially those in development, to contribute to the  protection, preservation and sustainable management of their forest resources.  Brazil does  not renounce its autonomy of decision-making regarding the formulation of public policies  on the preservation and sustainable development of its forest resources.   In the last few years, Brazil has amplified its actions to preserve its forests, as well as  to improve regulation, monitoring, audit, technical assistance, training, credit availability,  and incentives for sustainable production. The defense of this natural asset remains a  commitment for the next decades.   The preservation of the environment is an important objective. The modernization of  Brazil’s defense structure is vital for protecting this enormous asset. The preservation of the  environment in general, and the conservation of tropical rainforests and other biomes are  responsibilities shared by government agencies in the municipal, state and federal levels.  The Ministry of Defense is aware of its responsibility to contribute to the preservation,  control and maintenance of the country’s forest areas.  Foreign and Defense Policies The foreign and defense policies are complementary and inseparable. The maintenance   of regional stability and the construction of a more cooperative international environment  are in Brazil’s interest and will be favored by the joint action of the Ministry of Defense  (MD) and the Ministry of Foreign Relations (MRE).  The National Defense Policy (PND), the National Defense Strategy (END) and the Defense  White Paper (LBDN) are historic milestones for the establishment and dissemination of the  foundations and parameters of our defense. Policy and Strategy determine responsibilities  in promoting the national, particularly in with regard to the country’s development and  security. They evince a need for strengthening dialogue mechanisms between the MD and  the MRE, in terms of sharing intelligence and joint planning.   In the global level, the close participation of military officers and diplomats in  multilateral forums (South American Defense Council and political-military dialogues)  increases the country’s foreign policy and defense capacity to anticipate, in a coherent and  strategic way, the international system and its governance structures, thus facilitating the  defense of Brazilian interests abroad. This joint action must aim at diverse partnerships,  in order to strengthen relationships among developing countries, without doing harm to     DEFENSE WHITE PAPER52  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  traditional relations with developed world partners. At the same time that Brazil seeks to  optimize conditions to obtain technology from more developed countries, the profile of  nations which comprise the BRICS group and the IBAS Forum demonstrates that there are  great possibilities for cooperation among developing countries, even in areas of advanced  technology. For instance, the Air-to-Air Missile Program with South Africa, the outer space  cooperation with Russia, the CBERS program with China and the 145 aircraft project by the  Brazilian Aeronautical Company, (EMBRAER) with Indian radar. The latter is of seminal  importance for future cooperation with India in the defense field.   At regional level, especially in South America, the relationship between foreign and  defense policies must be strong in order to foster and expand integration to empower  South American action in the international arena. It should also be an aggregating factor  in enabling the interaction of neighboring governments in order to prevent threats to the  peace and security of the region.    The South Atlantic joins Brazil to Africa, a neighboring continent which significantly  influenced the creation of the Brazilian nation. Brazil’s special attention to Africa is reflected  in increasing trade and financing and investments, such as the cooperation for the production  of food and other agricultural goods with the support of the Brazilian Agricultural Research  Corporation (EMBRAPA). The protection of communication lines and trade routes with  Africa is of strategic importance to the country. It is one more element in the consolidation  of cooperative relations within the South Atlantic.   Air-to-Air Missile Program  The Brazilian South African air forces are producing, in cooperation, a new missile  called the A-Darter.  The project began in 2006, with investments by both countries.  The Brazilian team is supported by the Funding Authority for Studies and Projects  (FINEP). The A-Darter is a fifth generation air-to-air, short-range defense missile,  i.e. it is able to perform maneuvers to engage targets during flight with an infrared  detection system.    53DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  C H  A P  T E  R  2   —  T  H E   2 1  st  C  E N  T U  R Y   S T  R A  T E  G IC   E N  V IR  O N  M E  N T  Endowed with adequate defense capacity, Brazil will be in a position to dissuade  aggressions against its territory, population and its interests, and thereby contribute to the  maintenance of a peaceful environment in the region.

These institutions need to have the capacity to assure the territorial  integrity of the country and the defense of national interests, the Brazilian people, assets  and resources, as well as to guarantee the country’s sovereignty. All three institutions are  integral parts of the Ministry of Defense (MD), which guides, supervises and coordinates  all actions of the Armed Forces.   The territory is the nation’s land base, delimited by frontiers, waters and airspace  under Brazilian jurisdiction. Brazil has continental dimensions. To ensure its defense, the  Armed Forces are structured in accordance with the Federal Constitution and statutes.    The National Defense Policy (PND)20 and the National Defense Strategy (END) are  legal frameworks that guide the organization and modernization of the Brazilian military  instrument, as well as its training and employment, in a manner that is compatible with Brazil’s  political and strategic stature. These documents define the strategic dissuasive position  adopted by the country. Said position relies on an active diplomatic policy which aims for  peace and development, the preservation of friendship and cooperation with neighboring  countries, and with the international community. It is based on mutual confidence and  respect among nations. In accordance with legal guidelines, the Brazilian Armed Forces are  structured on the basis of capabilities and not in accordance with identified enemies.   Regarding the international arena, the preventive aspect of National Defense depends  on the importance allocated to diplomatic action as the first instrument for the resolution  of conflicts and on a strategic position based upon the existence of recognizable military  capability which is able to generate a dissuasive effect. To amplify the country’s influence   20 The current National defense Policy (PdN) was approved by decree No 5,484 of June 30, 2005 and updated in 2012.

The Armed Forces21  —  constituted by the Navy, the Army and the Air Force — are  national permanent and regular institutions which are organized on the basis of hierarchy  and discipline. These Forces are subordinated to the supreme authority of the President of  the Republic and have as their mission the defense of the motherland, the protection of the  constitutional branches of power and, by order of any of these branches, the protection of  law and order, with the aim of preserving state sovereignty and federal union. The Armed  Forces’ obedience to the democratically elected government, subject to the authority of the  President of the Republic, through the Ministry of Defense, is an essential element for the  republic and for national integrity.  Besides this mission, the Armed Forces also cooperate  with national development and civil defense.  The Armed Forces also act, in partnership with the Judicial Police, against crime in  the country’s borderlands, airspace, sea and rivers. These actions are also conducted in  coordination with other Executive agencies, in accordance with specific duties legally  assigned22 to the Navy, Army and Air Force.  In case of aggression against the country, the state will employ all components of national  power, with emphasis on military power, to exercise its right to legitimate self-defense, in  accordance with the United Nations Charter23. The country’s military power depends on the  capacity of its Armed Forces and the potential national resources that may be mobilized.  The latter reflects not only material resources, but also Brazil’s ability to rapidly increase its  military manpower, by calling up its military reserve. The Ministry of Defense coordinates  joint effort in the area of National Defense.  21 Federal constitution, Art. 142. 22 Pursuant to complementary Law No 97 of June 9, 1999, Art. 16-A.  23 uN charter, Art. 51.    57DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   The Ministry of Defense The Ministry of Defense (MD) was created on June 10, 1999, substituting the Armed   Forces’ Joint Staff and the military ministries. The former ministries of the Armed Forces  were transformed into the Navy, Army and Air Force departments. These agencies are  directed by General or Flag Officers of the highest military ranks, i.e. Admiral and General.  The Ministry of Defense, as a government department of the federal public administration,  is responsible for: coordinating joint defense efforts; for contributing to the protection of  national sovereignty, the constitutional branches of powers, law and order, national assets  and interests; and for promoting Brazil’s influence in the international arena.  The Ministry of Defense has authority over various matters, some of great sensibility  and complexity. These include joint military operations; defense budget; military policies  and strategies; strategic intelligence; science, technology and innovation; health; national  mobilization; remote sensors; command and control; and military service, among other issues.   The MD is also a political actor responsible for the promotion of cooperation among  other government agencies, which develop activities that are related to national defense.  The MD aligns defense projects with programs developed by these other government  agencies.  Organizational structure  The new perspectives derived from the National Defense Strategy, and the stronger   protagonism of the Ministry of Defense in the Brazilian political scene has led to an ample  restructuring of this government department. The rearrangement has promoted the role of  the Armed Forces Joint Staff, the Secretariats, and other agencies within the Ministry.  The organizational structure of the Ministry of Defense is currently as follows:  • Defense Military Council (CMiD) — an advisory board;  • Armed Forces Joint Staff (EMCFA);  • Office of the Secretary General (SG);  • Office of the Minister of Defense;  • Planning Office (ASPLAN);  • War College (ESG);  • Legal Office (CONJUR);    DEFENSE WHITE PAPER58  C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   • Internal Audit Office (CISET);  • Office of Management (SEORI);  • Office of Personnel, Education, Health and Sports (SEPESD);  • Office of Matériel (Secretaria de Produtos de Defesa — SEPROD); and  • Center for the Management and Operation of the Amazon Protection System  (CENSIPAM).

It is responsible for the coordination of interoperability programs with the purpose  of optimizing military resources for national defense, border security as well as rescue and  humanitarian operations.   The main instrument, through which the Armed Forces will develop strategic and tactical  flexibility, is the coordination among the military departments, which must improve joint  operational guidance in order to enhance capability. The reference point for this cooperation  will be the collaboration between the military staffs of each Armed Force in collaboration  with the Armed Forces Joint Staff to establish and improve interoperability.

In 2010, the then named Center for Peacekeeping Operations Training (CIOpPaz), a  Brazilian Army unit, originally founded in 2005, was transformed into the CCOPAB. From  then on it has integrated members from the three Armed Forces, Military Polices and Fire  Departments. This integration has strongly favored the synergy of these professionals in  complex peacekeeping missions.  Defense Strategic Sectors The National Defense Strategy selected three strategic areas: the nuclear sector, the   cybernetic sector and the space sector. The Ministry of Defense’s Ministerial Directive No  14 of 2009 resolved that the nuclear sector would be subject to the coordination of the Navy,  the cyber sector would be managed by the Army and the space sector by the Air Force.   The priority for all three sectors is to improve national scientific and technological  education and to develop human resources.  Nuclear Sector  Brazil develops nuclear technology with its own knowledge, and it is today included among  the main countries that have more fully mastered nuclear technology, with special note to  energy generation, and medical and industrial applications. The country has mastered the  entire nuclear fuel cycle and possesses enough uranium resources to meet all of its needs.  Brazil’s main objective is the technological autonomy and consolidation of its nuclear  industry as a state-of-the-art complex and promoter of development. As already mentioned  in Chapter 2, nuclear technology in Brazil is exclusively used for peaceful purposes. It is also  worthy of note that the Brazilian nuclear industrial park qualifies as an international reference,  especially concerning the security and protection of its facilities, as well as its waste control.   Since 1979, the Navy contributes to the Brazilian Nuclear Program, having fully mastered  the nuclear fuel cycle31, It currently supplies centrifuges to the Nuclear Industries of Brazil  (INB), with headquarters in Resende (RJ).   31 The nuclear fuel cycle is a set of stages in the industrial process which transforms the uranium element, in its natural  state, into fuel for use in a nuclear plant.    71DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   The essential part of the Navy Nuclear Program is the construction of a reactor for  the nuclear propelled Brazilian submarine, which will raise, considerably, the defense  capacity of Brazil in the South Atlantic.  It is important to highlight that only the submarine’s propulsion system will be nuclear,  which is expressly permitted in the agreement signed with the International Atomic Energy  Agency (AEIA). All of its weapons will be conventional, due to Brazil’s constitutional  commitment to the use of nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful purposes. This  commitment was reaffirmed in international agreements, such as the Non-Proliferation  Treaty, the Tlatelolco Treaty and the Brazil-Argentine treaty on the ABACC.   The possession of a submarine with nuclear propulsion will contribute to the defense  and preservation of national interests in water, particularly in the South Atlantic, and will  also permit:  • the protection of commercial routes;  • the safeguarding of navigation freedom;  • the protection of natural resources in the continental platform; and  • technological development.  Cybernetic Sector  Cyber threat has become a concern, as it puts in risk the integrity of delicate infrastructures,  which are essential for the operation and control of various systems and organizations  directly linked to the field of national security. Cyberspace protection includes a great  number of areas, such as education, intelligence, scientific research, doctrine, military  development, employment and personnel management. It also comprises the protection of  cyber assets and the capacity for acting in network.   The cyber sector has both intra and inter-organizational elements. It is multidisciplinary  and generates different technological services and products, besides management methods  and processes, at all levels.   Brazil’s efforts in the cyber sector has the purpose of ensuring confidentiality, availability,  integrity and authenticity of data circulating in its networks, which are processed and saved.  This project is a long-term effort which will positively influence the operational, scientific  and technological areas.  Under Army coordination, significant advances have been made in training specialized  personnel and in the development of advanced technological solutions. The following  premises were set for the project:    DEFENSE WHITE PAPER72  C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   • contemplate multidisciplinarity and duality of use;  • promote the defense industrial base;  • induce the national industry to produce innovative systems; and  • produce critical national components.  The Army Center for Cyber Defense is adding efforts to those of other existenting  government organizations. It seeks to:  • develop human resources;  • update doctrine;  • strengthen security;  • respond to network incidents;  • incorporate lessons learned; and  • protect against cyber-attacks.  Space Sector  Brazil’s space projects aim for scientific technological development. More specifically, they  seek to strengthen Brazilian air and space power, scientific research, innovation, national  space launch operations and technological services in aviation, space and defense systems.   The Satellite Launching Vehicle (VLS) is the main space project and requires higher  investment. The Aeronautics and Space Institute (IAE), an organization subordinate to the  Air Force Department of Aerospace Science and Technology (DCTA), has been developing,  since 1966, a set of sounding rockets of the (Brazilian) Sonda group. The increasing  improvement in space technology has allowed the development of the Satellite Launching  Vehicle. The first stage of this vehicle consists of four equal S-43 propellant units. These  devices, which operate simultaneously, are similar to the first stage of the Sonda IV rocket, of  the last series of the Sonda group. Other space products have been developed by the national  industry or in cooperation with foreign industries.  The Alcantara Launching Center (CLA) and the Barreira do Inferno Launching Center  (CLBI), located in the states of Maranhao and Rio Grande do Norte, respectively, are Air  Force organizations, subordinate to the Department of Aerospace Science and Technology  (DCTA). They operate launch missions, track aerospace devices, and collect and process data  on payloads. Moreover, these institutions conduct tests and scientific experiments of interest to  the Air Force and in accordance with the National Policy for Aerospace Development.    73DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   *brazil designed and built two data collection satellites (scd 1 and scd 2) to understand the environmental diversity  of the national territory.

It is part of the Military Structure of War (EMG), which, in  peace time, is integrated to the Air Force, being directly subordinated to the Air Operations  Command (COMGAR).   Its mission is to ensure the sovereignty over Brazilian Airspace, through control and, if  necessary, actions and interferences against movements in the Brazilian airspace that are  contrary to laws in force, or which may represent a threat to national interests, whether in  peace or in conflict.  National mobilization  National Mobilization System (SINAMOB)  National mobilization32 is a set of activities that are planned and developed by the state,  in a fast and mandatory manner, with the purpose of enabling the Country to carry on  strategic actions in the field of National Defense. The decree for mobilization is a presidential  prerogative.   For these strategic actions to be a well prepared and executed, Law No 11.631 of 27  December of 2007 created the National Mobilization System (SINAMOB). This system is  composed of a group of agencies which act in an integrated and orderly fashion, in order to  plan and carry out all phases of national mobilization and demobilization.   When decreeing national mobilization, the Executive Branch must specify the national  geographic area where it will take place and the necessary steps for its execution, including:  • the summoning of federal agencies to integrate the national mobilization effort;  • the readjustment of production, trade, distribution, consumption and services;  • the intervention in public and private production;  • the requisition and occupation of goods and services; and  • the drafting of civilian and military personnel.  32 The concept of mobilization is mentioned in item XXViii of Article 22, and item XiX of Article 84 of the Federal  constitution.

Elasticity refers to the capacity to rapidly increase human and  material resources available for defense purposes. This concept is linked to the issue of  military service, which is a National Defense instrument capable of supplying the reserve  troops required for military mobilization.  Military Service  Compulsory Military Service is a fundamental element for the mobilization of the  Brazilian people in defense of national sovereignty.  The legal basis for military service is provided in the Federal Constitution, in the Military  Service Law; in the Law for Military Service in the Areas of Medicine, Pharmacy, Odontology  and Veterinary Science; and in the Law for Alternative Service33. The Ministry of Defense is  the central agency of the Military Service.  According to the system now in force in Brazil, initial military service is mandatory for  male citizens. Permanence of these individuals in the regular service is optional.  Military service allows the nation to shape public spirit among citizens, instilling values  of solidarity, and justice as well as principles of, ethics and national pride. It is also an  important instrument for affirming national unity.  33 Alternative service refers to the practice of administrative, assistance, philanthropic or productive activities, instead of  activities that are essentially military in nature.

The initial military service  lasts for a year. The contingent is composed  of enlisted and selected men 18 years old or  older, and by doctors, pharmacists, dentists  and veterinarians, from both sexes, which fit into the aforementioned law.   From 2003 on, the phases of the recruiting process became common to the three Armed  Forces, under the direction of the Ministry of Defense.  At the end of the selection phase, citizens may be assigned to military service in a Navy,  Army or Air Force organization, while registered in one of the Reserves Training Units  (OFR), such as Reserve Officers Training Centers, Reserve Officers Training Units and  Military Shooting Ranges.  The Reserve Officers Training Centers (CPOR) and the Reserve Officers Training Units  (NPOR) are military combat education institutions, dedicated to training reserve officers.  The Military Shooting Ranges, known literally as “Shots of War”, are Army organizations  that train reserve personnel. They permit draftees to undertake military service in their local  area. This way, young draftees may combine military instruction with study and work.  In Brazil, around 1.65 million young  males annually reach the age required  for military service enlistment and  approximately 90 thou-sand are  admitted into the Armed Forces.

The increasing technological complexity of weapons, as well as the fluidity of circumstances  in which they are applied, generate ever growing demands on military personnel. This, in  turn, elevates the necessity for qualified men and women in the Armed Forces.  Defense Intelligence System (SINDE)  Law No 9,883 of December 7th, 1999, states that the Ministry of Defense is a component   of the Brazilian Intelligence System (SISBIN) and must supply data and specific knowledge  related to the defense of national institutions and interests to the Brazilian Intelligence  Agency (ABIN).  In 2002, the Defense Intelligence System (SINDE) was created in the scope of the  Ministry of Defense and the Armed Forces, with the objective of integrating the planning  and execution of actions on defense intelligence.   The Defense Intelligence System was developed to produce and safeguard knowledge of  interest to the Ministry of Defense and which is strictly military-technical in nature. This  system functions in two levels:    • Defense Strategic Intelligence — aims at the production of necessary knowledge for  the decision making process, as well as the formulation and direction of policies and  plans in the highest levels; and   • Defense Operational Intelligence — aims at the production and safeguarding of  necessary knowledge for the planning, direction and support of military campaigns  and operations, in order to achieve strategic objectives in the area of operations.    Based on systemic relations, without links of subordination, the Defense Intelligence  System is comprised of the highest-level intelligence organizations within the Ministry  of Defense and the Armed Forces. This System directs its activities in light of resolutions  made by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and National Defense34chaired by the Minister  of Institutional Security of the Presidency of the Republic (GSIPR), and in accordance with  resolutions of the Government Council, chaired by the President of the Republic or, on his  decision, by the President’s Chief of Staff. The Council is also integrated by the Ministers  and the President’s Private Secretary.  34 The chamber is responsible for the formulation of public policies and guidelines of matters related to the Federal  Government foreign affairs and National defense.    81DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   Brazilian Navy The Brazilian Navy was created on July 28, 1736, by authority   of João V, King of Portugal, originally as a Secretariat of State for  Naval Affairs and Overseas Territories, directly subordinated to  the King.  In 1808, as a result of the Napoleonic invasions, the Portuguese  Royal Court fled to Rio de Janeiro, and the Prince Regent, João  VI, appointed João Rodrigues de Sá e Menezes, Count of Anadia,  as head of that Secretariat, officially transferring it to Brazil.  In 1821, before returning to Portugal, João VI appointed the  Fleet Chief Manoel Antonio Farinha, as Secretary of State for the Navy Department in  Brazil.   Despite the importance of the above mentioned facts, which established the legal  foundations of the Brazilian Navy, it is important to note that the first Brazilian commander  of a naval group, in an essentially military mission, was registered 123 years before. In 1613,  during the French occupation of the State of Maranhão, Jeronimo de Albuquerque, born  in Olinda, State of Pernambuco, commanded an expedition of approximately 100 men,  on board of ships built in Brazil, known as “caravelões” (large caravels). This expedition,  departing from Recife and with the help of indigenous people, played a significant role in  the expulsion of the invaders.

The sea was the way to discovery,  colonization, trade, foreign invasion and the consolidation of independence. It was also  the arena for the defense of sovereignty in several occasions, including the two world wars.   In the 21st century, the country’s geopolitical complexity and the importance of the sea  for Brazil’s development induce multiple scenarios for the use of Naval Force. In addition  to the vastness of Brazil’s maritime areas, the Brazilian Navy faces great challenges to its  mission.  Mission  It is the Navy’s responsibility to: develop and employ Naval Power in the defense of the  homeland, in accordance with the Federal Constitution and other laws; to safeguard the  branches of state; and, by initiative of any of these branches, to ensure law and order. The  Navy also acts under mandate of international organizations and in support of the country’s  foreign policy. The Naval Force also fulfills subsidiary duties provided in law, especially  those related to “Sea Authority”, for the protection of national interests.   To fulfill its duties, the Navy directs its operational and support units according to the  policies established by the Ministry of Defense.  The Navy is assigned the following subsidiary tasks:  • guide and control the Merchant Navy and its related activities in what concerns the  Ministry of Defense;  • ensure the safety of maritime navigation;  •  contribute to the formulation and direction of national maritime policies;  •  enforce compliance with laws and regulations on the sea and inland waters, in  coordination with other departments of the Executive Branch from the federal and  state levels; and  •  cooperate with federal departments on the repression of crimes with national or  international repercussion, that occur at sea, in inland waters and in port areas,  through logistical, intelligence, communications and training support.  Due to these responsibilities, the Navy Chief of Staff is legally designated as the “Sea  Authority”35. The roles of the Sea Authority are related to matters of Sea Power36.  35 state power over maritime areas, which are under national sovereignty and jurisdiction. 36 maritime Power is the segment of National Power that is related to navigation in seas, inland waters as well as  waterway transport, fishing, deep-sea resource exploration, related industries, maritime public policy and, mainly, the  people’s maritime vocation. Naval Power is the “armed branch” (or military segment) of maritime Power.    83DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   Organization and Equipment   The Navy has the following organizational structure: a) An office of general management, the Navy Staff (EMA).  b) A senior advisory office, the Admiralty. c) Six institutions of direct and immediate assistance to the Navy Chief of Staff:  • Office of the Navy Chief of Staff (GCM); • Navy Intelligence Center (CIM); • Navy Office of Internal Audit (SecCIM); • Navy Special Attorney’s Office (PEM); • Inter-ministerial Commission for Maritime Resources (SECIRM); and • Navy Press Office (CCSM).  d) Seven area specific institutions: • Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (ComOpNav); • Directorate-General for Navigation (DGN); • Navy Secretary-General (SGM); • Navy Directorate-General for Material (DGMM); • Navy Directorate-General for Personnel (DGPM);  • Marine Corps Command (CGCFN); and • Navy Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation (SecCTM).  organization chart of the Navy  emA Admiralty  comopNavsGmdGN dGmm  Navy Commander  direct and immediate  Assistance offices  cGcFN  comemchcomemchcomemchcomemchcomemchcomemchcomemchcomemch  General management office senior Advisory office  Area specific institutions  Naval Forces and marine corps  comemchcomFFe comdN (9)  comForAerNavcomForscomForsup comdiv-1 comdiv-2  dGPm seccTm    DEFENSE WHITE PAPER84  C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (ComOpNav)  The Office of the Chief of Naval Operations is responsible for readiness, training and  employment of Naval, Naval Aviation and Marine Forces in military operations.

It was created in  Portugal on August 28, 1797, by authority of Queen Maria I, who arrived in Rio de Janeiro on  March 7, 1808, accompanying the rest of the Portuguese Royal family migrating to to Brazil.  The Marine Corps’ baptism of fire37 took place during an expedition to French Guyana  (1808/1809), with the takeover of Caienne38 In 1809, João Rodrigues Sá e Menezes, Count  of Anadia, then Navy Minister, ordered the Navy Royal Brigade to occupy the São José  Fortress, in the Island of Cobras, where to this day the Marine Corps Command has its  headquarters.  After King João VI’s return to Portugal, one battalion of the Navy Royal Brigade remained  in Rio. Since then, marines have been present in all important events of the history of Brazil,  whether in conflicts to consolidate national independence or in the Prata campaigns, or in  other armed conflicts which the country has been engaged in.  Over the years, the marines has been designated different names: Naval Artillery  Battalion of Rio de Janeiro, Navy Artillery Corps, Naval Battalion, Navy Infantry Corps,  Naval Regiment and, finally, since 1932, Marine Corps. In the 1950’s, the Marine Corps  was structured for operational employment as a Landing Force, becoming a segment of the  Navy assigned to naval campaigns requiring land operations.   37 First combat engagement. 38 brazil was then integral part of the Kingdom of Portugal.   \r    Districts’ Naval Aviation Resources    95DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   The Marine Corps is a professional and volunteer military unit which is in permanent  readiness for employment. It is expeditionary in character, par excellence, and essential for  the defense of naval and port facilities; as well as ocean archipelagos and islands in Brazilian  jurisdictional waters. The marines are also important for controlling river banks in riverine  operations and for conducting peacekeeping and humanitarian missions.  Organization  The Marine Corps is part of the Navy organization. It is composed of a Marine Command  (CGCFN) and its operational branch, the Fleet Marine Force Command (ComFFE), the  latter under the Naval Operations Command.  The Marine Corps Command has the purpose of contributing to the development and  employment of Naval Power, regarding specific Marine Corps activities, in the areas of  personnel, equipment and doctrine.  The Fleet Marine Force (ComFFE) is a unit that is organized, trained and equipped for  the execution of amphibious and land operations of limited range. These activities entail  launching a military force, from ships or vessels at sea, and involves landing on hostile or  potentially hostile beaches.  An amphibious operation is characterized by the integration of trained, organized and  equipped forces with different combat roles. Such operations, though generally concluded  on land, aim at the objectives of a naval campaign.

It is indispensable for  marine missions. Its main battalions are: one Logistics, one Engineering, and one  Amphibious Vehicles;  • Landing Command — assigned to constantly monitor potential crises situations,  in order to enable agility on the part of the Fleet Marine Force in the organization,  activation and employment of its Marine Corps Operational Groups (GptOpFuzNav);  • Marine Corps Special Operations Battalion — a special operations unit, adopted in  hostile environments, with the purpose of: destroying or damaging relevant objectives  in defended areas, capturing or rescuing personnel or material, recovering facilities,  obtaining data, outwitting or producing psychological effects on the enemy; and  • Rio Meriti Marine Corps Base — a support unit that supplies personnel and material  for command, control and administrative purposes.    The Marine Corps Groups (GptFN) are operational units designed to provide security  to naval facilities and to undertake limited operations, compatible to their numbers, in  support of Fleet Marine Corps Operational Groups. The Marine Corps Groups are located  and subordinated to Naval Districts’ headquarters, except for the 8th Naval District which  has no Marine Corps group.

The Navy should be able, whichever the situation, to fulfill four basic tasks concerning  Naval Power: deny the enemy use of the sea, to control maritime areas, project power over  land and contribute to determent.  A Naval Force must be able to efficiently provide for its own defense, including against  air threats. In such situations an operational aircraft carrier is indispensable. The capacity  to control maritime areas cannot be reached only through escort ships, which are vital. The  employment of interception and attack aircraft are also indispensable.    101DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   A Naval Force with different types of ships, commanded by an aircraft carrier, has the  mobility, permanence, flexibility and versatility needed to enable it to meet a wide range  of missions, from humanitarian to peacekeeping, as well as typical maneuvers in crises or  armed conflict.   A well-equipped Naval Force provides policymakers the capacity to calibrate the  employment of force, at appropriate time and place, with proportional intensity to meet  intended purposes. It is therefore an efficient determent element.  Since the 1970’s, the Navy found that conventional submarines were not sufficient to  face possible threats in the South Atlantic, its immediate naval operations environment.  To comply with its constitutional mission of defending sovereignty, territorial integrity  and the country’s sea interests, the Navy also requires nuclear propulsion submarines. The  exceptional mobility of these vessels ensures the advanced defense of the farthest maritime  frontier.   The surface Naval Force will rely on medium and large sized ships, which are able to  operate and remain for a long time at sea, as well as smaller sized ships, assigned to coastal  patrol and the patrol of main navigable Brazilian waterways.  In order to ensure readiness and security of Brazilian sovereignty and interests, inside the  country and overseas, the Navy will keep forces in conditions of immediate employment  (Fast Task Force) in naval war operations, in peace time, or in situations of crisis and conflict.   The Navy, employing its naval, air force or amphibious resources, has the condition to  conduct non-combatant evacuations, peacekeeping and humanitarian operations. It may  also project amphibious forces, regardless of hostility levels and the type of mission to be  achieved.  Strategic vision and goals  The Navy directs its activities with the aim of becoming a modern and well-balanced  Force39, It seeks to possess naval, aircraft and amphibious resources, which are compatible  with the country’s political and strategic standing in the international arena.  39  A modern Force is a military organization which is equipped with resources that are up-to-date, i.e. resources that  are less than 20 years in use. To ensure this, quality must prevail over quantity. balance refers to the development of  activities which ensure simultaneous employment at sea or in inland waters. balance also refers to the capacity of  executing, gradually, the four basic tasks of Naval Power and naval war operations.

For the Navy, the availability of nuclear submarines adds a new dimension to Brazilian  Naval Power, guaranteeing it deterrence capacity as required by its constitutional mission.   During the formulation of projects for deployment, procurement and modernization  of naval resources, the premises were contemplated. These principles were based on the  guidelines established by the National Defense Strategy for the Navy:  • the cyber, space and nuclear sectors are vital for National Defense;   • the task of denying the use of the sea by the enemy guides the country’s naval strategy;  • the reconfiguration of the Navy’s resources should balance between submarine, surface  and aerospace elements;  • the prioritization of the control of maritime areas which stretch from Santos (SP) to  Vitória (ES) and the Amazon River delta;  • the Naval Force will be organized around capabilities. It will be emphasize monitoring/ control, mobility and presence. In this manner, it will respond promptly through  strategic mobility, having the operational capacity to monitor the sea from space;  • Personnel will be relocated, particularly to the Amazon delta region, to the national  borders and to the large hydro basins of the Amazon, and the Paraguay-Paraná rivers;  • the capacity to assist undertake peacekeeping operations, humanitarian action and  international commitments for search and rescue will be increased;  • Brazil will project and manufacture its conventional or nuclear propulsion submarines,  as well as surface, amphibious, naval air and space resources;    • the Navy organizes itself and deploys its units in a manner that facilitates joint and  singular  operations; and  • the Navy should act, primarily, through a strategic defensive position.  Based on the aforementioned premises, short and long term projects of interest to the  Navy were developed40, Some are listed below, in no particular order, although they and are  all considered strategic and vital for the Naval Force:  • ensure the continuity of the Navy’s Nuclear Program;   • revitalize and reinvigorate the Navy’s current resources;  40 The main projects and sub-projects will be in detail in chapter 5.    103DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   • build a Second Fleet and a Second Marine Corps Force, with headquarters in the  North/Northeast (including a naval base, a naval air base, an amphibious base and a  supply base);  • improve the current Submarine Force, by incorporating conventional resources (S-BR)  and nuclear propulsion submarines (SN-BR). The Submarine Development Program  (PROSUB) may be highlighted. It includes the launching of four “Scorpène”41conventional  submarines from 2016 on and one nuclear propulsion submarine from 2022 on;  the building of specific docks and naval base; and the continuity of the Submarine  Modernization Program (MODSUB) for the five currently available conventional  submarines  of “Tupi” and “Tikuna” classes;  • structure surface forces to increase the capacity for controlling maritime areas with  cover demining, logistics and defense support;  • renew the surface fleet by building, primarily in Brazil, escort ships, logistics support  ships, patrol ships of various classes, aircraft carriers and multiple purpose ships;  • refit the Fleet Air Arm with highly efficient defense aircraft;  • increase the current Marine Corps manpower to two Fleet Marine Forces with two  landing units — one an amphibious brigade in the First Fleet, the other an amphibious  unit in the Second Fleet;  • structure the Navy with riverine forces for the Amazon basin and the Pantanal region;  • ensure the necessary resources and organizational structure to support subsidiary  roles assigned to the Sea Authority, through the “Navigation Safety” Program. This  program seeks to create and elevate (hierarchically) military port authorities, their  branches and agencies. It also aims at the construction of riverine ships for patrolling  transportation, medical assistance and assigned ships;   • increase the capacity of the Navy to fulfill international commitments for search and  rescue;  • supply the Navy with appropriate resources to participate in peacekeeping operations  and humanitarian actions, and to support the National Civil Defense System;  • implement the “Blue Amazon” Management System, for monitoring and surveying   Brazilian jurisdictional waters (AJB), with the purpose of improving the Navy’s  capacity for controlling maritime traffic in the South Atlantic. This is meant to ensure  the security of vessels engaged in strategic activities and to increase the capacity for  search and rescue;  41 scorpène submarines are conventional submarines, i.e. they rely on diesel-electric engines. These vessels are  derived from French technology, which will be transferred to the brazilian Navy as part of Prosub.

Over the years, the participation of women in the Navy has been notable. As officers  and enlisted women, they act in various areas, such as medicine, odontology, health  assistance (nursing, psychology, nutrition, physiotherapy and pharmacy), engineering,  architecture, civil construction, pedagogy, accounting, administration, law, history, social  communication, museology, librarianship, computer science, economics, social service,  security of waterway traffic, physical education, oceanography and meteorology, among  other fields relevant to the Navy.   Women are now military organization heads or deputy heads and team leaders.  They manage projects and the construction of warship and other equipment. They lead  departments, divisions and sections in the administration, in hospitals, in technology  centers, in naval districts and in the Navy’s specialized directorates.  In the Navy’s Medical and Engineering Corps, in particular, women may rise to the rank  of General Officer (Admiral), competing in equal conditions with male officers  belonging  to the same Corps.

The first Battle of Guararapes, on April 19, 1648, is considered  the genesis of the Brazilian Army. On this occasion, the Forces  fighting the invaders were genuinely formed by Brazilians (white,  colored and Amerindians).  In 1822, the Army cooperated with the quest for independence,  supporting Emperor Pedro I in a struggle that consolidated the  political emancipation of the country.   The Army fought, under the Empire, in conflicts of the River  Plata region and contributed to the consolidation of the Brazilian territory. Led by Marshall  Deodoro da Fonseca, the Brazilian Army played a fundamental role in the establishment of  a Republican government in 1889.  The Army exercised a relevant role in maintaining the unity of the homeland, and it  continues to do so. Its history is mixed with the country’s. The Army is present across the  national territory and identifies itself with the people. In it men and women are represented  without distinction of ethnic, religious, or social background.

The Army’s mission is conditioned by a territory of continental dimensions, by geographical  diversity and by a vast border with 10 countries.   Mission  It is the Army’s responsibility to develop the Land Force in order to meet its constitutional  mission of defending the homeland, protecting the three branches of state and upholding  law and order when called upon.  The Army must also fulfill subsidiary roles as provided  in complementary law, such as: to support national development and civil defense, as  well as the country’s foreign policy and to participate in international peacekeeping and  humanitarian missions.   The Army integrates the National Civil Protection and Defense System (SINPDEC),  taking part, across the national territory, in aid and assistance to victims of natural disasters,  whether in the phase of prompt response or in the stage of recovering and reconstructing.    The following subsidiary duties are also assigned to the Army:  • act, through preventive or repressive actions in the land frontiers, against border and  environmental crimes, separately or jointly with agencies of the Executive Branch.  This includes performing patrols; screening and inspecting people, land vehicles, ships  and aircraft; and arresting flagrant offenses;  • cooperate with federal agencies, whenever necessary, in the repression of crime,  within the national territory, by providing logistical, intelligence, communications and  training support; and  •  cooperate with federal, state and municipal agencies on engineering services.

The Land Force has seven Army Divisions and twelve Military  Regions, some of which are cumulative. The Amazon Command and the Northeastern  Command have each an engineering group.   The Army Divisions incorporate brigades and artillery units. The Army has 27 brigades  and four artillery units (three in the Southern Command and one in the Eastern Command).  The brigades may be subordinated to the Army Divisions or directly to the Area Commands.  The basic combat module is the brigade, which may be one of several types, depending  on the nature of its mission, the material utilized, or the operational area to which it is was  designated.   The brigade is a large unit based on a combined arms approach, which is able to perform  missions in an autonomous manner. Normally, it is composed of: maneuverable units and  sub-units (infantry and cavalry); suppressive fire units (field artillery): air defense units  (anti-aircraft artillery); combat support units (engineering and communications); and  logistics support units (supplies, medical services and combat materials). Brigades may  receive, according to their needs, fractions of the Army’s aviation, electronic warfare,  electronic intelligence, psychological operations, special operations, and anti-aircraft units,  and also Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).  Brigades are characterized by the flexibility of their organization and diversity of weapons,  munitions, vehicles and equipment, which, together with qualified personnel, are integrated  to ensure adequate performance of complex operations.  The main brigade types are:  • Light Brigades: Jungle Infantry Brigade, Frontier Infantry Brigade, Motorized Infantry  Brigade, Light Infantry Brigade and Parachute Infantry Brigade. The light brigades  were created due to the Land Force’s need for units with great flexibility and operational  capacity, which are able to move and act with celerity and efficiency anywhere in the  national territory, and also to guarantee law and order, as provided in the Constitution;    DEFENSE WHITE PAPER118  C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   CMS CMSE  CML  CMP CMNE  CMO  CMA  Cascavel  Dourados  Campo Grande  Curitiba Ponta Grossa  Florianópolis  Santa Maria  Porto Alegre  Pelotas  Bagé  Uruguaiana  Santiago  Corumbá  Cuiabá  Goiânia Cristalina  Brasília  Rio de Janeiro  Belo HorizonteJuiz de Fora  Salvador  Recife  João Pessoa Natal  Fortaleza Belém  Marabá  Manaus  Boa Vista  Tefé  São Gabriel da Cachoreira  Porto Velho  Campinas  São Paulo  Taubaté  Caçapava  Guarujá  Area Command Headquarters Military Division and Region (unified)  Military Region Armored Brigades  Mechanized Brigades Motorized Brigades Parachute Brigades  Light Brigade/Frontiers  Mountain Brigades  Anti-airspace Artillery Brigade  Special Operations Brigades Army Aviation Command Engineering Group  Division  Key  Deployment of brigades  CMS CMSE  CML  CMP CMNE  CMO  CMA  Cascavel  Dourados  Campo Grande  Curitiba Ponta Grossa  Florianópolis  Santa Maria  Porto Alegre  Pelotas  Bagé  Uruguaiana  Santiago  Corumbá  Cuiabá  Goiânia Cristalina  Brasília  Rio de Janeiro  Belo HorizonteJuiz de Fora  Salvador  Recife  João Pessoa Natal  Fortaleza Belém  Marabá  Manaus  Boa Vista  Tefé  São Gabriel da Cachoreira  Porto Velho  Campinas  São Paulo  Taubaté  Caçapava  Guarujá  Area Command Headquarters Military Division and Region (unified)  Military Region Armored Brigades  Mechanized Brigades Motorized Brigades Parachute Brigades  Light Brigade/Frontiers  Mountain Brigades  Anti-airspace Artillery Brigade  Special Operations Brigades Army Aviation Command Engineering Group  Division  Key  CMS CMSE  CML  CMP CMNE  CMO  CMA  Cascavel  Dourados  Campo Grande  Curitiba Ponta Grossa  Florianópolis  Santa Maria  Porto Alegre  Pelotas  Bagé  Uruguaiana  Santiago  Corumbá  Cuiabá  Goiânia Cristalina  Brasília  Rio de Janeiro  Belo HorizonteJuiz de Fora  Salvador  Recife  João Pessoa Natal  Fortaleza Belém  Marabá  Manaus  Boa Vista  Tefé  São Gabriel da Cachoreira  Porto Velho  Campinas  São Paulo  Taubaté  Caçapava  Guarujá  Area Command Headquarters Military Division and Region (unified)  Military Region Armored Brigades  Mechanized Brigades Motorized Brigades Parachute Brigades  Light Brigade/Frontiers  Mountain Brigades  Anti-airspace Artillery Brigade  Special Operations Brigades Army Aviation Command Engineering Group  Division  Key    119DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   • Medium Brigades: Mechanized Infantry Brigades and Mechanized Cavalry.   Medium Brigades have armored vehicles on wheels. They are assigned to defense  operations against foreign threats. During conflicts, they may be used in for scouting  and security purposes. They delay potential aggressors until the Land Force deploys  troops which are in better conditions to face the enemy; and  • Heavy Brigades: Armored Cavalry Brigade and Armored Infantry Brigade.   The Heavy Brigades are armored brigades. They are potent, highly mobile forces and,  therefore, can be decisive in land conflicts. Their mission is to close in on the enemy,  in order to destroy or neutralize, utilizing fire, maneuver and shock tactics. In the  battlefield, they are particularly capable of conducting highly mobile offensive actions  with great depth.  There are also three specific brigade combat modules43:  • Army Air Command;  • Special Operations Brigade; and  • Anti-aircraft Artillery Brigade.  The strategic conception of employment and the operational environment indicate  the nature, organization and material which are to be used by the Land Force. From this  premise, brigades are organized and trained to act mainly in their areas of specialization.  Equipment In addition to human resources, the Land Force possesses the following equipment, in   order to meet its Constitutional mission:  43 A combat module of a brigade is the lowest ranking unit of the Land Force which gathers under a single  command the main operational systems (maneuver, intelligence, command and control, fire suppression,  mobility, counter-mobility and protection, anti-air aircraft defense and logistics), allowing combined training  of arms and services. This combination must integrate combat units (infantry and cavalry), combat support  units (engineering, artillery and communications) and logistics units, with specific tasks, which compose the  operational systems. The combat module is able to act independently and to endure in action.

Military  manpower, which is compatible with the Country’s political and strategic stature, is  essential.  The Army develops capabilities, whether jointly with the other Forces or separately,  to meet three requirements simultaneously: secure the defense of the territory, project  power in order to secure vital interests and meet foreign policy demands for security,  international peace and regional integration. These capabilities require Forces at a  high level of readiness, supported by others formed by the mobilization of material  and human resources.  Based on lessons learned from contemporary wars and trends of future conflicts,  the Army develops its resources based on capabilities, since this approach provides  the institution with effective tools to respond to diffuse challenges in future.     \r     \r     \r     \r      DEFENSE WHITE PAPER124  C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   The following new capabilities are considered priorities for the Army:    • land determent compatible with the country’s political and strategic status;  • international projection of the Army in support of Brazil’s foreign policy;  • performance in cyberspace with freedom of action;  • Land Force logistics readiness;   • interoperability (with other Forces) and complementarity (with other agencies);  • integrated management at all levels;  • effective military doctrine;  • higher emphasis on the human dimension;  • adequate budget;  • defense products linked to operational capacity; and  • systemic management of operational data.  Strategic Vision and Goals    The Army is a public and permanent national institution. It is a fundamental instrument  for the security and defense of the Brazilian state. The internal and external acknowledgement  of the Army’s capacity to fulfill its mission demonstrates the Force’s relevance to the society  it serves. Such relevance must be permanently sustained through the understanding of the  people’s needs, of the state’s demands and the conditions imposed by the environment.   The Army has sought to modernize its equipment and armament, as well as the  quality of its personnel. However, to meet strategic demands, it has become evident that,  beyond adapting and modernizing, the Army must adopt the concept of transformation.  Transformation refers to the development of capabilities to comply with new duties, whether  derived from the present operational environment or from future challenges. This concept  is detailed in chapter 5.  Consistent with the dynamic development of the strategic environment, the Army started  a Transformation Process which will be continuous and oriented by a Force Project. Both  Process and Project are inserted into the Planning System of the Army.  The Army Staff completed a diagnostic of the Land Force, based on the National Defense  Strategy, and proposed actions for its adaptation to new demands of the state and the  Brazilian people. This initiative has resulted in the Strong Arm Strategy (EBF).    125DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   The following premises, established by the National Defense Strategy, were considered  in the preparation of the Strong Arm Strategy:  • the Army will be organized under the aegis of the trinomial monitoring/control,  mobility and presence;  • it must have strategic mobility to response quickly to any threat or aggression;  • it must deploy its strategic reserves in way that allows for fast concentration and   employment of Forces; • it must deepen the presence of military units in the frontiers; • it must develop the concept of flexibility in combat in order to meet monitoring/  control, mobility and presence requirements;   • it must develop the principle of elasticity, which is the capacity to quickly increase the   quantity of troops; and • the Amazon region is of great interest for the Ministry of Defense and the Army must   be able to deploy equipment and personnel in this area.    The Strong Arm Strategy is composed of a Deployment Plan, which determines the  positioning of personnel in order to meet the strategic concepts of employment, presence  and determent, and to attend to requirements of an Equipment Plan. The former comprises  the Protected Amazon Program and the Homeland Sentinel Program. The latter comprises  the Strategic Mobility Program and the Brazilian Combatant Program. These plans are  aligned to the Defense Deployment and Equipment Plan (PAED).

It includes the progressive installation of new Special  Frontier Platoons, as well as the modernization of existent ones. In a second stage,  the Program determines actions for the strengthening of the operational and logistics  structure of the Amazon Command.  Simultaneously, the Army will implement a Border  Monitoring System (SISFRON), through the use of electronic and radar means, such  as the SABER M60 and others to be developed, in integration with other military and  civilian systems, with the purpose of optimizing the capacity of monitoring around 16  thousand kilometers of border area in the Amazon, Midwest and Southern regions;  • Homeland Sentinel Program — includes the reorganization, the improvement and,  especially, the integration of logistics and operational structures of the area commands.  As aforementioned, the Amazon Command is contemplated in the Protected Amazon  Program;  • Strategic Mobility Program — aims to attend to the Army’s needs in terms of  replacements and material modernization, in order to improve mobility, flexibility and  interoperability with other Armed Forces; and   • Brazilian Combatant Program — includes projects dedicated to the research and  development of Defense products, the priority being the growth of nationalization and  acquisitions in the internal market.

Education — Main Training Centers    Army Academy (AMAN)  The Army Academy originated in 1792, with the creation of the Royal Academy of Artillery,  Fortification and Design, in Rio de Janeiro — the first military school of the Americas. During  the 19th century, the name was successively changed to Royal Military Academy, Imperial  Military Academy and Military Academy of the Royal Court. From 1906 to 1910, this  institution functioned at the War School in Porto Alegre (State of Rio Grande do Sul), and in  1913, at the Military School of Realengo (State of Rio de Janeiro). It was only on January 1st  1944 that the Army Academy was installed in a permanent site in Resende (State of Rio de  Janeiro). In 1951, the institution was officially designated the name of Army Academy.  The Academy develops the Army’s career combat officers. The undergraduate program  activities are carried out to develop necessary qualities for the military profession. The  Program lasts five years. The first year is undertaken in the Army Cadets Preparatory School  (EsPCEx), located in Campinas (State of São Paulo). The remaining four years are studies at  the Army Academy itself.  The curriculum includes subjects related to military and exact sciences, as well as  humanities. On concluding the program, the graduate is declared officer candidate and  is granted a military sciences degree. Admittance to the Army Academy occurs exclusive  through national competitive exams for the Army Cadets Preparatory School.  The founder of the Army Academy was Marshall José Pessoa Cavalcanti de  Albuquerque, who chose the location for the new building, conceived the project  for the institution and reinstated the title of “cadet”, which had been abandoned at  the time of the proclamation of the Republic. He also determined the use of historic  uniforms and created the “Short Sword of the Duke of Caxias”.

Throughout the teaching process, the cadet develops humanistic, scientific and  technological knowledge necessary for a career in the Army.   In the Academy, the cadet acquires a technical and military foundation, through training  and exercises, in order to be able, as a future officer, to exert command and leadership of  small groups (platoons and sections) and of subunits (companies, batteries or squads).  Junior Officer School (EsAO)  Founded in April 8, 1920, by the Minister of War Dr. João Pandiá Calógeras, the Junior  Officer School has the mission of developing captains, enabling them to command and lead  military units and preparing them for the exercise of staff duties which are not reserved for  the active duty Army Staff group. The program offered by this School lasts two years. The  first year is undertaken through distance learning, the second year requires class attendance.

Its mission is to prepare senior ranking  officers for staff, command, leadership, management and advisory roles in the highest ranks  of the Land Force. The College also cooperates with general and specialised organisations in  the Army in the field of doctrine for force development and employment.   All Command and Staff College programs are of graduate level and taught in accordance  with the country’s legislation on university education and the Army’s education regulations.   The Command and Staff College is increasing its relationship with similar military schools  in the Navy (Naval War College), in the Air Force (Air Force Command and Staff College)  and with civilian universities. Currently, it also accepts in its programs military personnel  from friendly nations, mainly from South America and Africa.  Military Engineering Institute (IME)  Located in the city of Rio de Janeiro, the Military Engineering Institute originated from  the merger of the Army’s Technical School and the Military Institute of Technology, in 1959.  The Military Engineering Institute has the mission of developing officers for the Army’s  Military Engineering Group (QEM). The following programs are offered: undergraduate  degree, exclusively for officers from the Army Academy; undergraduate degree and basic  military training for young civilians who finished high school; and basic training program  for graduate engineers who wish to join the Army. It also offers Masters and PhD degrees for  civilian and military personnel. Furthermore, the Institute plans, coordinates controls and  executes competitive examinations for admittance and the selective recruitment process for  the Army’s Military Engineering Group.   The quality of the Institute’s programs is apparent from the excellent results which it  regularly obtains in the Programs General Index (IGC)44. It is always among the 14 best  institutions, out of over two thousand participants.   The Army Technological Project determines the transfer of the Military Engineering  Institute from its current facilities to Guaratiba (State of Rio de Janeiro), near the Army  Technology Center (CTEx). New and modern buildings, with state-of-the-art equipment,  and proximity to civilian and military research and development organization will allow the  Institute to reach higher levels of excellence in its activities. The study on IME transfer and  updating process is in a conclusion stage.  44 The Programs General index (iGc) evaluates the performance of university level institutions in the country. it  synthesizes in one index the quality of all undergraduate, masters and Phd degrees in an educational institution. The  index is published by the Anísio Teixeira National institute for educational studies and research (inep) of the ministry of  education, immediately after the results of the National students Performance exam (enade) is published.

Its mission is to: develop active duty  officers of the Medical Doctors’ Group of the Army’s Health Service; coordinate graduate  programs for Health Service officers, as well as other programs for military personnel of  the Complementary Group in the fields of Nursing, Veterinarian Science and Psychology;  contribute to the development of military doctrine in the health area; carry out research in  Health Studies, in cooperation with similar institutions; offer internships in the health area;  and administrate competitive examinations for admittance into military health programs.  Army School of Administrative and Technical Studies (EsFCEx)  The Army Administrative and Technical School was created on April 5, 1988 with the  name of Army School of Administration. Located in the city of Salvador (BA), the School  began its activities by offering programs for Army career officers and enlisted men.    On October 2, 1989, Law No 7,831 created the Complementary Officers Group to meet  changes required by the modernization of the institution. From then on, the School took  charge of the education of officers for this new Group.   The School currently develops men and women with previous degrees in different fields  from university level institutions acknowledged by the Ministry of Education. Applicants  to the School must pass competitive exams, of national scope. Once admitted, they then  attend the Program for Officers of the Complementary Group (CFO/QC) which enables  them to perform and assume responsibilities and roles of Army officers, within their field  of expertise.  On November 8, 2010, the Ministerial Regulation No 1,080 transformed the Army School  of Administration into the Army School of Administrative and Technical Studies, changing  its mission and organization. Besides officers of the Complementary Group, the School  began, from then on, to develop officers in the professions of dentistry and pharmacy.  Combat Sergeant School (EsSA)  Located in the city of Três Corações (State of Minas Gerais) the Combat Sergeant School  is the military educational institution in charge of selecting and educating sergeants in the  professions of Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery, Engineering and Communications.

The School’s main purpose is the professional development of the Army’s  logistics sergeant. All curriculum activities seek to enable students to exercise specialized  roles within Army organizations.  Senior Combat Sergeant School (EASA)  The Senior Combat Sergeant School was established on July 10, 1992, with the name  of Sergeant Training Center — South, subordinated to the Southern Command, in the  quarters of the 17th Infantry Battalion.   The School has the mission of further educating sergeants of the Brazilian Army. To  achieve this purpose, it offers the Further Studies Program for Sergeants (CAS) of the  Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery, Engineering and Communications professions, thereby enabling  them to exercise roles at their rank level, including in administrative areas.  Scientific and Technological Institutions  Army Technology Center (CTEx)  Established in 1979, in Rio de Janeiro, the Army Technology Center is a military  organization directly subordinated to the Department of Science and Technology. Its mission  is to conduct research and development of defense products of interest to the Land Force.  To accomplish this goal, the Center, on occasion, engages in partnerships with national  companies for the joint development of products and receives financial support from the  Studies and Projects Fund (FINEP) of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation  (MCTI). These partnerships were celebrated, for example, to develop the SABER M60  radars.  Among the projects under development by the Army Technology Center, the following  are noteworthy:  • radar SABER M60 — the project contemplates a low altitude anti-aircraft defense  system, which protects sensitive points and areas;     C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   DEFENSE WHITE PAPER132  • anti-vehicle light weapon  — developed by Army Technology Center in partnership  with national companies, it is a weapon of individual use for anti-vehicle combat at  close quarters;  • missile MSS 1.2 AC — has the objective of attending to the demands of modern  combat, including high level of mobility, strong fire power and the capacity to engage  different types of targets; and  • flight simulator for Esquilo and Fennec helicopters — a product of the Army Technology  Center, developed in partnership with a national company, it aims to train Army pilots.  Foreign Exchange and Cooperation   The Army maintains a series of exchange and international cooperation activities with  other nations. The Land Force’s growing cooperation with South American and African  countries is noteworthy, particularly the Brasil-Paraguay Military Cooperation, which  began in 1942, originally named Brazilian Military Training Mission in Paraguay (MMBIP).

Maria  Quiteria is considered to be the first Brazilian woman to enlist in a military unit. However,  it was only in 1943, during World War II, that women were officially admitted into the  Brazilian Army. In that year 73 nurses (67 of them based in hospitals and six specialized in  air transport) were recruited. These volunteers served in four different United States Army  hospitals. After the war, as with the rest of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB), the  majority of nurses were awarded medals, promoted to officer ranks and placed on leave  from regular military service.  In 1992, the Army Administration School in Salvador (BA) enrolled the Army’s first  student cohort which included women — 49 in total, approved in competitive examinations.  The Army instituted, in 1996, the female volunteer military service for medical doctors,  dentists, pharmacists, veterinarians and nurses with undergraduate degrees.  In the same  year, the first class of 290 volunteer women was incorporated into the Army to render  military service in the healthcare area.   In 1997 the Military Engineering Institute enrolled its first 10 female students into the  Military Engineers’ Group (QEM).  Also in 1997, the Army Health School (EsSEx) enrolled and educated its first cohort of  university-level female medical doctors, dentists, pharmacists, veterinarians and nurses for  the Army Officer Health Group.  In 1998, the Army instituted a technical traineeship for graduates from other fields. In  that year, to meet institutional demands, it incorporated the first cohort of female lawyers,  business administrators, accountants, teachers, systems analysts, engineers, architects,  journalists, among other professionals, totaling 519 women.

The female officers (and medical doctors)  concluded the Leadership and General Staff Program for officers of the Health Group. They  therefore have the possibility to compete, in future, for promotion to General Officer rank.  The Army’s greatest asset is motivated men and women, who are able to fulfill their  missions. Therefore, in order to correct a legal gap, the Executive Branch has proposed a bill  to allow women to be admitted into more military programs which develop Army career  personnel, taking into account the peculiarities of military life.

In 1916 the Navy founded the  Naval Aviation School, in the Island of Enxadas,  in the city of Rio de Janeiro. In 1919, the Army  created the Military Aviation School at Campo  dos Afonsos, a neighborhood of the same city.  In 1941, during World War II, the Ministry of Aeronautics45, was created from the merger  of aerial and human resources from the Army, Navy and Civil Aviation Department. Its  armed branch was initially called National Air Forces, and in June of same year, it became  called Brazilian Air Force.  It is noteworthy that, in 1932, the first flight of the Military Air Mail (CAM) departed  from Campo dos Afonsos. This service was later replaced by the National Air Mail (CAN),  which has been of great importance for national integration.   45 The first minister of the Air Force was a lawyer and political leader named Joaquim Pedro salgado Filho.

It took part in the anti-submarine  campaign of the South Atlantic and in air combat over Italy, on the side of the Allies.  With the establishment of the Ministry of Defense in 1999, the Ministry of Aeronautics,  similarly to the other Armed Services, was subordinated to this new ministry and renamed  Brazilian Air Force.  The challenges faced by the Brazilian Air Force are proportional to the country’s  dimensions. The continental dimensions of the Brazilian airspace which needs to  be patrolled, controlled and defended, as well as the complexity of the international  environment, generate multiple demands for the Air Force, which in turn requires modern  and efficient means to meet these challenges.    Mission The Air Force is responsible for maintaing sovereignty over the national airspace in order   to defend the homeland. In particular, it must stop any acts hostile to national interests. To  achieve its purpose, the Air Force relies on its capacity for surveillance, control, and defense  of the national air space, through resources of detection, interception and destruction.  The Air Force has the following subsidiary roles:  • provide security for airspace navigation;  • establish, equip and operate aerospace, aerial and airport infrastructure under its  responsibility;  • operate the National Air Mail;  • cooperate with federal agencies in the area of law enforcement involving the  use of airspace and airport areas, through the provision of logistics, intelligence,  communications and training; and  • act in a continuous and permanent manner, alongside the judicial police services,  through airspace control, against all types of illicit air traffic, especially the traffic of  drugs, weapons, ammunitions and illegal passengers.  For the performance of this last role, the Air Force acts in cooperation with inspection  agencies, which take action after landing of aircrafts involved in illegal air traffic. In the  absence of lack of these agencies, the Air Force may inspect people, land vehicles, boats and  aircrafts, as well as arrest individuals engaged in flagrant infractions.   Considering the nature of these roles, the Air Force Chief of Staff is officially designated  “Military Air Authority”.

Its  equipment is classified by type of employment, i.e. fighter, patrol, transport, search & rescue,  rotor-wing and reconnaissance aircrafts.  This materiel is distributed in air bases across the  national territory.   The air bases are in charge of providing the necessary administrative, logistical,  operational and security support to the Air Force and the operational commands that act  within their premises, permanently or temporarily.  The following factors are considered important for the full utilization of the Air Force’s  capabilities to achieve the institution’s mission.   In the strategic realm:  • capacity to visualize areas of crisis or conflict;  • technological capacity; and  • institutional and international relations.  In the logistics realm:  • combined and joint operational capacity as well as continuous logistical support;  • security and redundancy of communications system;  • maintenance of elevated morale;  • human, financial and material resources;  • information technology training and education; and  • organizational structure, asset management and administrative rationality.   In the operational realm:   • command and control capacity;  • combat capacity;  • capacity to operate in hostile electromagnetic environments;  • capacity for self-defense on land and against aircrafts;  • intelligence capacity; and  • operational planning capacity.    147DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   Strategic Vision and Goals    To fulfill the Air Force’s mission — as provided in the Constitution and federal laws,  and according to the National Defense Strategy — an Institutional Planning System was  established.

The Air Force’s Strategic Military Plan (PEMAER) is a product of the Planning System. This  Plan reaffirms projects and actions contained in the Defense Deployment and Equipment  Plan (PAED), sets the objectives for the Air Force for an intended period and guides the  prioritization process of budget resources, while defining duties and responsibilities.  Based on a methodology developed by the Air Force, a strategy for planning and action  was conceived, which sets three structural axes described below.   I. Strengthening operational capacity  This axis has the following main objectives: supply the necessary means for the safe  and efficient circulation of both civilian and military air traffic in Brazilian airspace; and  contribute to the defense of national sovereignty, through aircraft development, acquisition  and modernization.   Main benefits:  • effective capacity for surveillance, control and defense of airspace over vulnerable  points and areas of the national territory, based on resources for detection, interception  and destruction;  • stronger military capacity to integrate main efforts for defending the nation. Actions  related to Air Force re-equipment would be prioritized; and   • assimilation of knowledge which will allow the country to achieve technological  independence in the airspace sector.  II. Scientific-technological training and education  Planning regarding the aerospace scientific-technological complex is guided by the  continual effort to educate and train human resources, as well as acquire physical capital,  in order to attain full knowledge over the technologies required. To achieve this purpose,  the Air Force allocates special attention to research as well as technological and industrial  development in the aerospace sector.   Main benefits:  • contribution to the reduction of foreign dependence, in straight cooperation with  national industry, especially in the aerospace sector, through the gradual nationalization  of equipment and services;    149DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   •  adequate plans to support national industry by promoting associations, participations  and acquisitions that secure competitiveness, with the aim of promoting exports; and   • human resources development in the field of Air Force related technology.  III. Organizational and operational transformation  The Air Force transformation process seeks to identify the ideal dimensions and structure  for the organization, in order to eliminate strategic vulnerabilities, and thereby allow the  Air Force to carry out its mission of National Defense and of promoting the country’s  development.  Main benefits:  • full knowledge of advanced technologies, through the modernization of human  resources education and training systems;  • maximization of operational and management effectiveness within the Air Force, in  accordance with new operational capacities and concepts, which require organizational  change;  • appreciation of Air Force professionals through the improvement of support structures;  and  • promotion of relations that expedite planning and interoperability with other Armed  Services, and that favors the deployment, employment and support to the Air Force.  Education - Main Institutions  Air Force Academy (AFA)  The Air Force Academy replaced the Aeronautics School, an institution originally  located in Campo dos Afonsos, which developed aviation and logistics officers for the Air  Force since the creation of the Ministry of Aeronautics in 1941. The name changed from  Aeronautics School to Air Force Academy in 1969.  In 1971, the Academy was transferred to new facilities in Pirassununga (State of São  Paulo). It is now responsible for developing cadets through the Pilot Officers Program  (CFOAV), the Logistics Officers Program (CFOINT) and the Infantry Officers Program  (CFOINF).  These undergraduate degree programs last four years and prepare officers for the initial  ranks of the Air Force in the aviation, logistics and infantry careers.

It is responsible for training civilians  and military personnel for future employment as Air Force officers.  Air Force Sergeant School (EEAR)  The Air Force Sergeant School was created in 1941 through the merger of human and  physical capital from the Navy and Army aviations. The Sergeant School was initially  located in the Ponta do Galeão, Governor’s Island, in the city of Rio de Janeiro. In 1950,  it was transferred to Guaratinguetá (State of São Paulo) where it remains to this day. This  School is charged with developing Air Force sergeants.  Scientific and Technological Institutions   Aeronautics and Space Institute (IAE)  The Aeronautics and Space Institute was created from the merger, in 1991, of the  Research and Development Institute (IPD) and the Space Activities Institute (IAE).  Its mission is to conduct research and development in the field of aerospace.   This Institute has been developing scientific and technological solutions to  strengthen Brazilian Aerospace Power. In particularly, it manages the satellite  launching vehicle project, the sounding rockets project and the unmanned aerial  vehicle project, among others.  Advanced Studies Institute (IEAv)  The Advanced Studies Institute originated from the fusion of the Advanced Studies  Laboratory and the Advanced Studies Division, both belonging to the now extinguished  Aerospace Technical Center (CTA). With the activation of the Technical Aerospace  Command, the Advanced Studies Institute became a military organization of the Air  Force, specifically assigned to the development of experimental technologies and the  study of liquid propellants and supersonic combustion technology, among other affairs.    153DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   153  Industrial Promotion and Coordination Institute (IFI)  The Industrial Promotion and Coordination Institute was established in 1967.

On that occasion, 150 women were admitted to the Air  Force — psychologists, nurses, systems analysts, social assistants, phono-audiologists,  nutritionists and librarians — selected from across the country. Women, therefore, have  been part of the administrative life of the Air Force for three decades.  In the Air Force Academy — where the military personnel that are allowed to achieve  the highest ranks of the Air Force are trained and educated — women began to be  admitted in 1996, in the Logistics Officer Program. In 2006, the Air Force graduated its  first cohort of female military pilots.   Female Air Force officers of the aviation, logistics, infantry, health and aeronautics  engineering careers are allowed to be promoted to General Officer ranks, while  competing in equal conditions for promotions with male officers. Currently, the  Brazilian Air Force employs approximately four thousand women.

The Defense Structure is  composed of the following officials:  I. President of the Republic;  II. Minister of Defense;  III. Defense Council;  IV. Armed Forces Chiefs of Staff;  V. Chief of the Joint Staff; and  VI. Commanders of Operational Commands.  The President of the Republic, as commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces, assisted by  the Minister of Defense, and by the Defense Council, is responsible for the employment  of military resources and for the strategic direction of the Armed Forces, as provided in  Article 2 of Complementary Law No 97 of June 9, 1999.  The Armed Forces have their own structure and are subordinated to the Minister of  Defense. The Joint Staff (EMCFA) is the permanent advisory institution of the Minister of  Defense for the direction of the Armed Forces. The Joint Staff prepares and coordinates the  planning of joint employment in operations that involve military personnel and resources.  In face of crisis or armed conflict, the President of the Republic approves a strategic plan  for employment and appoints Commanders of Operational Commands. Once activated,  each Operational Command is responsible for a geographical area — Theater of Operations  — where the Commander has the authority to conduct military operations in order to reach  selected and approved objectives. The Operational Commanders present to the Minister  of Defense an overview of operations to be conducted and a proposal for the allocation of  resources to their respective Commands.   The Armed Forces Chiefs of Staff supply the resources allocated by the Minister of  Defense to the Operational Commanders and provide the necessary logistical support.       157DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   Joint Operations Doctrine  The development of the Armed Forces, based on their operational capacities, allows the   Ministry of Defense to possess military forces that are able to act jointly, with flexibility,  versatility and mobility.  Military operations of extended scope demand the employment of considerable resources  from more than one Armed Service. To meet this challenge, the Armed Forces must join  efforts, adopt compatible procedures and integrate actions in order to obtain greater  efficiency and effectiveness in the execution of joint operations.  The Joint Staff prepares the Strategic Plans for the Joint Employment of the Armed Forces  (PECFA) and coordinates joint Armed Forces training and employment.  The planning of a joint operation, though similar to any other operation, is distinct in  terms of the heterogeneity of employment procedures and of the technical peculiarities of  the participating Forces. Hence the importance of coordination and integration of planned  actions through a joint operations doctrine.  The joint operations doctrine sets conditions for the synchronization of naval, land and  aerial actions, in order to attain strategic and operational objectives, in accordance with  political, diplomatic and economic efforts. The goal is to be effective through the synergy  of Force Components within the Operational Command operating in a certain Theater of  Operations.  Theater of Operations (TO) The Theater of Operations can be on land or sea and is comprised of the necessary area for   operations to be conducted, including the respective logistical support. The Armed Forces  that act in a TO are under a single Operational Command. The single Command allows  the coordination of actions and greater interoperability among Forces, avoiding duplicate  efforts and favoring the reduction of losses.  An Operational Command will be of a joint nature whenever it is formed by more than  one Force. On the other hand, each Force Component, integrating a Joint Operational  Command, may be either of singular or joint nature.   A Force Component will be of a singular nature whenever it is constituted of resources  from just one of Force. In this case the Force Component will receive the name Naval Force  Component, Land Force Component or Air Force Component.

In this case, they may be called Joint Task Force (Ft Cj) or Joint Force (F Cj), for example:  Special Operations Joint Force (F Cj Op Esp), Logistic Command (C Log) etc.   These military Forces must share areas of operation and carry out actions with a single  objective, which requires a high degree of interoperability. This requires mutual knowledge  and exchange of information and services regarding: employed forces; common procedures;  standardization of plans and document; and equipment employed.  Interoperability in Joint Operations  Several Force Components coexist in the Theater of Operations, sharing the sea, land  and aerial environments in a coordinated way, conducting actions for the achievement  of missions. The Theater of Operations Command synchronizes the Force Components  in order to reach strategic and operational objectives. The goal is to obtain effectiveness  through the synergy of the various resources in the Theater.

The employment of   the Armed Services in this type of operation is fundamentally different, in principles and  doctrine, from their traditional employment in missions related to defense against foreign  threats. In the latter, action is focused on enemy forces that are perfectly identifiable in the  field and usually characterized by conventional military weaponry and uniforms.   The peculiarities of this type of action has fostered the creation of a school for the study  and research on the field. The Law and Order Operations Training Center (CIOpGLO), in  Campinas (State of São Paulo), subordinated to the 11th Light Infantry Brigade, seeks to  modernize doctrine and the development of human resources for this type of employment.  The employment of the Armed Forces in law and order operations is the prerogative of  the President of the Republic as provided in Article 15 of Complementary Law No 97 of  199947. The Law specifies that following presidential orders, the Armed Forces’ operational  units will be activated to carry out the preventive and repressive actions necessary to ensure  the expected results, in an episodic manner, within a previously established area and for a  limited time.   47 Altered by complementary Laws No117 of 2004 and No136 of 2010.

The latter  should establish an operations coordination center, comprised of representatives of the public  agencies under his operational control or with related interests.   Brazilian legislation highlights the subsidiary nature of the Armed Forces’ intervention,  which should only occur “when all other means assigned to the preservation of public order  and the safety of the people and their property are exhausted”, as determined in Article 144 of  the Federal Constitution.   Presidential Decree No 3,897 of 2001 determines that public security means are considered  exhausted whenever, within a certain period of time, they become unavailable, inexistent or  insufficient for the regular performance of their constitutional mission.   It is also noteworthy that — as provided in Article 5 of same decree — the Armed Forces  may be employed to ensure law and order in situations when disturbances are presumable,  such as in official and public events, particularly those in which heads of states or of a foreign  governments participate, or on elections, upon request by the Electoral High Court.  Usually, the Armed Forces are employed to ensure law and order jointly with federal, state  and municipal security agencies.  Contemporary Examples of Military Force  Employment    Brazil’s Participation in the World Wars Brazil’s participation in the First World War was motivated by a series of episodes involving   Brazilian ships in Europe. For example, in April of 1917, the merchant vessel “Paraná” was  sunk near the English Channel. During the following months, other Brazilian merchant  vessels were sunk as well.  President Wenceslau Bras made an alliance with the countries of the Triple Entente and,  even without substantial military power, Brazil supported them, logistically, with agricultural  and raw materials.   In compliance with commitments to the Inter-allied Conference, the Brazilian government  sent a medical mission comprised of civilian and military surgeons, to act in campaign  hospitals in the European Theater of Operations, a number of aviation officers, from the     161DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   Army and the Navy, to join the Allied Air Force and, also, part of the Fleet, essentially to  conduct anti-submarine warfare.  In order to meet the Navy’s duties, the organization of a task force named “Naval Division  for Operations of War” (DNOG) was established. It was constituted of ships from the Brazilian  Fleet divisions. The following vessels joined the DNOG: the cruisers “Rio Grande do Sul”  and “Bahia”, the destroyers “Piauí”, “Rio Grande do Norte”, “Paraíba” and “Santa Catarina”,  the supply ship “Belmonte” and the tugboat “Laurindo Pitta”. The total naval contingent was  approximately 1.5 thousand men. The division was charged with patrolling an area within a  maritime triangle, which extended from the city of Dakar, in the African coast to the island of  São Vicente, in the Cape Verde archipelago, and Gibraltar, in the Mediterranean.  The participation of Brazil in World War II was also strongly motivated by the successive  sinking of Brazilian merchant vessels. In reaction to popular pressure, Brazil declared war on  the Axis powers on August 1942. The participation of the country in this conflict was more  significant than during the First World War.  Brazilian operations in the South Atlantic started almost at once. The Navy controlled  the navigation routes between North and South America. It also participated in joint and  combined operations, including the air-naval patrol, protection and escort of naval convoys  and preventive actions to impede attacks by the Axis powers on Brazilian soil.

It protected  the country’s international trade and ensured necessary supplies for the nation.   The Army sent approximately 25 thousand men to fight in Europe against the Axis powers.  The Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB) integrated the Fifth US Army. After heavy losses, the  FEB’s first successful operation was the siege Monte Castello Fortress, which was occupied and  garrisoned by a highly capable enemy division.   Following this success, the FEB carried out its subsequent missions with equally impressive  results. The first enemy force to surrender in Italy did so to FEB personnel, the so called  “Smoking Snakes”48. During the World War II Italian campaign, the FEB took custody of  over 20 thousand prisoners.  The Brazilian Air Force was created during World War II, in 1941. In 1942, it began to  carry out engagements in the patrol of Brazilian waters. In 1943, the 1st Fighter Group was  created. In the same year, a Brazilian Air Force aircraft sank an Axis submarine in the coast  of Rio de Janeiro.  The 1st Fighter Group operated in Italy from 1944 and integrated the 350th US Fighter  Group. It executed over two thousand missions and distinguished itself as one of three  foreign air units to be awarded a United States Presidential Unit Citation.  48 The brazilian expeditionary Force adopted the smoking snake as symbol due to what was said at the time: that it would  be easier to see a snake smoking than to see brazil at war.  illustration of a brazilian soldier in World War ii and the brazilian expeditionary Force symbol —  the smoking snake    163DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   Also worth noting is the participation in Italy of the 1st Liaison and Observation  Squadron, which acted jointly with the Divisionary Artillery, both units of the Brazilian  Expeditionary Force.

Brazil’s Participation in Peacekeeping Missions Since 1947, the country participates in United Nations peacekeeping missions, having   already contributed with over 30 thousand military and police personnel. It has integrated  operations in Africa (Congo, Angola, Mozambique, Liberia, Uganda and Sudan), in  Central America and the Caribbean (El Salvador, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Haiti), in  Asia (Cambodia and East-Timor) and in Europe (Cyprus and Croatia). Brazil assigned  troops to Suez (UNEF), Angola (UNAVEM), Mozambique (ONUMOZ), East-Timor  (UNTAET/UNMISET), Haiti (MINUSTAH) and, recently, in Lebanon (UNIFIL).  An important example of Brazilian participation in peacekeeping missions is the  presence of a contingent of the Armed Forces in Haiti, since 2004, in the United Nations  Stabilizing Mission — MINUSTAH. Brazil supplies over two thousand Army, Navy and  Air Force military personnel, the largest contingent among the 15 participating countries  and holds the command of this Peacekeeping Force.    The MINUSTAH was created by resolution of the United Nations Security Council. It  contributes to the reestablishment of institutional normality in Haiti after a long period  of political instability.  illustration of an aircraft of the brazilian Air Force in World War ii and the symbol of the Air Force in the  conflict    DEFENSE WHITE PAPER164  C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   The MINUSTAH’s role in ensuring the presidential elections of 2006 and 2010, with  peaceful transition of power, are noteworthy. As is the relevant role of the United Nations  Mission in reconstructing Haiti after the severe earthquake of January 2010.  The work undertaken by the Brazilian military is acknowledged by the Haitian people  and by international authorities. This is due to the military’s particular form of action,  a result of prior training received and its own professional expertise acquired with time.  The Haiti mission also allows participating Forces to improve their operational and  logistical systems, as well as maintain exchanges with troops from other nations.   In coordination with the UN and other UNASUL countries which integrate the Mission,  Brazil plans a gradual withdrawal of its troops from Haiti, in accordance with the desire  and capacity of the Haitian government to guarantee the country’s security.   Another recent example of Brazil’s participation in peacekeeping missions is the  Brazilian presence in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).

Armed Forces’ Role in Ensuring Law and Order The participation of the Brazilian military in a Pacification Force for the Complexo do   Alemão and Complexo da Penha — both low income suburban neighborhoods of the city  of Rio de Janeiro — is another, of several, examples of the Armed Forces’ work aiming to  fulfill their constitutional mission.  This Pacification Force was created by the Ministry of Defense in 2010, by order of the  President of the Republic, in order to cooperate with the Government of the State of Rio de  Janeiro in the establishment of law and order, following illegalities committed by organized  crime. The “Alemão-Penha” neighborhoods were occupied following coordinated action by  the Army, Navy and the State of Rio de Janeiro’s Military Police Force.  The Pacification Force, established under the authority of the Army’s Eastern Command,  acted to ensure the safety of the population until police personnel could be prepared to  occupy Police Pacification Units (UPP) in the communities. Besides these operations, the  military also undertook civic and social activities (ACISO)49, with the aim of improving the  quality of life of over 400 thousand dwellers in those neighborhoods.   49 concept in detail in chapter 4.    167DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   C H  A P  T E  R  3   —  D  E F  E N  S E   A N  D  T  H E   M IL  IT A  R Y   I N  S T  R U  M E  N T   Pacification Force Data  Force Quantity of military   personnel Expenditures (R$ Millions)  2011 2012 Total  Navy 148 5,4 - 5,4  Army 1,800 198 135,4 333,4  The Ágata Operations are another recent example of Federal troops ensuring Law  and Order.

This has significantly affected  international relations, the security of the state and its defense system. This new environment  requires a high capacity for critical analysis, in order to understand the present context,  anticipate future scenarios as well as identify and transform relevant data into state strategy,  based on available means. Such long-term demands require a deep and stable relation  between society and state.   The harmonious interaction between defense organizations and society generates greater  dynamism in defense and security policy. This interaction contributes to the continuous  improvement of the state’s ability to identify and analyze national security and defense  demands.  The implementation of the National Defense Policy requires the capacity to incorporate  and process a wide range of interests and demands in the national and international spheres.  Society must be involved in the moment of choosing priorities and strategies, as well as in  monitoring and evaluating government action. The efficient management of the country’s  defense resources requires balance between the adequate use of available financial resources  and the capabilities desired for the defense establishment. The quality of the implementation  of the National Defense Policy reflects the administrative capacity of the government, as  well as relations between state and society.

Citizen-Soldier Project  The project aims to socially and professionally develop conscripted recruits50 by   complementing their civilian education and facilitating their admission into the job  market. This initiative began in 2004 and covers the entire national territory.  Already 100  thousand young people have benefitted from it. Courses are taught by institutions of good  quality. They include introduction to entrepreneurship, ethics and citizenship. Courses are  offered according to the demands of the local job market, and considering the preferences  of the participants. The following areas, among others are prioritized: telecommunication,  engine repair, food production, civil construction, graphic arts, sewing, textile production,  electrical repair, commerce, public relations, transportation, information technology and  health studies. Approximately 67% of participants enrolled in the Project are awarded  professional employment upon completion of their military service.  Northern Border Program (Calha Norte) Created by the Federal Government in 1985, the Northern Border Program was initially   aimed at promoting the orderly and sustainable occupation and development of the region  that lies north of the Amazon River. However, the program was recently extended to the  Marajó Island (State of Pará) and to the Southern border of the rivers Solimões/Amazonas,  up to the borders of the states of Rondônia and Mato Grosso. The accomplishment of the  objectives of this program rely on several actions, such as the construction of highways,  ports, bridges, schools, nurseries, hospitals, aerodromes, potable water wells and electric  power grids. These actions are greatly beneficial to local communities.  The Northern Border Program is of great importance for increasing the presence of  public services in an area both poor and vulnerable. It contributes to national defense and  integration. The program spans approximately 30% of the national territory, where there  are about 8 million people are located, including 46% of Brazil’s indigenous population.  50 the obligatory military service, established by the first brazilian constitution in 1824, is an integration space for all  brazilian social groups and their armed forces. the national defense strategy seeks to value the military service,  stressing its republican and democratic nature. the military service is open to every citizen, with no class, race or  religion distinction.      livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional  c h  a P  t e  r  4   —  d  e f  e n  s e   a n  d  s  o c  ie t  Y  c h  a P  t e  r  4   —  d  e f  e n  s e   a n  d  s  o c  ie t  Y  171DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  Besides budget resources directly transferred to the Armed Forces, the Northern Border  Program relies on civilian agreements for resource allocation, involving the Ministry of  Defense, and the region’s states and municipalities.  The three Armed Services participate in the Northern Border as follows:   Navy:  • river navigation control and security; and  • assistance to poor communities in the region.   Army:  • implementation of basic infrastructure in the region’s municipalities;  • establishment of military units;  • maintenance of highways;  • maintenance of small power stations; and  • maintenance of Special Border Platoons’ infrastructure.  Air Force:  • establishment of military units;  • support through logistical air transportation;  • maintenance of aerodromes; and  • support for communities, with aeromedical evacuation.  The Northern Border Program is of political and strategic interest. It is a governmental  and multi-sector program involving several public agencies that reaches a wide segment of  the Brazilian population in need.  Armed Forces in Sports Program The Armed Forces in Sports Program is developed by the Ministry of Defense together   with other departments. Its general objective is to promote social integration through the  practice of sports. Tutoring, disease prevention and general educational orientation are  among the activities of the program. Efforts are concentrated on social inclusion, promotion  of public spirit, insertion in the job market as well as physical, sports and leisure activities.  Currently, approximately 12 thousand children and adolescents between the ages of  seven to seventeen are benefitting from this program. The Armed Forces provide: facilities;  medical and odontological services; welfare assistance; coordinators; transportation; and  auditors.

The Rondon Project The Rondon Project is led by the Ministry of Defense. It aims to enable college students   to participate in processes of local and sustainable development in Brazilian municipalities,  which also strengthen public spirit. The Project was created in 1967 as a result of a sociology  paper produced by students from the University of the State Rio de Janeiro (formerly  University of the State of Guanabara) and the Army Command and Staff College.   The project grants selected municipalities the opportunity to receive professors and  college students from different areas of study, who wish to contribute to the community and  to collaborate with local leaders to improvement the wellbeing of locals and the efficiency  of municipal administration.   Participants, so called “rondonistas”, work to generate multipliers whenever possible —  producers, public agents, teachers and local leaders — and perform actions with lasting  effect for the local population, economy, environment and municipal administration.    livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional  c h  a P  t e  r  4   —  d  e f  e n  s e   a n  d  s  o c  ie t  Y  c h  a P  t e  r  4   —  d  e f  e n  s e   a n  d  s  o c  ie t  Y  173DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  College students in the Rondon Project assisting an Amazon community  Due to the project’s vast reach, the Armed Forces’ logistical support is indispensable.

The Services act and participate directly with various segments of society. Examples  include: the application of Army engineering to construct roads, railways, bridges and water  reservoir; aeromedical evacuation by the Air Force in remote regions; and medical support  provided by the Navy’s hospital ships. The military also provides humanitarian support  in the occurrence of major accidents and calamities, such as: aircraft crashes, shipwrecks,  floods, earthquakes and long lasting droughts.   The military units of the Armed Forces are present in every region of the country and  they actively interact with their local communities.  Military personnel participate in a  community’s life by engaging in public events and by providing civic and social services,  including public health campaigns and support during calamities. They also render services  related to: inspection of restricted products; protection of human life; navigational security;  airspace control; and search and rescue activities.   The employment of the Armed Forces contributes to speed up the Federal Government’s  response to contingencies. Further examples of subsidiary and complementary activities  are listed below by Armed Service:  Navy: •  supervises compliance with waterway traffic safety legislation;  • controls professional maritime and port training, thereby contributing to the Merchant  Navy professionals’ training across the country;  • cares for human life at sea and in inland waters, through the Waterway Traffic Security  System (ports authorities, maritime police stations and agencies), for navigation safety  and for the control of water pollution by ships, drills and support facilities;  • attends to poor communities in the Amazon and the Pantanal region (State of Mato- Grosso), through Hospital Ships (NAsH).

The Ministry of Defense interacts with the National Congress particularly through  the Legislative Branch’s two permanent commissions that deal specifically with the issue  of National Defense: the House of Representatives’ Commission on Foreign Affairs  and National Defense (CREDN) and the Senate Commission on Foreign Affairs and  National Defense (CRE)51.    The Congress has the following constitutional duties in matters concerning or related to  National Defense:   • testablish and alter the number of personnel in the Armed Forces (Art. 48);  • ratify international treaties, agreements or acts that result in heavy onus or commitments  to the national treasury (Art. 49);  • authorize the President of the Republic to declare war, celebrate peace, allow foreign  forces to transit national territory  or to remain temporarily, except cases regulated by  complementary law (Art. 49);  • authorize states of emergency and federal intervention, or interrupt any of those  measures (Art. 49);   • approve initiatives of the Executive Branch concerning nuclear activities (art. 49); and   • approve multiannual plans, budget guidelines laws, annual budget laws, as detailed in  chapter six.  Besides these responsibilities, the presidents of the House of Representatives and the  Senate are members to the National Defense Council (Art. 91), a consultative body to the  President of the Republic for issues concerning national sovereignty and the defense of  democracy.   The continuous empowerment of the National Congress in defense issues contributes  to the increase of interest and engagement of society in this area. It is Congress’ duty, for  instance, to review this National Defense White Paper.   51 since the establishment of the Ministry of defense in 1999, the incumbent and past Ministers of defense have  participated in 53 public hearings and in three seminars organized by the permanent commissions of the national  congress.     livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional  c h  a P  t e  r  4   —  d  e f  e n  s e   a n  d  s  o c  ie t  Y  c h  a P  t e  r  4   —  d  e f  e n  s e   a n  d  s  o c  ie t  Y  181DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  Ministry of Defense and the Judicial Branch  The objective of the federal military courts is to judge military crimes. This body is   comprised of 40 judges, distributed among 12 judicial districts spread across the national  territory, as well as the Military High Court (STM), located in Brasília.  The Federal Constitution establishes that the Armed Forces are organized based upon  hierarchy and discipline, and have as their mission the defense of the Homeland, the  protection of the three branches of state, and by initiative of any of these branches, the  promotion of law and order. The national legal framework provides a body of norms to  ensure that military institutions achieve their essential purposes.  The Constitution is at the root of military criminal law. Chapter III of the Constitution  refers to the Judiciary, listing the institutions that integrate that branch of the state, including  the military courts and high courts (Art. 92, VI). The Constitution assigns to federal law the  role of defining military crimes and to the military courts the competence of processing and  judging compliance with these laws. (Art. 124). The Military Criminal Law is inscribed in  the Military Criminal Code. The various roles of the Military High Court are provided in  Art. 6th of Law No 8,457 of 1992 that regulates the  military courts, in accordance with the  Federal Constitution.  The military justice system is composed, in the first instance, by auditors and, in the  second instance, by the Military High Court, which deals with military crimes committed  by civilians and military personnel, but not with administrative infractions or indiscipline.  The Military High Court is composed by 15 permanent magistrates, nominated by the  President of the Republic and subsequently approved by the Federal Senate. Of these fifteen  magistrates, three are Flag Officers of the Navy, four are General Officers of the Army,  and three are General Officers of the Air Force. All of these officers are in active service,  within a special group, and exercise the highest rank of their respective military careers. The  remaining five magistrates are civilians.  The Ministry of Defense maintains tight cooperation with electoral courts. The Armed  Forces act during electoral periods, upon authorization from the Electoral High Court  (TSE), due to requests by regional courts for the use of federal force in support of elections.  Thus, exceptionally, during the electoral period around 15 thousand military personnel  from the Armed Forces are convened to participate in operations in over 300 Brazilian  municipalities, to reinforce security and to ensure the transportation of cargo, voting  machines in particular, and professionals from the electoral courts to remote regions of the  country.    livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional  c h  a P  t e  r  4   —  d  e f  e n  s e   a n  d  s  o c  ie t  Y  c h  a P  t e  r  4   —  d  e f  e n  s e   a n  d  s  o c  ie t  Y  DEFENSE WHITE PAPER182  Defense and the Human Rights   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted and proclaimed by resolution   217 A (III) of the United Nations General Assembly in December 1948. This document  was conceived to be a common ideal to be sought by all nations. Signatories must promote  the respect for the rights and freedoms expressed in the Declaration. The document also  adopts progressive measures, of national and international nature, to ensure its universal  and effective recognition and observance52.   The 5th Article of the Brazilian Constitution adopts the principles listed in the Universal  Declaration of Human Rights, with stress on the equality to all before the law, without  distinction of any kind. It guarantees to all Brazilians and foreigners residing in the country  the inviolability of the rights to life, liberty, equality and property53.  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Federal Constitution guarantee  that human rights are respected when the Ministry of Defense, its military commands, and  subordinated agencies undertake their various activities.    To guide the employment of the Armed Forces, the Ministry of Defense issues guidelines  which set the rules of engagement — these are operational procedures or general rules of  action, which guide the individual and collective conduct of the troops employed, including  in non-conventional operations. The rules of engagement are prepared in accordance with  each mission that the Armed Forces are called to. Legal procedures in force in the country  are faithfully observed, which limit the military’s freedom of action during self-defense and  legitimate defense.  The Armed Forces constitutional employment in international armed conflicts is also  based on the International Law of Armed Conflicts (DICA)54.   The International Law of Armed Conflict is a group of international norms applied to  armed conflicts, which for humanitarian reasons, limits the right of the parties in conflict  to freely choose methods and means to be employed in the conduct of hostilities. It also  protects people and property affected by these conflicts55. The International Law of Armed  Conflicts derives from the Geneva Conventions, a group of laws which regulates the  protection of victims of armed conflicts, including combatants and non-combatants56.  52 the Universal declaration of human rights, 1948. 53 the 30 articles of the Universal declaration of human rights are expressed in the 78 items of 5th article. 54 other legal documents sustaining the armed forces: law of Geneva, law of hague, law of new York and the Military  statute. 55 idac’s basic principles are: distinction, limitation, Proportionality, Military needs and humanity. these principles’  objective is to limit and assess, as much as possible, the war calamities, through the military needs conciliation with  the requirements set by principles of humanitarian nature.  armed conflicts employment Manual (idac) in the armed  forces, 1st edition, eMcfa, Ministry of defense, 2011. 56 the first convention of Geneva took place in 1864 and introduced what became called the humanitarian right. other four     livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional  c h  a P  t e  r  4   —  d  e f  e n  s e   a n  d  s  o c  ie t  Y  c h  a P  t e  r  4   —  d  e f  e n  s e   a n  d  s  o c  ie t  Y  183DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  Support for human rights in Haiti (MINUSTAH)  The International Law of Armed Conflict refers to relations between states and applies only to  situations of armed conflict. Human rights, on the other hand, are characterized by the principles  of universality and indivisibility, and therefore apply in any situation. In this context, the state  must respect civil and political rights, and promote social, economic and cultural rights as well.  Both the International Law of Armed Conflict and the laws on human rights are based on the  respect for the physical and moral integrity to the human being.   Among other factors, the growing participation of the Armed Forces in Peacekeeping  Operations57 aand in Operations of Law and Order have demonstrated the need to improve  the study of human rights and the International Law on Armed Conflicts in the various  educational institutions of the Navy, Army and Air Force.  Considering the importance of deepening studies on the subject and in accordance with  the 3rd National Plan for Human Rights58, the Ministry of Defense established guidelines   conventions were held in 1949, with the purpose to safeguard and protect the armed conflicts’ victims.   57 it is important to mark that the brazilian Joint center of Peacekeeping operations has already a series of stages on  the human rights theme.

This program is to be held from 2012 on and it is mandatory for all  military personnel appointed to Peacekeeping Missions, and Law and Order Operations.  This program should also cover, as much as possible, to remaining Armed Forces officers  and enlisted personnel in the various Military Organizations.  The Human Rights Program is scheduled to be taught in undergraduate military schools  from 2013 on. It will also be adapted into the curriculums of the Armed Services’ graduate  schools. The Program therefore will contribute, along with other initiatives, towards  increasing awareness and protection of human rights. It will also bring the Armed Forces  closer to the Brazilian society as well as international treaties and conventions.  Defense and the Access to Information Act  On November 18, 2011, Law No 12,527 was sanctioned — the Access to Information Act   — which regulates the constitutional right of citizens to obtain access to public information  from federal, state and municipal offices of the Executive Branch, Congress (including the  Court of Audit), the Judiciary and the Prosecutor General’s Office, including offices in  central administration, decentralized agencies and state owned enterprises.  The aforementioned Act treats access to information as a general rule, and confidentiality  as an exception. It also alters the confidentiality periods and classification of documents59.  The Ministry of Defense has adjusted the classification of all its documents according to  the provisions of the new Act and has adopted measures in order to facilitate the access  and consultation of data and documents under its responsibility, thus contributing to the  consolidation of democracy and the strengthening of transparency policy.   The Citizen’s Information Service (SIC) of the Ministry of Defense, inaugurated in May  2012, is part of this transparency effort.  The Information Service, located in the ground  floor of the Ministry building, is the sector responsible for providing guidance to people who  are interested in procedures for consulting and accessing the Ministry’s public information.  In addition to the Citizen’s Information Service, the National Defense White Paper and  the website of the Ministry of Defense all promote and publicize Defense information which  is of general and collective interest.  59 the Minister of defense has directed that the reclassification of confidential documents, within the scope of the Ministry  of defense, should not result in the increase of confidentiality periods.    livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional  c h  a P  t e  r  4   —  d  e f  e n  s e   a n  d  s  o c  ie t  Y  c h  a P  t e  r  4   —  d  e f  e n  s e   a n  d  s  o c  ie t  Y  185DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  brazilian defense studies association (abed)  The ABED was created in 2005 as a result of the joint efforts of a group of researchers  from different regions and academic backgrounds. These researchers, all members of  important institutions, shared a common concern for consolidating the related fields  of: National Defense; National and International Security; Strategy; War and Peace;  Civil-Military Relations; and Science and Technology. The objective of the Association  is to promote the exchange of ideas, the debate of problems and the development of  initiatives that are of common interest within the area of Defense Studies. The resulting  intellectual production of this Association constitutes important technical material for  supporting policy makers and the general public. The Association produces significant  synergetic effects between academic sectors that study National Defense, thereby  creating conditions for a renewal of national strategic thought.  Defense and Academia   In a democratic society, academia plays an important role jointly with state institutions   by producing knowledge and analysis that challenge established concepts.  The production of academic papers on National Defense has recently increased to a  significant extent and has gained further importance with the creation of the Brazilian  Association for Defense Studies (ABED).  Although some scholars have, individually, produced studies and research on themes  related to the National Defense, there were no courses, programs and infrastructure that  would allow for a more robust academic production.  The incentive to open academic space for critical reflection on defense issues and,  consequently, the creation of institutional conditions necessary for related university  activities has derived, in fair amount, from the flourishing of study and research on  international relations. The awareness that the country is not immune to risks and threats,  inherent to the relations between states, was reinforced and the integration of individual  researchers was favored.  In this context, new disciplines on Defense were created in  International Relations and Political Sciences programs.  The Ministry of Defense has sought to empower this phenomenon. The National  Defense Strategy has as one of its strategic actions the necessity to develop civilian experts  on defense and to support programs and courses on National Defense. The objective is  to promote further integration and participation of civilian sectors of the government in  debates related to defense issues, as well as to foster effective participation of the Brazilian  society, through the academic environment and institutes and entities linked to strategic     livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional  c h  a P  t e  r  4   —  d  e f  e n  s e   a n  d  s  o c  ie t  Y  c h  a P  t e  r  4   —  d  e f  e n  s e   a n  d  s  o c  ie t  Y  DEFENSE WHITE PAPER186  defense issues. The Pandiá Calogeras Institute, a civilian institution, will have as its main  mission the strengthening of relations with academia.  Some initiatives of the Ministry of Defense to improve research in the field of Defense  are described below.  Pro-Defense Program With the aim of contributing to the development of academic activities, the Coordination   for the Development of Graduates (CAPES) and the Ministry of Defense jointly launched,  in 2005, the Program for the Support of Teaching and Scientific & Technological Research  on National Defense (Pro Defense Program). The objectives of Pro-Defense are as follows:  •  timplement in Brazil academic cooperation networks in the area of National Defense;  •  develop human resources at the master and doctorate levels;  •  promote the exchange of knowledge within the Brazilian academic community;  •  stimulate partnerships among colleges, strategic studies centers and military  institutions of education and research; and   •  promote dialogue on National Defense among civilian and military specialists.

Strategy and Policy Studies Centers   Besides the civilian academic centers that deal with issues of policy and strategy, the   Ministry of Defense also maintains several study centers:   •  The War College’s Strategic Studies Center;  • The Naval Academy Policy and Strategic Studies Center;    livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional  c h  a P  t e  r  4   —  d  e f  e n  s e   a n  d  s  o c  ie t  Y  c h  a P  t e  r  4   —  d  e f  e n  s e   a n  d  s  o c  ie t  Y  187DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  Oceanographic Support Ship Ary Rongel and Polar Ship Admiral Maximiniano operating in OPERANTAR  • The Marine Corps Studies Center;  • The Army Strategic Studies Center;  • The Army Command and General Staff College’s Strategic Studies Center; and  • The Air Force University’s Strategic Studies Center.  These centers contribute to the synergy between the Ministry of Defense, academia and  other sectors of society through courses, symposiums, conferences, seminars, congresses  and other activities related to the theme of National Defense.   Brazilian Antarctic Program (PROANTAR) The scientific activities of the PROANTAR, already noted in chapter 2, are proposed   and developed by scholars from universities and research institutions of different regions  of Brazil. Researchers conduct investigations, through an interdisciplinary and inter- institutional manner, on various fields including: Earth Sciences, Atmospheric Sciences,  Life Sciences and Technology. Projects include research on: environmental change in the  Antarctic continent and its global impacts; environmental monitoring; and complementary  studies on local fauna and botany, among others matters.    livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional  c h  a P  t e  r  4   —  d  e f  e n  s e   a n  d  s  o c  ie t  Y  c h  a P  t e  r  4   —  d  e f  e n  s e   a n  d  s  o c  ie t  Y  DEFENSE WHITE PAPER188  The research engages a great number of Brazilian scientists, from different areas of  expertise and educational and research institutions, who develop their activities in the  Antarctic continent, using as support base the facilities of the Antarctic Station Comandante  Ferraz60 and the Navy’s ships (Oceanographic Support Ship Ary Rangel and Polar Ship  Admiral Maximiano).  Academic Congress   The Academic Congress is an initiative dedicated to the academic interaction between   students of officer cadet schools of the three Forces and university students from across  the country. Annually, the Ministry of Defense publishes, in nation-wide notices, the  prerequisites for higher education institutions to participate. The Congress is held in  military schools and has an average duration of one week. It includes debates on issues of  national interest as well as cultural and social activities.  Other Initiatives Besides the above-mentioned activities, the Ministry of Defense seeks, through various   means, to raise its degree of interactivity with society and to encourage research in the area  of National Defense. The most recent example of such an initiative was the preparation  process of this National Defense White Paper. Five national seminars were held, in different  cities of the country, and one of international scope, in Rio de Janeiro. A competition was  also held to select exceptional papers on National Defense by young university students  from across the country.  Civilian Staff in the Ministry of Defense  The manpower of the Ministry of Defense’s Central Administration is composed of 483   civilian and 680 military positions, 1,163 in total. The Ministry does not possess its own  particular civilian staff. Its civilian positions are filled by 104 civilians from the extinct Armed  Forces General Staff, 46 military reserve personnel hired for an indeterminate time period,  157 civil servants from other public agencies and 176 civil servants who are freely appointed  to Senior Managerial and Advisory Offices (DAS), according to legislation in force.   With the aim of providing the Ministry with its own particular staff, due to the importance  and peculiarity of its activities, the National Defense Strategy determined a study to create   60 on february 25, 2012, the antarctic station comandante ferraz was partially destroyed by fire. the Provisional act  no 560 of March 7, 2012, announced by the President of the republic, dilma rousseff, determined the recovery and  reconstruction of the base with the aim of continuing the activities of Proantar.    livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional  c h  a P  t e  r  4   —  d  e f  e n  s e   a n  d  s  o c  ie t  Y  c h  a P  t e  r  4   —  d  e f  e n  s e   a n  d  s  o c  ie t  Y  189DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  a career of Defense Analyst, with professional requirements that are compatible with the  activities of the Ministry. The bill for creating this career is currently being processed  by the Ministry of Planning. These professionals, after being selected through open and  competitive processes and having completed a specialization program on defense, will, in  great part, take up positions in the Ministry of Defense. Some of them may be distributed to  other ministries to develop projects and programs concerning National Defense.  It is worth noting that the majority of civil servants in the Ministry of Defense work in  offices which are civilian in nature, these include: the Office of the Minister of Defense, the  Office of Management, the Office of Defense Materiel, the Office of Education, Health and  Sports; the Center for the Management and Operation of the Amazon Protection System,  the Office of Legal Affairs, and the Office of Internal Audit. A small quantity of civil servants  also works in the Joint Staff.  Defense and Industrial Development   The National Defense Strategy (END) regards the development of the national defense   industry and technological autonomy as essential guidelines for the adequate supply of  the Armed Forces and for the development of the nation itself.   The attendance of the equipment needs of the Armed Forces will prioritize the  assimilation of advanced technologies by Brazilian nationals. The restructuring of the  Brazilian defense industry is a direct consequence to this decision. Guideline No 22 of the  National Defense Strategy determined the need to develop the nation’s defense industry  in order to achieve autonomy in technologies that are vital for national defense.   Within this context, the Ministry of Defense, through the Office of Defense Materiel  has promoted means and participated in activities that favor the development of the  Brazilian defense industry. Major initiatives are noted below:    1. Establishment of a Trade Promotion Center (NPC-MD)  Guideline No 1,116, approved by the Minister of Defense in April 2012, instituted the  Trade Promotion Center. This Center has the purpose of undertaking measures aimed  at the promotion and development of trade of Brazilian defense products, and at the  attraction of investments and technologies, which may be adopted in the development of  defense or dual use products.   2. Assessment of the Defense Industrial Base and promotion of exports  The Ministry of Defense and the Brazilian Agency for Industrial Development  (ABDI) ae carrying out a complete assessment of the Defense Industrial Base in Brazil,  with the objective of diagnosing the capabilities and potential of this important sector     livro branco de defesa nacional PbPb livro branco de defesa nacional  c h  a P  t e  r  4   —  d  e f  e n  s e   a n  d  s  o c  ie t  Y  c h  a P  t e  r  4   —  d  e f  e n  s e   a n  d  s  o c  ie t  Y  DEFENSE WHITE PAPER190  of the national economy. This task is of fundamental importance for the establishment  of incentive policies for the national industry. The Defense Industrial Base is currently  comprised of approximately 500 companies.   Currently, a large segment of Brazilian exports are based on low technology products  and are, consequently, of low aggregate value. Considering world military expenditure is  around US$1.5 trillion and that Brazilian exports are around US$1 billion American dollars  — equal to 0.067% of world total — the growth potential opened to the nation’s Defense  Industrial Base is considerable.  The Industrial Defense Base can change this situation, and may contribute to the increase  of technological content in Brazilian exports. The Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of  Development, Industry and Foreign Trade (MDIC) and the Brazilian Agency for Exports  and Investments (APEX) are seeking market segments where the Brazilian defense industry  may be competitive as well as supporting Brazilian companies in world fairs and other  international events.    3. Regulatory frameworks for strengthening the defense industry   Guideline No 22 of the National Defense Strategy sets the necessity for establishing  special legal, regulatory and tax frameworks to protect private national companies that  manufacture defense products against commercial risks and to ensure the continuity of  government purchases.   To fulfill this guideline, the Ministry of Defense is preparing regulatory frameworks  according to the public interest and the demands for incentives from the National Defense  Base. These include: the National Policy for the Defense Industry (PNID), which will guide  procedures of the Office of Defense Materiel; Law No 12,598 of March 22, 2012; and the  National Policy for the Exportation of Defense Products (PNEPRODE), which innovates by  creating a Program for Supporting Exports.  4. Development of science and technology  The Ministry of Defense is acting together with the Ministry of Science, Technology  and Innovation (MCTI) to maximize and optimize research efforts in military institutions,  dedicated to science and technology, with the aim of developing state-of-the-art technologies  for the nation’s defense system.  Some defense projects are being funded by the Studies and Projects Funding Agency  (FINEP) of MCTI, such as the SABER M60 radar, the development of permanent magnetic  engines for naval propulsion and the project for the development of precursor fiber for the  fabrication of carbon fiber.   5.

Such policies are focused on: infrastructure activities in support of production and trade;  legislation which would improve competitiveness by industrial sector companies; and more  consistent and lasting funding of entrepreneurial activities. The Board is therefore one more tool  available for the promotion of the Defense Industrial Base.  ABIMDE and Industries Federations The Ministry of Defense has established fruitful relationships with national defense   industries, through representative organizations, such as the Brazilian Association of  Defense and Security Industries (ABIMDE) and the Industries Federation.   The Committee on the Defense Industry’s Production Chain (COMDEFESA) of the  Industries Federation of the State of São Paulo (FIESP) holds plenary sessions for the  appreciation of matters, policies and legislation related to defense. The Committee’s agenda  of meetings is shared with the Office of Defense Materiel, which seeks mechanisms that  may contribute to solving presented demands.   Much of the Ministry of Defense’s interaction with the corporate sector is conducted  through the ABIMDE. The Association is a non-profit, with the purpose of congregating,  representing and protecting the interests of associated companies. Consequently, it  contributes to the formulation of public policies within the Defense sector. Currently, the  ABIMDE represents approximately two hundred companies.   Contact with the aforementioned organizations allows the Ministry of Defense to interact  widely with national industry. In this manner, the Ministry can obtain a better understanding  of the industry’s potential and gather necessary knowledge for the appropriate direction of  government industrial policies, as well as interact with foreign corporations interested in  investing or celebrating partnerships in Brazil.

By providing a better understanding of the limitations of current theories, the idea of  transformation alters thought patterns, generates new concepts and capabilities. It enables  one to respond innovatively to unexpected challenges. By aiding in the development of  skills, it enables the fulfilment of new tasks and the execution of modern combat activities.  The effectiveness of a transformation process is proportional to the capacity of acquiring  and applying state-of-the-art technology in the phases of research and development of new  weapons systems and platforms. As may be observed in various examples available, this is a  long-term process, and may extend for 20 years or more.  These changes require the development of new doctrines for the employment of troops,  in order to make the military forces more apt to act in a multifaceted operating environment.  In the case of Brazil, defense transformation, besides enabling greater capacity of its  Armed Forces, will create a range of opportunities for economic growth. This will occur  through three means:  • Defense Deployment and Equipment Plan (PAED);  • management modernization; and  • reorganization of the Defense Industrial Base.

Hence, these projects should integrate the programmatic budgetary  structures established in the successive Multiannual Plans of the Union (PPA), within a  time frame of 20 years (2012 to 2031).  Some priority projects of the Armed Forces, directed by the Ministry of Defense, within  PAED, are described below:  Brazilian Navy  The Navy, in order to increase Naval Power, in accordance with the guidelines of the   National Defense Strategy, chose its priority strategic projects in a manner that would  enable  greater autonomy in terms of acquisition of means, in relation to the outside world.  Thus, these projects have as one of their main objectives the strengthening of the Brazilian  Defense Industrial Base, and thereby enabling it to design, develop and construct means  and naval systems of high and medium complexity.

It also includes  the replenishment of conventional ammunition and maintenance of operational capacity.  2. Naval Nuclear Program (PNM)  The Naval Nuclear Program includes the development of the nuclear fuel cycle, the  construction and approval of a Nuclear-Electric Energy Generation Laboratory (LABGENE);  the construction of a prototype pressurized water reactor62, which is the basis for the reactor  of the first Brazilian Submarine with Nuclear Propulsion (SNBR); and the strengthening of  the Navy’s Technological Center in São Paulo (CTMSP).   The PNM and the Submarine Development Program (PROSUB) are closely linked. The  success of the PROSUB depends on the development of the nuclear propulsion system  through the Naval Nuclear Program.  62 Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR).

Development of the Navy’s Core Capabilities  The project is absolutely necessary, not only to modernize the Navy, but, also, to enable the  gradual substitution of the naval, naval aviation and amphibious combat means, which have a  deactivation deadline due to natural deterioration and to the endurance limit of these means. The  lifecycle limits of materiel are already established, which makes compliance with the program  all the more essential.  The program therefore aims to expand the operational capacity of the  Brazilian Navy. The following actions, within its scope, are noteworthy:  • The development of submarines (PROSUB), which includes the construction of four  new conventional submarines and one nuclear propelled submarine, in addition to a  shipyard and submarine base to support these units, as described in chapter 3;  • The acquisition of surface means (PROSUPER), which aims to develop the ability to  design and build, in Brazil, five escort vessels, five ocean patrol vessels of 1.8 thousand  tons and one logistical support vessel. Proposals submitted by interested shipyards are  currently under analysis;  • The design and construction, in Brazil, of 27 patrol vessels of 500 tons, two of which  have already been received and fiver others are under construction in the country,  with expected delivery by 2014;  • The acquisition of amphibious means — one combat vehicle landing ship (NDCC) or one  dock landing ship (NDD). The Amphibious Ship Procurement Program (PROANF) has  initiated research aimed at obtaining, abroad, a design of an amphibious ship, approved  and operated by other navies, for future construction in a national shipyard;  • The acquisition of aircraft carriers (PRONAE), which involves designing and building  one unit for the First Fleet and another for the Second Fleet.

The capacity to preserve the integrity  of strategic structures that may be the target of cyber-attacks of different modalities is very  importance to the country. Some short term actions envisioned for the cyber defense are  listed below:  • construction of the permanent headquarters of the Cyber Defense Center and the  acquisition of the supporting infrastructure;  • acquisition of equipment and training of human resources;  • acquisition of cyber defense hardware and software solutions; and  •  implementation of infrastructure projects of the Cyber Sector to increase the ability to  respond to threats.  3. Guarani Project The Guarani Project consists of the implementation of the New Family of Armored   Wheeled Vehicles (NFBR) of the Brazilian Army. The Project intends to provide mechanized  units with new armored vehicles, which incorporate the most recent trends and technological  developments. In the context of the National Defense Strategy, the project contributes to the  acquisition of new capabilities, strengthening the Brazilian industry with the acquisition of  dual-use technology.  The Project calls for the acquisition of 2,044 Brazilian designed Guarani personnel  carrier armored vehicles, over a period of 20 years. The new armored vehicles already  passed evaluation tests and the Brazilian Army received its first unit in June of 2012.  The Guarani Project also includes several subprojects, among which the following  stand out: Research and Development, Integrated Logistic Support (SLI), Nationalization  of Ammunition, Professional Development, Infrastructure, Command and Control,  Simulation, Doctrine and Management.  The NFBR includes a medium subfamily — reconnaissance, personnel transportation,  mortar, rescue, command post, radio unit, fire coordination unit, workshop and ambulance  — and one light subfamily — reconnaissance, anti-tank, mortar light, radar, command post  and advanced observation.    201DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  5   —  D  E F  E N  S E   T R  A N  S F  O R  M A  T IO  N  C H  A P  T E  R  5   —  D  E F  E N  S E   T R  A N  S F  O R  M A  T IO  N  Guarani Armored Vehicle   4. Integrated Border Monitoring System (SISFRON)  The SISFRON is a monitoring system that is integrated with other similar systems and which  will raise the capacity of command and control of the Land Force, allowing for the reduction  of response time against possible threats in areas of interest, with special attention to the  Amazon Region. Currently, the project is in the bidding stage for the implementation of a first  module based on the 4th Mechanized Cavalry Brigade in Dourados (State of Minas Gerais).  5. Integrated Strategic Land Structures Protection System   (PROTEGER)  The PROTEGER is a complex System, composed of Land Force units, aimed at protecting  Strategic Land Structures (EETer). These structures are defined as facilities, services,  goods and systems, which — if disrupted or destroyed in total or in part — could generate  significant damage to the security of the state and society in general.  The relevance of the system is evident considering that 90% of strategic structures are on  land and account for 56% of the energy grid and 96% of the country gross domestic product.  The system will cooperate with other agencies through prevention, warning and  protection activities intended to minimize risks resulting from natural or human causes,  such as sabotage, terrorism and organized crime.

Among the actions planned,  the following stand out:  • adaptation of air bases and expansion of alternative runways; • merger and redistribution of logistics and administrative organizations; and • transference of air units to the North and Midwest regions.    205DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  5   —  D  E F  E N  S E   T R  A N  S F  O R  M A  T IO  N  C H  A P  T E  R  5   —  D  E F  E N  S E   T R  A N  S F  O R  M A  T IO  N  2. Recovery of Operational Capacity In a modern Air Force, the management of projects demands a constant process of   performance evaluation and selection of alternatives to replace, modernize, develop or  revitalize aircraft and their systems, in order to strengthen and maintain the operational  capacity of the Force. This process is conventionally termed Recovery of Operational  Capacity, and it observes international efficiency standards adopted by modern Air Forces.  This project involves training and instruction of pilots, replenishment of weapons stocks  and technological upgrading of aircraft, including:  • the fighters AMX and F-5 — projects A-1M and F5-M;  • maritime patrol P-95 — Project P-3-BR;  • transportation and refueling — projects KC-130 and C-95M;  • reconnaissance — Project R-99; and  • airborne early warning  and control — Project E-99.  3. Airspace Control The Brazilian Airspace Control System (SISCEAB) is based on a civil/military ambivalence   and is the outcome of the integration of resources. It provides the necessary infrastructure  to monitor and management Brazilian airspace, in order to ensure the continuity of general  air traffic management, military operational traffic and aerospace defense, throughout the  Brazilian territory.  The increase of air traffic in general, and particularly in the terminal regions require  the implementation of new technologies to support the safe and efficient operation of the  country’s air transport. Some actions involve the modernization of the Aerospace Defense  Operations Center (CODA) and the adaptation of aircraft to the new satellite control and  navigation system CNS/ATM68.  68 CNS/ATM — A program of international scope program for modernizing air traffic control. The acronym CNS stands  for Communications, Navigation and Surveillance. ATM stands for Air Traffic Management.

Development and Construction of Aerospace Equipment The space activities, within the Space Activities National Program (PNAE), seek the   use of the outer space as a means of support for defense initiatives. Besides developing  satellite launching vehicles, the Air Force, jointly with other areas of the Ministry of  Defense, including the other two Armed Services, will set necessary requirements for the  development of geostationary satellites for safe telecommunications and meteorology, in  order to ensure effective command and control with national means.  The project aims to develop launching vehicles (as noted in chapters 2 and 3), promote  launching campaigns and optimize the necessary infrastructure for rendering these services.  8.Support for Air Force Military and Civilian Personnel  Within the realm of the military profession, the maintenance of morale and determination,  specifically for combat conditions, does not grow spontaneously. Therefore, actions that  promote well-being and maintain morale are important, especially those pertaining to  supplies for subsistence that support routine in the barracks, in times of peace or during  crisis and conflict. Therefore, this project aims to provide better conditions for the human  capital in the Air Force, in order to fully fulfill the Air Force’s mission. The following actions  are worthy of note:  • increase the availability of the military housing;  • modernize the nutritional management of the Air Force; and  • optimize the health and social assistance programs of the Air Force.  9. Modernization of Training Systems  The increase of the number of military personnel in the Air Force will demand an  increase of personnel to be trained in military schools. Therefore, it is important that these  institutions are adequately prepared to provide teaching and support activities in a manner  that is efficient and of a high standard.  Among the activities encompassed in this project, the following stand out: the enlargement  of educational infrastructure in general and the creation of facilities for training pilots in the  physically hostile environment of a combat aircraft cabin.       209DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  5   —  D  E F  E N  S E   T R  A N  S F  O R  M A  T IO  N  C H  A P  T E  R  5   —  D  E F  E N  S E   T R  A N  S F  O R  M A  T IO  N  Forecast of Project Completion and Estimated Global Value  In order to meet the priority strategic programs set by the Air Force in its Deployment  and Equipment Plan there will be a need for increasing the quantity of military and civilian  personnel in the next 20 years.

In the social field  • expansion of state services in poor communities; • Greater capacity to contribute to the security of urban centers; • Increased capacity to provide security to major events; and • Contribution to quality of life and increased security in smaller and remote cities.  Modernization of  Management  In order to improve the national defense system, formalize a policy for sustainable   defense and integrate the three Forces, the Ministry of Defense is implementing a strategic  management process, termed Strategic Planning System (SISPED), which will indicate the  direction to be followed by all components of the Ministry. This System will also analyze the  area of National Defense from various angles and define its direction by means of vectors  and goals which may be monitored.  The Strategic Planning System will indicate out long-term goals and strategies of  transformation. It will therefore be a guide to help visualize the goals that need to be achieved.  The ultimate purpose of the System is the creation of future conditions for obtaining  and constantly improving the operational capabilities of the Forces, in order to ensure  permanent readiness.  Defense Industrial Base  (BID) The Defense’s Industrial Base (BID) is a set of industries and companies organized   under Brazilian law that participate in one or more of the phases of research, development,  production, distribution and maintenance of defense products. A competitive and  consolidated defense industry generates high-level jobs and encourages technological  development with productive links to other sectors of industry.  The productive sector of defense possesses the following specific characteristics: the need  for large-scale production and high expenditures on research and development; a long time  frame for project maturation; a short life cycle of materials; and the existence of a market  heavily influenced by government procurement and exports; and the presence of highly  competitive institutions.  The Defense Industrial Base, alone, does not possess the conditions or capacity to meet  the supply demands of military products and services. The national capacity will only be  fulfilled if the entire infrastructure of science, technology and innovation is well adequately  activated and integrated.    213DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  5   —  D  E F  E N  S E   T R  A N  S F  O R  M A  T IO  N  C H  A P  T E  R  5   —  D  E F  E N  S E   T R  A N  S F  O R  M A  T IO  N  President Dilma Rousseff during the promulgation of Law No 12,598 of March 22, 2012  The country’s science, technology and innovation infrastructure, which is dedicated  to the production and supply of military technology, is much broader than the defense  industry. Its components must act in a concatenated and integrated manner in activities of  teaching, basic research, applied research, development, evaluation, design, manufacturing,  services and logistics.  The Defense Industrial Base has represented, for three decades, an important economic  sector of the country, with relevant contributions to the balance of trade and the opening of  new markets for innovative and high quality products. Until the promulgation of Provisional  Measure No 544 of 2011, which originated Law No 12,598 of March 22, 2012, government  policies for the sector were not compatible with the growth of the Brazilian economy, nor  with the equipment needs of the Armed Forces.  The commerce of defense products is restricted and highly regulated. Several countries  develop industrial and technological policies aimed at their respective defense industries  and government procurement is guided not only by technical and economic matters, but  also by geopolitical interests. This aspect engenders the curtailment and restriction of  transferences of various products and technologies from countries that possess these goods  to those that lack them.  The Brazilian Defense Industrial Base is responsible for 0.1% of all world exports of  conventional weapons, as shown in the table below, which presents Brazil in the 27th  position among countries that most export weapons.

The law contemplates: the government’s central administration; institutions that manage  special funds; agencies; public foundations; state, private and mixed companies; state  producers of defense products; and other agencies controlled directly or indirectly by the  Union, the states, the Federal District and the municipalities of Brazil.  The following definitions are adopted by this law:  I - Defense Product (PRODE) - every good, service, product or information, including  weapons, ammunition, means of transportation and communications, uniforms and  materials for individual or collective use in defense activities, with the exception of those  that are assigned to administrative use;  II - Defense Strategic Product (PED) - all defense products that are of strategic importance  for national defense, due to their technological content, scarcity or indispensability;  III - Defense System (SD) - interrelated or interactive set of defense products that serves  a specific purpose;  IV - Strategic Defense Company (EED) - any legal entity accredited by the Ministry of  Defense. These companies will have access to special tax schemes and funding for  programs, projects and activities related to national defense goods, referred to in item I  of Art. 8, and defense strategic products, in accordance with law;  V - Innovation - introduction of novelty or improvement in the productive environment,  which result in new defense products;  VI - Compensation - all and any practices agreed by the parties, as a condition for the  purchase of goods, services or technology, with the intention of generating technological,  industrial or commercial benefits, as established by the Ministry of Defense;  VII - Compensation agreement - legal instrument which formalizes the commitment and  the obligations of the supplier to compensate purchases;  VIII - Scientific and Technological Institution (ICT) - agency of the public administration,  which has the institutional mission, among others, of performing activities of basic or  applied research in the scientific or technological fields;   IX - Brazilian partners or shareholders - Brazilian individuals, either native or naturalized,  residing in Brazil or abroad, private institutions or investment funds or clubs, organized in  accordance with Brazilian law; and   X - Foreign partners or shareholders - individuals or private institutions, investment funds  or clubs and any other institution not contemplated in item IX.    215DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  5   —  D  E F  E N  S E   T R  A N  S F  O R  M A  T IO  N  C H  A P  T E  R  5   —  D  E F  E N  S E   T R  A N  S F  O R  M A  T IO  N  The Brazilian Defense Industrial Base is responsible for 0.1% of all world exports of  conventional weapons, as shown in the table below, which presents Brazil in the 27th  position among countries that most export weapons.

Regarding the internal market, the Defense Industrial Base has managed to meet the  increasing demands of the Brazilian Armed Forces and this has kept imports of such  products at reduced levels.  The recovery and strengthening of the Defense Industrial Base are goals outlined in the  National Defense Strategy. Besides the purpose of providing items and systems necessary  to the Armed Forces, the industrial base will also function as an inducer of technological  innovations with civilian applications, given the dual character of products.  The integration of programs and activities between the Ministry of Defense and the  Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI) has intensified in recent years,  with coordinated actions to promote priority projects that contemplate important  technological innovations and that are inducers of the Defense Industrial Base.  The joint efforts and initiatives in military and civilian research institutes, universities  and technology centers result in the strengthening of the entire Defense Industrial Base.  The Armed Forces offer, in terms of science, technology and innovation, valuable  contributions for raising the level of technological autonomy of the country. The  Forces maintain centers of excellence, particularly in applied research, which have been  fundamental for scientific and technological achievements that have occurred in Brazil.

The creation of the Office of Defense Materiel70 in the Defense Ministry is included  in this framework of fostering and promoting the Defense Industrial Base.  Since 2011, the Greater Brazil Plan has given continuity to the Productive Development  Policy (PDP), the National Defense Industry Policy (PNID) and the National Defense  Strategy. It reconciles the needs of industrial development with the requirements of  national defense.  70 Department of Defense Products — competencies and responsibilities described in chapter 3.    217DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  5   —  D  E F  E N  S E   T R  A N  S F  O R  M A  T IO  N  C H  A P  T E  R  5   —  D  E F  E N  S E   T R  A N  S F  O R  M A  T IO  N  The following are the main objectives of these policies with regard to the Defense  Industrial Base.  Documents Main Goals  National Defense Policy  — PND (2012)  •  stimulate state investments in advanced technological sectors; •  promote the continuous modernization and supply of the Armed   Forces with emphasis on support for science and technology for the  development of the Defense Industrial Base;  •  develop the Defense Industrial Base with a focus on achieving  autonomy in critical technologies;  •  ensure that the industrial sector contributes to ensure that the needs  of defense products are supported by technology under national  domain;  •  ensure the development of the Defense Industrial Base, including  the domain of dual technology use, in order to attend the supply of  defense products; and  •  promote the integration of the defense industry in South America to  ensure mutual benefit as well as training and technological autonomy.

The prospect of expanding demand for strategic defense products offers an excellent  opportunity to develop and strengthen the Defense Industrial Base. There are, however,  challenges highlighted in Greater Brazil Plan and the National Defense Strategy that  requires monitoring:  • increase investments in research, development and innovation;  • expand participation in domestic and foreign markets; and  • strengthen the supply chain in Brazil.    219DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  5   —  D  E F  E N  S E   T R  A N  S F  O R  M A  T IO  N  C H  A P  T E  R  5   —  D  E F  E N  S E   T R  A N  S F  O R  M A  T IO  N  Science, Technology and Innovation   Sharing or curtailing scientific and technological knowledge is a political decision that   directly interferes in trade negotiations between countries, including negotiations of defense  products.  To attend the guidelines of the National Defense Strategy, the Ministry of Defense, in  coordination with other ministries and representatives of the business and academic  communities, develops actions to integrate the existing science and technology systems in  Brazil.  Significant savings of resources and efforts may be achieved if there is greater  integration among research and development institutions of the Armed Forces, not only  in the implementation of projects that are of common interest, but also in exploring new  opportunities in science and technology.  Greater participation of the civilian scientific community in military projects, including  the possibility of transfer of budgetary resources from the Ministry of Defense to civilian  science and technology institutions can also streamline the management of projects that are  of interest to the Ministry.  The interaction between civilian and military research institutions, universities and  companies is essential to integrate entrepreneurial efforts in creating centers of advanced  technology in various areas. In Brazil, the technological centers are directly linked to  planning processes involving government, universities and companies, with particular  emphasis on state incentives for technological development. The Technological Center of  São José dos Campos, which focuses on the field of space, can be considered an example of  synergy in the sector of science and technology.

It has also grown stronger economically and acquired greater influence in the  international arena. These changes imply greater responsibilities for security and defense in  the global strategic environment.  National defense is of interest to society and is related to the main objectives of national  development. As noted in previous chapters, Brazil needs an efficient defense system to  protect its extensive territory, inestimable wealth and vast population.    The proper operation of the defense sector requires, in turn, an adequate allocation of  budget resources, as well as efficient management. This chapter will present budgetary  statistics and explain the main peculiarities of the Brazilian federal budget, particularly  in the area of defense. All historical data is present in real terms, i.e. considering inflation.  Defense Budget      General Rules Complementary Law No 97 of 1999, amended by Complementary Laws No 117 of 2004   and No 136 of 2010, established four general rules for the defense budget:  •  tthe Ministry of Defense’s budget will contemplate priorities defined in the National  Defense Strategy;   • the Ministry of Defense’s budget will distinguish sums allocated to the Navy, Army  and Air Force;  • the budget proposals of the Armed Services will be prepared jointly with the Ministry  of Defense, which will consolidate them; and  • The Navy, Army and Air Force will manage, individually, their respective allocated  budgetary resources.      DEFENSE WHITE PAPER222  C H  A P  T E  R  6   —  D  E F  E N  S E  ’S  E  C O  N O  M Y  C H  A P  T E  R  6   —  D  E F  E N  S E  ’S  E  C O  N O  M Y  Brazilian law adopts the principles of budgetary unity and universality. The unity  principle determines that there must only be one budget, i.e. each member of the Brazilian  federation (Union, states, Federal District and municipalities) must prepare a single budget.  Hence, the defense budget is part of the Union’s General Budget. The universality principle  determines that the budget law of each member of the federation must contain all revenues  and expenditures of every branch of state.  The Budget Process   The defense budget process, as part of the Union budget process, follows three main   phases. In the first phase, the Executive branch prepares a bill which establishes a four year  multiannual plan, in which all programs related to defense are inserted. This plan also sets  objectives, goals, initiatives and indicators for each program. The President of the Republic  is responsible for sending this bill to the National Congress, which, in turn, revises the  document, approves it and returns it for presidential sanction. The current multiannual  plan, called “More Brazil Plan”, comprises the period from 2012 to 2015.  In a second phase, the President of the Republic, on a yearly basis, sends to the National  Congress a bill on budget guidelines, which directs the preparation and the execution of the  annual budget law. The Congress is also responsible for appreciating and approving this bill,  and then returning it for presidential sanction.  In the last phase, the Ministry of Defense and other organs of the Union detail the actions  to be taken within their respective programs in an annual budget bill. These actions can be  of three types according to the official budget classification:  • projects: actions with a defined conclusion date;   • activities: actions which do not have a defined date of conclusion; and   • special operations: actions which do not generate products, such as debt payments.  The annual budget bill estimates revenues and authorizes expenses in detailed form and in  accordance with the budget guidelines law and the multiannual plan. It is the responsibility  of the President of the Republic to send to the National Congress, for amendment and  approval, the annual budget bill, which subsequently returns for presidential sanction.    223DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  6   —  D  E F  E N  S E  ’S  E  C O  N O  M Y  C H  A P  T E  R  6   —  D  E F  E N  S E  ’S  E  C O  N O  M Y  Defense Budget Principles An efficient National Defense system requires large scale and long term investments, such   as those applied on submarines, armored vehicles and aircraft. These materiel have a limited  service life, due to natural decay and technological advances. Thus, they must be renewed  periodically and, preferably, on pre-scheduled dates. Consequently, the allocation of budgetary  resources to the Ministry of Defense must, ideally, contemplate the following three principles:  •  stability — resources allocated to the Ministry of Defense should not, in principle, be  subject to drastic oscillations. Such practice contributes to the long term maintenance  of defense projects, avoiding delays and possible losses of personnel, who are often  developed along with projects;   • regularity — resource disbursement should occur in a systematic manner, to permit  the fulfillment of planned time schedules; and  • predictability — this principle grants security to the long term planning of large scale  projects, thereby assuring that resources are disbursed in a stable and regular manner.  Defense Budget Programs   The following chart shows the Ministry of Defense’s main programs in 2011, in proportion   to the Ministry’s total expenditure in that year.   6.0%1.0% 1.6%  1.6% 1.6%  1.6% 1.9%  2.8%  4.1%  31.5%  46.3%  Benefits for reserve personnel and pensioners  from the Ministry of Defense  Administrative support (comprised mostly  of personnel payments)  Brazilian airspace control and aviation safety  Development and employment of the Air Force  Others  Equipment and adaptation of the Brazilian  Army  Equipment and adaptation of the Brazilian  Army  Development and employment of Naval Power  Equipment and adaptation of the Army  Armed Forces health services  Equipment and adaptation of the Brazilian  Navy  Source: Senate — SIGA Brasil.  2011 budgetary programs of the Ministry of Defense    DEFENSE WHITE PAPER224  C H  A P  T E  R  6   —  D  E F  E N  S E  ’S  E  C O  N O  M Y  C H  A P  T E  R  6   —  D  E F  E N  S E  ’S  E  C O  N O  M Y  The chart shows that the largest part of the resources allocated to the Ministry of Defense  is assigned to the payment of benefits for reserve personnel and pensioners (46.3%) and  for administrative support (31.5%), which includes, among other expenses, the payroll  of active duty personnel. By contrast, in 2011, the total amount spent on investment and  maintenance of equipment and training was 10.8%71.  Defense Expenditures     International Scope   A comparison between the defense budgets of different countries permits a better   understanding of scale and how financial resources are applied. However, it must be noted  that there is a lack of uniformity in international budget rankings. A country may include  certain expenditure in its budget (for instance technological development), while another  may not. Brazil, in particular, includes expenditure on benefits for reserve personnel and  pensioners in its defense budget. The exclusion of these expenses would represent a 46%  decrease in the 2011 budget of the Ministry of Defense and similar values for the previous  years.  In the comparisons presented below, defense expenditure data was derived from the  Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in Sweden. The analysis is meant  to demonstrate the financial situation of the Brazilian Defense Ministry compared to similar  sectors in other countries.  In 2011, Brazil ranked tenth among countries with the largest defense expenditures in  the world. However, the previous remark regarding spending on reserve personnel and  pensioners, which may significantly misrepresent the country’s actual position, should  be considered. It also must be noted that Brazil is the country with the smallest defense  expenditure among the BRICS nations, except for South Africa, which did not expend  enough to figure among the top ten spenders72.  Among these top ten nations, Brazil was the sixth country that most increased its defense  expenditure in the last decade. However, again, it may be noted that this growth was inferior  to the that of the other BRICS nations. For example, there is a sharp discrepancy in the  growth in expenditure of Brazil (19%) and China (170%) in this period.  71 Obtained through the sum of the percentage of re-equipment and adaptation of the Navy and Air Force plus preparation  and employment of the three Forces.  72 Saudi Arabia’s budget values include spending with public security and may therefore be overestimated.     225DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  6   —  D  E F  E N  S E  ’S  E  C O  N O  M Y  C H  A P  T E  R  6   —  D  E F  E N  S E  ’S  E  C O  N O  M Y  Source: SIPRI.  2011 ten countries with the highest defense expenditures in the world    Defense  Expenditure  ( US$ billion)  0.0  100.0  200.0  300.0  400.0  500.0  600.0  700.0  800.0    USA     711.0   China  143.0  Russia  71.9  United Kingdom  62.7   France  62.5  Japan  59.3  India  48.9  Saudi Arabia  48.5    Germany  46.7  Brazil  35.4  US$Bi  Source: SIPRI.

This chart makes evident that almost half of global expenditures on  defense belong to the United States of America and that the defense expenditures of the  BRICS, not including South Africa, corresponds to 17.1% of total global spending in the  sector.    227DEFENSE WHITE PAPER  C H  A P  T E  R  6   —  D  E F  E N  S E  ’S  E  C O  N O  M Y  C H  A P  T E  R  6   —  D  E F  E N  S E  ’S  E  C O  N O  M Y  National Scope  The Ministry of Defense’s budget execution suffered a progressive reduction from 2000,   reaching its lowest level in 2003. From then on, there was a process of gradual recovery until  2010, as shown in the following chart. In 2011, there was a slight fall, due to financial restraining  measures imposed by the macroeconomic environment. The differences in the budget execution  between the Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defense’s Central Administration74 reflects their  respective differences and peculiarities, particularly concerning the number of personnel of  each, as described in chapter 3.   The newest Annual Budget Law (LOA), in its Volume IV, allocates R$ 64,794,765,301 to  the Ministry of Defense in 201275.     74 The expression “Central Administration” includes the organizational structure described in chapter 3, as well as the  War College (ESG), the Armed Forces Hospital (HFA) and the Civil Aviation Secretariat (SAC), which, in March 2011, was  transferred to the Presidency of the Republic.  75 The 2012 Annual Budget Law (LOA) is available in www.planejamento.gov.br.

It is important to note that the recovery of the budget execution of the Ministry of Defense,  previously mentioned, is less accentuated when one considers spending in proportion to  GDP. This is due to the fact that defense spending did not closely follow the evolution of  the Union’s primary expenses76 compared to GDP, which from 1995 to 2011 increased from  14.59% to 18.27%. In the same period, defense spending compared to GDP decreased from  1.79% to 1.48%.  76 Primary expenses, also known as non-financial expenditures, correspond to the combination of expenses that enable the  provision of public services to society, excluding financial expenses. These include expenses with personnel, maintenance  and investment. Such expenses may be of mandatory or discretionary nature.  2.5%  27.1%  45.3%  25.1%  Central Administration  Navy  Army  Air Force Source: SIAFI.

Of these various types of expenditure, spending on personnel and social security  represent the largest.  Current investments are far below the level required to support the priority projects of the  Ministry of Defense. As shown in chapter 5, in order to carry out a defense transformation,  along the indicated lines, it is necessary to substantially increase this type of expenditure.  Spending in maintenance must also rise, due to higher demands imposed by the acquisition  of new equipment.   In the personnel chart, presented below, it should be noted that the Army requires the  largest amount of budgetary resources, since it possesses the largest quantity of personnel,  as demonstrated in chapters 3 and 5. On the other hand, the Navy and Air Force, in the  last decade, have maintained a similar level of expenditure on human resources, due to   Ministry of Defense’s expenditures in 2011*  75.3%  1.0%  13.2%  10.6%  Personnel and social security  Debt  Maintenance  Investment Source: SIAFI.  *The 2012 LOA provides for the Ministry of Defense R$ 9,147,077,183 for expenses like investment.

It is a  medium term plan , of only four years, which is subject to several annual adjustments, including  restrictions, mostly due to external crises.  Although the defense budget has slightly recovered in the last seven years, there is still much  to be done.  Brazilian defense spending has not risen proportionately to the economic growth experienced  by the country. It is essential that society perceives expenses on national defense as necessary  investments for socioeconomic development, for the protection of natural resources and for the  defense of national sovereignty.  Not having Armed Forces in full readiness is a risk, and could result in higher costs for  the nation in future. Despite its peaceful tradition, Brazil cannot be seen as a defenseless and  disarmed nation. National Defense is a type of insurance which the Brazilian state should  continually renew, in accordance with the principles of stability, regularity and predictability, so  as to ensure a national environment that is favorable to full economic and social development.  77 Medium term from the budgetary perspective. From the Ministry of Defense’s viewpoint, the multiannual plan is considered  a short term document.

It has been, and will continue to be, the lifeblood of our nation’s economy. Published just over a year ago, the Integrated Review reaffirmed that the first duty of any government is to protect our people, our homeland, and our democracy. From a maritime perspective this is about protecting our ports, shipping routes and subsea infrastructure to ensure the free flow of goods and information that support our economy. It is about securing the waters of the UK and our Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies, particularly the UK Marine Area (UKMA) at home, which encompasses both our Territorial Sea and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) that surrounds it. We will protect the maritime domain and use our world-leading capabilities to monitor the seas and ocean, acting whenever and wherever we need to. This strategy is being published at a time of increased global tension, Russia’s illegal war on Ukraine has demonstrated the UK’s pivotal role in supporting an international order based on rules and principles. The barbarism and war crimes being committed in Ukraine are the kind of acts that had been consigned to the history books. The UK will develop our security and economic partnerships to deter and tackle aggression, coercion, and, oppression wherever it may appear. The UK will merge hard security and economic security, while building stronger global alliances to bring to bear the full range of our capabilities in championing the values that underpin our society. This puts Global Britain into action, working with international partners and institutions to uphold the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea including freedom of navigation, maintaining the international order and building a global network of liberty. Leaving the European Union has given us the ability to develop policies and strategies that represent the priorities and values that matter most to the British people. The National Strategy for Maritime Security captures this. It clearly defines maritime security and what this means for the UK, recognising the far-reaching impacts from sources of insecurity on the British people and our global interests. It sets strategic objectives and commitments that government will implement over the next five years and sets out how the implementation of the strategy will be monitored. 6 This strategy looks at how the UK can continue to strengthen the defences of the maritime sector, setting out robust, whole system approaches to emerging threats. Using our strength in security and diplomacy, our economic heft and our will and agility to lead the way in tackling some of the most challenging problems facing the international order. It will look forward to identify and mitigate future threats; from, in, and under the water. It draws on a rigorous evidence base from the UK Maritime Risk Assessment and incorporates input from industry, academia, and our global partners. Maritime Security is a whole of government endeavour, but as the five Secretaries of State responsible for the majority of this activity we are delighted to present this strategy which sets out the huge range of work planned to ensure the protection of our nation’s maritime interests.

As an island nation with global interests, the UK has a deep, historic connection to the seas and the ocean. For centuries, the maritime sector has played a critical role in the growth and prosperity of the UK by supporting trade and securing the vital supply routes to keep our nation running. Today, 95% of all goods by weight are imported or exported by sea18 and 99% of the UK’s international communications are carried through subsea fibre optic cables.19 2. It is vitally important that the maritime domain20 is secure. The globally interconnected domain consists of infrastructure and essential supply chains. Considerations of security need to remain at the fore of maritime policy. Protecting the functions of the supply chain networks are vital to ensuring that impacts are not felt by people in their daily lives. 3. The National Strategy for Maritime Security sets out the current and future issues facing government and the maritime sector. It draws on expertise and capabilities from a range of government departments and sets out clear strategic objectives and commitments over the coming five years to create a more secure, prosperous, and sustainable maritime sector. 4. Presenting the important issues and our objectives publicly will support industry, the public, academia, and our international partners in understanding the breadth and depth of work being undertaken to improve global maritime security. 5. In March 2021, the government launched ‘Global Britain in a Competitive Age: The Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy’ (the ‘Integrated Review’). It describes the government’s vision for the UK’s role in the world over the next decade and the action it will take to 2025. It identifies significant new changes to the international order and the UK’s place in the world. Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine has demonstrated the intensified competition between states over competing interests, norms, and values. This is being demonstrated through disruption of essential shipping lanes, disputes over maritime boundaries, or the use of hard and soft power by states to achieve narrowly focused objectives. 11 National Strategy for Maritime Security Executive summary 6. The government’s primary responsibility is the protection of our people, our homeland, and our democracy.21 From the maritime perspective this means the protection of our borders and essential trade routes, working with international partners to uphold the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), including ensuring freedom of navigation and adherence to the international order which supports our continued way of life. 7. Government is committed to deploying the full range of capabilities in tackling these emerging challenges, through the use of hard security and economic security we will take a whole of government approach. We will work with partners and build new global alliances to challenge states and non-state actors that threaten the maritime sector and the international order. 8. To support our whole of government approach the UK has created a broad, simple definition for maritime security, this ensures all maritime security interests can be properly considered, assessed, and planned for. This strategy defines maritime security in terms of upholding laws, regulations, and norms to deliver a free, fair, and open maritime domain. 9. Over the next five years, government will work towards five Strategic Objectives to further develop our world-leading approach to maritime security. These Strategic Objectives are interconnected and form the basis of this strategy document. 1: Protecting our homeland 2: Responding to threats 3: Ensuring prosperity 4: Championing our values 5: Supporting a secure, resilient ocean Maritime Security is about upholding laws, regulations, and norms to deliver a free, fair, and open maritime domain.

Overview The UK’s Approach 1. Following the publication of the Integrated Review, the time is now right to publish a new National Strategy for Maritime Security. The government published its first strategy for maritime security in 2014, setting out an approach to maritime security based around integration and collaboration both domestically and internationally. The 2014 strategy set the scene for a number of developments in the UK’s approach, which have been highly successful. 2. In particular, government has strengthened the UK’s maritime security capabilities by establishing the Joint Maritime Security Centre (JMSC) in 2019. The JMSC is at the centre of our response to maritime security. It works with stakeholders across government to develop a ‘Whole System Response’ to maritime security threats. Through the provision of a common understanding of maritime risk and threat, the JMSC enables government to tackle new challenges. It works across government to develop robust, well exercised multi-agency frameworks for responding to new and emerging threats. 3. The JMSC’s ability to cohere and augment the responses of UK agencies to complex maritime incidents both at home and abroad has demonstrated the value of a single coordinating maritime security body within government. 4. Published in 2019, Maritime 2050 – Navigating the Future sets a long-term vision for the UK over the coming 30 years. This document has been pivotal in setting an agreed position between government and industry on the future direction of the maritime sector over the coming decades. This strategy sets out our plan for the next five years to get us closer to the security ambitions set-out in Maritime 2050. 5. Government has also continued to work with international partners to tackle Serious and Organised Crime (SOC), piracy, terrorism, and other security threats. We will maintain a constant global security presence, with more ships, submarines, sailors, and marines deployed, protecting shipping lanes and upholding freedom of navigation. This work involves collaboration with the shipping industry and our international partners. 16 National Strategy for Maritime Security Overview Image: HMS Trent at sea undertaking joint anti-piracy exercises with the Nigerian Forces. 17 Image: Royal Marine Boarding team continues to conduct Alongside Assurance operations from HMS Trent. In the background is a small fishing vessel that was visited to observe fishery patterns to gain more understanding of regional activity. 6. In developing this strategy, the expertise and experience from strategy, policy and operational teams across government has been utilised. Harnessing science and technology and utilising subject matter experts, our approach has been robust, and evidence based. We have worked with academia and industry to understand a range of perspectives and ensure the most current thinking is included in the strategy. 7. Our five Strategic Objectives set out the approach government will take in delivering the activity required to protect the UK, the Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies. 18 National Strategy for Maritime Security Overview Table 1- Strategic Objectives and Statements of Intent. Strategic Objective Statement of intent Protecting our homeland Delivering the world’s most effective maritime security framework for our borders, ports and infrastructure, government will: • Work to ensure the security of our borders, ports and maritime infrastructure with Devolved Administrations, Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies. • Support the maritime sector to be resilient against cyber attack and other threats with resilient systems and networks to protect data. • Set out the standards and requirements for border infrastructure and facilities, in partnership with industry, to support investment to speed up and secure the passage of people and goods. Responding to threats Deploying a whole system response to bring world-leading capabilities and expertise to bear in responding to new and emerging threats, government will: • Further develop and effectively utilise world leading Maritime Domain Awareness capabilities. • Create a secure environment which limits the ability of terrorist and organised criminal groups to operate. • Develop comprehensive approaches to defend the integrity of our maritime interests from state threats. • Continue to develop and establish strong working relationships, partnerships, and alliances with International Partners, such as the continued commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the announcement of the AUKUS partnership. Ensuring prosperity Ensuring the security of international shipping, the unimpeded transmission of goods, information, and energy to support continued global development and our economic prosperity, government will: • Work with international partners to tackle Organised Criminal Groups (OCGs), piracy and other forms of criminal activity which threaten global prosperity. • Monitor chokepoints and strategic seaways to ensure the free movement of goods and trade. • Create a robust, secure, and diverse system to protect essential subsea infrastructure. 19 National Strategy for Maritime Security Overview Image: BIOT patrol vessel patrolling British Indian Ocean Territory waters. Strategic Objective Statement of intent Championing our values Championing the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea as the legal framework within which all activities in the ocean and seas are carried out, government will: • Uphold and promote compliance with the rights and obligations of UNCLOS including freedom of navigation.22 • Work with allies, partners, and multilateral institutions to maintain a free, open, and secure Indo-Pacific. • Lead by example to champion free trade and global cooperation to limit instability on the world’s ocean. Supporting a secure, resilient ocean To work towards an ocean that is effectively governed, clean, healthy, safe, productive, and biologically diverse, government will: • Champion sustainable governance of the ocean, developing maritime security approaches which enforce environmental regulations. • Consider changes to our climate as integral to supporting a mature maritime security approach. • Work with allies and partners to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of the marine environment. 8. In defining maritime security in terms of upholding laws, regulations, and norms to deliver a free, fair, and open maritime domain; government will tackle the range of issues facing the UK and our international partners in the maritime domain. 9. The UK will continue to take a collaborative approach to solving problems. We will continue to use new technologies and scientific understanding to support the national and global maritime industries in combatting well known and emerging risks, and also seize opportunities to secure a Global Britain with a competitive advantage. 20 National Strategy for Maritime Security Overview The UK’s commitment to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 10. The ocean is one of the most contested and complex global arenas, with a wide range of civil, military, and paramilitary actors. 11. The Integrated Review sets out the UK’s absolute commitment to upholding UNCLOS in all its dimensions, as an essential enabler of global prosperity, security, and a healthy planet. UNCLOS is the cornerstone of international law on ocean- related issues and the framework within which all activities in the ocean and seas, including those described in this strategy, must be conducted. 12. UNCLOS sets out rights and obligations on a wide range of issues including: shipping, fishing, seabed mining, conservation, cable-laying, freedom of navigation and the right to establish maritime zones such as the Territorial Sea, Exclusive Economic Zone and Continental Shelf. 13. We support, defend, and uphold international law by developing and delivering UK maritime policy that recognises the central role of UNCLOS. UNCLOS is critical to the UK’s economic, environmental and security interests. By upholding UNCLOS, we aim to ensure that all nations abide by the same clear rules, making international relations more predictable and peaceful. 21 National Strategy for Maritime Security Overview The Physical Maritime Domain 14. To understand maritime security, it is essential to outline the maritime domain in its entirety. This contributes to our understanding of the arena in which maritime security actors operate. UNCLOS sets the geographical limits of maritime zones and establishes rights and responsibilities of coastal states and flag states. 15. Accurate geospatial data is needed to officially calculate the legal maritime limits and boundaries of coastal states. Therefore, marine science critically underpins our authority under UNCLOS to claim, administer and lawfully prosecute infringements in our waters. 16. The UK’s marine estate, including the Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies, is vast and constitutes the 5th largest in the world. The metropolitan UK’s marine area (UKMA) encompasses both the Territorial Sea and the Exclusive Economic Zone around the UK. The challenge is, at present only around 20% of the world’s seabed and only 10% of the UK’s global marine area has been mapped to modern standards, partly caused by challenges with data collection, access, standards, and coordination. 17. However, as highlighted in the Integrated Review, the world is entering the ‘informational age’ and this strategy recognises the ocean as the next frontier to be opened up by advances in technology driven by the ever-increasing demand for more accurate and reliable marine geospatial information by the public and private sectors of all nations. Therefore, government has established the UK Centre for Seabed Mapping hosted by the UK Hydrographic Office. As a centre of excellence, it will coordinate cross-government and industry collaboration in order to increase the quantity, quality, and availability of data in the marine domain, which will inform government to support security, prosperity, and environmental objectives. 22 OverviewNational Strategy for Maritime Security Figure 1: Map showing the UK Marine Area, including the marine area of the Crown Dependencies of the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey. 23 OverviewNational Strategy for Maritime Security UK's Marine Estate 3,000 0 3,0001,500 Kilometers .

Overview 12 Nautical Miles 200 Nautical Miles ~350 Nautical Miles Territorial sea High Seas High Seas Freedoms Freedoms (Article 58): Navigation Overflight Laying of cables/pipelines Exclusive Economic Zone (Sovereign rights) Sovereignty Land Innocent Passage Interal waters B as el in e Continental Shelf Extended Continental Shelf The “Area” Additional freedoms: Fishing Scientific Research Figure 3: Overview of UNCLOS Maritime Zones.23 24 National Strategy for Maritime Security Overview • Baseline: The normal baseline for measuring the breadth of the territorial sea is the low-water line along the coast as marked on large-scale charts officially recognised by the coastal state. • Internal Waters: Covers all water and waterways on the landward side of the baseline. The UK is responsible for setting laws and regulating the use of these internal waters. • Territorial Sea: From the baseline up to 12 nautical miles (nm). The UK is responsible for setting laws and regulating the use of these waters, subject to the right of vessels from other states to exercise innocent passage or transit passage (where the waters constitute an international strait). A further 12 nm beyond the territorial sea, a State can establish a Contiguous Zone, in which it can continue to enforce laws in four areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution, to prevent breaches of these laws within its territory or territorial sea or to punish infringements of these laws in its territory or territorial sea. • Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ): This extends from the edge of the territorial sea up to 200 nm from the baseline. Within this area, coastal states have sovereign rights with respect to exploring and exploiting, conserving, and managing natural resources and jurisdiction with regard to marine scientific research, the protection and preservation of the marine environment and the establishment and use of artificial islands, installations, and structures, as well as some other rights provided by UNCLOS. The UK EEZ is the area within which the UK is responsible for enforcing fishing measures. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have their own zones within the EEZ in which they are responsible for fisheries enforcement. • Continental shelf: Coastal states have a continental shelf as of right, extending to at least 200nm from their coastal baselines, subject to the rights of States with opposite or adjacent coasts. Subject to certain conditions, the continental shelf may extend beyond 200nm. The coastal state has exclusive sovereign rights for exploring, exploiting, and conserving the natural resources on the seabed in this zone, as well as some other rights. • High Seas: The high seas are all parts of the ocean not included in the internal waters, territorial sea, EEZ or archipelagic waters of a state. The high seas are open to all states, who have various freedoms including navigation and overflight, laying of submarine cables and pipelines, construction of artificial islands and other installations, fishing, and scientific research. As a general rule, states have exclusive jurisdiction over their flagged vessels on the high seas. • The Area: The Area is the seabed and ocean floor and subsoil thereof beyond the limits of national jurisdiction. Exploration and exploitation of the mineral resources of the Area are managed by the International Seabed Authority as the common heritage of mankind. 25 National Strategy for Maritime Security Overview Other Challenges Impacting on Maritime Security 18. The National Strategy for Maritime Security 2014 outlined the most pressing challenges to maritime security at the time. This included terrorism, disruption to vital maritime routes, attacks on maritime infrastructure and shipping, transportation of illegal items by sea, people smuggling and human trafficking. This strategy recognises that these challenges are still current and seeks to address these. However, there are also new and emerging challenges impacting on maritime security such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, degradation of the marine environment and state-based threats. 19. The global COVID-19 Pandemic has demonstrated the highly connected world we live in. Responding to it has highlighted the importance of collaboration, multilateralism, and has shown that, in fighting the pandemic, ‘no-one is safe until everyone is’.24 The pandemic has highlighted the importance of protecting global supply chains and shipping routes, and how they can impact on the domestic stability of states. In recent years, we have seen how instability in countries can be used by terrorists and criminals to affect the global system. 20. Climate change presents a significant threat to our way of life. The changes we will see over the coming years and decades will continue to challenge the international order. They will also give rise to a wide range of new risks and opportunities to the maritime sector as a whole. This includes the opening of new trade routes through the Arctic or High North alongside increased global instability which may in turn create new forms of terrorism or criminality. Alongside this, the depletion and changing distribution of fish stocks may result in challenges for countries managing fish stocks and may spur Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing. 21. There has been a resurgence of state-based threats, intensifying wider state competition and the erosion of the rules-based international order, making it harder to build consensus and tackle global threats. Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has served to both demonstrate the threats to the international order while demonstrating the ability for global consensus and collaboration in the face of illegal actions. 22. Additionally, malicious cyber activity knows no international boundaries and has grown in terms of intensity, complexity, and severity. The UK’s mitigation of risks against cyber threats within the maritime industry is more important than ever and will continue to be critical as the industry evolves with increasing automation. 26 National Strategy for Maritime Security Overview 23. Alongside this, Serious and Organised Crime continues to present a sustained threat to UK maritime security and prosperity in a range of areas. Organised crime groups engage in piracy, in smuggling illicit commodities such as controlled drugs and firearms, in people smuggling and in human trafficking – in doing so, putting lives and communities at risk to make a profit. Maritime Risk Assessment 24. The strategy is informed by a comprehensive, cross-government Maritime Risk Assessment (MRA) to ensure all key risks are addressed. The MRA is reviewed regularly and informs the National Security Risk Assessment (NSRA). The likelihood and impact of particular risks are used to support wider government policy decisions and direct funding where appropriate. The MRA also supports our strategic objectives of protecting our homeland and responding to threats. 25. The key maritime security risks from the latest MRA are presented here in no particular priority order: • Terrorism affecting the UK and its maritime interests, including attacks against cargo or passenger ships. • Disruption to vital maritime trade routes resulting from war, criminality, piracy, or changes in international norms. • Attack on UK maritime infrastructure or shipping, including cyber-attack. • The transportation of illegal items by sea, including weapons of mass destruction, controlled drugs, and arms. • People smuggling and human trafficking. 27 National Strategy for Maritime Security Overview Objective 1: Protecting our homeland Delivering the world’s most effective maritime security framework for our borders, ports and infrastructure, government will: • Work to ensure the security of our borders, ports and maritime infrastructure with Devolved Administrations, Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies. • Support the maritime sector to be resilient against cyber attack and other threats with resilient systems and networks to protect data. • Set out the standards and requirements for border infrastructure and facilities, in partnership with industry, to support investment to speed up and secure the passage of people and goods. 1. In protecting our homeland, we are ensuring the safety of people and goods as well as the security of the UK’s marine estate. Maritime security can therefore be seen as an extension of the homeland or ‘UK border’. This includes the maritime assets of the UK, Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies and involves physical and digital protection of our ships, port facilities, and key maritime infrastructure. Our foreign policy rests on strong domestic foundations. 2. Government also has a responsibility to protect our underwater cultural heritage, with over 5500 sites of cultural significance globally. We will focus on in-situ preservation alongside safety and environmental management. This involves a number of government departments and agencies who focus on protecting military remains, cultural heritage and preventing illegal salvage activity of our historic and sensitive underwater sites. 28 National Strategy for Maritime Security Protecting our homeland Image: Bulk Carrier docked in Port of Bristol. 29 Border Security 3. The maritime domain provides a layer of deterrence and detection contributing to creating an effective border. Alongside the maritime domain there are ‘hard’ physical intervention points at ports and along our borders. The UK’s border is a vital asset for our safety, prosperity, and global reputation, it provides a unique intervention point to detect, disrupt, and respond to a range of security threats while enabling the travel and trade that underpin our way of life. 4. Border security is about facilitating the movement of legitimate trade and travellers, while ensuring the right measures are in place to deter hostile actors and prevent illicit cross-border movements of people and goods. Government takes a ‘layered’ approach to securing our borders with surveillance, control, and intervention matched to the most appropriate point. 5. In December 2020, government published the UK Border Strategy 2025 which sets out the vision for the UK border over the next five years as embracing innovation, simplifying processes for traders and travellers, and improving the security and biosecurity of the UK. Key amongst these transformations is to establish resilient ports of the future at border crossing points. 6. Border Force is the main agency responsible for securing the UK border, with Defence coordinating HMG’s operational response to countering small boat migration in the English Channel. Border Security is achieved by carrying out immigration and customs controls for people and goods entering the UK, with officers working at ports around the UK and the Crown Dependencies, at sea, inland, and overseas with our international partners. Border Force deploys its officers on an intelligence-led basis using both land and sea-based resources, maintaining a permanent presence at larger recognised ports catering for ferries, commercial cargo vessels, and cruise liners. To help improve the intelligence picture even further, Border Force will introduce a new digital system to gather Advance Passenger Information from pleasure craft arrivals for the first time. It is anticipated that further mandatory electronic reporting schemes will follow on. 7. Border Force Maritime Command’s fleet of Cutters and Coastal Patrol Vessels also plays a central role in reducing crime, tackling illegal migration, protecting the vulnerable, enabling the legitimate movement of people and goods to support economic prosperity, while reducing the risk from terrorism to the UK. This capability is also an integral part of the UK’s whole system approach to border security. 30 National Strategy for Maritime Security Protecting our homeland Image: Royal Marine Commandos from HMS Trent undertaking joint boarding exercises with Nigerian forces. Case Study – Motor Yacht KAHU, 2021 The Jamaican flagged MY KAHU was initially detected because of suspicious activity in the North Atlantic following her departure from Barbados. This suggested an intention to on-load an illicit cargo at sea. Enquiries established that the vessel had been under both FBI and the AFP (Australian Federal Police) suspicion of drug trafficking. Further, one of the crew on board was linked to a drugs OCG in the UK. The NCA subsequently coordinated a multi-agency operation. Border Force Maritime Command were tasked to detect and interdict the KAHU as soon as possible due to the high probability that the drugs would be off-loaded as the vessel approached Northern Europe. Permission was sought and secured from the Jamaican authorities to interdict the vessel on the High Seas. In the meantime HMC Searcher and CPV Alert were deployed to east of Ushant to identify and monitor the KAHU. The MY KAHU was detected moving eastbound up the English Channel. Once authority was granted, HMC Searcher and CPV Alert carried out the interdiction on the High Seas, just to the east of the Casquets. Once aboard, the boarding team found six crewmen, who were arrested in relation to Drug Trafficking offences. Numerous dry bags suspected to contain cocaine were discovered below decks, clearly made ready to offload. Once in harbour, Border Force confirmed that there was a gross weight of 2370kg of cocaine within the vessel – the largest ever UK cocaine seizure from a pleasure craft.’ 31 8. Crucially, Maritime Command ensures that security at ports is not undermined through the diversion of OCG activity elsewhere along our coast. Government will procure a new fleet of Cutters and Coastal Patrol Vessels to maintain and further enhance Border Force’s integral role in the UK’s law enforcement and border security effort. Port Security 9. Maritime ports are our gateway to the ocean and trade routes of the world. As a result, ports are naturally attractive targets to those seeking to facilitate or perpetrate crime or terrorism. Robust port security complements border security, making our ports and coastline less attractive to those who wish to exploit the UK. It covers a wide range of threats, from trespassers and petty theft, through to counter terrorism, state sponsored cyber-attacks and smuggling by OCGs. 10. We have seen in the past that protestors can interrupt the operation of key national infrastructure, including ports, through low-level and civil offences which can cause serious disruption to the public. Government is looking at options to prevent interference with the operation of key transport infrastructure. 11. The protection of port facilities is conducted through preventative measures to deter and detect unlawful acts, primarily addressing physical security, access control and application of security procedures. As the maritime security regulator, government is responsible for the implementation of the International Shipping and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS) and ensures its delivery through a robust maritime security compliance function. 12. Government will act as a regulator that our port sector can trust, continuing to provide Port Facility Security Officers (PFSOs) with expert advice and guidance. In striving for continuous improvement, government will also utilise bilateral relationships with maritime authorities in other nations to ensure shared objectives on port security are understood. 32 National Strategy for Maritime Security Protecting our homeland *All ports handled over 2 million tonnes of freight in 2020.

Security at ports in the UK, Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies will continue to require assessment of risk and implementation of security measures according to legislation, instructions, and guidance. Government will work with industry to accurately assess risk, encouraging close working between ports, government partners and subject matter experts to enable advice and guidance. For example, PORTSAFE is an initiative between the police and port operators which aims to enhance security awareness within commercial maritime ports, providing a hostile environment for maritime criminal activity. 14. Collaboration between port facilities, Port Security Authorities and providers will enable us to share best practice and embed common approaches to security across the sector. Government will continue work with industry to support the development of security procedures at our borders and ports. 15. Staff and seafarers remain the sector’s biggest asset, undertaking the work essential to maintaining global trade and prosperity. Their roles give them privileged access to facilities and systems which can be misused for illicit or illegal purposes. These personnel are vulnerable to coercion by criminal and terrorist organisations, to undertake malicious activity in return for personal gain. Government will continue to support the maritime sector in understanding the risks from the insider threat. The Centre for Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) publishes a range of guidance and public tools which support owners and operators to improve their protective security. 16. To improve collaboration between government and industry, a dedicated maritime security portal will be created to provide timely and effective industry engagement. This will enable quick, reliable, and up to date communications with secure access for sharing documents covering both policy and compliance. 34 National Strategy for Maritime Security Protecting our homeland Security of Freeports 17. In 2019, government announced plans to establish a number of freeports across the UK. Freeports are areas where businesses will benefit from more generous tax reliefs, simplified customs procedures, and wider government support. This will bring investment, trade and jobs addressing regional inequalities and levelling up the UK. The government remains committed to establishing a freeport in both Wales and Northern Ireland, and two green freeports in Scotland as soon as possible.26 18. While freeports do not change UK border security measures, it will be important to address any new security implications that affect freeports and ensure support to legitimate business activity. 19. Freeports are commonly used across the globe, and the Government has learned from these examples to build upon its current expertise and ensure cross-border illegal activity is thwarted.

Working alongside UK Law Enforcement, operators of freeports will need to put in place measures to ensure the security of their sites and effectively manage access. This will include providing the necessary infrastructure, both digital and physical, to ensure compliance with UK and international regulations. Government will continue to support and assure the proper implementation of all freeports security procedures. Cyber Security 21. Alongside the robust protection of our physical assets, government continues to support the maritime sector to build resilience against a range of cyber threats including cyber espionage, cyber-crime, hacktivism, and ransomware. 22. In some areas, the UK maritime sector is already making the most of technological advances. In the management of ports, logistics, supply chains, the rollout of 5G networks and the consideration of autonomous shipping, the UK has made great progress. 23. As a consequence of a spike in the volume of incidents globally, the maritime sector has experienced a growth in ransomware attacks. Improvements in understanding the threat and taking appropriate mitigations will reduce the impact of successful cyber-attacks. Our vision is that the UK in 2030 will continue to be a leading responsible and democratic cyber power, able to protect and promote our interests in and through cyberspace in support of national goals.27 36 National Strategy for Maritime Security Protecting our homeland Image: Container ship and General cargo ship alongside a port at night Case Study: Ransomware Attacks in 2020-21 According to Open Source, there were a number of ransomware attacks on the maritime sector throughout 2020 and 2021. • In March 2020, Operators of CL0P ransomware posted online files allegedly belonging to EV cargo. In June 2020, FireEye identified a CL0P ransomware sample able to target Overseas Territories related processes which could result in extended downtime for an organisation. • In April 2020, Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) reported a data centre outage that affected their website and networks. They subsequently reported that this was a result of malware which targeted a software vulnerability • In September 2020, French Shipping giant – CMA CGM were the victims of a Ragnar Locker ransomware attack, which affected e-commerce services, as well as company emails. • Australian logistics company Toll Group found themselves a victim of ransomware attacks twice in 2020. • In July 2021, South African ports, and rail company Transnet was targeted and forced to halt operations in a number of ports. Whilst operating systems were not directly affected, a terminal operating system was turned off as a precaution. It is likely that the cyber actor involved in the South Africa ports wished to extort money from the South African company. 37 24. Government can support organisations to build their resilience by continuing to provide advice and guidance on cyber best practice and to consider what further support can be made available. This can be done by seeking to understand the means by which efficient and effective screening measures can be made more agile to quickly meet the demand of any changes to emerging threats. 25. The Network and Information Systems (NIS) Regulations came into effect in 2018 to support organisations who provide a critical service, including those in the maritime sector, in building a stronger foundation of cyber security and resilience. The Department for Transport (DfT), as the competent authority for the regulation of the maritime sector, adopted the use of the National Cyber Security Centre’s (NCSC) Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF) to ensure operators manage the security of their network and information systems to ensure continuity of their essential services. DfT will continue to work with organisations to improve their cyber security post-CAF. Government will use the NIS Regulations 2018 to drive up standards of cyber security and help the sector become more resilient. 26. Government has recently published a new National Cyber Strategy, which sets out plans to cement the UK’s position as a responsible and democratic cyber power and strengthen cyber security and resilience across the country. A key objective of the Strategy is to ensure that government, Critical National Infrastructure (CNI), organisations and citizens understand the cyber risks they face and their responsibilities to manage them. Increased understanding of cyber security risks should help industry better assess and manage their own risk and improve their resilience and ability to prepare, respond and recover from cyber incidents. 27. The NCSC provides advice and guidance on risks through information sharing platforms and technical assistance in the event of a cyber incident. Organisations can access a range of free cyber security tools and services which NCSC provides as part of their Active Cyber Defence programme. Resources include tools such as ‘Early Warning’ which helps organisations spot malicious activity on their network, ‘Logging Made Easy’ which helps organisations install basic logging capability on their IT estate, and ‘Exercise in a Box’ which helps organisations test and practise their response to a cyber incident. Many more tools and services are available through the NCSC. 28. In their capacity as national technical authority for cyber threats, NCSC offer a range of services to support risk and threat management which are available to the sector. Government will work collaboratively with a wide spectrum of partners to further warn, inform, and advise. 38 National Strategy for Maritime Security Protecting our homeland Image: HMS Queen Elizabeth the next generation aircraft carrier enters Portsmouth, United Kingdom. 29. In light of the changing threat landscape, government will update the 2017 Cyber Security Code of Practice for Ships and work with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to agree international standards and agreements. The Cyber and Information Security section contained within the Port Facility Security Instructions will also be updated and will include links to NCSC guidance, including how to report cyber incidents. 30. Increased cyber incident reporting by the maritime industry will help the NCSC and government advise the sector on how to mitigate against existing and new threats and improve their resilience. There must also be consideration on securing legacy- based systems and making new systems ‘secure by design’ by building cyber security and resilience in at the start of the project. The challenges on the horizon are varied; rapid technological change and digital advances are reshaping the way we work and do business, with more and more organisations seeking to rely upon automated systems and network controls to complete the most complex of tasks. 31. Government will remain committed to developing excellence in its workforce, including specialist cyber skills and maritime thematic knowledge for those engaged on these programmes of work. 32. Government will implement the new National Cyber Strategy to ensure that the maritime industry is aware of the cyber risks it faces and their responsibilities in managing them. National Strategy for Maritime Security Protecting our homeland 39 Objective 2: Responding to threats Deploying a whole system response to bring world leading capabilities and expertise to bear in responding to new and emerging threats, government will: • Further develop and effectively utilise world leading Maritime Domain Awareness capabilities. • Create a secure environment which limits the ability of terrorist and organised criminal groups to operate. • Develop comprehensive approaches to defend the integrity of our maritime interests from state threats. • Continue to develop and establish strong working relationships, partnerships, and alliances with International Partners, such as the continued commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the announcement of the AUKUS partnership. 1. The UK coastline benefits from some of the world’s most advanced capabilities to respond to and protect against a wide range of threats, from tax evasion to terrorism and drug trafficking. The UK operational response to these threats includes capabilities from the Border Force, Police, Her Majesty’s Coastguard and Royal Navy ships among others. Our capabilities allow us to respond to current and ongoing challenges but also prepare us for new and emerging threats over coming years. 40 National Strategy for Maritime Security Responding to threats Image: RNLI Boat and HM Coastguard Helicopter undertaking at sea exercises. 41 2. The UK continues to build upon these capabilities. The UK’s shipbuilding industry supports skilled jobs and a vast supply chain around the country in both the civil and defence sectors and delivers world-leading capabilities for the Royal Navy. With the appointment of the Defence Secretary as the National Shipbuilding lead and champion, the Government’s ambitions for the shipbuilding sector have grown and there has been a renewed drive across Government to reinvigorate the sector. As detailed in the National Shipbuilding Strategy Refresh, the Government and industry’s shared vision is to create a globally successful, innovative, and sustainable UK shipbuilding enterprise by 2030. 3. Our ambition is to have a shipbuilding enterprise that is at the forefront of technological and environmental innovations, and which is globally competitive in key market segments, including design, build, integration, test and evaluation and repair. Moreover, decarbonisation, digitalisation, and autonomy represent the opportunity for a radical reboot of the commercial shipping industry. 4. On 31 January 2020, the UK left the European Union. The UK’s departure from the EU means that we will need to consider threats in new ways as a sovereign state. The UK will continue to cooperate closely with the EU, its member states and other international partners through a variety of existing and new mechanisms, including bilateral and multilateral agreements. 5. Government must consider maritime threats in different ways: • Threats on the water: where a threat actor uses the sea to cause an incident on the sea. This includes and is not limited to illegal fishing, blockading of ports, or theft. • Threats from the water: where a threat actor uses the sea as a means to achieve goals on land. This includes and is not limited to the smuggling of drugs, weapons, or people. • Threats under the water: where a threat actor uses the sea for illicit, illegal, or threatening purposes, including intelligence gathering, threatening subsea infrastructure or hostile intent. 6. In these definitions, the response required varies considerably. The personnel, equipment and plans used are based on a solid understanding of the maritime domain, comprehensive exercising, and world-leading intelligence capabilities. Science and technology play a key role in supporting the understanding of, preparing for, and responding to, threats in maritime. 42 National Strategy for Maritime Security Responding to threats 7. Government works with NATO, our allies and other global alliances to tackle new and emerging threats. We will continue to be the leading European ally within NATO, bolstering the Alliance by tackling maritime security threats jointly and committing our resources to collective security in the Euro-Atlantic region. This has been demonstrated in the UK’s robust and comprehensive approach to Russia’s illegal invasion in February 2022. 8. We will continue to exceed the NATO guideline of spending 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) on defence, and to declare our nuclear and offensive cyber capabilities to Allies’ defence under our Article 5 commitment. Maritime Domain Awareness 9. Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) is defined by the IMO as the effective understanding of anything associated with the maritime domain that could impact security, safety, the economy or the environment.28 10. The UK has world leading capabilities and expertise to effectively monitor the sea surrounding it, and the Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies. This means government can respond to incidents that could impact upon the security, safety, prosperity, or environment, rapidly and in a coordinated manner. 11. MDA is a critical component of our multi-layered maritime defence approach. The numerous agencies involved in MDA and the Royal Navy MDA Programme use a wide range of tools to provide up to date, accurate information to senior leaders and key decision makers. They collect and process vast amounts of data from all aspects of the maritime domain. This is achieved through a variety of primary data collection activities and situational awareness tools including surveillance software, the use of coastal radars, aviation operations, space-based reconnaissance, and government vessels. 12. The UK has a well-established status as a world leader in transforming data to support other maritime activities including claims of sovereignty, economic development, security and defence, scientific research, safety of navigation and environmental protection. As security requirements change and new technologies become available, it will be essential to adapt the current MDA model to provide the best available picture. 43 National Strategy for Maritime Security Responding to threats Image: Next generation aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth and Nimitz-class USS Ronald Reagan in the foreground with its carrier strike group and support vessels in the background, sailing in the Philippine Sea, undertaking quad carrier exercises with USS Carl Vinson and JS ISE (not pictured). 13. Government works with national, regional, and international partners to support MDA capacity building across the globe. Comprehensive understanding of the international system provides a common operating picture for maritime security actors. Government will continue to develop our MDA both domestically and internationally.

In recognition of the wide range of threats to maritime security, the UK has worked towards strengthening its maritime security capabilities over the past seven years. There are a number of organisations and departments which contribute to the UK’s maritime security system, and which together maintain a range of capabilities, including high-readiness air and maritime assets, to deter and respond to threats to the UK. We will continue to maintain and strengthen these capabilities as well as to enhance interoperability and coordination of our capabilities and structures to ensure they can be deployed and leveraged to best effect against the full range of current, new, and emerging threats. 15. At the heart of the ‘Whole System Response’ has been the creation of the JMSC as the government’s centre for maritime security coordination. The JMSC is a national organisation, supporting all agencies to deliver the maritime security objectives of the government, the Devolved Administrations, and the UK’s Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies. As a multi-agency organisation, the JMSC ensures that the government, military, and law enforcement agencies, have a developed understanding of maritime security threats and risks in our own waters and across the globe. 16. Since its formation, the JMSC has provided a mechanism for the UK’s maritime and law enforcement focused organisations to fuse intelligence, data, and capabilities. This maximises operational impact at home and abroad. The JMSC’s Operations Centre utilises cutting edge technology to provide 24/7 monitoring of UK waters. Staffed by personnel drawn from across government, it is well placed to swiftly identify maritime security incidents and enable the effective coordination of the UK’s aerial and at-sea assets to respond. The JMSC holds and develops the playbooks to counter the range of threats and assures multi-agency exercising of response scenarios. National Strategy for Maritime Security Responding to threats 46 Figure 7: Partners involved in delivering the UK’s Whole System Response to maritime security. 47 National Strategy for Maritime Security Responding to threats Operation STONEWISE: The “End of Transition Period” (Brexit) marked a coming of age of the JMSC where the structures laid out in the text allowed the JMSC to co-ordinate the whole of Government Preparations. The Maritime Threat Group met weekly and reported up to the NMSC(O) which in turn provided the higher-level governance of the whole system approach and acted as the single briefing to the MSMSG. This ensured that the Ministerial intent was understood and translated downward and that the MSMSG and thus XO Committee (now “Global Britain (Operations”) were informed of the response intentions, preparedness, and risks from the perspective of the entire UK Maritime Security System. This collaborative approach best utilised all of government assets to achieve a common aim with complimentary use of resource ensuring efficiencies, synergies and gaps were identified, mitigated where possible and explained. Illegal Migration and the Threat from Organised Immigration Crime 17. As global instability increases through social and political unrest, the movement of people across borders, including via maritime routes and the seas, is likely to become a greater challenge. Those seeking a better life for their families or fleeing oppression are using established land and sea routes to enter Europe. Some will attempt secondary migration journeys to reach the UK and we can expect this to continue over the next five years and beyond. 18. In recent years, OCGs have increasingly taken advantage of the most desperate in society. These groups exploit vulnerable people and offer to smuggle them into the UK via a range of methods, with the number of crossings via small boats increasing significantly over the last couple of years. Groups also traffic vulnerable people to be sold into modern slavery. 19. In support of Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), the UK’s maritime response regularly rescue people on unseaworthy boats not suitable to make the crossing across the English Channel. To strengthen our current efforts the MOD have taken primacy for our operational response within the Channel (Operation ISOTROPE). There is a significant risk to life from these crossings and it is therefore essential that we take a whole of route approach. Government works with international partners 48 National Strategy for Maritime Security Responding to threats and using technology and intelligence to target and disrupt the criminal gangs facilitating migrants’ journeys, protecting lives, while also supporting SOLAS operations if controls are evaded. 20. In this context, we are committed to working closely with our near neighbours, including France. UK funding has enabled France to significantly increase the numbers of French law enforcement officers deployed along the coast. We are investing in a range of technology and capability enhancements to ensure those deployed can quickly detect and respond to migrants prior to embarkation. Intelligence sharing is being increased to support operational activity and bilateral work through the Joint Intelligence Centre (JIC) established in July 2020 continues to build opportunities for investigations against those facilitating crossings. To date, 21 organised crime groups have been dismantled and over 500 individuals arrested as a result of JIC activity. 21. Innovative technologies are being identified and employed to support the UK response. Development of UK sovereign capabilities such as aerial surveillance assets, will ensure that all small boats to the UK are identified and interdicted. We are also investing in maritime assets to respond quickly and effectively to crossings and improve our awareness of facilitators’ activity in the Channel. We continue to evaluate and test a range of safe and legal options to find ways of stopping small boats making this dangerous and unnecessary journey. 22. Without these continued efforts, illicit migration would risk our sovereign border control, a loss of public confidence, and greater threat to life at sea. The UK 2025 Border Security Strategy sets out our commitments to saving lives and ensuring fair immigration policies. In the maritime environment, it is essential we have the capability to understand our environment through world leading MDA which will enable us to respond to those in need. 49 National Strategy for Maritime Security Responding to threats Threats from Terrorism 23. Terrorists continue to pose a threat to maritime security. The terrorist threat varies significantly across the globe and is highly dependent upon how permissive a region is for terrorists to plan and conduct attacks. Terrorism will remain a major threat over the coming decade, with a more diverse range of material and political causes, new sources of radicalisation and evolving tactics. 24. Government’s work on Maritime Counter Terrorism (MCT) looks to deliver the UK’s Counter Terrorism Strategy (CONTEST) which has the strategic objective of reducing the risk to the UK and its citizens and interests overseas from terrorism, so that our people can go about their lives freely and with confidence. 25. As well as being able to identify and respond to the recent diverse, low sophistication attack methodologies the UK must also remain prepared for complex or highly destructive attacks. To date we have worked to ensure that no major maritime terrorist incidents have occurred in or near UK seas. However, the UK must continue to prepare for a range of scenarios. 26. MCT is a whole of government endeavour, requiring contributions from a range of departments and operational partners, including Police, Counter Terrorism Policing, Defence, the Maritime and Coast Guard Agency, the emergency services and Border Force. Our MCT efforts are coordinated to ensure a collaborative approach to using shared expertise and capabilities to best effect. 27. Government will continue to refine, exercise and improve response plans for terrorist incidents at sea. We will be informed by robust science and technology and engage with industry to raise awareness of risks from terrorism, counter terrorism protective measures, and associated response plans, including among companies operating both UK and internationally flagged vessels. Government will continue to work closely with maritime neighbours and other European partners to establish and build on agreements to ensure we minimise the risk of terrorist activity near to UK shores – such as the UK-France Maritime Security Treaty which was signed in July 2021, to work closer together, share expertise and intelligence and conduct exercising. Government will continue working to ensure we can maximise the opportunities delivered by the UK-France Treaty once it is ratified. 28. Counter terrorism is a reserved matter but there are elements of the government’s MCT work which require collaboration with Devolved Administrations. We will continue to work closely with our colleagues in the Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Ireland administrations to ensure the specific interests and structures in those areas are appropriately reflected. 50 National Strategy for Maritime Security Responding to threats State Threats 29. As the Integrated Review sets out, we are seeing the move to a more competitive and multipolar world; one in which there is an intensification of competition between states and with non-state actors. States are becoming increasingly assertive in how they compete to advance their objectives and, in their willingness, to undermine ours. 30. State threats are persistent and take many forms including espionage, sabotage, cyber operations, and intellectual property and data theft. An increasing number of states now have the capability to undertake isolated attacks or use a range of threats to interfere with our security, economy, and society. 31. In the maritime domain, states may look to sabotage our key infrastructure, disrupt logistical and economic supply chains, or obstruct freedom of navigation. Recent state-backed attacks on commercial shipping have shown the challenges faced by the maritime industry in protecting both ships and seafarers. The attack on the MV MERCER STREET in July 2021 was attributed to Iran and demonstrates some of the capabilities available to states and non-state actors to target commercial shipping, risking the lives of seafarers. 32. Government will work with allies in relentlessly pursuing attribution and exposure of evidence in response to unacceptable state threats. The Royal Navy will deter state aggression by, for example, shadowing vessels transiting our territorial sea to ensure they comply with international law. The UK will continue to work with international partners to manage the risks posed by state actors. The UK is a key player in the International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC) which operates in the Gulf and reassures commercial shipping, provides deterrence against malign activity, and promotes freedom of navigation. We will continue to work with our allies and like-minded partners to collaborate and promote our mutual interests, so that together we are more resilient, and our collective response is greater than the sum of its parts. 51 National Strategy for Maritime Security Responding to threats Image: The Type 45 destroyer HMS Duncan in the foreground escorting a tanker through the Strait of Hormuz. HMS Duncan is supported by HMS Montrose in escorting the tanker. The International Maritime Security Construct The International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC) and Coalition Task Force (CTF) SENTINEL, was established in July 2019 in response to a heightened threat to freedom of navigation and free flow of trade in the Middle East. The UK has played a pivotal role in the formation and sustainment of IMSC using naval assets based at the Naval Support Facility in the Kingdom of Bahrain and the provision of Royal Navy staff, including a 1* Commander. In the IMSC, the UK is partnered with Albania, Estonia, Lithuania, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, The United Arab Emirates, and the US. The IMSC Mission provides reassurance to shipping and deters state sponsored malign activities, paying particular attention to the two strategic maritime choke points of the Bab Al Mandeb (in the Southern Red Sea) and the Strait of Hormuz. The IMSC’s state-facing posture sets it apart from other maritime security initiatives and task forces in the region, and it has built a considerable rapport with the global shipping industry and regional coalition members. Ultimately, the IMSC aims to preserve freedom of navigation and uphold the rule of law, to support free flow of trade on which our economy depends. 52 National Strategy for Maritime Security Responding to threats Foreign Direct Investment 33. The UK has a world-leading reputation for being an attractive place to invest, in large part due to the openness, transparency, and stability of our economy. Whilst both the UK and our foreign partners enjoy the mutual benefits of international trade, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into UK infrastructure and assets (including intellectual property) also has the potential to expose the UK to increased national security risk. Through investment, foreign states may be able to influence decision- making within key transport assets in ways that may run contrary to the UK’s national security. 34. In order to address risks posed by certain FDI, the National Security and Investment Act 2021 (NSI) seeks to protect the public whilst bolstering the UK’s status as an attractive place to invest. The NSI Act provides more efficient clearance processes for relevant acquisitions and greater certainty and transparency for investors and businesses. The Act also grants the Business Secretary ‘call in’ powers, allowing transactions to be reviewed – and if necessary blocked - on the basis of national security. The Act commenced on 4 January 2022, granting the Secretary of State with retrospective call-in powers for any relevant transactions completed on or after 12 November 2020. 35. The government is committed to developing a resilient and sustainable maritime sector, able to manage and mitigate malign foreign interference and hostile behaviour in all forms. The Maritime Sector and the National Security and Investment Act A healthy and secure maritime sector is essential to keep the country moving and therefore the government has ensured that critical UK port and maritime infrastructure are protected under the new NSI Act. In particular, investment into ports and harbours that handle at least one million tonnes of cargo per year will be in scope of the Act’s ‘mandatory notification’ regime – meaning any new acquirer(s) within this sector will have to inform the government of the details of the acquisition, if statutory thresholds are met. Should national security concerns regarding the acquisition come to light, the legislation allows the government to impose conditions or block or unwind acquisitions. 53 National Strategy for Maritime Security Responding to threats Objective 3: Ensuring prosperity Ensuring the security of international shipping, the unimpeded transmission of goods, information, and energy to support continued global development and our economic prosperity, government will: • Work with international partners to tackle Organised Criminal Groups (OCGs), piracy and other forms of criminal activity which threaten global prosperity. • Monitor chokepoints and strategic seaways to ensure the free movement of goods and trade. • Create a robust, secure, and diverse system to protect essential subsea infrastructure. 1. UK and global prosperity depend on the safe and secure international passage of goods, information, and energy moved by sea. Reliable and timely importation processes form the bedrock of the UK’s national economy and national security. 54 National Strategy for Maritime Security Ensuring prosperity Image: Front view of laden container ship moving at sea. 55 2. Government is committed to using agility and speed of action to enable us to deliver for our citizens, enhancing our prosperity and security. We will continue to transform the way government collects and uses border data to improve the security and resilience of the border and at our ports. This work will ensure improved data is used to contribute to a cross-Government performance framework that will allow for more effective monitoring of threats and risks to the border over time. 3. To support the prosperity of global trade routes we will use this data and the range of our capabilities to tackle the threats facing the essential transnational networks. Ship Security 4. Ships are conveying the vast majority of UK trade and many of our vital resources. UK ships, along with international shipping fleets, are strategic assets in maintaining domestic and international trade. The UK considers protection for ships at home and abroad and provisions of maritime security measures will enable us to strengthen and extend UK’s prosperity, security, and resilience. 5. Through the implementation of ISPS code in UK law, protection of ships is maintained by providing a standardised, consistent framework for evaluating risk. This enables the Government adopt develop new procedures and guidance as threats change. 6. Government will continue to support shipping communities in implementing the ISPS code for all UK-registered ships, making security inspections of foreign vessels in UK ports, handling ship security alerts, and approving and auditing the training providers for Ship Security Officer (SSO) and Company Security Officer (CSO) courses. 7. As the international security risks evolve, the Government, through regular evidence-based guidance, will help ship owners, operators (companies), masters and seafarers understand the risks posed by piracy, armed robbery, and other acts of violence against merchant shipping. 56 National Strategy for Maritime Security Ensuring prosperity Image: Container ship docked at port. Preventing Maritime Crime 8. SOC will continue to have a significant impact on UK citizens, with the scale and complexity of the issues facing government continuing to change. OCGs will continue to be transnational, with criminals from overseas sourcing illicit goods, exploiting the vulnerable and defrauding UK citizens and businesses. 9. Maritime routes continue to be some of the most attractive opportunities for OCGs to undertake a range of criminal activity. Without the use of the ocean OCGs would be unable to operate in the way that they do, and the vast profits that they make from illegal activity would be greatly reduced. 10. In order to traffic commodities between continents, OCGs purchase specific vessels or exploit legitimate cargo vessels. Yachts, fishing vessels and semi- submersible vessels are also all used to traffic across the ocean. Drugs, firearms, and tobacco will be hidden within containers, in void spaces, or specially constructed concealments within the vessels. These highly sophisticated operations can involve drugs being handed over at sea, well outside of the Territorial Sea to avoid detection by law enforcement. National Strategy for Maritime Security Ensuring prosperity 57 Image: Aerial photograph of laden container ship manoeuvring at the dock side with the assistance of tugboats. Case study: Project Latitude Smuggling by sea is recognised as a key threat within the National Strategic Assessment of Serious and Organised Crime and is a consistent part of the maritime threat and response. Work undertaken jointly by the Home Office and National Crime Agency. in countering this threat has resulted, since January 2019, in the seizure of over 60t of cocaine from a total of 25 tasked jobs/ships. Of the seized cocaine, 40t were from commercial vessels whilst 14.8t were from pleasure vessels. 5 out of 25 interdicted vessels listed were UK flagged. These operations highlight the significance of countering maritime crime, as many of the seized goods would have been destined for the UK and ending in the hands of OCGs. Additionally, given the flagging of the vessels and the ability of law enforcement to seize and detain, ships facilitating illicit activities, further highlights the importance of international cooperation and partnerships in tackling maritime crime. 58 Image: HMS Tamar and HMS Spey offshore patrol vessels alongside at HMNB Portsmouth. Case study: SY G.SIRO As the result of a joint operation involving the Portuguese, Spanish, UK and US authorities, the Portuguese deployed a navy surface asset and successfully located and interdicted the SY G.SIRO (Spanish flag), 23.44 metre sailing yacht approx. 350nm West of Lisbon, with 3 crew members aboard and a total of 5.2 tonnes of cocaine found aboard. It is likely that a proportion of the drugs destined for Europe would end up on UK shores and in the hands of OCGs. This highlights the importance of international cooperation and partnerships in tackling International Maritime Crime. 5959 11. The trafficking of drugs, people, and other illicit commodities in the maritime domain is often linked to corrupt crew members who are vulnerable to exploitation, port workers and others involved in the maritime industry to facilitate its entry into the UK and international ports. 12. Government works closely with neighbours and international partners to tackle SOC in the maritime domain. Our collaboration involves disrupting national security threats such as drug trafficking, firearms trafficking, people smuggling and human trafficking through working with the Maritime Analysis Operations Centre-Narcotics, EU SEACOP29 and other bilateral or multilateral organisations. Government will continue to explore new opportunities to work with international partners to tackle SOC. Countering Piracy and Armed Robbery 13. Piracy30 impacts global prosperity by disrupting the flow of goods and people by sea. Piracy is generally associated with less developed or unstable coastal nations which may have suffered civil strife or conflict. Such conditions are breeding grounds for OCGs who take advantage of vulnerable local communities to undertake a range of criminal activities. 14. In 2011, Somalia was the focal point for global piracy with 300 piracy incidents occurring in that year alone. The UK played a leading role in the international effort to suppress piracy from Somalia. While incidents have greatly reduced, we believe OCGs have focused on other types of crime. The current global hotspot for piracy is in the Gulf of Guinea where pirates use firearms to attempt to kidnap crew and hold them to ransom, hijack vessels, or take their cargo. In South East Asia and the Gulf of Mexico, piracy takes the form of petty theft from ships close to the shore. These incidents can have a serious impact on the operations of a vessel and the livelihoods of seafarers. 15. Government’s approach to counter piracy focuses on a combination of detection via improved global MDA and a concerted international naval response to disrupt the criminal networks. This sits alongside diplomatic engagement to support international institutions and frameworks. Government will continue to engage in the Djibouti Code of Conduct and the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia, Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP) and other international fora. 60 National Strategy for Maritime Security Ensuring prosperity Image: Aerial view of HMS Lancaster moving through open ocean in the Gulf of Guinea off the coast of West Africa. 16. Government will work multilaterally and bilaterally to support regional countries in the fight against cross-border maritime crime and piracy with a focus on legal frameworks to facilitate prosecutions, development of Maritime Domain Awareness, and capability building for navies and coastguards. 17. Government will take a leading role in developing multilateral engagement. For example, through our Dialogue Partner Status of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and in the G7++ Friends of Gulf of Guinea.

Chokepoints constitute narrow channels along widely used global sea routes; some are so narrow that restrictions are placed on the size of the vessel that can navigate through them. Restrictions may be placed upon vessels by the channel operators (e.g. Suez Canal) or by governments whose territorial seas the route intersects (e.g. Strait of Hormuz). 19. Strategic seaways such as Gulf of Guinea and Cape of Good Hope are also essential trade routes. Congested channels and operational restriction can reduce the speed or manoeuvrability of vessels transiting, making them vulnerable to attack from pirates, terrorists, state threats, or OCGs. 20. While most chokepoints can be circumvented, this normally leads to significant additional transit times. In some cases, such as the Strait of Hormuz, no practical alternatives are available. 21. To ensure global trade routes and chokepoints are freely navigable, the UK will work to ensure compliance by other states with UNCLOS. We will work with international partners to maintain and build consensus for an open and stable maritime domain. 22. Government is committed to supporting the maritime sector transiting through the High-Risk Area (HRA).33 The work of the UK Maritime Trade Organisation (UKMTO) delivers timely maritime security information and supports engagement with military forces in the region. 23. As the ice melts in the seas of the High North, new shipping routes emerge. As the North-East and North-West passages become more traversable, potential trade and shipping lines once thought impassable will open up. These new routes will require government action, taken in accordance with UNCLOS, to provide security, alleviate SOLAS concerns, ensure navigational rights are upheld, and address risks to the fragile marine environment. 24. The UK will enhance its understanding of the reliance of international shipping on chokepoints and strategic seaways, and work with partners to keep these supply routes open. 63 National Strategy for Maritime Security Ensuring prosperity Maritime choke points National Strategy for Maritime Security Chapter 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Panama Canal The 44nm Panama Canal links the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and avoids the hazardous Cape Horn route around the tip of South America. Around 15,000 vessels transit each year through the system of locks which make up the canal. Strait of Gibraltar The Strait of Gibraltar separates the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean and, at its narrowest point of 7nm separates Europe from North Africa. Strait of Bosporus (Turkish Strait) The Turkish Strait, which includes the Bosporus and Dardanelles waterways divides Asia from Europe and links the Black Sea to the Mediterranean carrying 48,000 vessels per year. It is an important transit corridor for oil exporting countries in the Black Sea (c. 2.4M barrels pe day). Suez Canal The Egyptian-controlled Suez Canal links the Mediterranean Sea with the Arabian and Indian Oceans. It is a key transit corridor for global trade – especially energy shipments between Europe and North America and the Middle East Europe. It also links manufacturing Asian economies with Europe. Strait of Hormuz The Strait of Hormuz links the Arabian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and is the world’s most important energy chokepoint with 30% of all seaborne-traded oil (and products) and 30% of natural gas transiting through. The Strait is 21nm wide at its narrowest point and encroaches into Omani and Iranian waters. Strait of Bab al-Mandab The Bab el-Mandeb Strait connects the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea. It’s 15nm wide at its narrowest point and sees 21,000 vessels annually pass through and 4.6M barrels of oil/day. Cape of Good Hope The Cape of Good Hope lies on the tip of Africa and is an important transit route for Global shipping. It can serve as an alternative roue for the Suez canal but adds around 15 days for European transits and 8-10 for the United States. Strait of Malacca The Strait of Malacca is the main shipping channel between the Indian and Pacific Ocean, linking the major economies of Asia. It is also a key arterial route between Europe and the Far East. Approximately 60% of the world’s maritime trade transits this corridor. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 PgX Figure 8: Map showing some strategic seaways and chokepoints around the world, taken from Integrated Review: The defence tilt to the Indo-Pacific.34 64 Ensuring prosperityNational Strategy for Maritime Security Image: The container ship Ever Given stuck in the Suez Canal in Egypt, viewed from the International Space Station 2021, NASA JSC ISS Image library. Case Study – The MV EVERGIVEN disruption to a strategic chokepoint The EVERGIVEN was loaded with c17,600 containers, carrying roughly $1 billion worth of cargo, when it went aground in the bank of Suez Cana in March 2021. The ship was unable to free itself and an operation was taken to free the ship and open the Suez up to traffic. By the end of the first day, 185 vessels were anchored nearby at the terminations of the Canal, unable to commence their transit. Amongst their diverse cargoes, these vessels were carrying electronics, cement, water, millions of barrels of oil, and several thousand head of livestock. It was estimated that US$10 billion worth of marine traffic per day was piling up. After six days the EVERGIVEN was freed but clearing the shipping backlog took a further six days. The time for some ports to resume normal operations took more than a month following the clearance of the EVERGIVEN. Between 10-12% of global trade passes through the Suez Canal with more than 50 vessels transiting it a day. A prolonged closure of Suez risked a cascade of delays that would be felt in day-to-day commerce by millions of people. A vessel missing its scheduled arrival at a terminal in New Jersey, for example, would not just create a problem for the American companies waiting for its cargo. It would also mean a backlog of all the containers the ship was supposed to pick up for export. Meanwhile, factories in China relying on the same vessel to pick up their goods weeks later, would require alternative options-which, given the disruption, might not exist. While this incident was not as a result of a security incident, the resulting delays to maritime trade from the EVERGIVEN incident highlight the vulnerabilities of strategic chokepoints to the security and resilience of the global supply chain. 65 Protecting Subsea Infrastructure 25. Chokepoints, strategic seaways, and congested waterways do not just affect surface traffic. Traditional maritime choke points, such as the Suez Canal, create similar constraints for subsea communication cables. Cables are further constrained geographically due to the limited number of suitable landing points. Figure 9: Cropped section of the Submarine Cable Map 2021, showing the intercontinental subsea cables connected to the UK and North Western Europe. 26. Subsea cables are essential to our modern way of life, providing communications that support the internet and energy connectivity which distributes electricity across markets. Both essential functions support our modern industries and global connectivity and contribute towards Net Zero. £545 bn of Gross Value Added (GVA) per annum is associated with UK exports relying on subsea cables. 66 National Strategy for Maritime Security Ensuring prosperity 27. Whilst subsea communications cables are privately owned and operated, the government regards UK linked cables as part of the UK’s critical international connectivity and infrastructure. Accidental damage caused by fishing, particularly trawling and other seabed-disturbing activities, remains the primary threat to subsea cables. The importance of cables to our way of life also requires security awareness against concerns of potential disruption by malign actors. A significant loss of subsea cables could be felt by everyone in the UK. The impact would directly affect the UK’s communications and internet-based services, as well as financial traffic. of all global communications transmitted via subsea communication cables.35 of foreign exchange cross-border trading takes place per day using the UK’s subsea fibre optic cables.36 A transatlantic telecommunications cable using the latest technology has a capacity of 250 million Megabits per second.37 28. To ensure the UK is well-positioned to provide a secure yet attractive hub for subsea data cables and retain expertise to support the modern digital economy, Government will re-evaluate its regulatory framework to support the continued security, resilience, and integrity of critical UK communications. This will include our ability to deploy timely maintenance and repairs of our subsea infrastructure. 29. The new MoD Multi-Role Ocean Surveillance (MROS) programme will play a vital and versatile role in protecting the integrity of the UK’s Maritime zones and critical undersea infrastructure. It will harness remotely piloted capabilities and form a key capability in managing modern subsea challenges, which continues to be coordinated at a cross-government level. 30. Government will endeavour to attract cable owner-operators by aligning strategically with key allies and markets. We will realise benefits from an effective and proportionate regulatory and legislative environment, and ensure protection to critical subsea infrastructure. 67 National Strategy for Maritime Security Ensuring prosperity The British Flag 31. International law requires that every merchant ship be registered in a country, called its flag state. A ship is subject to the law of its flag state. The Red Ensign Group (REG) is the group of British Shipping Registries. Any vessel registered in the UK, a Crown Dependency or UK Overseas Territory, is a “British ship” and is entitled to fly the Red Ensign flag. The Red Ensign flag is recognised globally for the maintenance of high standards, maritime safety, and the welfare of seafarers. 32. The government is responsible for the safety and security of UK flagged vessels globally. This requires using the full range of security and defence capabilities to produce expert guidance and geographic security level information. This allows shipping operators to develop informed risk assessments and effective mitigations during operational activity. 33. Government and our international consular services support UK flagged shipping should a security situation or event occur. Our diplomatic activity continues to support the right of merchant shipping to carry out commercial activities free from violence or aggression. The Royal Navy maintains a global presence and is active in deterring malign activity in regional hotspots. The Red Ensign flag is recognised globally for the maintenance of high standards, maritime safety, and the welfare of seafarers. 68 National Strategy for Maritime Security Ensuring prosperity Image: Aerial view of a fully ladened container ship travelling in open ocean. Case Study: International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) is an intergovernmental organisation created by the mandate of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. UNCLOS plays a central role in establishing what is required of flag States. In a 2015 Advisory Opinion, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea determined that UNCLOS placed flag States under a ‘due diligence’ obligation to take all necessary measures to prevent illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing by vessels flying their flag. However, while the Advisory Opinion was concerned with IUU fishing, the principles it identified and applied are relevant to the responsibility of flag States more broadly. The conclusion reached by ITLOS flowed from the obligation that UNCLOS places on flag States to effectively exercise their jurisdiction and control in administrative, technical, and social matters over ships flying their flag. In fulfilling that obligation, UNCLOS also requires flag States to take such measures as are necessary to ensure safety at sea with regard to a wide range of matters, including, for example, the prevention of collisions. When the flag State is alleged to have failed properly to exercise jurisdiction and control it must investigate and, if appropriate, take any action necessary to remedy the situation. 69 34. With international partners, we will continue to maintain our contribution to maritime security and freedom of navigation on a global scale wherever possible. Our national resources outside of UK waters will be focused on safeguarding Red Ensign Group flagged passenger and cargo ships and UK trade. Security compliance of the UK-flagged commercial cargo fleet is undertaken by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA). As part of this security compliance programme, the MCA provides the communication infrastructure for the receipt of Ship Security Alerts and undertakes inspections of overseas ships arriving in UK ports. 35. Government also encourages other nations to adopt the highest required standards. So-called ‘Flags of Convenience’ is the term often used to describe Open Registries – registries that allow ship owners of other nationalities to flag and operate ships under their flag and offer commercial advantages such as an attractive fiscal regime, substantially lower administrative fees, more accessibility to the registry, and lower costs for the ship owners. The record of compliance with international conventions by vessels on open registers is not significantly worse than that of vessels on other registries. 36. Article 94 of UNCLOS requires the flag State to “effectively exercise its jurisdiction and control in administrative, technical and social matters;” many of these matters are regulated by international conventions adopted through the IMO. 37. In response to Article 94 of UNCLOS the international maritime community has established a regime known as Port State Control, whereby a country can inspect foreign flagged vessels in their waters. Several regional regimes are in place such as the Paris memorandum of understanding and the Tokyo memorandum of understanding. Under these memoranda of understanding, the Maritime Administrations check that vessels entering their ports comply with the major IMO Conventions. 70 National Strategy for Maritime Security Ensuring prosperity Image: Red Ensign flag blowing in the wind. 38. For vessels which do not comply with these international conventions, there is potentially a significant sanction, which can ultimately lead to the exclusion of the vessel from all the ports in the region covered by the Memorandum of Understanding. 39. The IMO has a system for auditing the implementation by Member States of their obligations under the key IMO instrument. The UK will continue to support compliance of flag state obligations and port state control measures and will work closely with the IMO to encourage these high standards to prevail across all administrations. Government takes this responsibility seriously and the UK (and British Registries of the Red Ensign Group) have recently been successfully audited by the IMO. 71 National Strategy for Maritime Security Ensuring prosperity Objective 4: Championing our values Championing the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea as the legal framework within which all activities in the ocean and seas are carried out, government will: • Reinforce maritime international architecture by promoting and defending UNCLOS as the legal framework within which all activities in the ocean and seas are carried out • Work with allies, partners, and multilateral institutions to maintain a free, open, and secure Indo-Pacific. • Lead by example to champion free trade and global cooperation to limit instability on the world’s ocean. 1. While the bulk of our security focus will remain on the protection of our homeland and vital trade, the future success of Global Britain requires us to work with likeminded nations to champion the values which support our nation and the international order. 2. We will look to work bilaterally and with multilateral institutions such as, for example, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to promote a renewed commitment by the UK as a force for good in the world. We will defend the international order, this is particularly important at a time where state based competition is increasing. 72 National Strategy for Maritime Security Championing our values Image: HMS Protector viewed from its Quad Copter as it makes it way through Ice filled seas.

The UK, the US, and Australia signed the AUKUS agreement in 2022 to embark on developing a nuclear-powered conventionally armed submarine capability for the Royal Australian Navy, and to enhance our Advanced Capabilities. 4. Government is prepared to be bold, taking robust action to support the UK’s values and tackle coercion or aggression across the globe. In responding to Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine government has implemented some of the most restrictive sanctions. Demonstrating the will to stand against those who threaten the international order and values which the UK defends. Supporting and Defending UNCLOS 5. Government seeks to support, defend, and uphold UNCLOS in all its dimensions, as an essential enabler of global prosperity, security, and a healthy planet. The convention sets out the rules with which all activities must comply. Complying with the rights and obligations set out in UNCLOS can help ensure that activity on the world’s ocean supports prosperity, security, and sustainability. 6. This commitment is a common endeavour of the international community as demonstrated by the establishment and membership of the Group of Friends38 of UNCLOS. The Group of Friends will provide an opportunity to further the international community’s joint understanding of, and commitment to upholding the Convention. 7. Government will continue to uphold the universal and unified character of UNCLOS and reaffirm its important role in setting out the legal framework that governs all activities in the ocean and seas. We will continue to play a key role in developing and implementing Security Council Resolutions concerning maritime issues such as piracy and the enforcement of sanctions at sea. Government will continue to support the IMO and seek to provide resource and capability to its international mission. 8. Government will continue to play a central role in discussions on ocean issues at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), and IMO, defending and advocating for UNCLOS. National Strategy for Maritime Security Championing our values 74 Case Study: Maintaining the Freedom of Navigation in a Strategic Chokepoint While threats to Freedom of Navigation commonly take the form of excessive geographical or jurisdictional claims, in relation to the world’s key maritime chokepoints the threat may also be physical. The Strait of Hormuz which connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman, is a key route for all shipping both in and out of the Gulf area. All ships have a right to transit passage through the Strait, in accordance with UNCLOS, along the internationally recognised traffic separation scheme. The Persian Gulf remains an economic centre of gravity with up to 20 million barrels of oil and 3.5 billion cubic feet of Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) passing through the Strait of Hormuz daily – representing over 20% of worldwide trade. At its narrowest point with the traffic separation scheme passes through the territorial sea of Oman. For relatively little cost, transit through the Strait has previously been and could again be denied for some considerable time by state or non-state actors. Similar effects would be felt under increased tensions or in conflict, and whether the Strait was physically blocked or only threatened. Such disruption would have a profound effect on world oil and gas prices and many economies: HM Treasury analysis predicts that a 30-day closure of the Strait of Hormuz would have an impact on the global economy lasting at least four years. Consequently, it is a key strategic chokepoint, not only for the countries of the region, but globally – and freedom of navigation for all ships must be maintained. In order to mitigate this risk, to deter attempts to disrupt the Strait, and to maintain freedom of navigation to and from the Gulf, the UK operates in the region under the non-state facing Combined Maritime Forces, the IMSC and under UK National tasking. Since 2006 the Royal Navy has maintained four forward-deployed Mine Countermeasure Vessels (MCMVs) operating out of Bahrain and, since 2019, has also forward deployed a Type 23 Frigate to the region. This expeditionary force, supported by a ship from the Royal Fleet Auxiliary and Command and Control element, now housed in its own bespoke facility and built with assistance from the Kingdom of Bahrain, is part of the international effort to maintain the security of the region for all mariners, commercial or other. The success of this effort continues to be dependent on wider political engagement and whole-of-government activity across the region, including intelligence and information sharing. 75 Championing our valuesNational Strategy for Maritime Security Freedom of navigation 9. Freedom of navigation is the term given to the group of passage rights and freedoms that all states enjoy, and these rights are utilised by vessels of those states in navigating on, over, or under the world’s ocean and seas. Freedom of navigation is vital to the security and economic stability of the UK. Upholding freedom of navigation facilitates global maritime trade and provides the UK military and law enforcement and intelligence agencies with the legal landscape to allow it to respond to threats to security at range. 10. These rights are set out in UNCLOS and so maintaining the integrity of the convention and its consistent implementation is central to upholding freedom of navigation. The stability of the UNCLOS regime, and in consequence maritime security, may be fundamentally undermined by excessive claims over sea areas or unlawful interferences with navigational rights and freedoms. The UK will continue to challenge attempts to limit our freedom of navigation. 11. Government will look to support freedom of navigation through increasing our maritime presence in the Indo-Pacific region by deploying two Offshore Patrol Vessels from 2021, a Littoral Response Group from 2023 and a Type 31 Frigate later in the decade. Elsewhere, Offshore Patrol Vessels will be forward deployed to the South Atlantic and Caribbean and will maintain a presence in the Mediterranean and African Coast. Government will deploy our full range of capabilities to defend free trade, freedom of navigation and the International Order. 76 National Strategy for Maritime Security Championing our values 8 Ships 4 Ships £220m Defence: 8 Ships permanently attributed to NATO39 Defence: 4 Ships leading Baltic Protector under NATO40 Defence: Over £220m class A-C narcotics seized (2020-2021)41 Royal Navy Ships crossed every single line of longitude in 2021 In 2021, the Royal Navy assigned: the Continuous at Sea Deterrent, a Carrier Strike Group and Littoral Strike Group capabilities to NATO (Unique amongst European NATO members) 77 National Strategy for Maritime Security Championing our values National Strategy for Maritime Security Chapter 8 National Strategy for Maritime Security Chapter 8 Why the South China Sea matters Linking East and West The South China Sea covers 1.4 million square miles, and is the main global shipping route between the Pacific and Indian Oceans, through the strategically important Straits of Malacca. Global Maritime Trade42 60% of all global maritime trade passes through Asia: of that, one third passes through the South China Sea. This is worth over £2.33 trillion annually, which equates to 2.5% of the entire global economy. Global Britain43 The UK is a maritime trading nation, with commercial interests worldwide. We are reliant upon the South China Sea for over £91 billion worth of imports & exports passing through it every year - 12% of total UK seabourne trade. 78 Championing our valuesNational Strategy for Maritime Security Indo-Pacific Tilt 12. The UK is now investing greater and enduring effort in the Indo-Pacific as part of our recognition of the importance of this region to the UK in the Integrated Review. Our goal is to be the European partner with the broadest and most integrated presence in the Indo-Pacific, committed for the long-term, with closer and deeper partnerships both bilaterally and multi-laterally. 13. The government already has strong ties to the region. There are vital trade routes from East and South East Asia which support the global economy. However, the region also contains a number of disputes over contested features, fishing, or mining rights. Government is committed to supporting freedom of navigation and for disputes to be settled in accordance with UNCLOS through established international legal routes. 14. Sustainable development and maritime security are closely linked in this region – our £500m Blue Planet Fund44 will help support developing countries in the Indo- Pacific protect and sustainably use vital marine resources and help mitigate and build resilience to climate change and reduce poverty. We will promote timely information sharing and associated data exchange through our established MDA programme and liaison networks based in Maritime Fusion Centres in the Seychelles, India, and Singapore. 15. Following a Summit between Prime Ministers of the UK and India in 2021, the two countries agreed to enter into a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and agreed the UK/India 2030 Roadmap. The importance of our defence and security relationship, including in maritime security, was reaffirmed by the Leaders during the PM’s visit to India in April 2022. The Roadmap will increase maritime cooperation and coordination through the agreed Western Indian Ocean Partnership, a Maritime Dialogue and increase engagement with the Indian Ocean Rim Association. It also supports long-term technological collaboration, joint capability development and enhances training opportunities. The UK and India have agreed to closer maritime co-operation in the Indo-Pacific. The UK will join India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative and become lead partner for the maritime security pillar, including coordinating work with key partners in Southeast Asia. The UK shares many of the same opportunities and challenges as maritime nations in Southeast Asia. We strongly support ASEAN’s Outlook on the Indo-Pacific and the areas of enhanced maritime cooperation that the framework provides. 16. We will use our new Dialogue Partnership with ASEAN to further strengthen maritime cooperation in Southeast Asia and help build the capabilities of member 79 National Strategy for Maritime Security Championing our values states through education, training and exercising. The Quad (Australia, India, Japan, and the US) has identified maritime security as one of its priorities, and the UK will seek ways to support these important partners in their maritime security activity, bilaterally, trilaterally, and potentially collectively. 17. Government will increase our capacity building and training offer to Indo-Pacific States through longer and more consistent military deployments. Building on the legacy of substantial defence engagement by the Carrier Strike Group (CSG) in 2021, the UK has permanently assigned two of the Royal Navy’s newest and greenest warships, to the Indo-Pacific. These vessels will be followed by a Royal Navy Littoral Response Group in 2023, and a Type 31 Royal Navy Frigate later in the decade. Case Study: Defending UNCLOS in the South China Sea A stable and secure South China Sea (SCS) is vital to the UK’s interests in the Indo-Pacific. Our longstanding position is that we take no sides in the sovereignty disputes. Our commitment is to international law, in particular UNCLOS, and to freedom of navigation and overflight. We will uphold the rights and freedoms under UNCLOS, including the rights of littoral States in their EEZs. The UK will use a range of tools to promote and defend UNCLOS. In September 2020, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office’s (FCDO) Minister for Asia put our comprehensive legal position on the SCS on public record for the first time, parts of which have been have reiterated in subsequent statements, for example in a joint Note Verbale at the UN in 2020. It is important for the UK, as a leading maritime nation, to make our position clear on these issues. Where we have specific concerns, including about militarisation, coercion, and intimidation, we continue to raise them. We are working with allies to support ASEAN partners to strengthen regional capacity on maritime law and security. This includes dialogues, training, and conferences. Before the Carrier Srike Group (CSG) deployment in 2021, five Royal Navy ships have navigated the SCS since April 2018 as part of the UK’s consistent presence in the region. These deployments serve to reinforce our commitment to regional security and to upholding UNCLOS.

Environmental Challenges 1. The effects of climate change and environmental crimes at sea pose significant threats. It is essential that these are seen as equal to more immediate, and well understood, security threats. Many of the security challenges identified in this strategy can be a consequence of, or exacerbated by, changes to our climate. 2. There are many areas of government’s activity which support environmental protection, limiting global instability and supporting developing nations. This strategy considers the breaching of the laws, regulations and norms that govern our ocean. 82 National Strategy for Maritime Security Supporting a secure, resilient ocean Image: Mangrove tree roots, above and below the water in the Caribbean Sea, Panama, Central America. 3. Internationally, fisheries, aquaculture, and marine and coastal tourism account for 71% of employment in the global ocean economy.45 These sectors and the millions of livelihoods they support, predominantly in the developing countries, are highly dependent on the marine environment. Human-caused degradation of the seas and ocean from overexploitation, climate change and pollution put these livelihoods at risk and may drive future migration, conflict, and criminal activity. 4. OCGs, among others, play a persistent role in damaging our environment. This may be through illegal fishing which reduces fish stocks and impacts on the livelihoods of those working in coastal communities. Or through the dumping of waste which pollutes the seas putting the livelihood and lives of future generations at risk. These, and many other, sources of insecurity impact on our homeland and our people in a significant way. 5. Rising sea levels through climate change bring into question the extent and location of maritime zones lawfully established under the UNCLOS, creating uncertainty over rights to exploit biological and mineral resources in the sea and on the seabed. Some actors may take advantage of this uncertainty by seeking to exploit resources in areas where there is a lack of clarity as to whether it forms part of an EEZ or can be considered part of the High Seas. Finding solutions to this issue, which are consistent with UNCLOS, is important to ensure the wider integrity of the rules-based order at sea. 83 National Strategy for Maritime Security Supporting a secure, resilient ocean 83 6. The UK has some of the most stringent laws and regulations that govern our seas, providing continued protection of our interests. Government will continue to deliver the regulatory, policy and support frameworks needed to protect our marine environment at home and abroad. Government will seek to continue to build our understanding of the marine environment through investment in science and data to enable improved security. 7. Government will continue to make efforts to secure a positive outcome in UN negotiations for a new legally binding agreement under UNCLOS on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ Agreement). Such an agreement would provide for the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs) in areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ), which is necessary if we want to achieve protection of 30% of the global ocean by 2030 and tackle the impacts of climate change on the ocean. 8. Government will use its £500 million Blue Planet Fund, financed from the UK Official Development Assistance Budget, to help eligible developing countries reduce poverty, protect, and sustainably manage their marine resources and address human-generated threats, including activity to tackle IUU fishing. 9. Major pollution incidents have the potential to impact human activities at sea, people’s livelihoods, and the marine environment. In turn, these impacts risk destabilising countries and diverting important security resources to support the incident. The UK has world-leading technical and scientific expertise to support other governments in managing the risk of a pollution incident and the post- incident response. Government will establish a cross-departmental working group to strengthen the response to international pollution incidents. “The UK’s vision is that by 2030 the ocean will be effectively governed, clean, healthy, safe, productive and biologically diverse, linking resilient and prosperous coastal communities around the world.” Integrated Review 2021 84 National Strategy for Maritime Security Supporting a secure, resilient ocean Image: Aerial view of an oil tanker unloading at port.

Due to ongoing conflict in the region, the vessel has received little maintenance and now poses a significant pollution risk due to deterioration of the vessel’s structural integrity. If the vessel were to break apart the oil on board (estimated to be 1.14 million barrels of oil) would cause a significant impact in the waters of the Red Sea and the coastal communities that border it. As of October 2021, it has been reported that the FSO Safer is at imminent risk of sinking, fire, or explosion. In February 2022, the UN reported that an in-principle agreement was reached to transfer oil and limit the risk the vessel posed. However until the oil is transferred the imminent risk the FSO Safer poses to the environment remains. 85 Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing 10. IUU fishing is a significant contributor to overfishing, which remains one of the most serious threats to the health of the ocean. It depletes fish stocks, distorts competition, and destroys marine habitats. It jeopardises the foundation of international efforts to promote better ocean governance, undermines efforts to manage fisheries properly and can be a key obstacle to achieving environmental sustainability, food security and social stability. 11. It is estimated that IUU fishing activities are responsible for the loss of 11-26 million tonnes of fish each year, with a global value of between $10-23billion a year.46 IUU fishing is connected to a range of unlawful activities including transnational organised fisheries crime, illicit financial activity, and human rights abuses. Fraud and lack of traceability in the supply chain are central means of enabling the laundering of illegal marine products. 12. It is imperative that measures are strengthened to tackle IUU fishing in order to support the UK’s own global maritime security. Acknowledging the threat that IUU fishing poses globally, it is vital that the UK takes a strong participatory and influential role bilaterally and within international forums. Government is committed to being a world leader in the delivery of a sustainable, ecosystem approach to fisheries by working with key partners to deliver the UN’s’ Sustainable Development Goal 14.4 to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing. 13. Government will continue to participate in forums such as International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol), the North Atlantic Fisheries Intelligence Group (NAFIG), and the Five Eyes group to share vital intelligence towards tackling fisheries crime and supporting the UK’s maritime security approach. 86 National Strategy for Maritime Security Supporting a secure, resilient ocean Image: A blonde fur seal coming out of the water in Stromness Bay, South Georgia, taken by crew of HMS Endurance. Case Study: Blue Belt Programme – combatting IUU fishing across UK Overseas Territories The FCDO funded Blue Belt Programme protects over four million square kilometres of marine environment across the UK OT. Key to the Programme’s work is ensuring that these remote and unique environments are protected from the threat of IUU fishing. This is at its highest in the remote outer edges of the UK OTs’ maritime zones, where vessels in the surrounding high seas may enter and fish illegally. To prevent illegal fishing activity, a range of monitoring, compliance and enforcement techniques are employed. A standout example of this work in action is the interception of the MV NIKA, which was suspected of fishing illegally in the South Atlantic in 2019. South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands worked with international partners, including Interpol, and were assisted by the Blue Belt team, to initiate the vessel’s seizure and successful prosecution by Indonesia. It was added to the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) contracting party IUU vessel list and de-flagged by Panama. 8787 Image: Trawlers leaving Brixham Harbour Devon. 14. Government will publish a new national plan dedicated to tackling IUU fishing in 2022 and implement it over the next five years. 15. Government will play an active role in Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), Regional Fisheries Management Organisations, Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, and International Maritime Organisation to strengthen measures in preventing and deterring IUU fishing. 16. Government will continue to push internationally for the elimination of subsidies that enable IUU fishing. National Strategy for Maritime Security Supporting a secure, resilient ocean 88 Fisheries Control and Enforcement 17. As an independent coastal state, the UK has the ability to establish a fisheries management system which can enable our seas to flourish alongside a thriving, sustainable fishing industry. This is in line with the government’s 25-year environment plan,47 which aims to leave the environment in a better state for future generations. 18. The UK’s natural marine capital is abundant; with fish stocks worth £1bn in revenue and a diverse range of marine ecosystems. Our fisheries control and enforcement authorities are the first, most crucial line of defence in protecting these assets from a range of threats, most notably over-exploitation. 19. Our ability to effectively control fishing activity, and take enforcement action where necessary, is critical to achieving this. In addition to existing fisheries control measures, plans to employ proven remote monitoring technologies where appropriate will enhance our ability to assure compliance with regulations and more reliably monitor stock levels. Investment in these technologies, alongside skilled and trained staff, will increase our ability to achieve a high level of fisheries control, as well as our agility in managing fishing activity at a more granular level, based on the best available evidence. This will also enable us to be more flexible and responsive to more extreme effects wrought by climate change. 20. Alongside this, our fisheries enforcement assets provide a strong deterrent and enable authorities to take decisive action where incidents of non-compliance occur. These activities are underpinned by a risk-based and intelligence led strategy, geared at supporting businesses that are fishing sustainably to thrive, whilst protecting our seas from those who would exploit it. 21. Fisheries control and enforcement is a devolved matter. As such the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), and the Devolved Administrations take forward their own policies and procedures but work closely together to share information and ensure a coordinated approach to monitoring, compliance, and enforcement across UK waters. 22. Government will publish a plan dedicated to improving fisheries control and enforcement in 2022 and implement it over the next five years. 89 National Strategy for Maritime Security Supporting a secure, resilient ocean Forward Look 1. To meet the maritime security challenges of the future, government has taken a long-term strategic approach that continues to adapt to a changing international environment. This has been underpinned by Maritime 2050, the Integrated Review, Border Security Strategy 2025 and a range of other thematic strategies. 2. This strategy has set out the UK’s activity over the coming five years. During this period government will work with academia, industry and international institutions to establish a consistent approach to challenges facing the maritime sector. Government will continue to deploy hard security, economic security and our diplomacy to rally international partners and allies. 3. Maritime 2050 set out government’s long term vision for a secure and stable maritime environment. This strategy forms an important part of realising that vision. In addressing the short term risks we must also prepare for the medium to long term challenges facing the UK. 4. Within 24 months, two significant, unexpected challenges have impacted the international system – COVID19 and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. To prepare for future threats, government will horizon scan to anticipate and prepare for new and emerging threats. This will include the shifting geopolitical tensions we have seen emerge in 2022, climate change, and the deployment of new technologies to support the maritime industry. 5. We are seeing shifts in geopolitical dynamics, from Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine to an increasing global focus on the Indo Pacific region. Elsewhere in the world, we are seeing the manifestations of civil unrest and political rivalries which the UK must continue to monitor in order to protect our maritime interests. The coming years will likely see increased attempts by states to destabilise the UK’s maritime interests across the globe. The UK will continue to engage with international forums and allies to monitor and proactively manage these risks. 90 National Strategy for Maritime Security Forward Look Image: Ice patrol ship HMS Protector undertaking ice ramming trials in the arctic circle. 91 6. We must be proactive in recognising and mitigating the long-term impacts of climate change on maritime security. Sea ice retreat will lead to the opening of new trade routes that will present new challenges. For example, in the High North where government is working to maintain the region as one of high cooperation and low tension, maintain a significant contribution to Arctic science, and ensure increasing access to the region and its resources are managed sustainably and responsibly. 7. The erosion of land from rising sea levels is also putting pressure on coastal communities. In Bangladesh, for example, some estimates suggest that a one- metre increase in sea level will reduce land area by 18% and could lead to 25 million refugees.48 The UK will continue to support nations fighting the impacts of climate change and prevent the contributions to maritime insecurity from both a displaced population, and the catastrophic environmental impacts on the ocean that would result. 8. Climate change will also affect the abundance and distribution of marine life. Government will continue to monitor fish production projections to recognise where decreases may exacerbate existing inequalities between developed and developing nations to quickly identify where conflicts over diminished or shifting resources might arise. Against this background of dwindling and migrating fish stocks, demand for fish is increasing due to population and economic growth. This is driving some countries to subsidise their fishing industries to enable them to seek otherwise unprofitable fishing opportunities further afield. This puts further pressure on marine biomass and biodiversity in general, increases IUU fishing and potentially stokes conflict with countries on the other side of the world. The UK must ensure that the short-term commitments in this strategy are twinned with a longer-term outlook that takes these trends into account. 9. The strategy discussed how the UK will work with the maritime sector to strengthen cyber infrastructure to ensure that it is robust against potential attacks. We must also acknowledge that technology is advancing within the maritime space. This includes innovations like the use of autonomy and smart shipping technologies which could lead to fundamental change for the maritime sector, creating new trade opportunities, and a more efficient and sustainable maritime industry. 92 National Strategy for Maritime Security Forward Look 10. As the development of autonomous and remote operations technology continues, there is a need to ensure that UK law keeps pace to ensure the safe, secure, and environmentally sound operation of remotely operated and autonomous vessels. In September 2021, the Department for Transport launched the consultation ‘Future of Transport regulatory review’ to seek views on areas of maritime autonomy regulation that are outdated, a barrier to innovation, or not designed with new technologies and business models in mind. The government response will be published in 2022. 11. The UK will continue to monitor these issues, using science and technology to proactively research and prepare as far as possible. However, we also recognise that, as we have seen over the previous decade, unexpected geopolitical changes and unforeseen threats can emerge rapidly. 12. The maritime domain provides significant opportunities to the UK’s national and international interests, however it also provides many challenges. Through collaboration and proactive engagement with partners government will continue to tackle new and emerging threats to our maritime domain. Maintaining a long-term perspective will help us navigate the path ahead. Those who think they can win through oppression, coercion or invasion are being proved wrong by this new stand on global security – one that not only seeks to deter, but also ensures that aggressors fail.49 93 National Strategy for Maritime Security Forward Look Government activities following publication of the National Strategy for Maritime Security 1. This strategy has set out the key issues and objectives for the UK over the next five years. The different areas of government activity are supported by the strategic objectives set out in this Strategy, within higher level Strategies such as the Integrated Review and Maritime 2050, and the strategies of individual government Departments. This strategy has taken a whole of government approach to align activity. 2. An implementation group will be formed as the vehicle for overseeing the activity set out in this strategy. This group will report to Senior Leaders and Ministers on progress. 3. Government will publish regular reports on the implementation of this strategy, taking into account changes in the risks posed to the UK’s maritime sector and the global threat. Maritime Security Ministerial Small Group (MSMSG): The MSMSG has been formed to provide strategic direction for longer term maritime security initiatives. It will also provide Ministerial oversight across a number of issues as required.

In addition, the UK Fisheries Monitoring and Control Centre is based in Edinburgh and hosted on behalf of the UK by Marine Scotland. Scotland has a separate legal system, in which the Lord Advocate serves as head of the prosecution system and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service is the sole public prosecution service. Police Scotland has responsibility for all water within the 12- mile territorial limit of Scotland. Officers of Police Scotland have equivalent maritime law enforcement powers to those of other UK territorial forces under the Policing and Crime Act 2017 and the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the Chief Constable has operational independence for all matters within Scotland. 104 National Strategy for Maritime Security Annex A: UK Lead Departments with maritime security responsibilities Wales Marine and Fisheries Division The Marine and Fisheries Division (MFD) is a department within the devolved Welsh Government. The MFD co-ordinate a programme for monitoring, control, and surveillance of sea fishing activity. This programme includes similar activities undertaken by the MMO. A Welsh team of Marine Enforcement Officers carries out fisheries protection and enforcement and have a range of assets at their disposal including Fisheries Patrol Vessels. Joint Industry – Government organisations Government works closely with industry on maritime security. A range of engagement, takes place on a regular basis to share knowledge and expertise. The Shipping Defence Advisory Committee is one example of this work. Government will continue this range of engagement and will seek out new opportunities to ensure industry is appropriately supported. Shipping Defence Advisory Council (SDAC) The SDAC is currently an informal body designed to maintain dialogue between the MoD (Navy) and the shipping industry (via the UK Chamber of Shipping (UK CoS)) on maritime security and Defence issues as they relate to the shipping industry. The secondary purpose of the council is to act as the vehicle for industry input into the development of policy and operational practices as they relate to defence and maritime security. The SDAC is co-chaired by the Assistant Chief of Naval Staff and the Chairman of the Chamber of Shipping Defence & Security Committee. Membership includes the Royal Navy, UK CoS, Maritime Industry Representatives, DfT, FCDO and other government departments. Its principal task is to guide defence and security policy, strategy, and when required operational liaison as relates to the shared interests of the MOD and the Shipping Industry. 105 National Strategy for Maritime Security Annex A: UK Lead Departments with maritime security responsibilities Annex B: Glossary AIS Automatic Identification System (AIS) ASEAN Association South East Asian Nations BF Border Force CONTEST Counter Terrorism Strategy CNI Critical National Infrastructure CSG Carrier Strike Group EEZ Exclusive Economic Zone EU European Union FDI Foreign Direct Investment FoN Freedom of Navigation GVA Gross Value Added HRA High Risk Area IMO International Maritime Organization IR Integrated Review IO International Order ITLOS International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea INTERPOL International Criminal Police Organisation ISPS International Shipping and Port Facility Security Code NAFIG North Atlantic Fisheries Intelligence Group NATO North Atlantic Treaty Organisation OCGs Organised Criminal Groups OIC Organised Immigration Crime PFSA Port Facility Security Authority PFSO Port Facility Security Officer 106 National Strategy for Maritime Security Annex B: Glossary ReCAAP Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia SOC Serious and Organised Crime SOLAS Safety of Life at Sea UNCLOS United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 107 National Strategy for Maritime Security Annex B: Glossary References and Clarification 1 Maritime UK.

It has been, and will  continue to be, the lifeblood of our nation’s economy.   Published just over a year ago, the Integrated Review reaffirmed that the  first duty of any government is to protect our people, our homeland, and our  democracy. From a maritime perspective this is about protecting our ports,  shipping routes and subsea infrastructure to ensure the free flow of goods  and information that support our economy. It is about securing the waters of  the UK and our Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies, particularly the  UK Marine Area (UKMA) at home, which encompasses both our Territorial Sea  and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) that surrounds it. We will protect the  maritime domain and use our world-leading capabilities to monitor the seas and  ocean, acting whenever and wherever we need to.   This strategy is being published at a time of increased global tension, Russia’s  illegal war on Ukraine has demonstrated the UK’s pivotal role in supporting an  international order based on rules and principles. The barbarism and war crimes  being committed in Ukraine are the kind of acts that had been consigned to the  history books. The UK will develop our security and economic partnerships to  deter and tackle aggression, coercion, and, oppression wherever it may appear.   The UK will merge hard security and economic security, while building  stronger global alliances to bring to bear the full range of our capabilities in  championing the values that underpin our society. This puts Global Britain into  action, working with international partners and institutions to uphold the UN  Convention on the Law of the Sea including freedom of navigation, maintaining  the international order and building a global network of liberty.  Leaving the European Union has given us the ability to develop policies and  strategies that represent the priorities and values that matter most to the British  people. The National Strategy for Maritime Security captures this. It clearly  defines maritime security and what this means for the UK, recognising the  far-reaching impacts from sources of insecurity on the British people and our  global interests.  It sets strategic objectives and commitments that government will implement  over the next five years and sets out how the implementation of the strategy  will be monitored.  6    This strategy looks at how the UK can continue to strengthen the defences of the  maritime sector, setting out robust, whole system approaches to emerging threats.  Using our strength in security and diplomacy, our economic heft and our will and  agility to lead the way in tackling some of the most challenging problems facing the  international order. It will look forward to identify and mitigate future threats; from, in,  and under the water. It draws on a rigorous evidence base from the UK Maritime Risk  Assessment and incorporates input from industry, academia, and our global partners.  Maritime Security is a whole of government endeavour, but as the five Secretaries  of State responsible for the majority of this activity we are delighted to present this  strategy which sets out the huge range of work planned to ensure the protection of our  nation’s maritime interests.

As an island nation with global interests, the UK has a deep, historic connection to  the seas and the ocean. For centuries, the maritime sector has played a critical role  in the growth and prosperity of the UK by supporting trade and securing the vital  supply routes to keep our nation running. Today, 95% of all goods by weight are  imported or exported by sea18 and 99% of the UK’s international communications  are carried through subsea fibre optic cables.19  2. It is vitally important that the maritime domain20 is secure. The globally  interconnected domain consists of infrastructure and essential supply chains.  Considerations of security need to remain at the fore of maritime policy. Protecting  the functions of the supply chain networks are vital to ensuring that impacts are not  felt by people in their daily lives.  3. The National Strategy for Maritime Security sets out the current and future issues  facing government and the maritime sector. It draws on expertise and capabilities  from a range of government departments and sets out clear strategic objectives  and commitments over the coming five years to create a more secure, prosperous,  and sustainable maritime sector.  4. Presenting the important issues and our objectives publicly will support industry,  the public, academia, and our international partners in understanding the breadth  and depth of work being undertaken to improve global maritime security.   5. In March 2021, the government launched ‘Global Britain in a Competitive Age:  The Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy’  (the ‘Integrated Review’). It describes the government’s vision for the UK’s role  in the world over the next decade and the action it will take to 2025. It identifies  significant new changes to the international order and the UK’s place in the  world. Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine has demonstrated  the intensified  competition between states over competing interests, norms, and values. This  is being demonstrated through disruption of essential shipping lanes, disputes  over maritime boundaries, or the use of hard and soft power by states to achieve  narrowly focused objectives.   11  National Strategy for Maritime Security Executive summary    6. The government’s primary responsibility is the protection of our people, our  homeland, and our democracy.21 From the maritime perspective this means the  protection of our borders and essential trade routes, working with international  partners to uphold the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS),  including ensuring freedom of navigation and adherence to the international order  which supports our continued way of life.  7. Government is committed to deploying the full range of capabilities in tackling  these emerging challenges, through the use of hard security and economic security  we will take a whole of government approach. We will work with partners and build  new global alliances to challenge states and non-state actors that threaten the  maritime sector and the international order.  8. To support our whole of government approach the UK has created a broad, simple  definition for maritime security, this ensures all maritime security interests can be  properly considered, assessed, and planned for. This strategy defines maritime  security in terms of upholding laws, regulations, and norms to deliver a free, fair,  and open maritime domain.  9. Over the next five years, government will work towards five Strategic Objectives to  further develop our world-leading approach to maritime security. These Strategic  Objectives are interconnected and form the basis of this strategy document.  1: Protecting our homeland  2: Responding to threats  3: Ensuring prosperity  4: Championing our values   5: Supporting a secure, resilient ocean  Maritime Security is about  upholding laws, regulations, and  norms to deliver a free, fair, and  open maritime domain.

Overview  The UK’s Approach   1. Following the publication of the Integrated Review, the time is now right to publish  a new National Strategy for Maritime Security. The government published its first  strategy for maritime security in 2014, setting out an approach to maritime security  based around integration and collaboration both domestically and internationally.  The 2014 strategy set the scene for a number of developments in the UK’s  approach, which have been highly successful.   2. In particular, government has strengthened the UK’s maritime security capabilities  by establishing the Joint Maritime Security Centre (JMSC) in 2019. The JMSC is at  the centre of our response to maritime security. It works with stakeholders across  government to develop a ‘Whole System Response’ to maritime security threats.  Through the provision of a common understanding of maritime risk and threat, the  JMSC enables government to tackle new challenges. It works across government  to develop robust, well exercised multi-agency frameworks for responding to new  and emerging threats.   3. The JMSC’s ability to cohere and augment the responses of UK agencies to  complex maritime incidents both at home and abroad has demonstrated the value  of a single coordinating maritime security body within government.   4. Published in 2019, Maritime 2050 – Navigating the Future sets a long-term vision  for the UK over the coming 30 years. This document has been pivotal in setting an  agreed position between government and industry on the future direction of the  maritime sector over the coming decades. This strategy sets out our plan for the  next five years to get us closer to the security ambitions set-out in Maritime 2050.   5. Government has also continued to work with international partners to tackle  Serious and Organised Crime (SOC), piracy, terrorism, and other security threats.  We will maintain a constant global security presence, with more ships, submarines,  sailors, and marines deployed, protecting shipping lanes and upholding freedom  of navigation. This work involves collaboration with the shipping industry and our  international partners.   16  National Strategy for Maritime Security Overview    Image: HMS Trent at sea undertaking joint anti-piracy  exercises with the Nigerian Forces.  17    Image: Royal Marine Boarding team continues to conduct Alongside Assurance  operations from HMS Trent. In the background is a small fishing vessel that was   visited to observe fishery patterns to gain more understanding of regional activity.  6. In developing this strategy, the expertise and experience from strategy, policy and  operational teams across government has been utilised. Harnessing science and  technology and utilising subject matter experts, our approach has been robust,  and evidence based. We have worked with academia and industry to understand  a range of perspectives and ensure the most current thinking is included  in the strategy.   7. Our five Strategic Objectives set out the approach government will take in  delivering the activity required to protect the UK, the Overseas Territories and  Crown Dependencies.   18  National Strategy for Maritime Security Overview    Table 1- Strategic Objectives and Statements of Intent.   Strategic  Objective  Statement of intent  Protecting  our  homeland   Delivering the world’s most effective maritime security framework for our  borders, ports and infrastructure, government will:   • Work to ensure the security of our borders, ports and maritime  infrastructure with Devolved Administrations, Overseas Territories and  Crown Dependencies.  • Support the maritime sector to be resilient against cyber attack and other  threats with resilient systems and networks to protect data.  • Set out the standards and requirements for border infrastructure and  facilities, in partnership with industry, to support investment to speed up  and secure the passage of people and goods.  Responding  to threats  Deploying a whole system response to bring world-leading capabilities  and expertise to bear in responding to new and emerging threats,  government will:  • Further develop and effectively utilise world leading Maritime Domain  Awareness capabilities.  • Create a secure environment which limits the ability of terrorist and  organised criminal groups to operate.   • Develop comprehensive approaches to defend the integrity of our  maritime interests from state threats.   • Continue to develop and establish strong working relationships,  partnerships, and alliances with International Partners, such as the  continued commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)  and the announcement of the AUKUS partnership.   Ensuring  prosperity  Ensuring the security of international shipping, the unimpeded transmission  of goods, information, and energy to support continued global development  and our economic prosperity, government will:  • Work with international partners to tackle Organised Criminal Groups  (OCGs), piracy and other forms of criminal activity which threaten  global prosperity.  • Monitor chokepoints and strategic seaways to ensure the free movement  of goods and trade.  • Create a robust, secure, and diverse system to protect essential subsea  infrastructure.  19  National Strategy for Maritime Security Overview    Image: BIOT patrol vessel patrolling  British Indian Ocean Territory waters.  Strategic  Objective  Statement of intent  Championing  our values   Championing the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea as the  legal framework within which all activities in the ocean and seas are carried  out, government will:  • Uphold and promote compliance with the rights and obligations of  UNCLOS including freedom of navigation.22  • Work with allies, partners, and multilateral institutions to maintain a free,  open, and secure Indo-Pacific.   • Lead by example to champion free trade and global cooperation to limit  instability on the world’s ocean.   Supporting  a secure,  resilient  ocean  To work towards an ocean that is effectively governed, clean, healthy, safe,  productive, and biologically diverse, government will:  • Champion sustainable governance of the ocean, developing maritime  security approaches which enforce environmental regulations.  • Consider changes to our climate as integral to supporting a mature  maritime security approach.  • Work with allies and partners to ensure the conservation and sustainable  use of the marine environment.  8. In defining maritime security in terms of upholding laws, regulations, and norms to  deliver a free, fair, and open maritime domain; government will tackle the range of  issues facing the UK and our international partners in the maritime domain.   9. The UK will continue to take a collaborative approach to solving problems. We  will continue to use new technologies and scientific understanding to support  the national and global maritime industries in combatting well known and  emerging risks, and also seize opportunities to secure a Global Britain with a  competitive advantage.  20  National Strategy for Maritime Security Overview    The UK’s commitment to the United Nations  Convention on the Law of the Sea  10. The ocean is one of the most contested and complex global arenas, with a wide  range of civil, military, and paramilitary actors.   11. The Integrated Review sets out the UK’s absolute commitment to upholding  UNCLOS in all its dimensions, as an essential enabler of global prosperity, security,  and a healthy planet. UNCLOS is the cornerstone of international law on ocean- related issues and the framework within which all activities in the ocean and seas,  including those described in this strategy, must be conducted.   12. UNCLOS sets out rights and obligations on a wide range of issues including:  shipping, fishing, seabed mining, conservation, cable-laying, freedom of navigation  and the right to establish maritime zones such as the Territorial Sea, Exclusive  Economic Zone and Continental Shelf.  13. We support, defend, and uphold international law by developing and delivering  UK maritime policy that recognises the central role of UNCLOS. UNCLOS is  critical to the UK’s economic, environmental and security interests. By upholding  UNCLOS, we aim to ensure that all nations abide by the same clear rules, making  international relations more predictable and peaceful.   21  National Strategy for Maritime Security Overview    The Physical Maritime Domain  14. To understand maritime security, it is essential to outline the maritime domain in  its entirety. This contributes to our understanding of the arena in which maritime  security actors operate. UNCLOS sets the geographical limits of maritime zones  and establishes rights and responsibilities of coastal states and flag states.  15. Accurate geospatial data is needed to officially calculate the legal maritime limits  and boundaries of coastal states. Therefore, marine science critically underpins our  authority under UNCLOS to claim, administer and lawfully prosecute infringements  in our waters.   16. The UK’s marine estate, including the Overseas Territories and Crown  Dependencies, is vast and constitutes the 5th largest in the world. The metropolitan  UK’s marine area (UKMA) encompasses both the Territorial Sea and the Exclusive  Economic Zone around the UK. The challenge is, at present only around 20% of  the world’s seabed and only 10% of the UK’s global marine area has been mapped  to modern standards, partly caused by challenges with data collection, access,  standards, and coordination.   17. However, as highlighted in the Integrated Review, the world is entering the  ‘informational age’ and this strategy recognises the ocean as the next frontier to  be opened up by advances in technology driven by the ever-increasing demand for  more accurate and reliable marine geospatial information by the public and private  sectors of all nations. Therefore, government has established the UK Centre for  Seabed Mapping hosted by the UK Hydrographic Office. As a centre of excellence,  it will coordinate cross-government and industry collaboration in order to increase  the quantity, quality, and availability of data in the marine domain, which will inform  government to support security, prosperity, and environmental objectives.  22  OverviewNational Strategy for Maritime Security    Figure 1: Map showing the UK Marine Area, including the marine area of the Crown Dependencies of  the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey.  23  OverviewNational Strategy for Maritime Security    UK's Marine Estate  3,000 0 3,0001,500 Kilometers  .

The UK is responsible for setting laws and regulating the use of these  internal waters.  • Territorial Sea: From the baseline up to 12 nautical miles (nm). The UK is  responsible for setting laws and regulating the use of these waters, subject to  the right of vessels from other states to exercise innocent passage or transit  passage (where the waters constitute an international strait). A further 12 nm  beyond the territorial sea, a State can establish a Contiguous Zone, in which it  can continue to enforce laws in four areas: customs, taxation, immigration and  pollution, to prevent breaches of these laws within its territory or territorial sea or  to punish infringements of these laws in its territory or territorial sea.   • Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ): This extends from the edge of the territorial  sea up to 200 nm from the baseline. Within this area, coastal states have  sovereign rights with respect to exploring and exploiting, conserving, and  managing natural resources and jurisdiction with regard to marine scientific  research, the protection and preservation of the marine environment and the  establishment and use of artificial islands, installations, and structures, as  well as some other rights provided by UNCLOS. The UK EEZ is the area within  which the UK is responsible for enforcing fishing measures. Scotland, Wales,  and Northern Ireland have their own zones within the EEZ in which they are  responsible for fisheries enforcement.   • Continental shelf: Coastal states have a continental shelf as of right, extending  to at least 200nm from their coastal baselines, subject to the rights of States  with opposite or adjacent coasts. Subject to certain conditions, the continental  shelf may extend beyond 200nm. The coastal state has exclusive sovereign  rights for exploring, exploiting, and conserving the natural resources on the  seabed in this zone, as well as some other rights.  • High Seas: The high seas are all parts of the ocean not included in the internal  waters, territorial sea, EEZ or archipelagic waters of a state. The high seas  are open to all states, who have various freedoms including navigation and  overflight, laying of submarine cables and pipelines, construction of artificial  islands and other installations, fishing, and scientific research. As a general rule,  states have exclusive jurisdiction over their flagged vessels on the high seas.  • The Area: The Area is the seabed and ocean floor and subsoil thereof beyond  the limits of national jurisdiction. Exploration and exploitation of the mineral  resources of the Area are managed by the International Seabed Authority as the  common heritage of mankind.  25  National Strategy for Maritime Security Overview    Other Challenges Impacting on  Maritime Security   18. The National Strategy for Maritime Security 2014 outlined the most pressing  challenges to maritime security at the time. This included terrorism, disruption  to vital maritime routes, attacks on maritime infrastructure and shipping,  transportation of illegal items by sea, people smuggling and human trafficking.  This strategy recognises that these challenges are still current and seeks to  address these. However, there are also new and emerging challenges impacting  on maritime security such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, climate change,  degradation of the marine environment and state-based threats.   19. The global COVID-19 Pandemic has demonstrated the highly connected world  we live in. Responding to it has highlighted the importance of collaboration,  multilateralism, and has shown that, in fighting the pandemic, ‘no-one is safe until  everyone is’.24 The pandemic has highlighted the importance of protecting global  supply chains and shipping routes, and how they can impact on the domestic  stability of states. In recent years, we have seen how instability in countries can be  used by terrorists and criminals to affect the global system.   20. Climate change presents a significant threat to our way of life. The changes we will  see over the coming years and decades will continue to challenge the international  order. They will also give rise to a wide range of new risks and opportunities to the  maritime sector as a whole. This includes the opening of new trade routes through  the Arctic or High North alongside increased global instability which may in turn  create new forms of terrorism or criminality. Alongside this, the depletion and  changing distribution of fish stocks may result in challenges for countries managing  fish stocks and may spur Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing.   21. There has been a resurgence of state-based threats, intensifying wider state  competition and the erosion of the rules-based international order, making it harder  to build consensus and tackle global threats. Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine  in 2022 has served to both demonstrate the threats to the international order while  demonstrating the ability for global consensus and collaboration in the face of  illegal actions.   22. Additionally, malicious cyber activity knows no international boundaries and has  grown in terms of intensity, complexity, and severity. The UK’s mitigation of risks  against cyber threats within the maritime industry is more important than ever and  will continue to be critical as the industry evolves with increasing automation.   26  National Strategy for Maritime Security Overview    23. Alongside this, Serious and Organised Crime continues to present a sustained  threat to UK maritime security and prosperity in a range of areas. Organised crime  groups engage in piracy, in smuggling illicit commodities such as controlled drugs  and firearms, in people smuggling and in human trafficking – in doing so, putting  lives and communities at risk to make a profit.   Maritime Risk Assessment  24. The strategy is informed by a comprehensive, cross-government Maritime Risk  Assessment (MRA) to ensure all key risks are addressed. The MRA is reviewed  regularly and informs the National Security Risk Assessment (NSRA). The likelihood  and impact of particular risks are used to support wider government policy  decisions and direct funding where appropriate. The MRA also supports our  strategic objectives of protecting our homeland and responding to threats.   25. The key maritime security risks from the latest MRA are presented here in no  particular priority order:   • Terrorism affecting the UK and its maritime interests, including attacks against  cargo or passenger ships.  • Disruption to vital maritime trade routes resulting from war, criminality, piracy, or  changes in international norms.  • Attack on UK maritime infrastructure or shipping, including cyber-attack.  • The transportation of illegal items by sea, including weapons of mass  destruction, controlled drugs, and arms.  • People smuggling and human trafficking.  27  National Strategy for Maritime Security Overview     Objective 1: Protecting  our homeland  Delivering the world’s most  effective maritime security  framework for our borders, ports  and infrastructure, government will:   • Work to ensure the security of our borders, ports and maritime  infrastructure with Devolved Administrations, Overseas Territories and  Crown Dependencies.  • Support the maritime sector to be resilient against cyber attack and  other threats with resilient systems and networks to protect data.  • Set out the standards and requirements for border infrastructure and  facilities, in partnership with industry, to support investment to speed  up and secure the passage of people and goods.  1. In protecting our homeland, we are ensuring the safety of people and goods as well  as the security of the UK’s marine estate. Maritime security can therefore be seen  as an extension of the homeland or ‘UK border’. This includes the maritime assets  of the UK, Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies and involves physical  and digital protection of our ships, port facilities, and key maritime infrastructure.  Our foreign policy rests on strong domestic foundations.  2. Government also has a responsibility to protect our underwater cultural heritage,  with over 5500 sites of cultural significance globally. We will focus on in-situ  preservation alongside safety and environmental management. This involves a  number of government departments and agencies who focus on protecting military  remains, cultural heritage and preventing illegal salvage activity of our historic and  sensitive underwater sites.   28  National Strategy for Maritime Security Protecting our homeland    Image: Bulk Carrier docked in Port of Bristol.  29    Border Security  3. The maritime domain provides a layer of deterrence and detection contributing  to creating an effective border. Alongside the maritime domain there are ‘hard’  physical intervention points at ports and along our borders. The UK’s border is a  vital asset for our safety, prosperity, and global reputation, it provides a unique  intervention point to detect, disrupt, and respond to a range of security threats  while enabling the travel and trade that underpin our way of life.   4. Border security is about facilitating the movement of legitimate trade and travellers,  while ensuring the right measures are in place to deter hostile actors and prevent  illicit cross-border movements of people and goods. Government takes a ‘layered’  approach to securing our borders with surveillance, control, and intervention  matched to the most appropriate point.  5. In December 2020, government published the UK Border Strategy 2025 which sets  out the vision for the UK border over the next five years as embracing innovation,  simplifying processes for traders and travellers, and improving the security and  biosecurity of the UK. Key amongst these transformations is to establish resilient  ports of the future at border crossing points.   6. Border Force is the main agency responsible for securing the UK border, with  Defence coordinating HMG’s operational response to countering small boat  migration in the English Channel. Border Security is achieved by carrying out  immigration and customs controls for people and goods entering the UK, with  officers working at ports around the UK and the Crown Dependencies, at sea,  inland, and overseas with our international partners. Border Force deploys its  officers on an intelligence-led basis using both land and sea-based resources,  maintaining a permanent presence at larger recognised ports catering for ferries,  commercial cargo vessels, and cruise liners. To help improve the intelligence  picture even further, Border Force will introduce a new digital system to gather  Advance Passenger Information from pleasure craft arrivals for the first time. It  is anticipated that further mandatory electronic reporting schemes will follow on.   7. Border Force Maritime Command’s fleet of Cutters and Coastal Patrol Vessels  also plays a central role in reducing crime, tackling illegal migration, protecting  the vulnerable, enabling the legitimate movement of people and goods to  support economic prosperity, while reducing the risk from terrorism to the UK.  This capability is also an integral part of the UK’s whole system approach to  border security.  30  National Strategy for Maritime Security Protecting our homeland    Image: Royal Marine Commandos from  HMS Trent undertaking joint boarding  exercises with Nigerian forces.  Case Study – Motor Yacht KAHU, 2021  The Jamaican flagged MY KAHU was initially detected because of  suspicious activity in the North Atlantic following her departure from  Barbados. This suggested an intention to on-load an illicit cargo at sea.  Enquiries established that the vessel had been under both FBI and the  AFP (Australian Federal Police) suspicion of drug trafficking. Further,  one of the crew on board was linked to a drugs OCG in the UK. The NCA  subsequently coordinated a multi-agency operation.  Border Force Maritime Command were tasked to detect and interdict  the KAHU as soon as possible due to the high probability that the  drugs would be off-loaded as the vessel approached Northern Europe.  Permission was sought and secured from the Jamaican authorities to  interdict the vessel on the High Seas. In the meantime HMC Searcher  and CPV Alert were deployed to east of Ushant to identify and  monitor the KAHU.  The MY KAHU was detected moving eastbound up the English Channel.  Once authority was granted, HMC Searcher and CPV Alert carried out  the interdiction on the High Seas, just to the east of the Casquets. Once  aboard, the boarding team found six crewmen, who were arrested in  relation to Drug Trafficking offences. Numerous dry bags suspected to  contain cocaine were discovered below decks, clearly made ready to  offload. Once in harbour, Border Force confirmed that there was a gross  weight of 2370kg of cocaine within the vessel – the largest ever UK  cocaine seizure from a pleasure craft.’  31    8. Crucially, Maritime Command ensures that security at ports is not undermined  through the diversion of OCG activity elsewhere along our coast. Government will  procure a new fleet of Cutters and Coastal Patrol Vessels to maintain and further  enhance Border Force’s integral role in the UK’s law enforcement and border  security effort.  Port Security   9. Maritime ports are our gateway to the ocean and trade routes of the world. As  a result, ports are naturally attractive targets to those seeking to facilitate or  perpetrate crime or terrorism. Robust port security complements border security,  making our ports and coastline less attractive to those who wish to exploit the  UK. It covers a wide range of threats, from trespassers and petty theft, through to  counter terrorism, state sponsored cyber-attacks and smuggling by OCGs.  10. We have seen in the past that protestors can interrupt the operation of key national  infrastructure, including ports, through low-level and civil offences which can cause  serious disruption to the public. Government is looking at options to prevent  interference with the operation of key transport infrastructure.  11. The protection of port facilities is conducted through preventative measures to  deter and detect unlawful acts, primarily addressing physical security, access  control and application of security procedures. As the maritime security regulator,  government is responsible for the implementation of the International Shipping  and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS) and ensures its delivery through a robust  maritime security compliance function.   12. Government will act as a regulator that our port sector can trust, continuing to  provide Port Facility Security Officers (PFSOs) with expert advice and guidance.  In striving for continuous improvement, government will also utilise bilateral  relationships with maritime authorities in other nations to ensure shared objectives  on port security are understood.  32  National Strategy for Maritime Security Protecting our homeland    *All ports handled over 2 million tonnes of freight in 2020.

Security at ports in the UK, Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies will  continue to require assessment of risk and implementation of security measures  according to legislation, instructions, and guidance. Government will work with  industry to accurately assess risk, encouraging close working between ports,  government partners and subject matter experts to enable advice and guidance.  For example, PORTSAFE is an initiative between the police and port operators  which aims to enhance security awareness within commercial maritime ports,  providing a hostile environment for maritime criminal activity.   14. Collaboration between port facilities, Port Security Authorities and providers will  enable us to share best practice and embed common approaches to security  across the sector. Government will continue work with industry to support the  development of security procedures at our borders and ports.  15. Staff and seafarers remain the sector’s biggest asset, undertaking the work  essential to maintaining global trade and prosperity. Their roles give them  privileged access to facilities and systems which can be misused for illicit or  illegal purposes. These personnel are vulnerable to coercion by criminal and  terrorist organisations, to undertake malicious activity in return for personal gain.  Government will continue to support the maritime sector in understanding the  risks from the insider threat. The Centre for Protection of National Infrastructure  (CPNI) publishes a range of guidance and public tools which support owners and  operators to improve their protective security.  16. To improve collaboration between government and industry, a dedicated  maritime security portal will be created to provide timely and effective industry  engagement. This will enable quick, reliable, and up to date communications with  secure access for sharing documents covering both policy and compliance.  34  National Strategy for Maritime Security Protecting our homeland    Security of Freeports   17. In 2019, government announced plans to establish a number of freeports across  the UK. Freeports are areas where businesses will benefit from more generous  tax reliefs, simplified customs procedures, and wider government support.  This will bring investment, trade and jobs addressing regional inequalities and  levelling up the UK. The government remains committed to establishing a freeport  in both Wales and Northern Ireland, and two green freeports in Scotland as  soon as possible.26  18. While freeports do not change UK border security measures, it will be important to  address any new security implications that affect freeports and ensure support to  legitimate business activity.   19. Freeports are commonly used across the globe, and the Government has  learned from these examples to build upon its current expertise and ensure  cross-border illegal activity is thwarted.

Working alongside UK Law Enforcement, operators of freeports will need to put  in place measures to ensure the security of their sites and effectively manage  access. This will include providing the necessary infrastructure, both digital and  physical, to ensure compliance with UK and international regulations. Government  will continue to support and assure the proper implementation of all freeports  security procedures.  Cyber Security  21. Alongside the robust protection of our physical assets, government continues to  support the maritime sector to build resilience against a range of cyber threats  including cyber espionage, cyber-crime, hacktivism, and ransomware.  22. In some areas, the UK maritime sector is already making the most of technological  advances. In the management of ports, logistics, supply chains, the rollout of  5G networks and the consideration of autonomous shipping, the UK has made  great progress.  23. As a consequence of a spike in the volume of incidents globally, the maritime  sector has experienced a growth in ransomware attacks. Improvements in  understanding the threat and taking appropriate mitigations will reduce the impact  of successful cyber-attacks.   Our vision is that the UK in 2030 will  continue to be a leading responsible and  democratic cyber power, able to protect  and promote our interests in and through  cyberspace in support of national goals.27  36  National Strategy for Maritime Security Protecting our homeland    Image: Container ship and General cargo  ship alongside a port at night..  Case Study: Ransomware Attacks in 2020-21 According to Open Source, there were a number of ransomware  attacks on the maritime sector throughout 2020 and 2021.  • In March 2020, Operators of CL0P ransomware posted online files  allegedly belonging to EV cargo. In June 2020, FireEye identified  a CL0P ransomware sample able to target Overseas Territories  related processes which could result in extended downtime for  an organisation.   • In April 2020, Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) reported  a data centre outage that affected their website and networks.  They subsequently reported that this was a result of malware  which targeted a software vulnerability  • In September 2020, French Shipping giant – CMA CGM were the  victims of a Ragnar Locker ransomware attack, which affected  e-commerce services, as well as company emails.   • Australian logistics company Toll Group found themselves a  victim of ransomware attacks twice in 2020.  • In July 2021, South African ports, and rail company Transnet  was targeted and forced to halt operations in a number of ports.  Whilst operating systems were not directly affected, a terminal  operating system was turned off as a precaution. It is likely that  the cyber actor involved in the South Africa ports wished to extort  money from the South African company.  37    24. Government can support organisations to build their resilience by continuing to  provide advice and guidance on cyber best practice and to consider what further  support can be made available. This can be done by seeking to understand the  means by which efficient and effective screening measures can be made more  agile to quickly meet the demand of any changes to emerging threats.   25. The Network and Information Systems (NIS) Regulations came into effect in 2018  to support organisations who provide a critical service, including those in the  maritime sector, in building a stronger foundation of cyber security and resilience.  The Department for Transport (DfT), as the competent authority for the regulation  of the maritime sector, adopted the use of the National Cyber Security Centre’s  (NCSC) Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF) to ensure operators manage the  security of their network and information systems to ensure continuity of their  essential services. DfT will continue to work with organisations to improve their  cyber security post-CAF. Government will use the NIS Regulations 2018 to drive  up standards of cyber security and help the sector become more resilient.  26. Government has recently published a new National Cyber Strategy, which sets out  plans to cement the UK’s position as a responsible and democratic cyber power  and strengthen cyber security and resilience across the country. A key objective  of the Strategy is to ensure that government, Critical National Infrastructure  (CNI), organisations and citizens understand the cyber risks they face and their  responsibilities to manage them. Increased understanding of cyber security risks  should help industry better assess and manage their own risk and improve their  resilience and ability to prepare, respond and recover from cyber incidents.   27. The NCSC provides advice and guidance on risks through information sharing  platforms and technical assistance in the event of a cyber incident. Organisations  can access a range of free cyber security tools and services which NCSC provides  as part of their Active Cyber Defence programme. Resources include tools such as  ‘Early Warning’ which helps organisations spot malicious activity on their network,  ‘Logging Made Easy’ which helps organisations install basic logging capability on  their IT estate, and ‘Exercise in a Box’ which helps organisations test and practise  their response to a cyber incident. Many more tools and services are available  through the NCSC.   28. In their capacity as national technical authority for cyber threats, NCSC offer a  range of services to support risk and threat management which are available to the  sector. Government will work collaboratively with a wide spectrum of partners to  further warn, inform, and advise.  38  National Strategy for Maritime Security Protecting our homeland    Image: HMS Queen Elizabeth the next generation aircraft  carrier enters Portsmouth, United Kingdom.  29. In light of the changing threat landscape, government will update the 2017 Cyber  Security Code of Practice for Ships and work with the International Maritime  Organization (IMO) to agree international standards and agreements. The Cyber  and Information Security section contained within the Port Facility Security  Instructions will also be updated and will include links to NCSC guidance,  including how to report cyber incidents.  30. Increased cyber incident reporting by the maritime industry will help the NCSC and  government advise the sector on how to mitigate against existing and new threats  and improve their resilience. There must also be consideration on securing legacy- based systems and making new systems ‘secure by design’ by building cyber  security and resilience in at the start of the project. The challenges on the horizon  are varied; rapid technological change and digital advances are reshaping the way  we work and do business, with more and more organisations seeking to rely upon  automated systems and network controls to complete the most complex of tasks.  31. Government will remain committed to developing excellence in its workforce,  including specialist cyber skills and maritime thematic knowledge for those  engaged on these programmes of work.  32. Government will implement the new National Cyber Strategy to ensure that the  maritime industry is aware of the cyber risks it faces and their responsibilities in  managing them.   National Strategy for Maritime Security Protecting our homeland  39     Objective 2: Responding  to threats  Deploying a whole system  response to bring world leading  capabilities and expertise to bear  in responding to new and emerging  threats, government will:  • Further develop and effectively utilise world leading Maritime Domain  Awareness capabilities.  • Create a secure environment which limits the ability of terrorist and  organised criminal groups to operate.  • Develop comprehensive approaches to defend the integrity of our  maritime interests from state threats.  • Continue to develop and establish strong working relationships,  partnerships, and alliances with International Partners, such as the  continued commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  (NATO) and the announcement of the AUKUS partnership.  1. The UK coastline benefits from some of the world’s most advanced capabilities  to respond to and protect against a wide range of threats, from tax evasion to  terrorism and drug trafficking. The UK operational response to these threats  includes capabilities from the Border Force, Police, Her Majesty’s Coastguard  and Royal Navy ships among others. Our capabilities allow us to respond to  current and ongoing challenges but also prepare us for new and emerging threats  over coming years.  40  National Strategy for Maritime Security Responding to threats    Image: RNLI Boat and HM Coastguard  Helicopter undertaking at sea exercises. 41    2. The UK continues to build upon these capabilities. The UK’s shipbuilding industry  supports skilled jobs and a vast supply chain around the country in both the civil  and defence sectors and delivers world-leading capabilities for the Royal Navy.  With the appointment of the Defence Secretary as the National Shipbuilding lead  and champion, the Government’s ambitions for the shipbuilding sector have  grown and there has been a renewed drive across Government to reinvigorate the  sector. As detailed in the National Shipbuilding Strategy Refresh, the Government  and industry’s shared vision is to create a globally successful, innovative, and  sustainable UK shipbuilding enterprise by 2030.   3. Our ambition is to have a shipbuilding enterprise that is at the forefront of  technological and environmental innovations, and which is globally competitive  in key market segments, including design, build, integration, test and evaluation  and repair. Moreover, decarbonisation, digitalisation, and autonomy represent the  opportunity for a radical reboot of the commercial shipping industry.   4. On 31 January 2020, the UK left the European Union. The UK’s departure from the  EU means that we will need to consider threats in new ways as a sovereign state.  The UK will continue to cooperate closely with the EU, its member states and other  international partners through a variety of existing and new mechanisms, including  bilateral and multilateral agreements.   5. Government must consider maritime threats in different ways:  • Threats on the water: where a threat actor uses the sea to cause an incident  on the sea. This includes and is not limited to illegal fishing, blockading of  ports, or theft.  • Threats from the water: where a threat actor uses the sea as a means to  achieve goals on land. This includes and is not limited to the smuggling of drugs,  weapons, or people.  • Threats under the water: where a threat actor uses the sea for illicit, illegal,  or threatening purposes, including intelligence gathering, threatening subsea  infrastructure or hostile intent.  6. In these definitions, the response required varies considerably. The personnel,  equipment and plans used are based on a solid understanding of the maritime  domain, comprehensive exercising, and world-leading intelligence capabilities.  Science and technology play a key role in supporting the understanding of,  preparing for, and responding to, threats in maritime.  42  National Strategy for Maritime Security Responding to threats    7. Government works with NATO, our allies and other global alliances to tackle new  and emerging threats. We will continue to be the leading European ally within  NATO, bolstering the Alliance by tackling maritime security threats jointly and  committing our resources to collective security in the Euro-Atlantic region. This has  been demonstrated in the UK’s robust and comprehensive approach to Russia’s  illegal invasion in February 2022.  8. We will continue to exceed the NATO guideline of spending 2% of gross domestic  product (GDP) on defence, and to declare our nuclear and offensive cyber  capabilities to Allies’ defence under our Article 5 commitment.  Maritime Domain Awareness   9. Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) is defined by the IMO as the effective  understanding of anything associated with the maritime domain that could impact  security, safety, the economy or the environment.28   10. The UK has world leading capabilities and expertise to effectively monitor the sea  surrounding it, and the Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies. This means  government can respond to incidents that could impact upon the security, safety,  prosperity, or environment, rapidly and in a coordinated manner.  11. MDA is a critical component of our multi-layered maritime defence approach. The  numerous agencies involved in MDA and the Royal Navy MDA Programme use a  wide range of tools to provide up to date, accurate information to senior leaders  and key decision makers. They collect and process vast amounts of data from all  aspects of the maritime domain. This is achieved through a variety of primary data  collection activities and situational awareness tools including surveillance software,  the use of coastal radars, aviation operations, space-based reconnaissance, and  government vessels.   12. The UK has a well-established status as a world leader in transforming data  to support other maritime activities including claims of sovereignty, economic  development, security and defence, scientific research, safety of navigation and  environmental protection. As security requirements change and new technologies  become available, it will be essential to adapt the current MDA model to provide  the best available picture.   43  National Strategy for Maritime Security Responding to threats    Image: Next generation aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth and Nimitz-class  USS Ronald Reagan in the foreground with its carrier strike group and support   vessels in the background, sailing in the Philippine Sea, undertaking quad  carrier exercises with USS Carl Vinson and JS ISE (not pictured).  13. Government works with national, regional, and international partners to support  MDA capacity building across the globe. Comprehensive understanding of the  international system provides a common operating picture for maritime security  actors. Government will continue to develop our MDA both domestically  and internationally.

In recognition of the wide range of threats to maritime security, the UK has worked  towards strengthening its maritime security capabilities over the past seven years.  There are a number of organisations and departments which contribute to the UK’s  maritime security system, and which together maintain a range of capabilities,  including high-readiness air and maritime assets, to deter and respond to threats  to the UK. We will continue to maintain and strengthen these capabilities as well as  to enhance interoperability and coordination of our capabilities and structures to  ensure they can be deployed and leveraged to best effect against the full range of  current, new, and emerging threats.   15. At the heart of the ‘Whole System Response’ has been the creation of the JMSC as  the government’s centre for maritime security coordination. The JMSC is a national  organisation, supporting all agencies to deliver the maritime security objectives of  the government, the Devolved Administrations, and the UK’s Overseas Territories  and Crown Dependencies. As a multi-agency organisation, the JMSC ensures  that the government, military, and law enforcement agencies, have a developed  understanding of maritime security threats and risks in our own waters and  across the globe.  16. Since its formation, the JMSC has provided a mechanism for the UK’s maritime and  law enforcement focused organisations to fuse intelligence, data, and capabilities.  This maximises operational impact at home and abroad. The JMSC’s Operations  Centre utilises cutting edge technology to provide 24/7 monitoring of UK waters.  Staffed by personnel drawn from across government, it is well placed to swiftly  identify maritime security incidents and enable the effective coordination of the  UK’s aerial and at-sea assets to respond. The JMSC holds and develops the  playbooks to counter the range of threats and assures multi-agency exercising of  response scenarios.   National Strategy for Maritime Security Responding to threats  46    Figure 7: Partners involved in delivering the UK’s Whole System Response to maritime security.  47  National Strategy for Maritime Security Responding to threats    Operation STONEWISE: The “End of Transition Period” (Brexit) marked  a coming of age of the JMSC where the structures laid out in the text  allowed the JMSC to co-ordinate the whole of Government Preparations.  The Maritime Threat Group met weekly and reported up to the NMSC(O)  which in turn provided the higher-level governance of the whole system  approach and acted as the single briefing to the MSMSG. This ensured that  the Ministerial intent was understood and translated downward and that  the MSMSG and thus XO Committee (now “Global Britain (Operations”)  were informed of the response intentions, preparedness, and risks from the  perspective of the entire UK Maritime Security System. This collaborative  approach best utilised all of government assets to achieve a common aim  with complimentary use of resource ensuring efficiencies, synergies and  gaps were identified, mitigated where possible and explained.  Illegal Migration and the Threat from  Organised Immigration Crime   17. As global instability increases through social and political unrest, the movement  of people across borders, including via maritime routes and the seas, is likely to  become a greater challenge. Those seeking a better life for their families or fleeing  oppression are using established land and sea routes to enter Europe. Some will  attempt secondary migration journeys to reach the UK and we can expect this to  continue over the next five years and beyond.   18. In recent years, OCGs have increasingly taken advantage of the most desperate in  society. These groups exploit vulnerable people and offer to smuggle them into the  UK via a range of methods, with the number of crossings via small boats increasing  significantly over the last couple of years. Groups also traffic vulnerable people to  be sold into modern slavery.  19. In support of Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), the UK’s maritime response regularly  rescue people on unseaworthy boats not suitable to make the crossing across the  English Channel. To strengthen our current efforts the MOD have taken primacy  for our operational response within the Channel (Operation ISOTROPE). There is  a significant risk to life from these crossings and it is therefore essential that we  take a whole of route approach. Government works with international partners   48  National Strategy for Maritime Security Responding to threats    and using technology and intelligence to target and disrupt the criminal gangs  facilitating migrants’ journeys, protecting lives, while also supporting SOLAS  operations if controls are evaded.  20. In this context, we are committed to working closely with our near neighbours,  including France. UK funding has enabled France to significantly increase the  numbers of French law enforcement officers deployed along the coast. We are  investing in a range of technology and capability enhancements to ensure those  deployed can quickly detect and respond to migrants prior to embarkation.  Intelligence sharing is being increased to support operational activity and bilateral  work through the Joint Intelligence Centre (JIC) established in July 2020 continues  to build opportunities for investigations against those facilitating crossings. To  date, 21 organised crime groups have been dismantled and over 500 individuals  arrested as a result of JIC activity.  21. Innovative technologies are being identified and employed to support the UK  response. Development of UK sovereign capabilities such as aerial surveillance  assets, will ensure that all small boats to the UK are identified and interdicted. We  are also investing in maritime assets to respond quickly and effectively to crossings  and improve our awareness of facilitators’ activity in the Channel. We continue to  evaluate and test a range of safe and legal options to find ways of stopping small  boats making this dangerous and unnecessary journey.   22. Without these continued efforts, illicit migration would risk our sovereign border  control, a loss of public confidence, and greater threat to life at sea. The UK 2025  Border Security Strategy sets out our commitments to saving lives and ensuring  fair immigration policies. In the maritime environment, it is essential we have the  capability to understand our environment through world leading MDA which will  enable us to respond to those in need.  49  National Strategy for Maritime Security Responding to threats    Threats from Terrorism   23. Terrorists continue to pose a threat to maritime security. The terrorist threat varies  significantly across the globe and is highly dependent upon how permissive a  region is for terrorists to plan and conduct attacks. Terrorism will remain a major  threat over the coming decade, with a more diverse range of material and political  causes, new sources of radicalisation and evolving tactics.  24. Government’s work on Maritime Counter Terrorism (MCT) looks to deliver the  UK’s Counter Terrorism Strategy (CONTEST) which has the strategic objective of  reducing the risk to the UK and its citizens and interests overseas from terrorism,  so that our people can go about their lives freely and with confidence.  25. As well as being able to identify and respond to the recent diverse, low  sophistication attack methodologies the UK must also remain prepared for  complex or highly destructive attacks. To date we have worked to ensure that no  major maritime terrorist incidents have occurred in or near UK seas. However, the  UK must continue to prepare for a range of scenarios.   26. MCT is a whole of government endeavour, requiring contributions from a range of  departments and operational partners, including Police, Counter Terrorism Policing,  Defence, the Maritime and Coast Guard Agency, the emergency services and  Border Force.  Our MCT efforts are coordinated to ensure a collaborative approach  to using shared expertise and capabilities to best effect.  27. Government will continue to refine, exercise and improve response plans for  terrorist incidents at sea. We will be informed by robust science and technology  and engage with industry to raise awareness of risks from terrorism, counter  terrorism protective measures, and associated response plans, including among  companies operating both UK and internationally flagged vessels. Government will  continue to work closely with maritime neighbours and other European partners  to establish and build on agreements to ensure we minimise the risk of terrorist  activity near to UK shores – such as the UK-France Maritime Security Treaty which  was signed in July 2021, to work closer together, share expertise and intelligence  and conduct exercising. Government will continue working to ensure we can  maximise the opportunities delivered by the UK-France Treaty once it is ratified.   28. Counter terrorism is a reserved matter but there are elements of the government’s  MCT work which require collaboration with Devolved Administrations. We will  continue to work closely with our colleagues in the Scottish, Welsh, and Northern  Ireland administrations to ensure the specific interests and structures in those  areas are appropriately reflected.   50  National Strategy for Maritime Security Responding to threats    State Threats  29. As the Integrated Review sets out, we are seeing the move to a more competitive  and multipolar world; one in which there is an intensification of competition  between states and with non-state actors. States are becoming increasingly  assertive in how they compete to advance their objectives and, in their willingness,  to undermine ours.   30. State threats are persistent and take many forms including espionage, sabotage,  cyber operations, and intellectual property and data theft. An increasing number  of states now have the capability to undertake isolated attacks or use a range of  threats to interfere with our security, economy, and society.   31. In the maritime domain, states may look to sabotage our key infrastructure, disrupt  logistical and economic supply chains, or obstruct freedom of navigation. Recent  state-backed attacks on commercial shipping have shown the challenges faced  by the maritime industry in protecting both ships and seafarers. The attack on the  MV MERCER STREET in July 2021 was attributed to Iran and demonstrates some  of the capabilities available to states and non-state actors to target commercial  shipping, risking the lives of seafarers.   32. Government will work with allies in relentlessly pursuing attribution and  exposure of evidence in response to unacceptable state threats. The Royal Navy  will deter state aggression by, for example, shadowing vessels transiting our  territorial sea to ensure they comply with international law. The UK will continue  to work with international partners to manage the risks posed by state actors. The  UK is a key player in the International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC) which  operates in the Gulf and reassures commercial shipping, provides deterrence  against malign activity, and promotes freedom of navigation. We will continue  to work with our allies and like-minded partners to collaborate and promote our  mutual interests, so that together we are more resilient, and our collective response  is greater than the sum of its parts.  51  National Strategy for Maritime Security Responding to threats    Image: The Type 45 destroyer HMS Duncan in the foreground  escorting a tanker through the Strait of Hormuz. HMS Duncan is  supported by HMS Montrose in escorting the tanker.  The International Maritime Security Construct    The International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC) and Coalition Task  Force (CTF) SENTINEL, was established in July 2019 in response to  a heightened threat to freedom of navigation and free flow of trade in  the Middle East. The UK has played a pivotal role in the formation and  sustainment of IMSC using naval assets based at the Naval Support  Facility in the Kingdom of Bahrain and the provision of Royal Navy staff,  including a 1* Commander. In the IMSC, the UK is partnered with Albania,  Estonia, Lithuania, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, The United Arab Emirates, and  the US.    The IMSC Mission provides reassurance to shipping and deters state  sponsored malign activities, paying particular attention to the two strategic  maritime choke points of the Bab Al Mandeb (in the Southern Red Sea)  and the Strait of Hormuz. The IMSC’s state-facing posture sets it apart  from other maritime security initiatives and task forces in the region, and  it has built a considerable rapport with the global shipping industry and  regional coalition members. Ultimately, the IMSC aims to preserve freedom  of navigation and uphold the rule of law, to support free flow of trade on  which our economy depends.  52  National Strategy for Maritime Security Responding to threats    Foreign Direct Investment  33. The UK has a world-leading reputation for being an attractive place to invest, in  large part due to the openness, transparency, and stability of our economy. Whilst  both the UK and our foreign partners enjoy the mutual benefits of international  trade, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into UK infrastructure and assets (including  intellectual property) also has the potential to expose the UK to increased national  security risk. Through investment, foreign states may be able to influence decision- making within key transport assets in ways that may run contrary to the UK’s  national security.   34. In order to address risks posed by certain FDI, the National Security and  Investment Act 2021 (NSI) seeks to protect the public whilst bolstering the  UK’s status as an attractive place to invest. The NSI Act provides more efficient  clearance processes for relevant acquisitions and greater certainty and  transparency for investors and businesses. The Act also grants the Business  Secretary ‘call in’ powers, allowing transactions to be reviewed – and if necessary  blocked - on the basis of national security. The Act commenced on 4 January 2022,  granting the Secretary of State with retrospective call-in powers for any relevant  transactions completed on or after 12 November 2020.  35. The government is committed to developing a resilient and sustainable maritime  sector, able to manage and mitigate malign foreign interference and hostile  behaviour in all forms.  The Maritime Sector and the National Security and Investment Act     A healthy and secure maritime sector is essential to keep the country  moving and therefore the government has ensured that critical UK port and  maritime infrastructure are protected under the new NSI Act. In particular,  investment into ports and harbours that handle at least one million tonnes  of cargo per year will be in scope of the Act’s ‘mandatory notification’  regime – meaning any new acquirer(s) within this sector will have to inform  the government of the details of the acquisition, if statutory thresholds are  met. Should national security concerns regarding the acquisition come to  light, the legislation allows the government to impose conditions or block  or unwind acquisitions.  53  National Strategy for Maritime Security Responding to threats     Objective 3: Ensuring  prosperity  Ensuring the security of  international shipping, the  unimpeded transmission of goods,  information, and energy to support  continued global development  and our economic prosperity,  government will:  • Work with international partners to tackle Organised Criminal Groups  (OCGs), piracy and other forms of criminal activity which threaten  global prosperity.  • Monitor chokepoints and strategic seaways to ensure the free  movement of goods and trade.  • Create a robust, secure, and diverse system to protect essential  subsea infrastructure.  1. UK and global prosperity depend on the safe and secure international passage  of goods, information, and energy moved by sea. Reliable and timely importation  processes form the bedrock of the UK’s national economy and national security.  54  National Strategy for Maritime Security Ensuring prosperity    Image: Front view of laden  container ship moving at sea.  55    2. Government is committed to using agility and speed of action to enable us to  deliver for our citizens, enhancing our prosperity and security. We will continue  to transform the way government collects and uses border data to improve  the security and resilience of the border and at our ports. This work will ensure  improved data is used to contribute to a cross-Government performance  framework that will allow for more effective monitoring of threats and risks to the  border over time.  3. To support the prosperity of global trade routes we will use this data and the range  of our capabilities to tackle the threats facing the essential transnational networks.   Ship Security  4. Ships are conveying the vast majority of UK trade and many of our vital resources.  UK ships, along with international shipping fleets, are strategic assets in  maintaining domestic and international trade. The UK considers protection for  ships at home and abroad and provisions of maritime security measures will enable  us to strengthen and extend UK’s prosperity, security, and resilience.  5. Through the implementation of ISPS code in UK law, protection of ships is  maintained by providing a standardised, consistent framework for evaluating risk.  This enables the Government adopt develop new procedures and guidance as  threats change.  6. Government will continue to support shipping communities in implementing the  ISPS code for all UK-registered ships, making security inspections of foreign  vessels in UK ports, handling ship security alerts, and approving and auditing  the training providers for Ship Security Officer (SSO) and Company Security  Officer (CSO) courses.  7. As the international security risks evolve, the Government, through regular  evidence-based guidance, will help ship owners, operators (companies), masters  and seafarers understand the risks posed by piracy, armed robbery, and other acts  of violence against merchant shipping.  56  National Strategy for Maritime Security Ensuring prosperity    Image: Container ship  docked at port.  Preventing Maritime Crime   8. SOC will continue to have a significant impact on UK citizens, with the scale and  complexity of the issues facing government continuing to change. OCGs will  continue to be transnational, with criminals from overseas sourcing illicit goods,  exploiting the vulnerable and defrauding UK citizens and businesses.  9. Maritime routes continue to be some of the most attractive opportunities for OCGs  to undertake a range of criminal activity. Without the use of the ocean OCGs would  be unable to operate in the way that they do, and the vast profits that they make  from illegal activity would be greatly reduced.   10. In order to traffic commodities between continents, OCGs purchase specific  vessels or exploit legitimate cargo vessels. Yachts, fishing vessels and semi- submersible vessels are also all used to traffic across the ocean. Drugs, firearms,  and tobacco will be hidden within containers, in void spaces, or specially  constructed concealments within the vessels. These highly sophisticated  operations can involve drugs being handed over at sea, well outside of the  Territorial Sea to avoid detection by law enforcement.   National Strategy for Maritime Security Ensuring prosperity  57    Image: Aerial photograph of laden container  ship manoeuvring at the dock side with the  assistance of tugboats.   Case study: Project Latitude Smuggling by sea is recognised as a key threat within the National  Strategic Assessment of Serious and Organised Crime and is  a consistent part of the maritime threat and response. Work  undertaken jointly by the Home Office and National Crime Agency.  in countering this threat has resulted, since January 2019, in the  seizure of over 60t of cocaine from a total of 25 tasked jobs/ships.  Of the seized cocaine, 40t were from commercial vessels whilst  14.8t were from pleasure vessels. 5 out of 25 interdicted vessels  listed were UK flagged.   These operations highlight the significance of countering maritime  crime, as many of the seized goods would have been destined for  the UK and ending in the hands of OCGs. Additionally, given the  flagging of the vessels and the ability of law enforcement to seize  and detain, ships facilitating illicit activities, further highlights the  importance of international cooperation and partnerships in tackling  maritime crime.   58    Image: HMS Tamar and HMS Spey offshore patrol  vessels alongside at HMNB Portsmouth.  Case study: SY G.SIRO As the result of a joint operation involving the Portuguese, Spanish,  UK and US authorities, the Portuguese deployed a navy surface asset  and successfully located and interdicted the SY G.SIRO (Spanish flag),  23.44 metre sailing yacht approx. 350nm West of Lisbon, with 3 crew  members aboard and a total of 5.2 tonnes of cocaine found aboard.  It is likely that a proportion of the drugs destined for Europe would end up  on UK shores and in the hands of OCGs. This highlights the importance  of international cooperation and partnerships in tackling International  Maritime Crime.  5959    11. The trafficking of drugs, people, and other illicit commodities in the maritime  domain is often linked to corrupt crew members who are vulnerable to exploitation,  port workers and others involved in the maritime industry to facilitate its entry into  the UK and international ports.   12. Government works closely with neighbours and international partners to tackle  SOC in the maritime domain. Our collaboration involves disrupting national  security threats such as drug trafficking, firearms trafficking, people smuggling  and human trafficking through working with the Maritime Analysis Operations  Centre-Narcotics, EU SEACOP29 and other bilateral or multilateral organisations.  Government will continue to explore new opportunities to work with  international partners to tackle SOC.  Countering Piracy and Armed Robbery   13. Piracy30 impacts global prosperity by disrupting the flow of goods and people  by sea. Piracy is generally associated with less developed or unstable coastal  nations which may have suffered civil strife or conflict. Such conditions are  breeding grounds for OCGs who take advantage of vulnerable local communities to  undertake a range of criminal activities.  14. In 2011, Somalia was the focal point for global piracy with 300 piracy incidents  occurring in that year alone. The UK played a leading role in the international effort  to suppress piracy from Somalia. While incidents have greatly reduced, we believe  OCGs have focused on other types of crime. The current global hotspot for piracy  is in the Gulf of Guinea where pirates use firearms to attempt to kidnap crew and  hold them to ransom, hijack vessels, or take their cargo. In South East Asia and the  Gulf of Mexico, piracy takes the form of petty theft from ships close to the shore.  These incidents can have a serious impact on the operations of a vessel and the  livelihoods of seafarers.   15. Government’s approach to counter piracy focuses on a combination of detection  via improved global MDA and a concerted international naval response to disrupt  the criminal networks. This sits alongside diplomatic engagement to support  international institutions and frameworks. Government will continue to engage  in the Djibouti Code of Conduct and the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast  of Somalia, Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed  Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP) and other international fora.   60  National Strategy for Maritime Security Ensuring prosperity    Image: Aerial view of HMS Lancaster moving through open ocean in the Gulf  of Guinea off the coast of West Africa.   16. Government will work multilaterally and bilaterally to support regional countries  in the fight against cross-border maritime crime and piracy with a focus on  legal frameworks to facilitate prosecutions, development of Maritime Domain  Awareness, and capability building for navies and coastguards.  17. Government will take a leading role in developing multilateral engagement. For  example, through our Dialogue Partner Status of the Association of Southeast  Asian Nations and in the G7++ Friends of Gulf of Guinea.

Chokepoints constitute narrow channels along widely used global sea routes;  some are so narrow that restrictions are placed on the size of the vessel that can  navigate through them. Restrictions may be placed upon vessels by the channel  operators (e.g. Suez Canal) or by governments whose territorial seas the route  intersects (e.g. Strait of Hormuz).  19. Strategic seaways such as Gulf of Guinea and Cape of Good Hope are also  essential trade routes. Congested channels and operational restriction can reduce  the speed or manoeuvrability of vessels transiting, making them vulnerable to  attack from pirates, terrorists, state threats, or OCGs.  20. While most chokepoints can be circumvented, this normally leads to significant  additional transit times. In some cases, such as the Strait of Hormuz, no practical  alternatives are available.   21. To ensure global trade routes and chokepoints are freely navigable, the UK will  work to ensure compliance by other states with UNCLOS. We will work with  international partners to maintain and build consensus for an open and stable  maritime domain.  22. Government is committed to supporting the maritime sector transiting through the  High-Risk Area (HRA).33 The work of the UK Maritime Trade Organisation (UKMTO)  delivers timely maritime security information and supports engagement with  military forces in the region.  23. As the ice melts in the seas of the High North, new shipping routes emerge. As the  North-East and North-West passages become more traversable, potential trade  and shipping lines once thought impassable will open up. These new routes will  require government action, taken in accordance with UNCLOS, to provide security,  alleviate SOLAS concerns, ensure navigational rights are upheld, and address risks  to the fragile marine environment.  24. The UK will enhance its understanding of the reliance of international shipping  on chokepoints and strategic seaways, and work with partners to keep these  supply routes open.  63  National Strategy for Maritime Security Ensuring prosperity    Maritime choke points  National Strategy for Maritime Security Chapter 7  1  2 3  4 5  6  7  8        Panama Canal  The 44nm Panama Canal links the Pacific and  Atlantic Oceans and avoids the hazardous Cape  Horn route around the tip of South America. Around  15,000 vessels transit each year through the system  of locks which make up the canal.         Strait of Gibraltar  The Strait of Gibraltar separates the Mediterranean  Sea from the Atlantic Ocean and, at its narrowest  point of 7nm separates Europe from North Africa.            Strait of Bosporus (Turkish Strait)  The Turkish Strait, which includes the Bosporus and  Dardanelles waterways divides Asia from Europe  and links the Black Sea to the Mediterranean  carrying 48,000 vessels per year.  It is an important  transit corridor for oil exporting countries in the  Black Sea (c. 2.4M barrels pe day).         Suez Canal  The Egyptian-controlled Suez Canal links the  Mediterranean Sea with the Arabian and Indian  Oceans. It is a key transit corridor for global trade –  especially energy shipments between Europe and  North America and the Middle East Europe. It also  links manufacturing Asian economies with Europe.         Strait of Hormuz  The Strait of Hormuz links the Arabian Gulf to the  Gulf of Oman and is the world’s most important  energy chokepoint with 30% of all seaborne-traded  oil (and products) and 30% of natural gas transiting  through. The Strait is 21nm wide at its narrowest  point and encroaches into Omani and Iranian waters.        Strait of Bab al-Mandab  The Bab el-Mandeb Strait connects the Red Sea  with the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea. It’s 15nm  wide at its narrowest point and sees 21,000 vessels  annually pass through and 4.6M barrels of oil/day.         Cape of Good Hope  The Cape of Good Hope lies on the tip of Africa and  is an important transit route for Global shipping. It  can serve as an alternative roue for the Suez canal  but adds around 15 days for European transits and  8-10 for the United States.           Strait of Malacca  The Strait of Malacca is the main shipping channel  between the Indian and Pacific Ocean, linking  the major economies of Asia. It is also a key  arterial route between Europe and the Far East.  Approximately 60% of the world’s maritime trade  transits this corridor.    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  PgX Figure 8: Map showing some strategic seaways and chokepoints around the world, taken from  Integrated Review: The defence tilt to the Indo-Pacific.34  64  Ensuring prosperityNational Strategy for Maritime Security    Image: The container ship Ever Given stuck in the Suez  Canal in Egypt, viewed from the International Space   Station 2021, NASA JSC ISS Image library.   Case Study – The MV EVERGIVEN disruption  to a strategic chokepoint The EVERGIVEN was loaded with c17,600 containers, carrying  roughly $1 billion worth of cargo, when it went aground in the bank of  Suez Cana in March 2021. The ship was unable to free itself and an  operation was taken to free the ship and open the Suez up to traffic.  By the end of the first day, 185 vessels were anchored nearby at the  terminations of the Canal, unable to commence their transit. Amongst  their diverse cargoes, these vessels were carrying electronics,  cement, water, millions of barrels of oil, and several thousand head of  livestock. It was estimated that US$10 billion worth of marine traffic  per day was piling up. After six days the EVERGIVEN was freed but  clearing the shipping backlog took a further six days. The time for  some ports to resume normal operations took more than a month  following the clearance of the EVERGIVEN.  Between 10-12% of global trade passes through the Suez Canal with  more than 50 vessels transiting it a day.  A prolonged closure of Suez risked a cascade of delays that would be  felt in day-to-day commerce by millions of people. A vessel missing  its scheduled arrival at a terminal in New Jersey, for example, would  not just create a problem for the American companies waiting for its  cargo. It would also mean a backlog of all the containers the ship was  supposed to pick up for export. Meanwhile, factories in China relying  on the same vessel to pick up their goods weeks later, would require  alternative options-which, given the disruption, might not exist.  While this incident was not as a result of a security incident, the  resulting delays to maritime trade from the EVERGIVEN incident  highlight the vulnerabilities of strategic chokepoints to the security  and resilience of the global supply chain.  65    Protecting Subsea Infrastructure   25. Chokepoints, strategic seaways, and congested waterways do not just affect  surface traffic. Traditional maritime choke points, such as the Suez Canal,  create similar constraints for subsea communication cables. Cables are further  constrained geographically due to the limited number of suitable landing points.  Figure 9: Cropped section of the Submarine Cable Map 2021, showing the intercontinental subsea  cables connected to the UK and North Western Europe.  26. Subsea cables are essential to our modern way of life, providing communications  that support the internet and energy connectivity which distributes electricity  across markets. Both essential functions support our modern industries and global  connectivity and contribute towards Net Zero. £545 bn of Gross Value Added (GVA)  per annum is associated with UK exports relying on subsea cables.  66  National Strategy for Maritime Security Ensuring prosperity    27. Whilst subsea communications cables are privately owned and operated, the  government regards UK linked cables as part of the UK’s critical international  connectivity and infrastructure. Accidental damage caused by fishing, particularly  trawling and other seabed-disturbing activities, remains the primary threat to  subsea cables. The importance of cables to our way of life also requires security  awareness against concerns of potential disruption by malign actors. A significant  loss of subsea cables could be felt by everyone in the UK. The impact would  directly affect the UK’s communications and internet-based services, as well as  financial traffic.  of all global communications transmitted via subsea  communication cables.35   of foreign exchange cross-border trading  takes place per day using the UK’s subsea  fibre optic cables.36  A transatlantic telecommunications cable using the latest  technology has a capacity of 250 million Megabits per second.37  28. To ensure the UK is well-positioned to provide a secure yet attractive hub for  subsea data cables and retain expertise to support the modern digital economy,  Government will re-evaluate its regulatory framework to support the continued  security, resilience, and integrity of critical UK communications. This will include  our ability to deploy timely maintenance and repairs of our subsea infrastructure.  29. The new MoD Multi-Role Ocean Surveillance (MROS) programme will play a  vital and versatile role in protecting the integrity of the UK’s Maritime zones and  critical undersea infrastructure. It will harness remotely piloted capabilities and  form a key capability in managing modern subsea challenges, which continues  to be coordinated at a cross-government level.  30. Government will endeavour to attract cable owner-operators by aligning  strategically with key allies and markets. We will realise benefits from an  effective and proportionate regulatory and legislative environment, and ensure  protection to critical subsea infrastructure.  67  National Strategy for Maritime Security Ensuring prosperity    The British Flag   31. International law requires that every merchant ship be registered in a country,  called its flag state. A ship is subject to the law of its flag state. The Red Ensign  Group (REG) is the group of British Shipping Registries. Any vessel registered in  the UK, a Crown Dependency or UK Overseas Territory, is a “British ship” and is  entitled to fly the Red Ensign flag. The Red Ensign flag is recognised globally for  the maintenance of high standards, maritime safety, and the welfare of seafarers.  32. The government is responsible for the safety and security of UK flagged vessels  globally. This requires using the full range of security and defence capabilities to  produce expert guidance and geographic security level information. This allows  shipping operators to develop informed risk assessments and effective mitigations  during operational activity.  33. Government and our international consular services support UK flagged shipping  should a security situation or event occur. Our diplomatic activity continues to  support the right of merchant shipping to carry out commercial activities free from  violence or aggression. The Royal Navy maintains a global presence and is active  in deterring malign activity in regional hotspots.  The Red Ensign flag is recognised globally  for the maintenance of high standards,  maritime safety, and the welfare  of seafarers.  68  National Strategy for Maritime Security Ensuring prosperity    Image: Aerial view of a fully ladened container ship  travelling in open ocean.  Case Study: International Tribunal for the  Law of the Sea  The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) is an  intergovernmental organisation created by the mandate of the Third  United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea.  UNCLOS plays a central role in establishing what is required of flag  States. In a 2015 Advisory Opinion, the International Tribunal for the  Law of the Sea determined that UNCLOS placed flag States under a  ‘due diligence’ obligation to take all necessary measures to prevent  illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing by vessels flying  their flag. However, while the Advisory Opinion was concerned with  IUU fishing, the principles it identified and applied are relevant to the  responsibility of flag States more broadly.  The conclusion reached by ITLOS flowed from the obligation that  UNCLOS places on flag States to effectively exercise their jurisdiction  and control in administrative, technical, and social matters over ships  flying their flag. In fulfilling that obligation, UNCLOS also requires flag  States to take such measures as are necessary to ensure safety at  sea with regard to a wide range of matters, including, for example, the  prevention of collisions. When the flag State is alleged to have failed  properly to exercise jurisdiction and control   it must investigate and, if  appropriate, take any action necessary to remedy the situation.  69    34. With international partners, we will continue to maintain our contribution to  maritime security and freedom of navigation on a global scale wherever possible.  Our national resources outside of UK waters will be focused on safeguarding  Red Ensign Group flagged passenger and cargo ships and UK trade. Security  compliance of the UK-flagged commercial cargo fleet is undertaken by the  Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA). As part of this security compliance  programme, the MCA provides the communication infrastructure for the  receipt of Ship Security Alerts and undertakes inspections of overseas ships  arriving in UK ports.  35. Government also encourages other nations to adopt the highest required  standards. So-called ‘Flags of Convenience’ is the term often used to describe  Open Registries – registries that allow ship owners of other nationalities to flag  and operate ships under their flag and offer commercial advantages such as an  attractive fiscal regime, substantially lower administrative fees, more accessibility  to the registry, and lower costs for the ship owners. The record of compliance with  international conventions by vessels on open registers is not significantly worse  than that of vessels on other registries.  36. Article 94 of UNCLOS requires the flag State to “effectively exercise its jurisdiction  and control in administrative, technical and social matters;” many of these matters  are regulated by international conventions adopted through the IMO.   37. In response to Article 94 of UNCLOS the international maritime community has  established a regime known as Port State Control, whereby a country can inspect  foreign flagged vessels in their waters. Several regional regimes are in place  such as the Paris memorandum of understanding and the Tokyo memorandum  of understanding. Under these memoranda of understanding, the Maritime  Administrations check that vessels entering their ports comply with the major  IMO Conventions.  70  National Strategy for Maritime Security Ensuring prosperity    Image: Red Ensign flag blowing in the wind.  38. For vessels which do not comply with these international conventions, there  is potentially a significant sanction, which can ultimately lead to the exclusion  of the vessel from all the ports in the region covered by the Memorandum  of Understanding.  39. The IMO has a system for auditing the implementation by Member States of  their obligations under the key IMO instrument. The UK will continue to support  compliance of flag state obligations and port state control measures and will  work closely with the IMO to encourage these high standards to prevail across  all administrations. Government takes this responsibility seriously and the UK  (and British Registries of the Red Ensign Group) have recently been successfully  audited by the IMO.  71  National Strategy for Maritime Security Ensuring prosperity     Objective 4:  Championing our values  Championing the United Nations  Convention on the Law of the  Sea as the legal framework  within which all activities in the  ocean and seas are carried out,  government will:   • Reinforce maritime international architecture by promoting and  defending UNCLOS as the legal framework within which all activities in  the ocean and seas are carried out  • Work with allies, partners, and multilateral institutions to maintain a  free, open, and secure Indo-Pacific.  • Lead by example to champion free trade and global cooperation to  limit instability on the world’s ocean.   1. While the bulk of our security focus will remain on the protection of our  homeland and vital trade, the future success of Global Britain requires us to  work with likeminded nations to champion the values which support our nation  and the international order.   2. We will look to work bilaterally and with multilateral institutions such as, for  example, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to promote a  renewed commitment by the UK as a force for good in the world. We will defend  the international order, this is particularly important at a time where state based  competition is increasing.   72  National Strategy for Maritime Security Championing our values    Image: HMS Protector viewed from its Quad Copter as it makes it way through  Ice filled seas. HMS Protector is the Royal Navy’s Ice Patrol Ship and is deployed  for 330 days of the year. 7373    Image: The CMA CGM Corte Real  container ship sailing in open ocean.  3. The UK, the US, and Australia signed the AUKUS agreement in 2022 to embark on  developing a nuclear-powered conventionally armed submarine capability for the  Royal Australian Navy, and to enhance our Advanced Capabilities.  4. Government is prepared to be bold, taking robust action to support the UK’s  values and tackle coercion or aggression across the globe. In responding to  Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine government has implemented some of the most  restrictive sanctions. Demonstrating the will to stand against those who threaten  the international order and values which the UK defends.  Supporting and Defending UNCLOS   5. Government seeks to support, defend, and uphold UNCLOS in all its dimensions,  as an essential enabler of global prosperity, security, and a healthy planet. The  convention sets out the rules with which all activities must comply. Complying  with the rights and obligations set out in UNCLOS can help ensure that activity on  the world’s ocean supports prosperity, security, and sustainability.  6. This commitment is a common endeavour of the international community as  demonstrated by the establishment and membership of the Group of Friends38  of UNCLOS. The Group of Friends will provide an opportunity to further the  international community’s joint understanding of, and commitment to upholding  the Convention.   7. Government will continue to uphold the universal and unified character of  UNCLOS and reaffirm its important role in setting out the legal framework that  governs all activities in the ocean and seas. We will continue to play a key role in  developing and implementing Security Council Resolutions concerning maritime  issues such as piracy and the enforcement of sanctions at sea. Government will  continue to support the IMO and seek to provide resource and capability to its  international mission.  8. Government will continue to play a central role in discussions on ocean issues  at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), the United Nations Security  Council (UNSC), and IMO, defending and advocating for UNCLOS.  National Strategy for Maritime Security Championing our values  74    Case Study: Maintaining the Freedom of Navigation in  a Strategic Chokepoint While threats to Freedom of Navigation commonly take the form of excessive  geographical or jurisdictional claims, in relation to the world’s key maritime  chokepoints the threat may also be physical. The Strait of Hormuz which connects  the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman, is a key route for all shipping both in and  out of the Gulf area. All ships have a right to transit passage through the Strait, in  accordance with UNCLOS, along the internationally recognised traffic separation  scheme. The Persian Gulf remains an economic centre of gravity with up to  20 million barrels of oil and 3.5 billion cubic feet of Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) passing  through the Strait of Hormuz daily – representing over 20% of worldwide trade.   At its narrowest point with the traffic separation scheme passes through the  territorial sea of Oman. For relatively little cost, transit through the Strait has  previously been and could again be denied for some considerable time by state or  non-state actors. Similar effects would be felt under increased tensions or in conflict,  and whether the Strait was physically blocked or only threatened. Such disruption  would have a profound effect on world oil and gas prices and many economies: HM  Treasury analysis predicts that a 30-day closure of the Strait of Hormuz would have  an impact on the global economy lasting at least four years. Consequently, it is a  key strategic chokepoint, not only for the countries of the region, but globally – and  freedom of navigation for all ships must be maintained.  In order to mitigate this risk, to deter attempts to disrupt the Strait, and to maintain  freedom of navigation to and from the Gulf, the UK operates in the region under  the non-state facing Combined Maritime Forces, the IMSC and under UK National  tasking. Since 2006 the Royal Navy has maintained four forward-deployed Mine  Countermeasure Vessels (MCMVs) operating out of Bahrain and, since 2019, has  also forward deployed a Type 23 Frigate to the region. This expeditionary force,  supported by a ship from the Royal Fleet Auxiliary and Command and Control  element, now housed in its own bespoke facility and built with assistance from the  Kingdom of Bahrain, is part of the international effort to maintain the security of the  region for all mariners, commercial or other. The success of this effort continues  to be dependent on wider political engagement and whole-of-government activity  across the region, including intelligence and information sharing.  75  Championing our valuesNational Strategy for Maritime Security    Freedom of navigation  9. Freedom of navigation is the term given to the group of passage rights and  freedoms that all states enjoy, and these rights are utilised by vessels of those  states in navigating on, over, or under the world’s ocean and seas. Freedom of  navigation is vital to the security and economic stability of the UK. Upholding  freedom of navigation facilitates global maritime trade and provides the UK military  and law enforcement and intelligence agencies with the legal landscape to allow it  to respond to threats to security at range.   10. These rights are set out in UNCLOS and so maintaining the integrity of the  convention and its consistent implementation is central to upholding freedom of  navigation. The stability of the UNCLOS regime, and in consequence maritime  security, may be fundamentally undermined by excessive claims over sea areas or  unlawful interferences with navigational rights and freedoms. The UK will continue  to challenge attempts to limit our freedom of navigation.   11. Government will look to support freedom of navigation through increasing  our maritime presence in the Indo-Pacific region by deploying two Offshore  Patrol Vessels from 2021, a Littoral Response Group from 2023 and a Type 31  Frigate later in the decade. Elsewhere, Offshore Patrol Vessels will be forward  deployed to the South Atlantic and Caribbean and will maintain a presence in the  Mediterranean and African Coast.   Government will deploy our full range of  capabilities to defend free trade, freedom  of navigation and the International Order.  76  National Strategy for Maritime Security Championing our values    8 Ships  4 Ships  £220m  Defence: 8 Ships permanently  attributed to NATO39  Defence: 4 Ships leading Baltic  Protector under NATO40  Defence: Over £220m class A-C  narcotics seized (2020-2021)41  Royal Navy Ships crossed every single  line of longitude in 2021  In 2021, the Royal Navy assigned: the  Continuous at Sea Deterrent, a Carrier  Strike Group and Littoral Strike Group  capabilities to NATO (Unique amongst  European NATO members)  77  National Strategy for Maritime Security Championing our values    National Strategy for Maritime Security Chapter 8  National Strategy for Maritime Security Chapter 8  Why the South China Sea matters   Linking East and West The South China Sea covers 1.4 million square miles,  and is the main global shipping route between the Pacific  and Indian Oceans, through the strategically important  Straits of Malacca.  Global Maritime Trade42  60% of all global maritime trade passes through Asia: of  that, one third passes through the South China Sea.   This is worth over £2.33 trillion annually, which equates to  2.5% of the entire global economy.  Global Britain43  The UK is a maritime trading nation, with commercial  interests worldwide. We are reliant upon the South China  Sea for over £91 billion worth of imports & exports passing  through it every year - 12% of total UK seabourne trade.  78  Championing our valuesNational Strategy for Maritime Security    Indo-Pacific Tilt  12. The UK is now investing greater and enduring effort in the Indo-Pacific as part of  our recognition of the importance of this region to the UK in the Integrated Review.  Our goal is to be the European partner with the broadest and most integrated  presence in the Indo-Pacific, committed for the long-term, with closer and deeper  partnerships both bilaterally and multi-laterally.   13. The government already has strong ties to the region. There are vital trade routes  from East and South East Asia which support the global economy. However, the  region also contains a number of disputes over contested features, fishing, or  mining rights. Government is committed to supporting freedom of navigation  and for disputes to be settled in accordance with UNCLOS through established  international legal routes.  14. Sustainable development and maritime security are closely linked in this region  – our £500m Blue Planet Fund44 will help support developing countries in the Indo- Pacific protect and sustainably use vital marine resources and help mitigate and  build resilience to climate change and reduce poverty. We will promote timely  information sharing and associated data exchange through our established  MDA programme and liaison networks based in Maritime Fusion Centres in the  Seychelles, India, and Singapore.   15. Following a Summit between Prime Ministers of the UK and India in 2021, the  two countries agreed to enter into a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership  and agreed the UK/India 2030 Roadmap. The importance of our defence and  security relationship, including in maritime security, was reaffirmed by the  Leaders during the PM’s visit to India in April 2022. The Roadmap will increase  maritime cooperation and coordination through the agreed Western Indian Ocean  Partnership, a Maritime Dialogue and increase engagement with the Indian Ocean  Rim Association. It also supports long-term technological collaboration, joint  capability development and enhances training opportunities. The UK and India  have agreed to closer maritime co-operation in the Indo-Pacific. The UK will join  India’s Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative and become lead partner for the maritime  security pillar, including coordinating work with key partners in Southeast Asia.  The UK shares many of the same opportunities and challenges as maritime nations  in Southeast Asia. We strongly support ASEAN’s Outlook on the Indo-Pacific and  the areas of enhanced maritime cooperation that the framework provides.   16. We will use our new Dialogue Partnership with ASEAN to further strengthen  maritime cooperation in Southeast Asia and help build the capabilities of member   79  National Strategy for Maritime Security Championing our values    states through education, training and exercising. The Quad (Australia, India,  Japan, and the US) has identified maritime security as one of its priorities, and the  UK will seek ways to support these important partners in their maritime security  activity, bilaterally, trilaterally, and potentially collectively.  17. Government will increase our capacity building and training offer to Indo-Pacific  States through longer and more consistent military deployments. Building on  the legacy of substantial defence engagement by the Carrier Strike Group (CSG)  in 2021, the UK has permanently assigned two of the Royal Navy’s newest and  greenest warships, to the Indo-Pacific. These vessels will be followed by a Royal  Navy Littoral Response Group in 2023, and a Type 31 Royal Navy Frigate later  in the decade.   Case Study: Defending UNCLOS in the South China  Sea  A stable and secure South China Sea (SCS) is vital to the UK’s interests in the  Indo-Pacific. Our longstanding position is that we take no sides in the sovereignty  disputes. Our commitment is to international law, in particular UNCLOS, and to  freedom of navigation and overflight. We will uphold the rights and freedoms under  UNCLOS, including the rights of littoral States in their EEZs.   The UK will use a range of tools to promote and defend UNCLOS. In September  2020, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office’s (FCDO) Minister for  Asia put our comprehensive legal position on the SCS on public record for the  first time, parts of which have been have reiterated in subsequent statements, for  example in a joint Note Verbale at the UN in 2020. It is important for the UK, as a  leading maritime nation, to make our position clear on these issues. Where we have  specific concerns, including about militarisation, coercion, and intimidation, we  continue to raise them.   We are working with allies to support ASEAN partners to strengthen regional  capacity on maritime law and security. This includes dialogues, training, and  conferences. Before the Carrier Srike Group (CSG) deployment in 2021, five Royal  Navy ships have navigated the SCS since April 2018 as part of the UK’s consistent  presence in the region. These deployments serve to reinforce our commitment to  regional security and to upholding UNCLOS.

Environmental Challenges  1. The effects of climate change and environmental crimes at sea pose significant  threats. It is essential that these are seen as equal to more immediate, and well  understood, security threats. Many of the security challenges identified in this  strategy can be a consequence of, or exacerbated by, changes to our climate.  2. There are many areas of government’s activity which support environmental  protection, limiting global instability and supporting developing nations. This  strategy considers the breaching of the laws, regulations and norms that  govern our ocean.   82  National Strategy for Maritime Security Supporting a secure, resilient ocean    Image: Mangrove tree roots, above and below  the water in the Caribbean Sea, Panama,  Central America.  3. Internationally, fisheries, aquaculture, and marine and coastal tourism account for  71% of employment in the global ocean economy.45 These sectors and the millions  of livelihoods they support, predominantly in the developing countries, are highly  dependent on the marine environment. Human-caused degradation of the seas and  ocean from overexploitation, climate change and pollution put these livelihoods at  risk and may drive future migration, conflict, and criminal activity.  4. OCGs, among others, play a persistent role in damaging our environment. This may  be through illegal fishing which reduces fish stocks and impacts on the livelihoods  of those working in coastal communities. Or through the dumping of waste which  pollutes the seas putting the livelihood and lives of future generations at risk.  These, and many other, sources of insecurity impact on our homeland and our  people in a significant way.   5. Rising sea levels through climate change bring into question the extent and  location of maritime zones lawfully established under the UNCLOS, creating  uncertainty over rights to exploit biological and mineral resources in the sea and  on the seabed. Some actors may take advantage of this uncertainty by seeking  to exploit resources in areas where there is a lack of clarity as to whether it forms  part of an EEZ or can be considered part of the High Seas. Finding solutions to this  issue, which are consistent with UNCLOS, is important to ensure the wider integrity  of the rules-based order at sea.   83  National Strategy for Maritime Security Supporting a secure, resilient ocean  83    6. The UK has some of the most stringent laws and regulations that govern our  seas, providing continued protection of our interests. Government will continue to  deliver the regulatory, policy and support frameworks needed to protect our marine  environment at home and abroad. Government will seek to continue to build our  understanding of the marine environment through investment in science and data  to enable improved security.  7. Government will continue to make efforts to secure a positive outcome in  UN negotiations for a new legally binding agreement under UNCLOS on the  conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond  national jurisdiction (BBNJ Agreement). Such an agreement would provide for  the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs) in areas beyond national  jurisdiction (ABNJ), which is necessary if we want to achieve protection of 30% of  the global ocean by 2030 and tackle the impacts of climate change on the ocean.  8. Government will use its £500 million Blue Planet Fund, financed from the UK  Official Development Assistance Budget, to help eligible developing countries  reduce poverty, protect, and sustainably manage their marine resources and  address human-generated threats, including activity to tackle IUU fishing.  9. Major pollution incidents have the potential to impact human activities at sea,  people’s livelihoods, and the marine environment. In turn, these impacts risk  destabilising countries and diverting important security resources to support the  incident. The UK has world-leading technical and scientific expertise to support  other governments in managing the risk of a pollution incident and the post- incident response. Government will establish a cross-departmental working  group to strengthen the response to international pollution incidents.  “The UK’s vision is that by 2030 the  ocean will be effectively governed, clean,  healthy, safe, productive and biologically  diverse, linking resilient and prosperous  coastal communities around the world.”  Integrated Review 2021  84  National Strategy for Maritime Security Supporting a secure, resilient ocean    Image: Aerial view of an oil  tanker unloading at port.  Case Study: FSO Safer Current potential pollution incidents of concern include the FSO Safer,  a floating oil storage and offloading vessel, anchored off the coast of  Yemen. Due to ongoing conflict in the region, the vessel has received  little maintenance and now poses a significant pollution risk due to  deterioration of the vessel’s structural integrity. If the vessel were to  break apart the oil on board (estimated to be 1.14 million barrels of  oil) would cause a significant impact in the waters of the Red Sea  and the coastal communities that border it. As of October 2021, it  has been reported that the FSO Safer is at imminent risk of sinking,  fire, or explosion.  In February 2022, the UN reported that an in-principle agreement was  reached to transfer oil and limit the risk the vessel posed. However  until the oil is transferred the imminent risk the FSO Safer poses to the  environment remains.  85    Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing  10. IUU fishing is a significant contributor to overfishing, which remains one of the  most serious threats to the health of the ocean. It depletes fish stocks, distorts  competition, and destroys marine habitats. It jeopardises the foundation of  international efforts to promote better ocean governance, undermines efforts to  manage fisheries properly and can be a key obstacle to achieving environmental  sustainability, food security and social stability.   11. It is estimated that IUU fishing activities are responsible for the loss of 11-26 million  tonnes of fish each year, with a global value of between $10-23billion a year.46  IUU fishing is connected to a range of unlawful activities including transnational  organised fisheries crime, illicit financial activity, and human rights abuses. Fraud  and lack of traceability in the supply chain are central means of enabling the  laundering of illegal marine products.   12. It is imperative that measures are strengthened to tackle IUU fishing in order to  support the UK’s own global maritime security. Acknowledging the threat that  IUU fishing poses globally, it is vital that the UK takes a strong participatory  and influential role bilaterally and within international forums. Government is  committed to being a world leader in the delivery of a sustainable, ecosystem  approach to fisheries by working with key partners to deliver the UN’s’ Sustainable  Development Goal 14.4 to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing.  13. Government will continue to participate in forums such as International Criminal  Police Organization (Interpol), the North Atlantic Fisheries Intelligence Group  (NAFIG), and the Five Eyes group to share vital intelligence towards tackling  fisheries crime and supporting the UK’s maritime security approach.  86  National Strategy for Maritime Security Supporting a secure, resilient ocean    Image: A blonde fur seal coming out of the water in Stromness  Bay, South Georgia, taken by crew of HMS Endurance.  Case Study: Blue Belt Programme –  combatting IUU fishing across UK Overseas  Territories  The FCDO funded Blue Belt Programme protects over four million  square kilometres of marine environment across the UK OT. Key to  the Programme’s work is ensuring that these remote and unique  environments are protected from the threat of IUU fishing. This is  at its highest in the remote outer edges of the UK OTs’ maritime  zones, where vessels in the surrounding high seas may enter and  fish illegally. To prevent illegal fishing activity, a range of monitoring,  compliance and enforcement techniques are employed.  A standout example of this work in action is the interception of the MV  NIKA, which was suspected of fishing illegally in the South Atlantic  in 2019. South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands worked  with international partners, including Interpol, and were assisted by  the Blue Belt team, to initiate the vessel’s seizure and successful  prosecution by Indonesia. It was added to the Commission for  the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR)  contracting party IUU vessel list and de-flagged by Panama.  8787     Image: Trawlers leaving Brixham Harbour Devon.  14. Government will publish a new national plan dedicated to tackling IUU fishing in  2022 and implement it over the next five years.   15. Government will play an active role in Food and Agriculture Organisation of  the United Nations (FAO), Regional Fisheries Management Organisations,  Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, and  International Maritime Organisation to strengthen measures in preventing and  deterring IUU fishing.  16. Government will continue to push internationally for the elimination of subsidies  that enable IUU fishing.  National Strategy for Maritime Security Supporting a secure, resilient ocean  88    Fisheries Control and Enforcement   17. As an independent coastal state, the UK has the ability to establish a fisheries  management system which can enable our seas to flourish alongside a thriving,  sustainable fishing industry. This is in line with the government’s 25-year  environment plan,47 which aims to leave the environment in a better state for  future generations.   18. The UK’s natural marine capital is abundant; with fish stocks worth £1bn in revenue  and a diverse range of marine ecosystems. Our fisheries control and enforcement  authorities are the first, most crucial line of defence in protecting these assets from  a range of threats, most notably over-exploitation.   19. Our ability to effectively control fishing activity, and take enforcement action  where necessary, is critical to achieving this. In addition to existing fisheries  control measures, plans to employ proven remote monitoring technologies where  appropriate will enhance our ability to assure compliance with regulations and  more reliably monitor stock levels. Investment in these technologies, alongside  skilled and trained staff, will increase our ability to achieve a high level of fisheries  control, as well as our agility in managing fishing activity at a more granular level,  based on the best available evidence. This will also enable us to be more flexible  and responsive to more extreme effects wrought by climate change.  20. Alongside this, our fisheries enforcement assets provide a strong deterrent and  enable authorities to take decisive action where incidents of non-compliance occur.  These activities are underpinned by a risk-based and intelligence led strategy,  geared at supporting businesses that are fishing sustainably to thrive, whilst  protecting our seas from those who would exploit it.  21. Fisheries control and enforcement is a devolved matter. As such the Department  for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), and the Devolved Administrations  take forward their own policies and procedures but work closely together to share  information and ensure a coordinated approach to monitoring, compliance, and  enforcement across UK waters.   22. Government will publish a plan dedicated to improving fisheries control and  enforcement in 2022 and implement it over the next five years.   89  National Strategy for Maritime Security Supporting a secure, resilient ocean     Forward Look  1. To meet the maritime security challenges of the future, government has taken a  long-term strategic approach that continues to adapt to a changing international  environment. This has been underpinned by Maritime 2050, the Integrated Review,  Border Security Strategy 2025 and a range of other thematic strategies.  2. This strategy has set out the UK’s activity over the coming five years. During this  period government will work with academia, industry and international institutions  to establish a consistent approach to challenges facing the maritime sector.  Government will continue to deploy hard security, economic security and our  diplomacy to rally international partners and allies.   3. Maritime 2050 set out government’s long term vision for a secure and stable  maritime environment. This strategy forms an important part of realising that vision.  In addressing the short term risks we must also prepare for the medium to long  term challenges facing the UK.  4. Within 24 months, two significant, unexpected challenges have impacted the  international system – COVID19 and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. To prepare for  future threats, government will horizon scan to anticipate and prepare for new  and emerging threats. This will include the shifting geopolitical tensions we have  seen emerge in 2022, climate change, and the deployment of new technologies to  support the maritime industry.  5. We are seeing shifts in geopolitical dynamics, from Russia’s illegal invasion of  Ukraine to an increasing global focus on the Indo Pacific region. Elsewhere in  the world, we are seeing the manifestations of civil unrest and political rivalries  which the UK must continue to monitor in order to protect our maritime interests.  The coming years will likely see increased attempts by states to destabilise the  UK’s maritime interests across the globe. The UK will continue to engage with  international forums and allies to monitor and proactively manage these risks.  90  National Strategy for Maritime Security Forward Look    Image: Ice patrol ship HMS Protector  undertaking ice ramming trials in the arctic circle.  91    6. We must be proactive in recognising and mitigating the long-term impacts of  climate change on maritime security. Sea ice retreat will lead to the opening of new  trade routes that will present new challenges. For example, in the High North where  government is working to maintain the region as one of high cooperation and low  tension, maintain a significant contribution to Arctic science, and ensure increasing  access to the region and its resources are managed sustainably and responsibly.   7. The erosion of land from rising sea levels is also putting pressure on coastal  communities. In Bangladesh, for example, some estimates suggest that a one- metre increase in sea level will reduce land area by 18% and could lead to  25 million refugees.48 The UK will continue to support nations fighting the impacts  of climate change and prevent the contributions to maritime insecurity from both  a displaced population, and the catastrophic environmental impacts on the ocean  that would result.   8. Climate change will also affect the abundance and distribution of marine life.  Government will continue to monitor fish production projections to recognise  where decreases may exacerbate existing inequalities between developed and  developing nations to quickly identify where conflicts over diminished or shifting  resources might arise. Against this background of dwindling and migrating fish  stocks, demand for fish is increasing due to population and economic growth. This  is driving some countries to subsidise their fishing industries to enable them to  seek otherwise unprofitable fishing opportunities further afield. This puts further  pressure on marine biomass and biodiversity in general, increases IUU fishing and  potentially stokes conflict with countries on the other side of the world. The UK  must ensure that the short-term commitments in this strategy are twinned with a  longer-term outlook that takes these trends into account.  9. The strategy discussed how the UK will work with the maritime sector to strengthen  cyber infrastructure to ensure that it is robust against potential attacks. We must  also acknowledge that technology is advancing within the maritime space. This  includes innovations like the use of autonomy and smart shipping technologies  which could lead to fundamental change for the maritime sector, creating new  trade opportunities, and a more efficient and sustainable maritime industry.   92  National Strategy for Maritime Security Forward Look    10. As the development of autonomous and remote operations technology continues,  there is a need to ensure that UK law keeps pace to ensure the safe, secure, and  environmentally sound operation of remotely operated and autonomous vessels.  In September 2021, the Department for Transport launched the consultation ‘Future  of Transport regulatory review’ to seek views on areas of maritime autonomy  regulation that are outdated, a barrier to innovation, or not designed with new  technologies and business models in mind. The government response will be  published in 2022.  11. The UK will continue to monitor these issues, using science and technology to  proactively research and prepare as far as possible. However, we also recognise  that, as we have seen over the previous decade, unexpected geopolitical changes  and unforeseen threats can emerge rapidly.  12. The maritime domain provides significant opportunities to the UK’s national  and international interests, however it also provides many challenges. Through  collaboration and proactive engagement with partners government will continue to  tackle new and emerging threats to our maritime domain. Maintaining a long-term  perspective will help us navigate the path ahead.  Those who think they can win through  oppression, coercion or invasion are being  proved wrong by this new stand on global  security – one that not only seeks to deter,  but also ensures that aggressors fail.49  93  National Strategy for Maritime Security Forward Look     Government activities  following publication of  the National Strategy for  Maritime Security  1. This strategy has set out the key issues and objectives for the UK over the next  five years. The different areas of government activity are supported by the strategic  objectives set out in this Strategy, within higher level Strategies such as the Integrated  Review and Maritime 2050, and the strategies of individual government Departments.  This strategy has taken a whole of government approach to align activity.  2. An implementation group will be formed as the vehicle for overseeing the  activity set out in this strategy. This group will report to Senior Leaders and  Ministers on progress.  3. Government will publish regular reports on the implementation of this strategy,  taking into account changes in the risks posed to the UK’s maritime sector and the  global threat.   Maritime Security Ministerial Small Group (MSMSG):  The MSMSG has been formed to provide strategic direction for longer  term maritime security initiatives.

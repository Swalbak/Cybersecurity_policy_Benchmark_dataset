Networks that have migrated from traditional circuit switched systems to packet switched networks. These include IP networks, ATM Networks and Next Generation Networks for example. Advanced communications services. Services delivered over advanced communications networks, such as the Internet and related services. Asynchronous Transfer Mode Network. A network that uses the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol. The ATM protocol outlines a way to transfer data in packets, or cells. This protocol is very efficient, as it allows different types of information such as voice, data, and video to be transmitted in the same cell. This makes use of every byte of space available on the network at all times and has a higher bandwidth than other types of networks. Broadband. High-speed data transfer connections based on optical infrastructure. T1 (1.5 Mbps) has been widely used as the threshold; however, some countries such as South Korea use T3 (45 Mbps) as the speed threshold for broadband. Broadband technology is based on optical infrastructure. Broadcasting. Broadcasting is a process that sends voice, data, or video signals simultaneously to a group in a specific geographic area or to those connected to a broadcast network system such as a satellite or cable television system. Broadcasting is typically associated with radio, television radio transmission systems and the Internet. Circuit Switched Network. A type of network in which a physical path is obtained for and dedicated to a single connection between two end points in the network for the duration of the connection. ICT Policy for Lesotho 4 Commercial Broadcaster. A broadcaster that is funded solely from private means such as sales and marketing, sponsorships, donations and merchandising but not from Government means. Commercial broadcasters are autonomous from Government and have historically operated with complete editorial freedom. Community Broadcaster. A public broadcaster that provides programming of interest on the local level or for particular communities such as a religious community. Community broadcasters can be funded by Government, non-profits, viewers, through donations and advertising. Digital Divide. The technological gap between countries that have fully exploited ICTs and those that have not. The digital divide is often associated with the resulting gap in terms of economic development. Distance Learning. A method of teaching students in remote locations where educational facilities are not accessible or where desired courses and training are not available. It involves learning through TV, radio, correspondence, the Internet, CD-ROM, video and so on. Electronic Commerce (e-commerce). The process of carrying out business transactions on-line, usually to sell goods or services. E-commerce takes three main forms: business to consumer (B2C) transactions, business to business (B2B) transactions and business to Government (B2G) transactions. Electronic Government (e-Government). Government’s delivery of services and information through the use of ICTs. Encryption. The tools and other means necessary for the protection of data communications, which typically involves the translation of data into a secret code. Global Information System (GIS). A system that provides a framework for data manipulation and display of map data for applications such as: (a) location verification, ICT Policy for Lesotho 5 (b) location correlation, (c) locational relationships, (d) district coding, (e) route analysis, (f) area analysis and (g) mapping/display creation. Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The convergence of computing, information and communications technology. ICT makes possible the fast and worldwide exchange of information, and has the capacity to revolutionise work processes, service delivery, etc. Information Society. Information Society is a term for a society in which the creation, distribution, and manipulation of information has become the most significant economic and cultural activity. Information Economy. An economy where information is the key driver to economic activity. Internet. The collection of interconnected networks that use the Internet Protocol. Internet Protocol (IP). The method or protocol by which data is sent from one computer to another on the Internet. Multimedia. The combination of text, sound, and/or motion video. Multimedia is usually smaller and less expensive than motion pictures and has the possibility of audience interactivity. Interactive elements can include: voice command, mouse manipulation, text entry, touch screen, video capture of the user, or live participation. Next-Generation Network (NGN). NGNs converge three separate networks - the PSTN voice network, the wireless network and the data network (the Internet) - into a common packet infrastructure. This intelligent, highly efficient infrastructure delivers a host of new technologies, applications, and services that are more flexible, scalable and cost- efficient than services that have been offered in the past. One key NGN service is the voice portal, which provides callers with anywhere, anytime access to Web-based information ICT Policy for Lesotho 6 Portal. A gateway through which users navigate the Web gaining access to a wide range of resources and services, such as email, forums, websites and search engines. Private automatic branch exchange (PABX). An automatic telephone switching system within a private enterprise. Public Broadcaster. A public broadcaster has traditionally been subsidised by Government or supported directly by viewers. Nowadays, public broadcasters are not beholden to advertisers, political parties or Government and exercise complete editorial freedom. More and more, public broadcasters are taking on a mixed commercial model, sourcing funds through a mix of advertising and public monies. Short Message Service (SMS). A text message service that enables short messages of generally no more than 140-160 characters in length to be sent and received from a cell phone. SMS is supported by all digital-based mobile communications systems. Telecentre. A public place where anyone can pay to use ICT services. These services include but are not limited to the Internet, email, fax, telephone service, photo coping and other electronic information services. Telemedicine.

World Wide Web (WWW). Hypertext servers (HTTP), which are the servers that allow text, graphics and sound files to be mixed together on the Internet. ICT Policy for Lesotho 8 FOREWORD The constant evolution of technology brings about major paradigm shifts in human society. For example, our ability to develop technologies to harness food and energy from plants and animals and later from non-living sources such as coal, water, solar and wind led to the agricultural and industrial revolutions. Recent advancements in communications, computing and information technologies have brought about today’s Information Revolution. As in times past, this new paradigm requires that we learn new skills, employ new technologies and use different resources. Most importantly, we must learn to use technology to do things differently. Information has become the most valuable instrument for development in the Information Age. The key is to use it in such a way as to leap frog stages of development in order to rapidly attain a thriving economy and a society where each individual can achieve her or his full potential. In our quest to achieve prosperity, we should not lose sight of the opportunities offered by the technologies driving the Information Revolution to preserve our culture, expand our horizons and develop a more participatory democracy. The Ministry of Communications, Science and Technology has formulated this ICT Policy to provide the nation with a vision and strategy for becoming a fully integrated member of the Information Society. The policy is intended to unite Government, industry, civil society and the general public in the achievement of its national development goals. It identifies key areas of the economy that will serve as catalysts in driving the policy towards its fruition. It endeavors to reduce the digital divide between the “haves” and the “have nots,” to promote gender equality, protect the environment and to improve food security and the standard of living of all Basotho. It also strives to promote a healthy society capable of exploiting the full potential of ICTs. This is a tall order considering that less than one percent of the population owns a computer or has access to the Internet. Only eight percent own a telephone and fewer still have access to electrical power. And, all too frequently, those with access to information and communications technologies do not fully understand how to use them. The nation’s ICT Policy for Lesotho 9 low GDP per capita further constrains the ability of industry, institutions and individuals to invest in and make use of ICTs. The implementation of this policy will be an immense challenge for Lesotho with its limited financial resources and low levels of ICT penetration and literacy. Political leadership and a shared vision will be critical to its success. I am confident that we will succeed in this grand undertaking to transform our nation into a knowledge-based society and call upon all stakeholders to actively participate. Motsoahae Thomas Thabane MP Minister of Communications, Science and Technology ICT Policy for Lesotho 10 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Government has developed the Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) Policy as tool to enable Lesotho to achieve its development goals as articulated in the Lesotho Vision 2020 Policy Document and the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. The policy supercedes the Lesotho Telecommunications Policy of 1999, which has basically set up the appropriate institutional framework for policy formulation, regulation and operations in the Telecommunications sector. While one of the major goals of the 1999 policy was to encourage the deployment of ICT infrastructure in the country, this particular policy takes the mandate further to give direction as to how the proposed Information and Communications Technologies could be utilised to open up new opportunities, improve service delivery and hence ease the grip of poverty on the Basotho Nation. The policy paper is structured in such a manner that the first chapter introduces the concept of ICT. The role of information in development and the importance of ICTs are introduced after a brief explanation of ICT has been provided. The picture is then completed by elaborating on the rationale of this particular policy. The second chapter considers the guiding principles behind this particular policy. The Vision and mission together with the overall goals, objectives and the strategies of the policy are articulately spelt out in this section of the document. The various stakeholders and the roles they are expected to play towards the actualisation of the policy goals are presented in chapter 3. Specifically, the policy identifies ten cross cutting catalysts that would provide the strategic framework needed to guide the successful implementation of the policy. These are ICT supporting infrastructure, Education and Human Resource Development, Enabling Legal and Regulatory framework, Rapid Delivery of ICT Services, E-Government, E-Commerce, Health, Agriculture and Food Security, Tourism and Environment and lastly, Gender and Youth. Each of the above cross cutting issue is dealt with under its own section. There is a brief introduction for each of these issues, which explain its importance, and where the country ICT Policy for Lesotho 11 is or has done as far as that particular subject is concerned. That is followed by the policy objectives and strategies on that particular subject. Policy measures, instruments and initiatives of each of the above captioned cross cutting catalysts wrap up the sections. The last chapter concentrates on the institutional framework for the policy implementation. The chapter allocates responsibilities and tasks to the various stakeholders as far as ICT promotion and coordination, resource mobilisation, monitoring, evaluation, regional and international coordination and sector restructuring are concerned. ICT Policy for Lesotho 12 1.0 CHAPTER 1 THE ICT POLICY CONTEXT 1.1 Introduction Integration of Lesotho into the global information society calls for development of an effective policy and regulatory framework for the implementation of such a strategy. The ICT policy developed here is cognizant of converged technologies. It captures the Dynamic and pervasive nature of the technology. 1.2 The Role of Information in Development Sustainable social and economic development in today’s Information Age is contingent upon each citizen’s ability to access, process and create information. In times past, we searched for gold, precious stones, minerals and ore. Today, it is knowledge that makes us rich and access to information is all-powerful in enabling individual and collective success. Information is also key to meaningful participation in the political process. For example, the free flow of information between policymakers and the public will increase the success of Government initiatives in such areas as poverty reduction and HIV and AIDS awareness and prevention programmes. It will also more closely align Government strategies with the needs of the people. The wide availability of information regarding social services, job creation and education will provide the foundation for individual empowerment, national unity and a stimulus for a thriving economy. If Lesotho is to become a fully integrated and prosperous member of the global economy, it must recognise that information is power, critical to economic growth and sustainable development. In addition, as stated in the Lesotho Vision 2020 policy document, “all Basotho need to have a unity of purpose, well-thought-out strategies and a determination to succeed” if this dream is to become a reality. ICT Policy for Lesotho 13 1.3 Definition of Information and Communication Technology Information and communication technology (ICT) is the convergence of communications, computing and information technologies. This convergence has resulted in the development of new and improved services delivered over a diverse range of technological platforms. Today, ICT encompasses telecommunications - fixed and wireless, broadcasting, multi-media, software development, electronic publishing, information storage and retrieval, email, distance learning, telemedicine, postal services, electronic commerce, the Internet and much more. In the years to come, we can anticipate an ever-expanding cornucopia of ICT products and services that will continually transform our lives and the world in which we live. 1.4 The Importance of ICT ICTs can have a wizard effect on speeding the development process of the country. ICTs make it possible to deliver information by means of voice, text, data, video and graphics faster and more efficiently than before. Furthermore, the constantly evolving range and quality of ICT delivery platforms is improving the availability and affordability of accessing of information. These developments provide an enabling environment for Government to work with the private sector and civil society to improve and expand access to information for all its citizens. For example, ICTs can be used to reduce inequalities among the sexes, by providing women with greater access to meaningful information. They can also be used to improve the lives of the disabled with technologies that enable the deaf to communicate more effectively with the hearing world and the physically immobilised to study and work from home through the Internet. Telemedicine applications can save lives in rural areas by speeding diagnosis and treatment for the isolated. Distance education provides an inexpensive and effective means of developing the human resource capacity throughout the country. E-Government services improve access to and knowledge of Government services as well as provide a vehicle for strengthening democracy. ICT Policy for Lesotho 14 1.5 Rationale for Lesotho’s ICT Policy The dream of a prospering Lesotho, fully integrated in the global economy cannot be realised without a well designed strategy. In order for Lesotho to seize and obtain maximum benefits from the opportunities provided by ICTs, it needs a roadmap that clearly defines what is to be done, when and how it will be done and who is going to do it. The Government having developed the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Policy as a tool to enable Lesotho to achieve its development goals as articulated in the Lesotho Vision 2020 Policy Document and the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper is now in a position to set up the appropriate institutional framework for policy formulation, regulation and operations in the sector. An ICT policy is needed to channel and mobilise the investment required to accomplish its great ambitions. It is needed to provide guidance to lawmakers in their review of existing laws and regulations and requisite changes, as well as in the development of new legal instruments to support the transition to an information economy. Therefore, the rationale for developing this ICT policy is based upon the need to: • Create a roadmap for ICT development, attract and mobilise internal and external investment. • Co-ordinate the efforts of Government, the private sector, civil society and individuals in order to ensure a shared vision for the ICT sector, avoid fragmentation of resources and to maximise utilisation of scarce resources. • Ensure that Lesotho is a dynamic member of the global economy and Information Society. • Guide the delivery and creation of electronic information across all sectors in order to provide Government, individuals, the private sector and civil society with the resources and tools needed to participate in the Global Information Society. • Stimulate the development of national infrastructure needed to support the delivery of ICT services throughout the country and provide universal access to information and knowledge. ICT Policy for Lesotho 15 • Develop a transparent and effective legal and regulatory framework that promotes investment in the ICT sector and embraces technological innovation. • Channel delivery of ICT services and applications so as to achieve national development goals such as food security, poverty reduction, a healthy population and a stable democracy. • Develop the human capacity needed to drive and sustain an information economy. ICT Policy for Lesotho 16 2.0 CHAPTER 2 Road Map To Information Society 2.1 Guiding Principles There are many challenges that the country will face in its implementation of a policy of this magnitude. Key among these challenges is the assurance of a unified approach through all sectors of Government. In this endeavour, Government must be the key driver of the policy, actively engaging the public in the process. Additionally, the dream of a Lesotho as a fully incorporated member of the Information Society cannot be achieved without networks to carry services. At the same time, people cannot make use of networks if they do not know how to use them, cannot afford to access them or if the information flowing over them lacks relevance to their lives. To help ensure that these challenges do not become obstacles to the successful implementation of the ICT policy, Lesotho shall be guided, among others, by the following principles: • Political commitment and proactive leadership in the implementation of the policy, including a leadership role in the attraction and mobilisation of investment needed to achieve policy goals and strategies. • Good governance such as transparency, accountability and the Rule of Law. • Commitment to the principles of the freedom of the press and the right to information, as well as the independence, pluralism and diversity of the media. • Public-private partnerships shall be the primary vehicle in the implementation of the ICT policy. • Legislation that encourages transparent and effective regulation that takes into account the convergence of technologies in a technology neutral manner. • Legislation that promotes the use of electronic environments for both consumers and industry. • Close alignment with current and future short, medium and long-term national development goals such as the Poverty Reduction Strategy and the National Vision for Lesotho 2020. ICT Policy for Lesotho 17 • Development of supporting infrastructure such as advanced communications networks, electrical power and roads essential for the delivery of universal access of ICT’s. • Cognizance of the information needs of all of society, including women, youth, the disabled, the elderly and the disenfranchised. • Government’s commitment to establish coordination mechanisms to promote integration across sectors and to lead public awareness campaigns • Alignment with regional and global policies and best practices. The genesis of this policy derives from Government’s; • Recognition of the strategic opportunities and benefits that information and communication technologies can offer to accelerate social and economic development. • Realisation that the ability to create, access, utilise and share information and knowledge is key to effective participation and wealth creation in the 21st century. • Belief that advanced communications networks, accessible to everyone, are critical to ensuring that all Basotho have the necessary resources to benefit from ICTs . • Acknowledgment of the need for national coordination among stakeholders to ensure that all sectors of the economy harness the potential of ICTs to support development goals. • Awareness of its leadership role for the transition to a knowledge-based economy and of the importance of enriching its human resource base. • Cognisance of the technological innovations that have led to convergence in communications, computing and information services and necessitated the need for a new regulatory framework that promotes technology neutral paradigms. • Understanding that as the Information Society is a global phenomenon, national efforts need to be supported by international and regional cooperation among Governments, the private sector, civil society and financial institutions. ICT Policy for Lesotho 18 2.2 Vision “To create a knowledge-based society fully integrated in the global economy by 2020.” This ICT vision anticipates that by year 2015, Lesotho will have successfully developed and deployed ICTs that: • Respond to national needs and priorities. • Reduce inequalities between the sexes, and decrease the digital divide between urban and rural areas and the haves and have-nots. • Improve governance and deepen democracy. • Develop the human capacity needed to drive and sustain an information economy. • Support its economic activities at home and throughout the world. 2.3 Mission “To fully integrate information and communications technologies throughout all sectors of the economy in order to realise rapid, sustainable socio-economic development.” As Lesotho charts its course to join and fully participate in the global economy, it must embrace strategies to develop and deliver information to all its citizens. Thus, the vision and mission of the Government must be to create knowledge to fuel all sectors of the economy and enrich the intellectual capital of the nation. This policy strives to incorporate ICTs in the everyday life of the Basotho, so as to realise the vision of a Lesotho that is fully integrated in the global economy. A parallel goal is to promote the use of appropriate, scalable ICT services and applications so as to eradicate poverty, strengthen democracy and improve quality of the life for all. ICT Policy for Lesotho 19 2.4 Goals The overall ICT policy goals are to: • Increase wealth creation and improve lives through the adoption and use of ICTs. • Promote affordable, universal access to ICT products and services. • Promote effective regulation of the sector by establishing rules and regulations that promote competition, protect and educate the consumer, create a level playing field among operators and service providers and encourage local and foreign investment in the ICT sector. • Increase ICT literacy levels in the country. • Coordinate the implementation of ICTs throughout the economy. • Develop the human resource capacity in ICTs to meet the changing demands of the national and the global economy. • Develop standards, practices and guidelines to support the deployment and exploitation of ICTs. • Provide mechanisms for empowering local participation of Basotho in the ICT sector. 2.5 Objectives The overall objectives of the ICT policy are to: • Create awareness among all stakeholders; Government, the private sector, civil society and the general public, about the importance of integrating ICTs in Lesotho’s development process. • Facilitate the deployment of a national broadband backbone network to enable the delivery of ICT services and products, to meet universal access goals. • Mobilise resources, attract investment and establish innovative financing mechanisms needed to realise ICT policy goals. • Facilitate the broadest possible access to public domain information.

Due to convergence of technologies, the responsibilities of this regulator need to be expanded. Furthermore, new legislation is needed to ensure that the sector embraces technological innovation in such a way as to benefit both providers and consumers of ICTs. Legislation is also needed to safeguard the interests of consumers and producers of information in electronic environments. Government is committed to establishing a harmonized legal and regulatory framework that takes into account converging communications technologies, services and delivery platforms. It is also committed to protecting individuals and corporations, from some of the undesirable aspects inherent in the transformation to an information economy. Government further recognises the importance of an effective regulator that performs its functions consistently, comprehensively and fairly in a transparent manner.

Advanced communications services. Services delivered over advanced communications   networks, such as the Internet and related services.      Asynchronous Transfer Mode Network. A network that uses the Asynchronous   Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol. The ATM protocol outlines a way to transfer data in   packets, or cells. This protocol is very efficient, as it allows different types of information   such as voice, data, and video to be transmitted in the same cell. This makes use of every   byte of space available on the network at all times and has a higher bandwidth than other   types of networks.      Broadband. High-speed data transfer connections based on optical infrastructure. T1   (1.5 Mbps) has been widely used as the threshold; however, some countries such as South   Korea use T3 (45 Mbps) as the speed threshold for broadband. Broadband technology is   based on optical infrastructure.    Broadcasting. Broadcasting is a process that sends voice, data, or video signals   simultaneously to a group in a specific geographic area or to those connected to a   broadcast network system such as a satellite or cable television system. Broadcasting is   typically associated with radio, television radio transmission systems and the Internet.    Circuit Switched Network. A type of network in which a physical path is obtained for   and dedicated to a single connection between two end points in the network for the   duration of the connection.         ICT Policy for Lesotho 4  Commercial Broadcaster. A broadcaster that is funded solely from private means such   as sales and marketing, sponsorships, donations and merchandising but not from   Government means. Commercial broadcasters are autonomous from Government and   have historically operated with complete editorial freedom.      Community Broadcaster. A public broadcaster that provides programming of interest   on the local level or for particular communities such as a religious community.   Community broadcasters can be funded by Government, non-profits, viewers, through   donations and advertising.       Digital Divide. The technological gap between countries that have fully exploited ICTs   and those that have not. The digital divide is often associated with the resulting gap in   terms of economic development.      Distance Learning. A method of teaching students in remote locations where   educational facilities are not accessible or where desired courses and training are not   available. It involves learning through TV, radio, correspondence, the Internet, CD-ROM,   video and so on.       Electronic Commerce (e-commerce). The process of carrying out business transactions   on-line, usually to sell goods or services. E-commerce takes three main forms: business   to consumer (B2C) transactions, business to business (B2B) transactions and business to   Government (B2G) transactions.      Electronic Government (e-Government). Government’s delivery of services and   information through the use of ICTs.      Encryption.

ICT Policy for Lesotho 8  FOREWORD  The constant evolution of technology brings about major paradigm shifts in human   society. For example, our ability to develop technologies to harness food and energy from   plants and animals and later from non-living sources such as coal, water, solar and wind   led to the agricultural and industrial revolutions. Recent advancements in   communications, computing and information technologies have brought about today’s   Information Revolution. As in times past, this new paradigm requires that we learn new   skills, employ new technologies and use different resources. Most importantly, we must   learn to use technology to do things differently.      Information has become the most valuable instrument for development in the Information   Age. The key is to use it in such a way as to leap frog stages of development in order to   rapidly attain a thriving economy and a society where each individual can achieve her or   his full potential.  In our quest to achieve prosperity, we should not lose sight of the   opportunities offered by the technologies driving the Information Revolution to preserve   our culture, expand our horizons and develop a more participatory democracy.      The Ministry of Communications, Science and Technology has formulated this ICT   Policy to provide the nation with a vision and strategy for becoming a fully integrated   member of the Information Society.  The policy is intended to unite Government,   industry, civil society and the general public in the achievement of its national   development goals. It identifies key areas of the economy that will serve as catalysts in   driving the policy towards its fruition. It endeavors to reduce the digital divide between   the “haves” and the “have nots,” to promote gender equality, protect the environment and   to improve food security and the standard of living of all Basotho. It also strives to   promote a healthy society capable of exploiting the full potential of ICTs.      This is a tall order considering that less than one percent of the population owns a   computer or has access to the Internet. Only eight percent own a telephone and fewer still   have access to electrical power. And, all too frequently, those with access to information   and communications technologies do not fully understand how to use them. The nation’s     ICT Policy for Lesotho 9  low GDP per capita further constrains the ability of industry, institutions and individuals   to invest in and make use of ICTs.      The implementation of this policy will be an immense challenge for Lesotho with its   limited financial resources and low levels of ICT penetration and literacy.  Political   leadership and a shared vision will be critical to its success. I am confident that we will   succeed in this grand undertaking to transform our nation into a knowledge-based society   and call upon all stakeholders to actively participate.         Motsoahae Thomas Thabane MP   Minister of Communications, Science and Technology     ICT Policy for Lesotho 10  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  The Government has developed the Information and Communications Technologies   (ICT) Policy as tool to enable Lesotho to achieve its development goals as articulated in   the Lesotho Vision 2020 Policy Document and the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper.   The policy supercedes the Lesotho Telecommunications Policy of 1999, which has   basically set up the appropriate institutional framework for policy formulation, regulation   and operations in the Telecommunications sector. While one of the major goals of the   1999 policy was to encourage the deployment of ICT infrastructure in the country, this   particular policy takes the mandate further to give direction as to how the proposed   Information and Communications Technologies could be utilised to open up new   opportunities, improve service delivery and hence ease the grip of poverty on the Basotho   Nation.      The policy paper is structured in such a manner that the first chapter introduces the   concept of ICT.  The role of information in development and the importance of ICTs are   introduced after a brief explanation of ICT has been provided.  The picture is then   completed by elaborating on the rationale of this particular policy. The second chapter   considers the guiding principles behind this particular policy. The Vision and mission   together with the overall goals, objectives and the strategies of the policy are articulately   spelt out in this section of the document.      The various stakeholders and the roles they are expected to play towards the actualisation   of the policy goals are presented in chapter 3. Specifically, the policy identifies ten cross   cutting catalysts that would provide the strategic framework needed to guide the   successful implementation of the policy. These are ICT supporting infrastructure,   Education and Human Resource Development, Enabling Legal and Regulatory   framework, Rapid Delivery of ICT Services, E-Government, E-Commerce, Health,   Agriculture and Food Security, Tourism and Environment and lastly, Gender and Youth.        Each of the above cross cutting issue is dealt with under its own section. There is a brief   introduction for each of these issues, which explain its importance, and where the country     ICT Policy for Lesotho 11  is or has done as far as that particular subject is concerned. That is followed by the policy   objectives and strategies on that particular subject. Policy measures, instruments and   initiatives of each of the above captioned cross cutting catalysts wrap up the sections.        The last chapter concentrates on the institutional framework for the policy   implementation. The chapter allocates responsibilities and tasks to the various   stakeholders as far as ICT promotion and coordination, resource mobilisation,   monitoring, evaluation, regional and international coordination and sector restructuring   are concerned.     ICT Policy for Lesotho 12     1.0  CHAPTER 1 THE ICT POLICY CONTEXT      1.1 Introduction   Integration of Lesotho into the global information society calls for development of an   effective policy and regulatory framework for the implementation of such a strategy. The   ICT policy developed here is cognizant of converged technologies. It captures the   Dynamic and pervasive nature of the technology.   1.2 The Role of Information in Development   Sustainable social and economic development in today’s Information Age is contingent   upon each citizen’s ability to access, process and create information. In times past, we   searched for gold, precious stones, minerals and ore. Today, it is knowledge that makes   us rich and access to information is all-powerful in enabling individual and collective   success.       Information is also key to meaningful participation in the political process. For example,   the free flow of information between policymakers and the public will increase the   success of Government initiatives in such areas as poverty reduction and HIV and AIDS   awareness and prevention programmes. It will also more closely align Government   strategies with the needs of the people. The wide availability of information regarding   social services, job creation and education will provide the foundation for individual   empowerment, national unity and a stimulus for a thriving economy.            If Lesotho is to become a fully integrated and prosperous member of the global economy,   it must recognise that information is power, critical to economic growth and sustainable   development.  In addition, as stated in the Lesotho Vision 2020 policy document, “all   Basotho need to have a unity of purpose, well-thought-out strategies and a determination   to succeed” if this dream is to become a reality.      ICT Policy for Lesotho 13  1.3 Definition of Information and Communication Technology   Information and communication technology (ICT) is the convergence of   communications, computing and information technologies. This convergence has resulted   in the development of new and improved services delivered over a diverse range of   technological platforms. Today, ICT encompasses telecommunications - fixed and   wireless, broadcasting, multi-media, software development, electronic publishing,   information storage and retrieval, email, distance learning, telemedicine, postal services,   electronic commerce, the Internet and much more. In the years to come, we can anticipate   an ever-expanding cornucopia of ICT products and services that will continually   transform our lives and the world in which we live.   1.4 The Importance of ICT   ICTs can have a wizard effect on speeding the development process of the country. ICTs   make it possible to deliver information by means of voice, text, data, video and graphics   faster and more efficiently than before. Furthermore, the constantly evolving range and   quality of ICT delivery platforms is improving the availability and affordability of   accessing of information. These developments provide an enabling environment for   Government to work with the private sector and civil society to improve and expand   access to information for all its citizens.       For example, ICTs can be used to reduce inequalities among the sexes, by providing   women with greater access to meaningful information. They can also be used to improve   the lives of the disabled with technologies that enable the deaf to communicate more   effectively with the hearing world and the physically immobilised to study and work   from home through the Internet. Telemedicine applications can save lives in rural areas   by speeding diagnosis and treatment for the isolated.  Distance education provides an   inexpensive and effective means of developing the human resource capacity throughout   the country. E-Government services improve access to and knowledge of Government   services as well as provide a vehicle for strengthening democracy.      ICT Policy for Lesotho 14  1.5 Rationale for Lesotho’s ICT Policy   The dream of a prospering Lesotho, fully integrated in the global economy cannot be   realised without a well designed strategy. In order for Lesotho to seize and obtain   maximum benefits from the opportunities provided by ICTs, it needs a roadmap that   clearly defines what is to be done, when and how it will be done and who is going to do   it.   The Government having developed the Information and Communication Technology   (ICT) Policy as a tool to enable Lesotho to achieve its development goals as articulated in   the Lesotho Vision 2020 Policy Document and the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper is   now in a position to set up the appropriate institutional framework for policy formulation,   regulation and operations in the sector.       An ICT policy is needed to channel and mobilise the investment required to accomplish   its great ambitions. It is needed to provide guidance to lawmakers in their review of   existing laws and regulations and requisite changes, as well as in the development of new   legal instruments to support the transition to an information economy.         Therefore, the rationale for developing this ICT policy is based upon the need to:   • Create a roadmap for ICT development, attract and mobilise internal and external   investment.   • Co-ordinate the efforts of Government, the private sector, civil society and   individuals in order to ensure a shared vision for the ICT sector, avoid fragmentation   of resources and to maximise utilisation of scarce resources.   • Ensure that Lesotho is a dynamic member of the global economy and Information   Society.   • Guide the delivery and creation of electronic information across all sectors in order to   provide Government, individuals, the private sector and civil society with the   resources and tools needed to participate in the Global Information Society.   • Stimulate the development of national infrastructure needed to support the delivery of   ICT services throughout the country and provide universal access to information and   knowledge.     ICT Policy for Lesotho 15  • Develop a transparent and effective legal and regulatory framework that promotes   investment in the ICT sector and embraces technological innovation.   • Channel delivery of ICT services and applications so as to achieve national   development goals such as food security, poverty reduction, a healthy population and   a stable democracy.   • Develop the human capacity needed to drive and sustain an information economy.     ICT Policy for Lesotho 16  2.0 CHAPTER 2 Road Map To Information Society     2.1 Guiding Principles   There are many challenges that the country will face in its implementation of a policy of   this magnitude. Key among these challenges is the assurance of a unified approach   through all sectors of Government. In this endeavour, Government must be the key driver   of the policy, actively engaging the public in the process. Additionally, the dream of a   Lesotho as a fully incorporated member of the Information Society cannot be achieved   without networks to carry services. At the same time, people cannot make use of   networks if they do not know how to use them, cannot afford to access them or if the   information flowing over them lacks relevance to their lives.  To help ensure that these   challenges do not become obstacles to the successful implementation of the ICT policy,   Lesotho shall be guided, among others, by the following principles:      • Political commitment and proactive leadership in the implementation of the   policy, including a leadership role in the attraction and mobilisation of investment   needed to achieve policy goals and strategies.   • Good governance such as transparency, accountability and the Rule of Law.   • Commitment to the principles of the freedom of the press and the right to   information, as well as the independence, pluralism and diversity of the media.   • Public-private partnerships shall be the primary vehicle in the implementation of   the ICT policy.   • Legislation that encourages transparent and effective regulation that takes into   account the convergence of technologies in a technology neutral manner.   • Legislation that promotes the use of electronic environments for both consumers   and industry.   • Close alignment with current and future short, medium and long-term national   development goals such as the Poverty Reduction Strategy and the National   Vision for Lesotho 2020.     ICT Policy for Lesotho 17  • Development of supporting infrastructure such as advanced communications   networks, electrical power and roads essential for the delivery of universal access   of ICT’s.   • Cognizance of the information needs of all of society, including women, youth,   the disabled, the elderly and the disenfranchised.   • Government’s commitment to establish coordination mechanisms to promote   integration across sectors and to lead public awareness campaigns    • Alignment with regional and global policies and best practices.      The genesis of this policy derives from Government’s;   • Recognition of the strategic opportunities and benefits that information and   communication technologies can offer to accelerate social and economic   development.   • Realisation that the ability to create, access, utilise and share information and   knowledge is key to effective participation and wealth creation in the 21st century.   • Belief that advanced communications networks, accessible to everyone, are   critical to ensuring that all Basotho have the necessary resources to benefit from   ICTs .   • Acknowledgment of the need for national coordination among stakeholders to   ensure that all sectors of the economy harness the potential of ICTs to support   development goals.   • Awareness of its leadership role for the transition to a knowledge-based economy   and of the importance of enriching its human resource base.   • Cognisance of the technological innovations that have led to convergence in   communications, computing and information services and necessitated the need   for a new regulatory framework that promotes technology neutral paradigms.   • Understanding that as the Information Society is a global phenomenon, national   efforts need to be supported by international and regional cooperation among   Governments, the private sector, civil society and financial institutions.     ICT Policy for Lesotho 18     2.2 Vision      “To create a knowledge-based society fully integrated in the global economy by 2020.”      This ICT vision anticipates that by year 2015, Lesotho will have successfully developed   and deployed ICTs that:       • Respond to national needs and priorities.   • Reduce inequalities between the sexes, and decrease the digital divide between   urban and rural areas and the haves and have-nots.   • Improve governance and deepen democracy.   • Develop the human capacity needed to drive and sustain an information economy.   • Support its economic activities at home and throughout the world.      2.3 Mission      “To fully integrate information and communications technologies throughout all sectors   of the economy in order to realise rapid, sustainable socio-economic development.”      As Lesotho charts its course to join and fully participate in the global economy, it must   embrace strategies to develop and deliver information to all its citizens. Thus, the vision   and mission of the Government must be to create knowledge to fuel all sectors of the   economy and enrich the intellectual capital of the nation.      This policy strives to incorporate ICTs in the everyday life of the Basotho, so as to realise   the vision of a Lesotho that is fully integrated in the global economy. A parallel goal is to   promote the use of appropriate, scalable ICT services and applications so as to eradicate   poverty, strengthen democracy and improve quality of the life for all.      ICT Policy for Lesotho 19  2.4 Goals    The overall ICT policy goals are to:   • Increase wealth creation and improve lives through the adoption and use of   ICTs.   • Promote affordable, universal access to ICT products and services.   • Promote effective regulation of the sector by establishing rules and regulations   that promote competition, protect and educate the consumer, create a level   playing field among operators and service providers and encourage local and   foreign investment in the ICT sector.   • Increase ICT literacy levels in the country.   • Coordinate the implementation of ICTs throughout the economy.   • Develop the human resource capacity in ICTs to meet the changing demands   of the national and the global economy.   • Develop standards, practices and guidelines to support the deployment and   exploitation of ICTs.   • Provide mechanisms for empowering local participation of Basotho in the ICT   sector.      2.5 Objectives      The overall objectives of the ICT policy are to:    • Create awareness among all stakeholders; Government, the private sector,   civil society and the general public, about the importance of integrating ICTs   in Lesotho’s development process.   • Facilitate the deployment of a national broadband backbone network to   enable the delivery of ICT services and products, to meet universal access   goals.   • Mobilise resources, attract investment and establish innovative financing   mechanisms needed to realise ICT policy goals.   • Facilitate the broadest possible access to public domain information.     ICT Policy for Lesotho 20  • Promote the development and dissemination of local ICT products and   services.   • Promote usage of ICTs throughout all sectors of society including   disadvantaged groups.   • Strengthen the existing ICT institutional, legal and regulatory framework.   • Create a conducive and secure environment for producers and consumers of   information over electronic networks.   • Promote collaboration and co-ordination among all sectors of the economy   and at regional and international levels.   2.6 Strategies   To drive and channel the development of an Information Economy, Government as a   leader, in collaboration with other stakeholders, is committed to the following overall   strategies      1. Establishing legal and institutional mechanisms to ensure the successful   implementation of the ICT policy by:   • Developing an enabling legal and regulatory framework that balances the   interests of consumers with creating an environment that fosters a robust and   profitable ICT sector.   • Enacting new laws to promote trust and confidence in a digital environment.   • Putting in place a sustainable institutional framework to coordinate, support   and monitor the implementation of the ICT policy, strategies and plans.   • Ensuring that policies, rules and regulations developed for the ICT sector   advocate regulatory transparency, protect the consumer, promote competition   and support technological neutrality.      2.

The country needs a human resource base that can support   the deployment and exploitation of ICT services and technologies driving an information   economy. Thus, investments must be made in all levels of formal education.  Government   in partnership with the private sector will work towards creating training opportunities   and promoting an environment that is conducive to job creation and job enrichment in the   ICT sector.      ICT Policy for Lesotho 29  3.2.1 Policy Objectives and Strategies   There is a limited supply of qualified ICT professionals in the country and the high cost   of ICT training programmes serves as a barrier to building capacity in this area.     Educators frequently lack ICT literacy and expertise and thus, in many cases, have been   ineffective at integrating and utilising existing ICTs in schools.  Furthermore, the high   cost of equipment deters educators from making the purchase of computers and Internet   connectivity a priority when schools lack basic amenities and educational supplies.       Government is committed to a comprehensive programme of rapid deployment,   utilisation and exploitation of ICTs within the formal educational system as well as   vocational institutions. Policy efforts shall be directed at using ICTs to facilitate   education and life long learning and to support efforts of the private sector in its delivery   of on-the-job training and re-training programmes.       Objectives   The objectives that will lead to effective education and human resource development   include   • Facilitate the deployment, utilisation and exploitation of ICTs within the   educational system to improve access to information so as to support teaching and   learning at all levels.   • Transform Lesotho into an ICT literate nation by promoting ICT awareness and   computer literacy throughout the education system and within the public at large.   • Use ICTs to develop the education system to improve and expand access to   educational training and research resources and facilities.   • Broaden access to education and training opportunities by promoting electronic   distance education and virtual learning.    • Promote and facilitate programmes designed to improve job skills within the   public and private sectors.   • Build and retain a critical mass of ICT professionals needed to manage innovation   in the country.        ICT Policy for Lesotho 30  Strategies      Strategies to be employed to achieve these objectives are to:   • Encourage all educational institutions to invest in computers and to connect to the   Internet.   • Promote electronic distance learning, training and virtual learning systems to   compliment and supplement campus-based education and training systems.   • Develop ICT curricula for all levels of the education system.   • Encourage collaboration between local and international educational institutions   to facilitate educational exchange and promotion of ICT education and training      • Work with the private sector to create affordable packages and schemes under   which students, teachers and educational institutions can afford ICT Products and   services.   • Use electronic educational management and information systems to improve the   management of educational institutions.   • Develop mechanisms to retain a large pool of ICT professionals to meet the needs   of the country.   • Establish and enforce standards for the certification of ICT professional skills.   • Encourage life-long learning among the population at large and promote on-the-   job training and retraining within the public and private sectors.   • Improve access to education to people with disabilities.   • Encourage public and private sector apprenticeship programs, internships, co-  opts, and work-study programmes.   • Develop and promote programmes and initiatives for enhancing ICT skills within   the existing workforce in educational institutions, industry and Government.   3.2.2.

ICT Policy for Lesotho 32     3.3 Enabling Legal and Regulatory Framework   The vision of a thriving ICT sector that fuels the whole economy will only be realised   through an enabling legal and regulatory framework. Government will ensure that legal   and regulatory instruments are in place to promote investment needed to develop and   deliver ICTs throughout the country. Efforts will also be made to ensure that the interests   of consumers are equally balanced with creating an environment that fosters a robust and   profitable ICT sector.      The key-determining factor in fostering investment is the assurance of an independent   regulator that is accountable to the sector and conducts its business in a transparent and   consistent manner.       3.3.1 Policy Objectives and Strategies     The Lesotho Telecommunications Authority Act of 2000 established an autonomous and   independent regulatory authority to govern the telecommunications sector. Due to   convergence of technologies, the responsibilities of this regulator need to be expanded.   Furthermore, new legislation is needed to ensure that the sector embraces technological   innovation in such a way as to benefit both providers and consumers of ICTs. Legislation   is also needed to safeguard the interests of consumers and producers of information in   electronic environments.      Government is committed to establishing a harmonized legal and regulatory framework   that takes into account converging communications technologies, services and delivery   platforms. It is also committed to protecting individuals and corporations, from some of   the undesirable aspects inherent in the transformation to an information economy.   Government further recognises the importance of an effective regulator that performs its   functions consistently, comprehensively and fairly in a transparent manner.        ICT Policy for Lesotho 33  Objectives      The objectives for the development of an enabling and regulatory framework are to      • Promote the establishment of a fully competitive market   • Establish a harmonized legal and regulatory framework that takes into account   converging communications technologies, services and delivery platforms.   • Protect intellectual property and copyrights, privacy, data protection and on-line   security without unduly restricting public access to information.   • Promote investment and innovation within the ICT sector in order to improve   access, affordability and quality of services.   • Reduce the economic and non-economic cost of doing business in Lesotho to   enable the private sector to flourish.   • Encourage a transparent regulatory environment that provides for open processes   and access to information.

This USF will be established as independent advisory body responsible to   the MCST         • Develop working definitions of universal access and set targets and timelines for   achieving universal access goals.   • Develop regulations to establish and operate a Universal Service Fund to support   ICT infrastructure expansion, local content development and access to ICT   services and training.     ICT Policy for Lesotho 35     3.4     Rapid Delivery of ICT Services to Society    Government acknowledges that Lesotho must develop initiatives that foster rapid   diffusion of ICT services to the whole of society, in order to close the gap to the digital   divide between itself and the rest of the world.       The proliferation of ICT services will be enhanced by ensuring that a multi-channel   distribution system is available throughout the country. In this way, consumers can   choose for themselves the most appropriate and affordable means of access. The quality   and diversity of media is also key to rapid delivery of ICT services.  Freedom of   expression, media pluralism and professional codes of conduct will encourage the take up   and demand for media made available via ICTs. Thus, Government is committed to   ensuring that a variety of distribution channels, including radio, television, and   telecommunications networks are universally available for accessing ICT services on   demand. It also promises to protect freedom of expression, the right to information and to   facilitate the development of diverse, independent sources of quality media.    3.4.1 Policy Objectives and Strategies    Policies and initiatives are needed to speed-up the delivery of ICT services as well as   address poverty issues that impede the take up and utilisation of such services. Measures   are also needed to develop and promote ICT delivery systems, services and applications   that offer practical solutions to the development challenges faced by the Basotho.

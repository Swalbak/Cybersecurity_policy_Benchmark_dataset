The Digital Strategy 2016-2020 sets the course for Danish public sector digitisation efforts and their interaction with business- es and industry. Jointly with the businesses and public institutions at local, regional and central-government levels which on a daily basis take advantage of the opportunities provided by digitisation, this strategy will help build the basis for a strong and secure digital Denmark. Some initiatives are being launched now. Others will be defined or adjusted up until 2020 in response to the opportunities and challenges ahead. Therefore, this strategy will fully equip citizens, public employees and businesses for the digital Denmark of the future. The Government, Local Government Denmark, and Danish Regions Denmark and the world are facing funda- mental changes. Rapid ongoing digital de- velopments are already changing the way in which we live, the way we run our busi- nesses and the way our public services and welfare services are delivered. Technological developments have always played a role in altering the way in which we live, and new technologies have given us op- portunities that not many of us would want to do without. The invention of the automo- bile gave us far more mobility and flexibility. Automation of processing and packaging processes within the food industry improved opportunities within supply and flexible con- sumption. Old job functions have become defunct and new ones have appeared in their place. We have seen it all before. However, the rate and evolutionary power of technological developments will accelerate in the years to come. Digital development will be so fast, profound and unpredictable that it will challenge and change society in ways we cannot even begin to imagine. What the future will bring is now more un- certain than ever. Artificial intelligence, nano and biotechnologies, and the widespread use of Big Data are already at our doorstep. So, the future is now, not tomorrow! The new technologies provide a multitude of opportunities. However, this develop- ment also challenges society and demands change and transition. It is not whether or not the changes will happen, but how, as a society, we are prepared to adapt and to exploit the opportunities offered by the new technologies to produce more pros- perity and welfare while still preserving the uniquely Danish sense of security and confi- dence in each other and in society. Digital Denmark Just as globalisation, digitisation raises many difficult questions. In a number of ar- eas, Denmark is well prepared for what the future will bring. However, in other areas, we still have a lot to learn. Therefore, the pub- lic sector must work closely with the Danish business community, stakeholder organisa- A STRONGER AND MORE SECURE DIGITAL DENMARK WHO IS PARTICIPATING? The government Digital Strategies concern the authorities at all levels of government, from state, to regions to municipalities - i.e. both the administrative institutions such as ministries, agencies and the municipal and regional administrations, and the executive institutions such as hospitals, public schools, universities, etc. A STRONGER AND MORE SECURE DIGITAL DENMARK6 A STRONGER AND MORE SECURE DIGITAL DENMARK 7 Denmark is in a good position to embrace the digital future. We are a small country with a population that has great trust and confidence in each other and in the public sector. People generally have a high level of education. People and businesses have good digital competences and have gener- ally embraced digital technologies. There is a strong tradition of collaboration and find- ing new and practical solutions between public authorities, and across the public and private sectors. Furthermore, the public sector began in- troducing IT solutions early on, and for this reason in particular it has high-quality data sets and registries which are quite unique in an international perspective. Denmark has built a secure and robust digital in- frastructure, which allows individuals and businesses to complete efficiently their business with the public sector over the internet. All of this has enabled a huge digital transition in recent years. Significant digital developments in the public sector The internet is today the primary gateway to public administration for the majority of Danes. Individuals and businesses have their own digital mailbox. Online self- service has been made mandatory for more than 100 administrative procedures. When the Central Customs and Tax Administra- tion (SKAT) opens up for online access to tax assessments, digital Danes flood onto the website. Furthermore, digital solutions are an in- tegral part of many public services. Care workers use tablet computers to moni- tor and register any changes in the health status of their elderly clients. Teachers use digital learning tools and materials to differ- entiate their teaching to the individual stu- dent, and health technologies make it possi- ble for patients to monitor their condition in their own homes. Some individuals and businesses have wel- comed the developments and can easily cope, while others have taken some time to adjust to new ways of dealing with things. Local and regional governments have played and are still playing an active role in ensuring that citizens and businesses are guided through the many changes and that there is help available to those who stumble on the way. Focus on user centricity, sense of security and public trust The Danish welfare system builds on the public's widespread confidence and trust in the public sector. It is important that we safeguard this public trust now that digital communication and digital services from the authorities are becoming an everyday We must seize the digital opportunities fact. It is absolutely vital that we establish safe and secure frameworks for citizens and businesses to interact digitally with the pub- lic sector. Digital safety and security of individuals and businesses are essential to being able to ex- ploit the opportunities offered by digitisation to develop and improve the Danish welfare system; and digitisation does offer huge op- portunities for individuals as well as for so- ciety in general. The Danish public sector is designed to ensure that services for citizens and busi- nesses are as far as possible organised at local or regional levels within the frame- work of the law. This approach helps en- sure a greater sense of security and public trust, as well as a greater degree of user centricity in services. Therefore, digitisation must underpin local decision power and re- sponsibility. When public services become digital, people should not feel that the public sector is becoming distant, with no anchoring in the local community. Instead, digitisation should promote a continued feeling of local anchorage. For example, digitisation can enhance the degree of user centricity and the empower- ment of individuals because digital solutions allow them easy access from home, or in their local area, to services and information of high quality, regardless of where in Den- mark they live. Digital services are becoming increasingly more adaptable to the needs of the individual, i.e. they are becoming ever more user-centric. Furthermore, with digi- tal welfare solutions, citizens can become 'co-players' in delivery of their welfare ser- vices. With more efficient, digital solutions it is possible to improve the quality of services and enable local development. Denmark has a well-developed infrastruc- ture for mobile and broadband coverage However, if we are to continue to have a society that works efficiently and with local anchoring, we need to ensure that this good mobile and broadband coverage is improved even more.  Public-sector data must be shared and reused We can establish a simpler and more co- hesive public sector in which the author- A STRONGER AND MORE SECURE DIGITAL DENMARK8 A STRONGER AND MORE SECURE DIGITAL DENMARK 9 Government is to create good framework conditions for commerce and industry and, thus, contribute to growth in Denmark through the promotion of digital solutions in Danish businesses, through promotion of en- trepreneurship and through establishing the foundation for Danish businesses to be able to continue to compete in the global market. The goal is for Danish businesses to become better at exploiting new paths to growth. This requires that Denmark and Danish busi- nesses become better at exploiting the potential in, for example, automation and new technologies, and, by doing so, en- hance productivity and competitiveness. This applies, in particular, to the many Danish small and medium-sized enterprises. Efforts by the public sector must promote digitisation in the private sector. With more digitisation, businesses will become better at exploiting business potentials in a digital world; they will become more competitive and they will improve their productivity. Creation of a strong digital Denmark with new opportunities and improved frame- work conditions for businesses calls for new public-private partnerships. Data is an all-important resource in a digital era; a resource which opens up for new busi- ness opportunities and which can be used to optimise internal business procedures. It is important that, within the framework of the law, more public-sector data is made available to businesses, so that this data can serve as a driver for innovation and new business opportunities in the private sector. This should provide the business community with good opportunities for finding, combin- ing and reusing data to develop new inno- vative products and services, so that busi- nesses will be well positioned in the future competition. Digitisation efforts should create strong framework conditions for businesses and support their digital transition. For example, better and more user-friendly digital solu- tions and automated data collection from businesses should contribute to the goal of reducing significantly the administrative burden on businesses. ities can collaborate smoothly to provide good and efficient services to individuals or businesses based on the knowledge that they already have about them. For this to become a reality, the authorities must to a greater extent be able to exchange and access relevant data on individuals in a secure manner; not least in situations in which many authorities are involved. Local, regional and central governments therefore have to work towards more shar- ing of data wherever this is possible, rele- vant and secure. Increased use of data can be supported by common data standards, standardised data formats, common IT ar- chitectures and a robust IT infrastructure. Increased sharing of data will enable new generations of digital solutions which can automatically find the necessary data. In- dividuals and businesses will save time because they do not have to report data unnecessarily. Furthermore, administrative processes and case work will be eased if manual workflows, and in some situations decisions, can be automated. More efficient sharing and exchange of data between various IT systems and organisa- tional units will provide individuals and busi- nesses with more efficient case processing procedures and more tailored and coherent interventions. In future, individuals and businesses should, as far as possible, only have to submit, infor- mation to the authorities once, instead of having to enter the same information in seve- ral places in public digital solutions. Greater use and reuse of data will also im- prove the basis for the public services de- livered. This will also contribute to a more modern and efficient public sector and, thus, release resources which can be applied to other political priorities. These efforts should be continued, taking account of the legislation on processing of personal data and the individual's right to privacy. New business opportunities The business and growth policy of the A STRONGER AND MORE SECURE DIGITAL DENMARK10 A STRONGER AND MORE SECURE DIGITAL DENMARK 11 Although Denmark has already become far more digital, we have only just embarked on the very extensive process of transition. With digital solutions becoming ever more widespread, citizens and businesses have high expectations for digital public services that are up-to-date and add value to every- day life. However, technological developments are happening at such a pace that we are not always able to predict the digital opportuni- ties, users' needs and societal benefits that the future will bring. When development of the eIdentification solution NemID was planned in 2008, smartphones were not that widespread and the computer tablet had yet to be invented. Therefore, it could not have been predicted that, only a few years later, users would want to be able to read their digital post or log onto public-service web portals and onto self-service or online bank- ing solutions from their mobile devices. Continuous modernisation necessary Continuous improvement and adaptation of public sector digital solutions and systems are therefore necessary in step with the development of technologies and of soci- ety. This will require investment. In future years, it will also be necessary for a num- ber of authorities to modernise or replace some of their IT systems, either because they are outdated or because they are no longer working according to their intended purpose. Furthermore, the IT solutions and process- es of a number of authorities are today designed to match the internal needs and organisation of the authority rather than the needs of citizens and businesses which, in many cases, go across authorities and sec- tors. Much data is still stored differently and de- fined differently from one public authority to another. This makes exchange of data across sectors or administrations very dif- ficult. This in turn makes it unnecessarily complicated for different authorities to col- laborate to deliver the best and most effi- cient services to individuals and businesses. This calls for solutions. Therefore, extensive development and clear-up work is required so that citizens and businesses can rest assured the ser- vice they receive is coherent and that the IT systems function optimally. However, the public sector has a solid foundation. Many principles and methods have already been developed by different authorities and can be reused and disseminated to more au- thorities. Denmark on the way Expenditures and revenues will come under pressure The public sector will be faced with a signifi- cant strain on public expenditure in the years to come. This is due, in particular, to demands to deal with an aging population, climate change, housing and integrating refugees, as well as more expenditure on the health services. At the same time, impacts from the EU with regard to the application of data across national borders, legislation as well as language and accessi- bility requirements, will be significant for our opportunities to develop Danish public services and administrations. Financing the Danish welfare system is based on the taxes and charges paid by individuals and businesses. However, digital development and new business models will also challenge the revenue models and regulatory models of the public sector. The global, digital economy is expected to grow and, in the long term, per- haps require new solutions. New, internet-based business models can pro- vide new opportunities for growth, greater flex- ibility and a wider range of services for users. However, with regard to taxation and market regulation, etc., these business models will also challenge the structure of society. A STRONGER AND MORE SECURE DIGITAL DENMARK12 A STRONGER AND MORE SECURE DIGITAL DENMARK 13 THE DIGITAL STRATEGY This Digital Strategy runs up to 2020, and in it the central, regional and local govern- ments continue a series of initiatives from the previous Strategy. Furthermore, a large number of new initiatives will create the foundation for the Danish public sector of the future. About the Digital Strategy Since 2001, digitisation of the public sector has been driven by close and binding collab- oration between local, regional and central governments. This is applies especially in areas in which it is necessary and appro- priate to develop cross-cutting solutions. The work has been embedded in multi-year strategies covering central, local and region- al governments. The strategic digital initiatives make it pos- sible for the public sector to make joint investments in areas which are particu- larly complex and in which there are inter- dependencies across different authorities and sectors. Digitisation has proven to be an effective and efficient tool to rethink processes and work- flows in the public sector. Furthermore, in several areas, digitisation has given rise to a break with the compartmentalised think- ing that is often applied by the public sector. The tradition of common public sector stra- tegic work on digitisation entails continuous endeavours for closer public sector colla- boration to deliver good, efficient and coher- ent services to citizens and businesses. Strategic interaction Digital strategies are not the sole answer to all the challenges facing Denmark. The individual authority has a responsi- bility to realise the digital potential within its own auspice and, thus, to ensure that digitisation leads to the desired change. In parallel with joint public sector efforts, there are sector-specific digitisation projects and strategies, for example joint municipal and regional digital strategies. This approach to public sector digitisation efforts provides a good balance between common strategic targets and local adaptation and priorities. Furthermore, interacting with the public sector, private businesses, trade organisa- tions and NGOs are also contributing to find- ing common solutions for the digital transi- tion and helping to secure the foundation for a strong and secure Digital Denmark. 15 years of digital strategies 2001 DIGITAL COLLABORATION • Digital signature • Citizens can send emails to public authorities • Digital communication by the authorities • NemID (eID solution), NemLog-in (federated user management and log-in to online public services etc.), eIndkomst (digital reporting of income) • Digital Post (digital mailbox for messages and commications from public authorities), NemSMS (text message reminders from the authorities), Borger.dk (digital public services web portal for citizens) • Authorities must use common IT infrastructure • NemKonto (mandatory default citizen's account for payments from the authorities) and eInvoicing • Virk.dk (digital public services web portal for businesses) and Sundhed. dk (web portal providing personal access to all own health data) • Secure government email systems 2004 EFFICIENT PAYMENT AND INTERNAL DIGITISATION 2007 COMMON INFRASTRUCTURE 2011 DIGITAL COMMUNICATION • Digital Post made mandatory for individuals and businesses • Online self-service solutions made mandatory for individuals and businesses • Dissemination of digital welfare services • The Basic Data Programme DENMARK IN THE DIGITAL LEAD Over the past 15 years, Denmark has undergone a unique transition to digital public admini- stration, communication and services. A number of solutions originating from previous digi- tal strategies have now become routine. With NemKonto (a mandatory citizen's account for payments from the authorities), the authorities now know which account to pay benefits into. Furthermore, with the secure eIdentification solution NemID everyone has a secure means of personal identification and authentication online. Digital registration of real property rights makes it easier to buy and sell property. Several common, cross-sectoral web portals have been established such as a web portal with access to personal health data (sundhed.dk), a single-point of access to all digital public services (borger.dk), and a public services web portal for businesses (virk.dk). Furthermore, a digital income registry has been established so that, in a number of areas, individuals are no longer burdened with reporting and documenting changes to their income in order to receive benefits. Some of the most recently introduced initiatives include mandatory Digital Post and man- datory online self-service for individuals and businesses. Telemedicine solutions for people with chronic disorders and digital learning tools and materials are becoming more wide- spread throughout Denmark. Furthermore, much public-sector basic data is now available online and free of charge for individuals, businesses and authorities alike. All of this makes up the solid foundation which the public sector will develop further up to 2020. A STRONGER AND MORE SECURE DIGITAL DENMARK14 A STRONGER AND MORE SECURE DIGITAL DENMARK 15 Vision: Public sector digitisation creates value and growth, it provides efficiency improvements and it secures the confidence of Danish people in the digital society. Digitisation can provide better quality in pub- lic services and it can lead to a more cohesive and efficient public sector that creates value for individuals and for businesses. Denmark has come a long way in the digital transition of the public sector, but a lot of work still lies ahead. This Digital Strategy 2016-2020 sets three ambitious, but realistic, goals for the devel- opment of a more digital public sector in the years to come: The Digital Strategy sets three ambitious goals supported by focus areas. Each focus area includes a number of underlying, specific initiatives to contribute to realising the goals. VISION AND GOALS The Digital Strategy 2016-2020 SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES THE PUBLIC SECTOR PROTECTS DATA ROBUST DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE DIGITISATION FOR EVERYONE 7 8 DIGITAL SOLUTIONS MUST BE EASY-TO-USE, QUICK AND ENSURE HIGH QUALITY A USER-FRIENDLY AND SIMPLE DIGITAL PUBLIC SECTOR BETTER USE OF DATA AND QUICKER CASE PROCESSING BETTER AND MORE COHESIVE WELFARE SERVICES 1 2 3 DIGITISATION MUST PROVIDE GOOD CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH BETTER FRAMEWORK FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY PUBLIC-SECTOR DATA AS A GROWTH DRIVER AN EFFICIENT UTILITIES SECTOR 4 5 6 9 Security and confidence must be in focus at all times The great confidence Danes have in each other and in the public sector is the foundation of Danish welfare. We must safeguard this sense of security in an ever-more digital society. Therefore, we will improve information security in the public sector and enhance the digital competences of citizens and of businesses. A digital infrastructure for the public sector that is crucial for society must be robust and it must meet the needs of its users. Moreover, Den- mark will be an inclusive society in which everyone can participate, both those who are ready to digitise, and those who cannot use the digital solutions or who do not have access to them. Public sector digitisation must provide good conditions for growth Digitisation will make it easier to run a business and will contribute to the Government’s goal to reduce the administrative burden on the business community by DKK 3 billion by 2020. The ambition is that the administrative burden on businesses from reporting to public authorities is to be removed through automatic business reporting. All solutions aimed at businesses will be integrated in the Virk.dk portal, and businesses will meet a public sector that fully supports their digital transition. The business community will have access to more public-sector data that can form the basis for new business opportunities and innovation. Digital solutions must be easy-to-use, quick and ensure high quality The Danish public should see that public-sector digitisation adds real value to their lives. The public sector must offer high-quality digital services and digital welfare solutions. Digitisation should make life easier, make it easier for people to help themselves, and im- prove the quality of public services. The authorities will share relevant information and work together better for the individual person or business. Furthermore, digitisation will contribute to a more cohesive and efficient public sector.

This is practical and it saves time for the citizens, businesses and the authorities. Therefore, it is vital that public-sector digital solutions and services are user-friendly, intuitive and of high quality, so that users continue to have confidence in using public-sector digi- tal services. Work to make modern, digital solutions available for citizens and businesses has only just begun. It has to be easy for citizens and businesses to navigate public digital universes to ascertain whether a digital ap- plication has been filled out and submitted correctly, for example, and to know what to do next in the process. Therefore, in some areas there is a need to improve public digital services so that digital communication between the users and the public sector stays up-to-date. At the same time, digitisation can be used as a lever to improve authority communication and coor- dination across sectors. Being digital should be easy Denmark will have high-quality digital ser- vices. Citizens and businesses will see that digitisation of public services adds real val- ue to their lives. Today, we are used to seeing easy and rap- id digital services from private businesses make a positive difference in our lives. For example, when we can easily transfer mon- ey to each other via our mobile phones, buy birthday presents on the internet, or check- in and choose our seats in the aeroplane from home before we travel. It will be equally easy and quick to be in digital contact and have dealings with the public authorities. This means, for exam- ple, that the individual self-service solu- tions and digital solutions (such as NemID and Digital Post) have to be user-friendly, up-to-date and of high quality. The plan is that increasingly digital services from the various authorities will also be acces- sible from those places on the internet where citizens and businesses are already active. The common public-sector portals, borger.dk and Virk, will also continue to play a central role as entrances to digital public- sector solutions. Digital developments are so rapid that we cannot always predict what technical pos- sibilities and user requirements there will be in the future. Therefore, the user-friend- liness of public digital solutions for citizens and for businesses must be measured regularly. Knowledge about the effect and DIGITAL SOLUTIONS MUST BE EASY-TO- USE, QUICK AND ENSURE HIGH QUALITY FOCUS AREAS THE GOAL Public-sector self-service solutions, websites and portals will constantly be improved so that it is easier to deal with administration and so that services are more targeted towards the individual user. If services are more intelligent and more efficient, and if users are already active on the internet, then users can serve themselves more easily and quickly at whatever time it suits them. The authorities will share relevant information with each other and they will automatise administrative procedures so that citizens and businesses experience shorter case-proces- sing times for digital applications and notifications. Furthermore, users will be less likely to have to spend time submitting the same information to several places and finding documen- tation for information that is already in public registries. Better information sharing between authorities will also provide citizens with more cohe- sive pathways when a case crosses between authorities, for example a treatment pathway in which both a hospital and the municipal healthcare services are involved. Furthermore, the overall welfare of Danes will be improved through the dissemination of digital welfare solutions. 1. A USER-FRIENDLY AND SIMPLE DIGITAL PUBLIC SECTOR 2.

BETTER AND MORE COHESIVE WELFARE SERVICES Focus area 1 A user-friendly and simple digital public sector 23DIGITAL SOLUTIONS MUST BE EASY-TO-USE, QUICK AND ENSURE HIGH QUALITY22 to check both their Digital Post mailbox and their physical mailbox. In future, business- es and the many individuals ready for digital solutions should be confident that they will receive in digital format all relevant post from the public sector that can be digitised. The right help Digital communication with the authorities can be an advantage, for example for the el- derly who do not live close to their families. Digital solutions mean that family members can help by notifying change of address or applying for housing benefits from their own home. Using a digital power of attorney, people will be able to let their families and others they trust take care of their interests and access the necessary data digitally. This means that families and others will not have to use solutions such as paper forms or let- ter post to help someone with their digital administration. Improving digital communication will mean that fewer people will have to pick up the phone or turn up in person at the citizen service centre to get help, and it means that businesses can save time. At the same time, people who still need help will get it. It will be easier for citizens and businesses to locate and receive the right help, irrespec- tive of whether they are having trouble with NemID, Digital Post, borger.dk or Virk. value of solutions for users and for the au- thorities will be used to improve solutions and the information and service received by users. Cohesive digital services Communication to citizens and businesses must be clear and coherent so that users are well-informed and feel secure. Users should meet a service-oriented public sector that can guide them rapidly and effective- ly through the relevant authority areas and services. Poor language or complex rules and processes must not obstruct fast and effective communication. User journeys through the public digital solu- tions will be easier and clearer from start to end, so that users know what to do when attending to matters with the public sector. A particular common public-sector respon- sibility is to ensure that users receive a cohesive service when they are to deal with different elements of the same case. This is especially relevant when a user is in contact with several different authorities and has to use several self-service solutions, perhaps on different authorities’ websites. For example, the user journey for an entre- preneur to set up a company will be made more user-friendly and cohesive, where to- day at least five or six self-service solutions are required. Firstly, the business has to be registered on the business portal virk.dk to get a central business registration number, and a NemKonto bank account for the busi- ness has to be set up with a bank. Next, a NemID eID and digital signature has to be ordered on medarbejdersignatur.dk and a Digital Post mailbox needs setting up for the business. There could also be improvements in digi- tal user journeys for private individuals, for example in connection with moving home or filing for divorce. Better insight and overview The public sector must be more transpar- ent. Therefore citizens and businesses must have easier access to data about themselves held by a specific authority. Furthermore, users should have a greater insight into their cases, applications, data and relationships with the public authorities. The public digital services will be adapted to the current situation and needs of the individual citizen or business, so that the user meets personalised, relevant content on public-sector websites or portals which the user feels competent and confident in navigating. For new parents, it is relevant to know where and how to name their baby or to enrol the child on the waiting list for a daycare institution. People approaching retirement require other solutions and in- formation, for example about pensions and health benefits. Today, the authorities can choose whet- her they will send communications to users digitally or by surface mail. On the other hand, individuals and businesses have DIGITAL POST FOR PARENTS WITH JOINT CHILD CUSTODY The authorities are increasingly sending correspondence as Digital Post. If the authori- ties send Digital Post to parents about their joint-custody child, there are circumstances in which just one parent receives the correspondence. This can happen even if, in some areas, the legislation states that both parents are to be informed about matters relating to their child. The regulations in sector legislation and the individual administrative area determine whether both parents have to be informed about matters relating to their child. Therefore, a common set of guidelines will be drawn up for the authorities, outlining the situations in which information about a joint-custody child is to be sent to both parents. The guidelines will help clarify how correspondence is to be sent in accordance with relevant legislation. This will also secure equality between parents with regard to receiving information about a joint-custody child. In the summer of 2016, it will be technically possible for authorities to send one Digital Post communication to several recipients. This means that it will be easier for the authorities, with few administrative procedures, to ensure that both parents of a child receive Digital Post about the child.

Work on selected user journeys, for example divorces or business start-ups, will secure easier and more straight- forward self-service processes. Users will be guided through the process and thereby they will be able to serve themselves easily and sim- ply in a more cohesive administrative procedure. 1.2 BETTER DIGITAL COMMUNICATION In order to ensure user-friendly and up-to-date digital solutions, self-service solutions, infra- structure components and portals must meet a few agreed requirements when new solutions are developed or further developed. The re- quirements are drawn up in collaboration with relevant authorities. For example, these may include that solutions are to work on mobile devices, be accessible for the disabled, and be tested by users. Data will be collected about user experience and use of the solutions so that solutions can constantly be improved. A USER-FRIENDLY AND SIMPLE DIGITAL PUBLIC SECTOR INITIATIVES Time is one of the important service parame- ters in a digital society. The huge amounts of data already under the charge of the public administration will be used more extensively to benefit citizens and businesses wherever possible within the framework of legislation. Simpler rules, better processes and reduc- tions in the administrative burden will make the public sector more efficient and easier to use for the individual person and for bu- sinesses. Relevant knowledge to be used across authorities Relevant information from self-service solu- tions, public registries, etc. will be exchanged much more extensively between the autho- rities’ specialist systems, it will support the work of case officers and it will be reused across authorities in order to simplify repor- ting to authorities as far as is technically and legally possible. In the long term, it will be possible for far more case decisions to be made more rapid- ly, and in some cases immediately, because the necessary information is correct and available in the right place at the right time in the course of a case. This is already happe- ning to some extent, for example with regard to payment of benefits such as child allow- ance, maternity leave benefits and state reti- rement pensions. This means that citizens and businesses are seeing shorter case-processing times, and more often receive an immediate reply, for example, as to whether they qualify for a specific benefit, as well as the amount to which they are entitled. Furthermore, the authorities can perform tasks more efficient- ly, for example when it becomes possible to automate parts of case processing. As far as possible, citizens and businesses will not have to spend time submitting the same information to several places or pro- viding documentation for information that is already in public registries. For example, when people have submitted information in one context to one authority, they should not have the inconvenience of submitting the same information to another authority. This could mean, for example, that digital appli- cations, reportings and notifications already have some fields completed with relevant information in advance. This means that ci- tizens and businesses can have their cases processed faster, for example when applying for something or notifying any changes. Reusing data from public registries also con- tributes to preventing incorrect payments Focus area 2 Better use of data and quicker case processing 1.3 OVERVIEW OF OWN INTERACTIONS WITH AUTHORITIES, AND BENEFITS Citizens and businesses will be offered insight into relevant information about themselves held by pub- lic authorities. This information will be presented in a context tailored to the individual user. The author- ities will increasingly actively inform citizens and businesses about important events. For example, this may be a text reminder that it is time for children to be vaccinated. This means that users will be better able to react to important information in due time. 1.4 BETTER TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR CITIZENS AND BUSINESSES It will be easier for users to get help if they have problems with NemID, NemLog-in, Digital Post, etc. A number of common public-sector support pro- grammes will be gathered together so that it is easier for citizens and businesses to get help or to be guided to the right authority. Information about operational problems and disruption in common solutions for de- central authorities will be enhanced so that they can provide the best help for users. Knowledge about the problems users meet will be collected and used to improve the digital solutions. 1.5 ALL COMMUNICATION FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR IS DIGITAL In future, businesses and the individuals ready for digital solutions will receive all their post from public authorities digitally. However, this will exclude specif- ic types of correspondence, for example letters that can only be managed physically, for example sample letters which contain vials, health-insurance cards, etc. Similarly, exchange of digital notifications be- tween authorities will take place through efficient use of digital channels such as secure email and Digital Post, among other things through metadata mark-up of notifications. 26 27DIGITAL SOLUTIONS MUST BE EASY-TO-USE, QUICK AND ENSURE HIGH QUALITY DIGITAL SOLUTIONS MUST BE EASY-TO-USE, QUICK AND ENSURE HIGH QUALITY and fraud, among other things, because the individual or business is not at risk of for- getting to notify changes in information. Or because the rules are so complex that users unintentionally submit incorrect information. Legal framework conditions for a digital age However, data sharing not only poses a te- chnical challenge. There is also a challenge in safeguarding a regulatory framework to ensure that new opportunities offered by digitisation become assets for Danish so- ciety. The legislative framework should be up-to-date so that it does not restrict more than necessary data sharing across sectors and functions. If specific legislation does not allow digitisation of processes, this will be examined in more detail. This might lead to proposed legislative amendments. Simpler rules can provide better opportunity for smoother administrative processes and can make the public sector more efficient and easier to use for citizens and businesses. At the same time, the legislative framework should continue to set very clear limits so that data on citizens and businesses is only collected and used where necessary and where it produces value for the individual and for society. Some Danish acts and regulations covering digitisation originate from EU regulations. This places requirements on the way we or- ganise the Danish digital public sector and the way we design our digital solutions and infrastructure, etc. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation will influence how we can work with data in the public sector and in society in general in the future. INITIATIVES THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION The upcoming General Data Protection Regulation is expected to be adopted by the EU during 2016. The objective of the Regulation is to provide better protection of citizens' rights in con- nection with processing of personal data, to improve the possibilities for exchanging personal data in the European single market, as well as to reduce administrative burdens and moder- nise the regulations to reflect the realities of a digital world. Amongst others, the regulation continues and specifies a number of obligations under the current Data Protection Directive which has been implemented into Danish law through the Processing of Personal Data Act. The Regulation also introduces new requirements on public authorities, for example to appoint a data protection advisor and, in certain situations, prepare impact analyses. Important work lies ahead with regard to establishing clarity about the sig- nificance of the Regulation for digitisation work, including identifying the specific consequenc- es for public authorities. This work will be performed collaboratively between the relevant public parties. WHAT IS BASIC DATA? The public authorities register core information about individuals, businesses, real property, build- ings, addresses, and more. This information is called basic data and is used throughout the public sector in day-to-day casework by the authorities. Basic data therefore has to be reliable, of high quality, coherent across registries and databases, and easy to access for authorities, businesses and citizens. All basic data will be retrievable from the Data Distributor. ABOUT THE BASIC DATA PROGRAMME Basic Data Programme has set the framework for joint, structured and coordinated work in a number of prioritised basic data areas. Public registries with central basic data have been improved and data has been made available free of charge to public authorities, businesses and citizens. Less double registration, fewer parallel registries and less expenditure on ad- ministration can lead to considerable efficiency improvements in government. Furthermore, businesses and citizens can be spared from having to provide the same information to the au- thorities again and again. In a number of areas, businesses can moreover retrieve basic data free of charge and use it to develop new, smart solutions and products. 2.1 CLEAR LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR EGOVERNMENT Legislation and regulations should be adapted to the digital age. To address the cross-sectoral legal challenges of more eGovernment and more use of digital data, a standing committee will be set up under the auspices of the Agency for Digitisation. This committee will collect, screen and prioritise cross-sectoral legal challenges identified by the authorities. The committee will prepare solutions for how to deal with the challenges identified. 2.2 PROGRESS WITH GOOD BASIC DATA We must make even more progress in creating good public sector basic data. Therefore, efforts will be set in motion to improve the quality of, and reach the targets set for, existing basic data. The opportunity for launching potential new basic data projects, including on pay and salaries data, as well as joint solutions and services such as tailored data extracts, will be examined. A per- manent governance structure will be established, so that the authorities can continue their work to establish reliable and coherent basic data of high quality. 2.3 CORRECT PAYMENTS AND BETTER DATA ON THE INDIVIDUAL Work by the public sector to prevent incorrect payments and fraud will be continued. Simple and evidence-based control processes, harmoni- sation of concepts, high data quality and smooth cross-government collaboration will contribute to continued more efficient and effective efforts to prevent incorrect payments and fraud. BETTER USE OF DATA AND QUICKER CASE PROCESSING 28 29DIGITAL SOLUTIONS MUST BE EASY-TO-USE, QUICK AND ENSURE HIGH QUALITY DIGITAL SOLUTIONS MUST BE EASY-TO-USE, QUICK AND ENSURE HIGH QUALITY (COPD) makes these patients feel more se- cure in their everyday lives and gives them more flexibility. Furthermore, telemedicine involves the patients in their own treatment. In addition, welfare technologies for home care, such as paperless toilets, make citi- zens with disabilities less dependent on care services. Digital welfare solutions also allow healthcare and care staff etc. to plan their work more intelligently and more efficiently. Therefore, digital welfare solutions with a proven track record should be deployed fur- ther, so that more citizens can benefit from them. At the end of 2016, a total of 16 projects will have been launched or completed to test digital welfare solutions on a large scale. Experience from this will be used as a launch-pad for taking things to the next lev- el and for Denmark to decide, up to 2020, on the deployment of additional digital welfare solutions with a proven track record of pro- viding value for citizens. The continued development and testing of digital welfare solutions and new technol- ogies for the public sector will in many sit- uations take place in collaboration with the business community. This means that the competences and experience of businesses can be brought into play in the development of public services. If digital welfare solutions are deployed on a large scale throughout Denmark, this will generate new opportuni- ties for businesses and give them additional experience which, in turn, can lead to export opportunities in the global market. Digital learning materials and tools In a digital world, IT and digital tools and learning materials should be a natural part of didactic practices and teaching for chil- dren and young people. New digital tools and learning materials must challenge the digi- tal generation at day-care facilities, schools and other educational institutions, and sup- port good didactic practices and high-quality teaching. Many child carers and teachers are already using digital tools and learning materials in day-care facilities, schools and youth edu- cational programmes, etc. Digital tools and learning materials can raise the didactic and academic level, motivate children, young people and college and university students, as well as ensure they take a more active role in their own learning, although at their own pace and at a level suited to the indi- vidual. Competencies As welfare services are increasingly be- ing delivered digitally, public employees must know how to use the digital solutions in their work lives. Furthermore, public employees at the frontline of the welfare system should support and guide citizens in the use of digital web portals, tools and welfare solutions, as well as assist them in their digital dealings with the authorities. So, there is need for public employees with the right competences, and this applies not the least to those employees who are in di- rect contact with citizens, such as teachers, child carers, and healthcare and care staff. There is a need for a more holistic approach to the digital interface between citizens and the public sector. Citizens must find that digi- tisation leads to improved and better coor- dinated welfare services. To realise this, the authorities must to a greater extent share relevant information with each other. Knowledge sharing for better welfare services The exchange of relevant health data be- tween the hospital and the local health service, for example, makes it easier to co- ordinate cross-sectoral patient pathways. It means that patients do not have to serve as liaison and be responsible for the knowledge transfer between various health staff. This will provide security and improve patient treatment. Furthermore, it is vital that a young person trying to build a life after prison is offered help to re-enter society. For this to become reality, the local social services should be able to get timely information from the pris- on and probation services about the young person's upcoming release from prison. These two examples illustrate how sharing relevant data allows government officials to organise citizens' pathways more optimally and coordinate things better on the basis of the specific situation of the individual. In the final analysis, intelligent sharing and use of relevant data offer many benefits for the individual as well as for society in gen- eral. However, this also places demands on government authorities throughout the pub- lic sector to develop and expand further on existing opportunities and arrive at a shared understanding of IT architecture, data, clas- sification and data quality, so that data can be exchanged securely, efficiently and ef- fectively, and taking account of the privacy of the individual. Sharing data must always be within the framework of the law - and with the consent of the citizen, where this is relevant. It should also be easier and digital- ly smoother to collect consent from individ- uals, so that processes are simpler. Further deployment of digital welfare solutions The majority of citizens want to live ac- tive lives, be able to cope on their own and be free to do the things they enjoy. Digital welfare solutions play an important role in making this possible. As citizens in general become increasingly more confident with technology and digital solutions, and as new user-friendly solutions are developed, digital welfare solutions will become an ever more integrated part of modern public services. Further deployment of digital solutions that provide freedom and empower individ- uals not only improves the quality of life of individuals; it also improves the econo- my. For example, telemedicine for citizens with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Focus area 3 Better and more cohesive welfare services 30 31DIGITAL SOLUTIONS MUST BE EASY-TO-USE, QUICK AND ENSURE HIGH QUALITY DIGITAL SOLUTIONS MUST BE EASY-TO-USE, QUICK AND ENSURE HIGH QUALITY INITIATIVES 3.1 COHESIVE WELFARE PATHWAYS FOR CITIZENS Welfare pathways will be analysed: 1) cross-sec- toral, coordinating interventions for citizens with concurrent substance use and mental health disorders; 2) unemployed young people on edu- cational programmes; and 3) incarceration at in- stitutions under the prison and probation services and subsequent reintegration into society. Pro- posals will be prepared for how to make pathways more coherent for citizens, for example through data sharing and smoother workflows. Experience from this will be used to ensure more coordinat- ed, efficient and effective welfare pathways in the future. At the same time, there will be pilot tests of a shared approach to easy and uniform data sharing across the various welfare areas. 3.4 DIGITAL LEARNING AND TEACHING Children and young people should benefit from digital learning tools and materials that enhance teaching. Before the end of 2018, the effect of efforts to apply ICT in teaching in municipal pri- mary and lower-secondary schools will be meas- ured. There will be efforts to support the imple- mentation of the agreement that pupils, parents, teachers and child carers have a shared user portal as their digital access point for learning materials, communications and other information regarding the teaching in primary and lower-sec- ondary school. In 2019, all relevant upper-sec- ondary written exams will be digital, and in 2020 all relevant written primary and lower-secondary school leaving exams will be digital. 3.5 DIGITAL COMPETENCES FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES Public employees should be qualified to deal with the digital requirements of the future. The digi- tisation goals of Danish university colleges will therefore be followed through and there will be special efforts to enhance digital teaching skills for school teachers and child carers. Further- more, every public employee will be continuously informed about the requirements for information security. BETTER AND MORE COHESIVE WELFARE SERVICES 3.2 BETTER DATA ABOUT DISABLED AND MARGINALISED ADULTS Work by local government to strengthen the quality of social services work will be contin- ued. By supporting digitally a more uniform and structured practice of documentation across lo- cal governments in the social services field, citi- zens will be ensured better pathways, systematic follow-up on the effects of interventions, and the opportunity for greater transparency across target groups within the area. Furthermore, this will also establish the foundation for sharing data and collaborating across specialist fields and sec- tors. 3.3 FURTHER DEPLOYMENT OF DIGITAL WELFARE SOLUTIONS Experience gained from large-scale testing of digital welfare solutions should be documented and solu- tions with a proven track record will be deployed further to benefit citizens. The goal is that eight dig- ital welfare solutions will have been analysed and a binding decision taken before 2020 on nationwide deployment of approximately four solutions. A suc- cessful deployment requires that several authorities follow the same time schedule. DIGITISATION MUST PROVIDE GOOD CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH 34 35DIGITISATION MUST PROVIDE GOOD CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH DIGITISATION MUST PROVIDE GOOD CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH DIGITISATION MUST PROVIDE GOOD CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH FOCUS AREAS THE GOAL Digital solutions have great significance for the framework conditions of businesses. Public sector digitisation should contribute to realising the Government's goal to reduce the admi- nistrative burden on the business community by DKK 3 billion by 2020 and to make it easier to run a business in Denmark. Digitisation and new technologies are drastically changing the conditions for businesses. Also in the public sector, there is an untapped potential for exploiting the opportunities provided by digitisation to rethink public services. It is the am- bition that a far greater part of reporting by businesses to the public authorities is to take place automatically. The public sector has large amounts of data which businesses can use to optimise their procedures, and which can form the basis for new business opportunities and innovation. Therefore, the public sector should make more public sector data available to businesses and support exploitation of this data by businesses. Data must to a greater extent be improved and made available in a number of specific areas in which there is deemed to be a great potential for a more efficient and effective public sector and new business opportunities for Danish businesses. This includes data on waste, underground infrastructure, energy, topography, climate and water. 4. BETTER FRAMEWORK FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY 5. PUBLIC SECTOR DATA AS A GROWTH DRIVER 6. AN EFFICIENT UTILITIES SECTOR Throughout the years, the public sector has played an important role in the digital transi- tion of businesses, for example through man- datory digital communication and e-invoi- cing in dealings with public institutions and authorities. Public sector digitisation should continue to contribute to raising the digitisation level of businesses. At the same time, digitisa- tion must be targeted to make it easier and more attractive to run a business. The public sector must establish framework conditions which strengthen productivity, business development and competitiveness for Dan- ish businesses. Less administrative burden Digitisation offers an opportunity to dras- tically reduce the administrative burden of businesses. Businesses today spend a sub- stantial amount of resources on reporting data to the authorities. Therefore, we must continue work to reduce this administrative burden. Businesses should not have the nuisance of submitting information to one authori- ty which another authority already holds. Furthermore, there is a vision to complete- ly eliminate the many requirements for manual reporting, and instead replace this reporting with automatic business report- ing. This will require that reporting become more automatised, so that the relevant data is retrieved directly from businesses’ own systems. This saves time for the indi- vidual business and means better and more timely data for public authorities. To achieve this, there is need for persistent and strong focus over the next many years on adapting IT systems, standardising data and changing workflows. At the same time, it requires addressing barriers relating to administrative law and data law. This en- tails extremely complex work, but it is the right way forward if digitisation is to make it easier to run a business in Denmark. Digital tendering procedures As a consequence of the EU Public Procure- ment Directive, from October 2018 open procedures must be digital, from announ- cing to submitting tenders. Denmark should aim even higher. The authorities are already receiving invoices electronically. We there- fore have to aim at an even more digital tendering and procurement procedure up to and including payment, and we should ex- ploit the opportunities for reusing data. A digital tendering and procurement proce- dure can make communication more effi- cient and reduce transaction costs for busi- nesses and public authorities alike. A more Focus area 4 Better framework for the business community 36 37DIGITISATION MUST PROVIDE GOOD CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH DIGITISATION MUST PROVIDE GOOD CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH efficient tendering procedure will also make it possible to stretch the taxpayers' money further. At the same time, a digital process can raise the visibility of relevant European tendering procedures for Danish businesses. Opportunity for cloud computing In upcoming years, there will be focus on creating more competition in the market for public IT solutions and reducing the IT oper- ating costs of the authorities. The authori- ties should be allowed to exploit the entire spectrum of IT solutions, including cloud computing, and clear framework conditions should be established for this. For public authorities, improved possibilities to make use of cloud computing in relevant areas will mean that they can buy standard- ised and flexible IT solutions which, in turn, will allow them to scale capacity up or down as required. This can reduce queues when many citizens want to log in to a given ser- vice at the same time. For the authorities, cloud computing used in the right ways, and taking the right security measures, can therefore lead to increased technical and commercial flexibility as well as cheaper and more efficient IT solutions. WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING? Cloud computing is a business model which entails buying standardised IT products (soft- ware, hardware or services) as a service over the internet. This means customers do not have to install and maintain the IT products themselves in house. Cloud computing can contribute to economic growth by reducing the costs of procuring and operating IT systems. Furthermore, both customers and suppliers can scale IT products up or down as required. INITIATIVES 4.1 AUTOMATIC BUSINESS REPORTING The public sector should to a greater extent use automation and data reuse between autho- rities and businesses. A trial process will be carried out for a number of volunteer busines- ses in the area of financial and economic repor- ting to the public authorities. This process will involve automatic exchange of accounting data between the business and the authorities. This trial process will include relevant analyses as the basis for a decision on deploying automatic business reporting. 4.2 DIGITAL TENDERING PROCEDURES AND PROCUREMENT According to the EU Public Procurement Directi- ve, digital tendering procedures must be in place by October 2018, so that businesses can submit tenders digitally in open procedures. An analy- sis of the tendering and procurement procedure will be launched, which will identify opportuni- ties to use standards, technical requirements and common public sector components, such as interoperability with future versions of NemID, NemLog-in, NemHandel, Virk.dk and encryption components, etc. The analysis will describe how a coherent digital tendering and procurement procedure can be completed most efficiently with a view to reducing transaction costs for the contracting authority as well as for suppliers. 4.3 CLOUD COMPUTING IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR The public sector should have opportunity to use cloud computing where this provides value and is appropriate from both a commercial and a securi- ty perspective. Therefore, an updated legal guide- line will be prepared on the basis of the upcoming General Data Protection Regulation, describing the possibilities available for the authorities with regard to cloud computing, and which also ad- dresses assessment and management of security risks. BETTER FRAMEWORK FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY 38 39DIGITISATION MUST PROVIDE GOOD CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH DIGITISATION MUST PROVIDE GOOD CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH carrying out substantial new development on existing systems. This must be with con- sideration for IT security and the protection of data. Smart Cities The use of new technologies such as solu- tions related to the Internet of Things (IoT) and data used in the design of modern intel- ligent cities are often referred to as the con- cept of 'Smart City’. This could be waste bins that automatically report when they need emptying, intelligent traffic management systems, and the collection, display and use of public sector data. Many Danish local and regional governments have launched projects with Smart City solutions, and Denmark has come a long way in this area. Furthermore, Danish businesses have a number of stronghold positions, for example with regard to climate adaptation and energy-efficiency improvement, waste management, and user-friendly design and architecture. Experience from these pro- jects should be further developed and used to promote the deployment of good Smart City solutions. In future, the use of more types of GPS data and new technology will accelerate. It will be easier to get dynamic localisation data in real time, for example data about the move- ments of large crowds of people, road con- gestion, local environmental conditions in connection with flooding and cloud bursts, etc. Furthermore, the launch of the Euro- pean Galileo satellite navigation system will speed up the development of technological solutions with accurate and dynamic data. This new GPS data must be freely acces- sible and sharable across administrative units and fields. Therefore, a common basis for sharing dynamic positioning data across public sector IT systems should be establis- hed. With this common basis, central, regio- nal and local governments can develop their own separate systems and solutions which can interoperate and be combined across sectors and units. The quantities and quality of data, as well as our possibilities for storing and processing these large quantities of data, are increasing dramatically these years. The authorities at central, regional and local government levels today collect and produce large quantities of data in their daily performance of tasks. Both businesses and citizens report large quantiti- es of data to the public authorities. One of the largest collections of data is therefore held by the public sector. Data as resource In an international perspective, Danish pub- lic sector data is of high quality and holds a large commercial productivity and growth potential. Businesses can use public sector data to optimise their business processes and to develop new products and services which create value for citizens, public autho- rities and fellow businesses. In the digital age, data is one of the most valuable resour- ces for running a business. In recent years, the public sector has worked to improve the framework conditions for the accessibility of public sector data. With the establishment of the Basic Data Program- me, businesses, citizens and authorities gained access to an array of basic data such as address data, business data and property ownership data. The work to make reliable and coherent public sector data available for society will still be an essential focus area in the future to boost data-driven innovation. Benefits must be showcased Today, businesses and authorities often have difficulty finding, combining and exploiting public sector data. Therefore, there is a need to improve the access of businesses to public sector data which offers a grow- th potential for the businesses, and at the same time promote increased use of data. Data will not automatically be utilised me- rely by making it available. When data is collected from a larger and more heteroge- neous number of sources, IT systems and employees are challenged, not the least in small and medium-sized enterprises. Expe- rience suggests that businesses should be made more aware of the value of data and that it should be easier for authorities and businesses to experiment in using data. Opening up for free access to public sector data should take place wherever this is re- levant for businesses and cost-effective for the authorities, and, of course, within the framework of the law. It can also be advantageous for the autho- rities to plan access to data from the be- ginning when buying new IT systems or Focus area 5 Public sector data as a growth driver 40 41DIGITISATION MUST PROVIDE GOOD CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH DIGITISATION MUST PROVIDE GOOD CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH INITIATIVES 5.1 OPEN PUBLIC SECTOR DATA In order to promote public sector data, including the commercial use of this type of data, a com- mon public sector partnership will be set up com- prising Open Data DK, Danish Regions, and the Danish Business Authority. This partnership will consult with businesses and experts to establish a better overall picture of existing open data and promote efforts to ensure access to more open data. The objective of the partnership is also to promote the use of open data, including by en- suring clear framework conditions for use, as well as draw attention to the value of using data, for example through hackathons and the establish- ment of a public-private data space. 5.2 SMART CITY PARTNERSHIP A joint public sector partnership for Smart Cities will promote the use of smart digital solutions and data in urban development efforts as well as support the commercial potential of Smart City solutions. The Partnership will select three to five action areas for focussed efforts to promote the deployment of good Smart City solutions. This could be in areas such as green and sustainable development, intelligent traffic management sy- stems or use of sensor data. 5.3 INFRASTRUCTURE FOR POSITIONING AND NAVIGATION DATA New, more accurate and reliable GPS data holds the potential to alter the way authorities and pri- vate businesses solve problems, and render their problem-solving more efficient and effective. An analysis will be carried out of public sector and commercial needs for establishing a common public infrastructure for positioning and navigati- on data. The analysis will serve as the basis for deciding on implementation of one or two pilot projects. PUBLIC SECTOR DATA AS A GROWTH DRIVER Danish society is dependent on good and ef- ficient utilities. The utilities sector supplies electricity, gas, district heating, water and telecommunications services to consumers and it collects and manages waste and wa- stewater. In 2014, total costs of production in the electricity, gas, district heating, waste and wastewater sectors amounted to bil- lions of DKK, corresponding to 2.5 % of the overall Danish economy. Data on the utilities sector is important for local government decisions about urban and business development projects or for their efforts to build future-proof critical infra- structure for society (to prevent flooding, for example). At the same time, data on the utilities sector can play a significant role in strategic work by the public sector to realise a cost-effective transition of Danish society to less energy consumption, increased pro- duction, and more use of renewable energy. Therefore, we must be good at planning and managing the utilities area effectively and efficiently. This will require better and more coherent utilities data, which businesses, authorities and citizens alike can rely on and exploit. Need for shared utilities data Utilities data includes topography and terra- in data and water data, such as data about wastewater (sewer lines). Utilities data also includes data on the production and con- sumption of electricity, gas and heating, as well as data about cables, for example tele- vision, traffic-light and internet cables, etc. Many such data sets already exist, but the- se are often fragmented and difficult to find. The quality and relevance of the information is not homogenous, and it is often difficult to combine the types of data necessary to op- timise operations. This also makes it expen- sive and difficult for public authorities and public sector companies to maintain the many different systems and databases in which the data is stored. Open and quality-assured data is therefore vital for efficient production and manage- ment in the utilities area. There is a great untapped potential in the using data as a driver to improve the efficiency of workflows and procedures in the sector. This will ensure higher returns on the Danish utilities infra- structure and, thus, lower prices for consu- mers and businesses. At the same, an improved data basis will pro- vide new business opportunities for Danish businesses. This applies to the primary utility companies which can optimise their operati- Focus area 6 An efficient utilities sector 42 43DIGITISATION MUST PROVIDE GOOD CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH DIGITISATION MUST PROVIDE GOOD CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH ons, as well as to the businesses which, for example, provide solutions for data-driven decision support systems. It is anticipated that increased integration of different utilities systems will be vital for conversion of the energy system to renewab- les which come from intermittent energy sources, for example solar and wind energy. Easy access to good utilities data Topography and terrain data as well as data on water and the climate are vital when lo- cal and regional governments are to plan and make decisions about, for example, expanding water and wastewater manage- ment utilities to prevent sewers from over- flowing and to ensure clean drinking water in connection with extreme weather events. At the same time, effective common public sector combining and distribution of ter- rain, climate and water data are important and will provide positive benefits for other sectors, such as building and construc- tion, insurance and agriculture. Better and more accessible data can also help promo- te innovation in private businesses, just as it can open up for new data-driven products and services for both private and public se- ctor clients. Furthermore, the display and accessibility of existing data on energy supplies, for examp- le production and consumption of electricity, gas and heating, could greatly benefit the Danish transition to less energy consump- tion and more renewables. This transition has meant there is a strong demand for coherent energy supply data, smart energy management tools and data-driven decision support systems, so that the transition can be as cost-effective as possible. Better data in the area can help produce an even more efficient energy supply and push for the development of new products in the energy supply sector. It should also be easier for businesses, authorities and other stakeholders to get information about underground infrastruc- ture, for example electric cables, district- heating pipes, sewage pipes, natural-gas pipes or antenna cables. Consistent infor- mation about the grid system will make it easier and cheaper to maintain and establish new underground infrastructure. Better sha- ring of data about underground infrastruc- ture can also reduce damage during digging and excavation. The waste area is facing serious challenges with regard to generating data of adequate quality and such that it is accessible and useful for planning, inspection and develop- ment by local governments. It is necessary to modernise existing national IT systems used to collect data so that local govern- ments, for example, can use data about waste to optimise waste management in Denmark. INITIATIVES 6.1 COMMON DATA ON TOPOGRAPHY, CLIMATE AND WATER Data on topography, climate and water is part of the administrative foundation for many sectors and authorities. Consistent provision of up-to- date data on topography, climate and water across sectors will contribute to more effective administration, it will support the frequent emer- gency situations in connection with extreme we- ather events and it will promote development of new products and technologies. 6.2 OPEN DATA ON ENERGY SUPPLY Conversion to more renewable energy has crea- ted a substantial demand for data-driven decision support and tools for smart energy management. This requires the relevant data to be accessible and of good quality. An analysis will be conduc- ted of the potential for making available data on energy consumption in buildings. The analysis will also identify general possibilities arising from in- tegrating this data into the utilities sector. Data will be tested through a pilot project for ener- gy-efficient buildings. 6.3 EXCHANGE OF DATA ON UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE Currently, maintaining and constructing infra- structure is costly for authorities and businesses. A digital platform will therefore be established to exchange data on underground infrastructure to streamline workflows, reduce damage from digging and excavation, and to enable coordination of digging activities as well as exploit synergies between different supply infrastructures. The con- sequences of this initiative, including scope and any phasing-in, will be discussed with the utilities sector and the telecommunications sector. 6.4 OVERALL IT ARCHITECTURE FOR DATA ON WASTE Better data on waste will enable local govern- ments to plan, enforce and evaluate local govern- ment waste schemes more optimally to benefit the public and businesses. Currently, waste data is collected through a number of IT systems which have been established separately and which can only to a limited extent share data. An analysis will be initiated to result in an action plan for flexible registration, exchange and use of data between the IT systems in the waste area. AN EFFICIENT UTILITIES SECTOR SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES 46 47SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES FOCUS AREAS THE GOAL The public sector is to use and manage data on citizens and businesses with care and with the appropriate level of security. Information security in the public sector must be improved. Therefore, all authorities will have to commit to the principles set out in the international information security standard ISO27001. This also means that public employees should have, and be familiar with, clear guidelines on how to store and manage personal data on citizens and confidential data on businesses. The public sector should ensure robust and efficient operation of systems and IT infrastruc- tures that are crucial for society. New secure and user-friendly generations of NemID, Nem- Log-in and Digital Post must be able to meet future needs and allow citizens and businesses to communicate securely and with confidence, both with each other and with public autho- rities. Digitisation should be for everyone – also for individuals with special needs or challenges. Digital competences of citizens and businesses and their knowledge about secure digital behaviour must be improved. Assistance should be available to those who cannot use digital solutions or who do not have access to them. Developing the digital skills of children and young people already begins at preschool, and continues throughout school, further educa- tion and the rest of their lives. 7. THE PUBLIC SECTOR PROTECTS DATA 8. ROBUST DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE 9. DIGITISATION FOR EVERYONE Citizens and businesses should feel confi- dent and safe using digital public services. The public sector must protect user data, and therefore information security must be improved throughout the public sector. This should be done with emphasis on user-fri- endliness in digital solutions and on financi- al considerations. New level of ambition Digital solutions and digital technologies have created new possibilities for dialogue and involvement, brand new businesses op- portunities, etc. However, increased digitisa- tion has also brought with it a risk of new ty- pes of crime. Cyber criminals, misuse of data and breaches of security are more serious than ever. They pose a real risk in the form of losses and costs for individuals, businesses and public authorities, and they can also lead to loss of confidence in IT solutions. We must therefore aim high with regard to information security in the public sector. Not least the very serious cases of breach of security in recent years have made it im- portant for all public authorities to be in full control of information security and to follow the international standards on managing and storing data. Secure management of information about citizens and businesses The need to improve security has developed in line with the increasing need for access to personal data on citizens and confidential data on businesses as a consequence of digi- tal transformation. Several employees deal with sensitive or confidential data in their work and case processing. Other security procedures are required when manual pa- per-based workflows become digital and sharing information becomes easier. Citizens and businesses should feel confi- dent and safe when submitting information to the public administration. They should be able to trust that data will be used for rele- vant purposes and that it will not be lost or fall into the wrong hands. The public sector will use and manage sensitive and confiden- tial data with care and with the appropriate level of security and privacy. Public employees should have, and be famili- ar with, clear guidelines on how to collect, sto- re and use data, and not least sensitive per- sonal data and confidential data. Authorities will control who has access to sensitive data on the public and businesses. Management in the authorities will assume responsibility for information security, and the authorities will ensure establishment of secure procedures Focus area 7 The public sector protects data 48 49SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES and workflows adapted to the individual tasks. Among other things, this will be done through consistently differential access to data so that only relevant employees have access to data on citizens and businesses. Data protection will, as far as possible, be in- corporated into the design and development of public IT solutions from the very outset. Investing in security comes at a price. How- ever, in an ever-more digital world, data pro- tection is an increasing necessity to ensure that people and businesses have confidence in digital public services. The public sector will work to spread the use of common public security standards. More- over, the Danish public sector must have a full realistic overview of the current security situation and threat levels with regard to cy- ber and information security in order to react and initiate preventive measures. Secure digital identities In a globalised world, goods, services and people are increasingly crossing borders, not least between the EU Member States. At the same time, the current refugee crisis means that authorities and administrations in Den- mark will have to deal with a large number of foreign citizens without a Danish or Euro- pean ID number. Correct digital identities are required for citizens and employees of businesses to communicate securely with the authorities and with each other. Therefore, there is an increasing need for certainty about the identity of individuals and businesses in a digital world. Among other things, there is a need for a common method and stricter process with regard to issuing digital identities such as NemID to foreign individuals and businesses in Denmark. This will ensure that individuals can receive the correct benefits, that businesses can report correct data such as VAT returns, etc. Mo- reover, a better overview can prevent Danes and foreigners from receiving benefits they are not entitled to after moving away from Denmark. Similarly, there is a challenge with regard to ensuring the right level of security in ID solu- tions targeted at children and young people who are not old enough to have a NemID. They should be able to navigate securely online and log on to relevant digital solu- tions, for example in connection with school. As of 2018, digital identity (such as NemID) must be usable in all public sector digital solutions in all EU Member States. For example, a Danish student will be able to use a NemID in connection with an application to study abroad. Moreover, a foreign employee in Denmark will be able to log on to a Danish self-service solution (to apply for a tax card, for example) with the digital identity solution of his/her own country. Ongoing development of common solutions The public sector has an important task in making available central solutions to citi- zens and businesses that enable safe and secure digital communication and interacti- on. Individuals and businesses unable to use digital self-service solutions must be given the opportunity to surrender digital power of attorney to another trusted party, and it should also be possible to provide digital consent. The major common solutions, NemID, Nem- Log-in and Digital Post, will all be put up for tender in the years to come. This will be a good occasion to develop and rethink the solutions in order to meet the future needs for security, digital identities, rights manage- ment, communication, user-friendliness and accessibility. 50 51SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES INITIATIVES 7.1 WELL-MANAGED INFORMATION SECURITY IN ALL AUTHORITIES Information security must be managed better by central, regional and local governments. All pub- lic authorities will therefore have to commit to the principles set out in the international informa- tion security standard ISO27001. Efforts against hacking incidents will be intensified. Information security should be an intrinsic part of design and development of public IT solutions on the basis of the principles of 'data protection by design' and 'data protection by default'. 7.2 COMMON STANDARDS FOR SECURE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION Exchange of information must be conducted securely throughout the public sector. Therefo- re, the current and future common public sector standards for secure exchange of information will be disseminated throughout the public sector. 7.3 DIGITAL IDENTITIES AND RIGHTS MANAGEMENT Systems and data must only be accessed by the right people. This will be ensured through correct assignment of digital identities (e-identities) and rights. The common method to assign correct digital identities to the public and businesses mo- ving to Denmark, for example, will be improved. The possibility to surrender digital power of at- torney and consent will be made easier. Stricter requirements from the EU for mutual acceptance of e-identities across borders must also be met. 7.4 NEW GENERATIONS OF NEMID, NEMLOG-IN AND DIGITAL POST NemID, NemLog-in and Digital Post are necessary to ensure efficient and secure digital self-service for citizens and businesses. New tendering pro- cedures will be held for the three infrastructure components in the strategy period. Among other things, the tendering procedures will ensure con- tinuous development of the systems so that they are up-to-date, user-friendly, and secure, and so that they meet the needs of authorities, citizens and businesses. 7.5 SECURE ID SOLUTIONS FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE The need for a more secure identification solu- tion for children and young people has arisen in line with the increasing use of digital solutions. This need applies in particular to the group of 12-15-year-olds who do not yet have a NemID, but have an increasing need for digital confidentiality in connection with login to school intranets, for example. Methods to develop an ID solution for children and young people will be analysed. THE PUBLIC SECTOR PROTECTS DATA Denmark has come a long way in estab- lishing an up-to-date and robust basis for eGovernment. In the years to come, the public sector will strive to consolidate the Danish digital foundation. A robust digi- tal foundation is about ensuring common frameworks for IT architecture, and a con- sistent IT infrastructure. Common frameworks for IT architec- ture in the public sector Effective sharing of data across authorities and with citizens and businesses requires possibilities to reuse relevant data. For IT systems in one public authority to be able to retrieve, understand and use data originating from a system in another authority requires a common framework for how authorities describe and exchange such data. While many authorities, within their respective areas, have developed architecture patterns for their IT systems, common architecture principles and guidelines are necessary for systems to be able to exchange and use data easily and securely across authorities. Prin- ciples and guidelines are based in part on the common public sector work on the Basic Data Programme. Consistent IT infrastructure The common public sector digital infrastruc- ture and digital platforms such as NemID, NemLogin, NemKonto bank account, virk.dk, Digital Post, The Civil Registration System etc. are now just as important for Danish society as the physical infrastructure such as roads, railways, the electricity grid and the telephone network. The individual in- frastructure components and systems are now so closely linked that a breakdown in one system will impact many other systems and solutions in the public sector as well as in the private sector. For instance, if NemID is down, users cannot read their digital post, use a self-service solution, log on to their online bank account or on to borger.dk. Focus area 8 Robust digital infrastructure WHAT DOES A COMMON PUBLIC SECTOR IT ARCHITECTURE MEAN FOR DATA SHARING? IT architecture to share data consists of common principles and guidelines to describe and exchange data, and it helps authorities retrieve and use data from each other's IT systems. The architecture makes it easier, simpler and more secure to integrate public IT systems with one another and it forms the basis for more efficient data sharing in the public sector. 52 53SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES Therefore, more than ever, there is a need for an approach in which authorities colla- borate across sectors in selected key areas to share information and ensure stable and robust solutions; an approach that makes it easy to gain an overview of the current operating status. It must be easy for the authorities to determine the system status if the systems become inaccessible or so overstretched that users are queueing up for access. This will enable the authorities to inform citizens and businesses about the status of their IT solutions. The digital solutions made available by the public sector must live up to the expecta- tions of citizens and businesses for data protection, information security and stable operation. The public sector must continue to deliver professional IT operations at all levels, so that public sector solutions can be robust, stable and effective. The infrastruc- ture will be checked regularly, and solutions and the common public sector components will be kept up-to-date. Danes must have quick access to the inter- net regardless of where they live or work in Denmark. Denmark generally has a highly developed broadband infrastructure, howe- ver in some parts of the country citizens and businesses still do not have the broadband speeds they want. Moreover, an increasing number of activities in the digital society require a good internet connection. BETTER BROADBAND THROUGHOUT DENMARK The Danish Government has a target that by 2020 all households and businesses must have access to a broadband connection with a download speed of at least 100 Mbit/s and upload speed of at least 30 Mbit/s. The point of departure of the Government is that broadband development should be market-driven, and regulation should be technology-neutral. In order to promote this development and ensure good broadband coverage throughout Denmark, the Government has taken a number of initiatives that will be implemented in the years to come: • Establishment of a test scheme with a government broadband funding pool of DKK 200 million • Better opportunities to utilise existing passive infrastructure for broadband such as empty underground pipes and conduits • Ambitious requirements for coverage in future frequency auctions • The BoligJobordning (tax deduction scheme for domestic and home-improvement services) can be used for the deployment of broadband. KNOWLEDGE OF CURRENT BROADBAND COVERAGE The Tjekditnet.dk website (check your internet) allows consumers, businesses, local govern- ments and regions to check the current broadband coverage and search for suppliers for a given address. The website is planned to be updated for smartphone use in 2016. In the 2013-2020 Strategy for Digital Welfare it was agreed to examine the requirements imposed by selected digital welfare services on local coverage. In 2016, a survey will be con- ducted of the broadband coverage as well as of the requirements imposed by the digital welfare services. 8.1 GOOD DATA AND EFFICIENT DATA SHARING A common public sector IT architecture will be developed to set the framework for sharing data between authorities. Among other things, public authorities will be able to use this architecture in their work on standardising and improving data, and when they need to share data with, or use data from, other authorities in connection with case pro- cessing, for example. The architecture consists of joint management of public architecture principles and guidelines as well as common frameworks for how to create and share good data. 8.2 ROBUST OPERATION OF THE COMMON INFRASTRUCTURE The collaboration on operation of crucial common public sector IT infrastructure systems will be strengthened and their mutual dependencies will be mapped. A common public sector communica- tion platform will be developed, on which author- ities and other stakeholders can find information about the current operating status. ROBUST DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE INITIATIVES 54 55SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES PROFESSIONAL MANAGEMENT OF IT SYSTEMS AND IT PROJECTS The Danish welfare model requires stable and efficient IT systems, and this is why good management of IT is crucial. The coming years will see a massive professionalisation of IT man- agement in the central government to ensure a robust IT portfolio and foundation for further work to digitise central government. Moreover, the central government will prioritise its IT costs to ensure efficient administration of taxpayers' money. Finally, genuine competition and profes- sional collaboration with suppliers utilising market innovation forces need to be ensured. THE COUNCIL FOR IT PROJECTS For a number of years, the central government has been working consistently to improve man- agement of major government IT projects, e.g. under the auspices of the Council for IT Projects. This has contributed to positive developments for IT projects. However there is a need for fur- ther professionalisation, e.g. in connection with support of contract and supplier management as well as in agile development projects. An analysis of the overall government IT area, which will be completed in 2016, will identify central government management of IT and IT costs. This will contribute to even more profes- sional management of government IT systems and projects MUNICIPAL COLLABORATION ON EXPOSURE TO MARKET MECHANISMS AND PROFESSIONAL SUPPLIER MANAGEMENT Through the joint municipal ordering organisation KOMBIT, local governments have exposed to market mechanisms a number of crucial business systems over which the former municipal- ly-owned KMD had a monopoly. In the coming years, local governments will face a challeng- ing task in implementing new, modernised IT solutions. By joining forces under KOMBIT, local governments can ensure a higher level of professionalisation with regard to specification, tendering procedures, implementation and subsequent administration of large IT projects. KOMBIT is also the hub of municipal knowledge, building on market dialogue, contract manage- ment and efficient operation of IT solutions. MODEL FOR MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF COMMON REGIONAL DIGITISATION PROJECTS For a number of years, Danish regions have been focusing on digitisation and have made Denmark one of the world leaders with regard to IT support for hospitals. IT projects throughout the healthcare services are increasingly becoming more complex and this increases require- ments for competences and management in projects. The regions have therefore developed a model for management and control of digitisation projects as a basis for the common regional projects under RSI (regional healthcare ICT). This model is in line with similar models in cen- tral government and local governments, and thereby supports collaboration on common public sector IT projects between regions, local governments and central government. The use of digital technologies and soluti- ons is increasing exponentially in society as a whole. Some individuals and businesses have welcomed these developments and can easily adjust to the changes. Others have taken some time to adjust to new ways of dealing with things, e.g. commu- nication with public authorities which has gradually become more digital in recent years. As a society, we are obligated to continual- ly ensure that individuals are able to cope securely and competently in a digital world, and not least on the labour market, where requirements for digital skills continue to increase. This applies to adults as well as new to generations growing up as digital natives. Competences for the digital generation Children's digital learning and education begins as early as at preschool and conti- nues throughout the educational system. Children and young people must therefore be able to use digital technologies, tools and platforms. They must possess know- ledge and skills to make qualified decisions and to navigate safely and securely on the internet. Children and young people of the digital generation must have the digital skills and culture to cope in a digital world and to communicate digitally with authori- ties. Focus area 9 Digitisation for everyone WHAT ARE DIGITAL COMPETENCES AND DIGITAL CULTURE? Digital competences and culture are generally important prerequisites for being able to cope in an evermore digital society. Digital competences include the ability to use digital solutions, tools and online platforms to search, collect and analyse information and knowledge. This includes being able to use a computer, tablet or smartphone to search information on the internet, use NemID, read Digital Post, use online banking etc. Public employees must be able to use technical tools in their work. For example, home carers use PDAs (Personal Data Assistant devices) and primary school teachers use digital tools and platforms when teaching. Digital culture is about preparing children and young people to cope socially and ethically in a digital world. Among other things, children and young people must obtain the necessary digital competences to enable them to use IT as a working tool and to acquire knowledge and solve problems. They must be aware of the possibilities and restrictions of the internet and know the consequences of their digital footprints on the internet. They must generally be able to show safe and responsible digital behaviour. 56 57SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES Help is available The Denmark of the future will embrace those who are ready to digitise as well as those who cannot use the digital channels and solutions or who do not have access to them. Individuals and businesses must have adequate knowledge and the necessary competences to communicate and interact digitally with the authorities. Denmark has unique collaboration between local govern- ments, regions, the central government, vol- untary organisations, and increasingly also the business community. All these players are strongly committed to improving the IT competences of the population. This collab- oration will be continued and expanded. Many citizens have needed, and still need, help to become digital and to use digital solutions. Therefore, it is still necessary to help individuals who find it difficult to use the new technology and communicate digitally with the authorities, or who have special needs for help. They should be giv- en the guidance and support they need. This could be help to learn basic digital skills such as using NemID and Digital Post. Others only need help now and again, for example, to carry out a transaction in a self-service solution. Local governments will continue to play an important role in this context. There should, of course, be good access to the public sector and help should be avail- able for individuals who cannot use digital portals to the public sector. Such individuals will still be able to contact and communi- cate with the public sector. This means that they can continue to receive printed letters and get help to deal with public authorities by other means than digitally. Moreover, businesses, which, in contrast to individuals, cannot be exempted from digital commu- nication and are only rarely exempted from Digital Post, will be offered help to use these digital channels. Security The public sector should be co-responsi- ble for improving information security in Denmark and for helping individuals and businesses to navigate securely in an increasingly digital world. Individuals in Denmark should have a high level of knowledge about secure online behaviour. Protecting business secrets etc. is a pri- mary consideration for businesses. Busi- nesses should be prepared to meet the challenges of digital security in order to reduce the risk of losing data due to cyber attacks. 9.1 DIGITAL SKILLS FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE From a young age, children and young people must build digital competences and culture to prepare them for the digital reality. Information campaigns about competent and safe navigation in the digital society will make children and young people aware of their use of technology so they can navigate safely online. Teaching programmes and material for pupils in primary and lower se- condary school and in upper secondary education will provide them with digital skills to interact di- gitally with society. 9.2 INFORMATION AND HELP FOR CITIZENS AND BUSINESSES Individuals and businesses who find it difficult to use digital solutions and to communicate digital- ly with the authorities must be given the neces- sary help and support. Initiatives aimed at spe- cial target groups will be launched on a regular basis to ensure that as many people as possible benefit from the digital opportunities. These in- clude young people, elderly people, people from non-western countries and businesses that are not quite ready for IT. The authorities will provide clear and consistent information adapted to the target group about the digital channels and por- tals to the public sector. 9.3 HIGH LEVEL OF AWARENESS OF INFORMATION SECURITY Technological and digital development impo- ses increasing requirements for the knowledge and competences of individuals and businesses. Therefore, ongoing information campaigns and initiatives about good digital behaviour will be lau- nched during the strategy period. The campaign and initiatives will generate knowledge about threats and prepare individuals and businesses for exploiting digital possibilities safely and securely. DIGITISATION FOR EVERYONE INITIATIVES 58 SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES 59 ACCESSIBILITY IN IT SOLUTIONS As more things can be carried out digitally, citizens are given new possibilities to gain easy and quick access to the public sector. This also applies to individuals with special challenges, e.g. disabilities. Their special needs should be taken into consideration as much as possible when developing digital solutions for the public sector. During 2016, a proposal for an EU directive on accessibility to public sector websites is expected to be implemented in Danish legislation. The directive is to ensure that public sector websites are developed such that as many people as possible can access the information on the websites and use self-service solutions. It is important that authorities as well as suppliers incorporate technical accessibility as an in- tegral part of digital solutions made available by the public sector. This applies to public sector websites and the digital self-service solutions, but also when developing infrastructure compo- nents such as NemID, Digital Post, etc. Public authorities must listen to input from stakeholder organisations, such as the Disabled Peoples Organisations Denmark, which can identify special needs for adjusting and making available solutions, for example certain types of letters in Digital Post. Where possible, public authorities will incorporate technical accessibility when deploying digital solutions in the individual sectors. For example, this could be in connection with digital welfare services in the healthcare and care sectors or the education area. For example, institutions, schools and local governments procuring digital teaching tools and materials may impose requirements for accessibility to the suppliers of the teaching materials.

The Digital Strategy 2016-2020 sets the  course for Danish public sector digitisation  efforts and their interaction with business- es and industry. Jointly with the businesses  and public institutions at local, regional and  central-government levels which on a daily  basis take advantage of the opportunities  provided by digitisation, this strategy will  help build the basis for a strong and secure  digital Denmark.  Some initiatives are being launched now.  Others will be defined or adjusted up until  2020 in response to the opportunities and  challenges ahead. Therefore, this strategy  will fully equip citizens, public employees  and businesses for the digital Denmark of  the future.  The Government, Local Government   Denmark, and Danish Regions  Denmark and the world are facing funda- mental changes. Rapid ongoing digital de- velopments are already changing the way  in which we live, the way we run our busi- nesses and the way our public services and  welfare services are delivered.   Technological developments have always  played a role in altering the way in which we  live, and new technologies have given us op- portunities that not many of us would want  to do without. The invention of the automo- bile gave us far more mobility and flexibility.  Automation of processing and packaging  processes within the food industry improved  opportunities within supply and flexible con- sumption. Old job functions have become  defunct and new ones have appeared in their  place. We have seen it all before.    However, the rate and evolutionary power of  technological developments will accelerate  in the years to come. Digital development  will be so fast, profound and unpredictable  that it will challenge and change society in  ways we cannot even begin to imagine.   What the future will bring is now more un- certain than ever. Artificial intelligence, nano  and biotechnologies, and the widespread  use of Big Data are already at our doorstep.  So, the future is now, not tomorrow!   The new technologies provide a multitude  of opportunities. However, this develop- ment also challenges society and demands  change and transition. It is not whether or  not the changes will happen, but how, as  a society, we are prepared to adapt and  to exploit the opportunities offered by the  new technologies to produce more pros- perity and welfare while still preserving the  uniquely Danish sense of security and confi- dence in each other and in society.  Digital Denmark  Just as globalisation, digitisation raises  many difficult questions. In a number of ar- eas, Denmark is well prepared for what the  future will bring. However, in other areas, we  still have a lot to learn. Therefore, the pub- lic sector must work closely with the Danish  business community, stakeholder organisa-  A STRONGER AND MORE   SECURE DIGITAL DENMARK  WHO IS PARTICIPATING?  The government Digital Strategies concern the authorities at all levels of government, from  state, to regions to municipalities - i.e. both the administrative institutions such as ministries,  agencies and the municipal and regional administrations, and the executive institutions such  as hospitals, public schools, universities, etc.    A STRONGER AND MORE SECURE DIGITAL DENMARK6 A STRONGER AND MORE SECURE DIGITAL DENMARK 7  Denmark is in a good position to embrace  the digital future. We are a small country  with a population that has great trust and  confidence in each other and in the public  sector. People generally have a high level  of education. People and businesses have  good digital competences and have gener- ally embraced digital technologies. There is  a strong tradition of collaboration and find- ing new and practical solutions between  public authorities, and across the public  and private sectors.   Furthermore, the public sector began in- troducing IT solutions early on, and for this  reason in particular it has high-quality data  sets and registries which are quite unique  in an international perspective. Denmark  has built a secure and robust digital in- frastructure, which allows individuals and  businesses to complete efficiently their  business with the public sector over the   internet. All of this has enabled a huge   digital transition in recent years.  Significant digital developments   in the public sector The internet is today the primary gateway  to public administration for the majority  of Danes. Individuals and businesses have  their own digital mailbox. Online self-  service has been made mandatory for more  than 100 administrative procedures. When  the Central Customs and Tax Administra-  tion (SKAT) opens up for online access to  tax assessments, digital Danes flood onto  the website.  Furthermore, digital solutions are an in- tegral part of many public services. Care  workers use tablet computers to moni- tor and register any changes in the health   status of their elderly clients. Teachers use  digital learning tools and materials to differ- entiate their teaching to the individual stu- dent, and health technologies make it possi- ble for patients to monitor their condition in  their own homes.   Some individuals and businesses have wel- comed the developments and can easily  cope, while others have taken some time to  adjust to new ways of dealing with things.  Local and regional governments have  played and are still playing an active role  in ensuring that citizens and businesses are  guided through the many changes and that  there is help available to those who stumble  on the way.   Focus on user centricity, sense of   security and public trust  The Danish welfare system builds on the  public's widespread confidence and trust  in the public sector. It is important that we  safeguard this public trust now that digital  communication and digital services from  the authorities are becoming an everyday   We must seize the digital opportunities  fact. It is absolutely vital that we establish  safe and secure frameworks for citizens and  businesses to interact digitally with the pub- lic sector.   Digital safety and security of individuals and  businesses are essential to being able to ex- ploit the opportunities offered by digitisation  to develop and improve the Danish welfare  system; and digitisation does offer huge op- portunities for individuals as well as for so- ciety in general.   The Danish public sector is designed to  ensure that services for citizens and busi- nesses are as far as possible organised at  local or regional levels within the frame- work of the law. This approach helps en- sure a greater sense of security and public  trust, as well as a greater degree of user  centricity in services. Therefore, digitisation  must underpin local decision power and re- sponsibility. When public services become  digital, people should not feel that the  public sector is becoming distant, with no  anchoring in the local community. Instead,  digitisation should promote a continued  feeling of local anchorage.  For example, digitisation can enhance the  degree of user centricity and the empower- ment of individuals because digital solutions  allow them easy access from home, or in  their local area, to services and information  of high quality, regardless of where in Den- mark they live. Digital services are becoming  increasingly more adaptable to the needs of  the individual, i.e. they are becoming ever  more user-centric. Furthermore, with digi- tal welfare solutions, citizens can become  'co-players' in delivery of their welfare ser- vices. With more efficient, digital solutions it  is possible to improve the quality of services  and enable local development.  Denmark has a well-developed infrastruc- ture for mobile and broadband coverage  However, if we are to continue to have a  society that works efficiently and with local  anchoring, we need to ensure that this good  mobile and broadband coverage is improved  even more.   Public-sector data must be   shared and reused We can establish a simpler and more co- hesive public sector in which the author-    A STRONGER AND MORE SECURE DIGITAL DENMARK8 A STRONGER AND MORE SECURE DIGITAL DENMARK 9  Government is to create good framework  conditions for commerce and industry and,  thus, contribute to growth in Denmark  through the promotion of digital solutions in  Danish businesses, through promotion of en- trepreneurship and through establishing the  foundation for Danish businesses to be able  to continue to compete in the global market.  The goal is for Danish businesses to become  better at exploiting new paths to growth. This   requires that Denmark and Danish busi- nesses become better at exploiting the  potential in, for example, automation and  new technologies, and, by doing so, en- hance productivity and competitiveness. This applies, in particular, to the many   Danish small and medium-sized enterprises.  Efforts by the public sector must promote  digitisation in the private sector. With more  digitisation, businesses will become better  at exploiting business potentials in a digital  world; they will become more competitive  and they will improve their productivity.  Creation of a strong digital Denmark with  new opportunities and improved frame- work conditions for businesses calls for  new public-private partnerships.   Data is an all-important resource in a digital  era; a resource which opens up for new busi- ness opportunities and which can be used to  optimise internal business procedures.  It is important that, within the framework  of the law, more public-sector data is made  available to businesses, so that this data  can serve as a driver for innovation and new  business opportunities in the private sector.  This should provide the business community  with good opportunities for finding, combin- ing and reusing data to develop new inno- vative products and services, so that busi- nesses will be well positioned in the future  competition.  Digitisation efforts should create strong  framework conditions for businesses and  support their digital transition. For example,  better and more user-friendly digital solu- tions and automated data collection from  businesses should contribute to the goal  of reducing significantly the administrative  burden on businesses.  ities can collaborate smoothly to provide  good and efficient services to individuals or  businesses based on the knowledge that  they already have about them. For this to  become a reality, the authorities must to  a greater extent be able to exchange and  access relevant data on individuals in a   secure manner; not least in situations in  which many authorities are involved.   Local, regional and central governments  therefore have to work towards more shar- ing of data wherever this is possible, rele- vant and secure. Increased use of data can  be supported by common data standards,  standardised data formats, common IT ar- chitectures and a robust IT infrastructure.  Increased sharing of data will enable new  generations of digital solutions which can  automatically find the necessary data. In- dividuals and businesses will save time  because they do not have to report data  unnecessarily. Furthermore, administrative  processes and case work will be eased if  manual workflows, and in some situations  decisions, can be automated.  More efficient sharing and exchange of data  between various IT systems and organisa- tional units will provide individuals and busi- nesses with more efficient case processing  procedures and more tailored and coherent  interventions.  In future, individuals and businesses should,  as far as possible, only have to submit, infor-  mation to the authorities once, instead of  having to enter the same information in seve-  ral places in public digital solutions.   Greater use and reuse of data will also im- prove the basis for the public services de- livered. This will also contribute to a more  modern and efficient public sector and, thus,  release resources which can be applied to  other political priorities.  These efforts should be continued, taking  account of the legislation on processing of  personal data and the individual's right to  privacy.  New business opportunities The business and growth policy of the     A STRONGER AND MORE SECURE DIGITAL DENMARK10 A STRONGER AND MORE SECURE DIGITAL DENMARK 11  Although Denmark has already become far  more digital, we have only just embarked on  the very extensive process of transition.  With digital solutions becoming ever more  widespread, citizens and businesses have  high expectations for digital public services  that are up-to-date and add value to every- day life.  However, technological developments are  happening at such a pace that we are not  always able to predict the digital opportuni- ties, users' needs and societal benefits that  the future will bring. When development  of the eIdentification solution NemID was  planned in 2008, smartphones were not that  widespread and the computer tablet had yet  to be invented. Therefore, it could not have  been predicted that, only a few years later,  users would want to be able to read their  digital post or log onto public-service web  portals and onto self-service or online bank- ing solutions from their mobile devices.   Continuous modernisation necessary Continuous improvement and adaptation of  public sector digital solutions and systems  are therefore necessary in step with the  development of technologies and of soci- ety. This will require investment. In future  years, it will also be necessary for a num- ber of authorities to modernise or replace   some of their IT systems, either because  they are outdated or because they are no  longer working according to their intended  purpose.   Furthermore, the IT solutions and process- es of a number of authorities are today  designed to match the internal needs and   organisation of the authority rather than the  needs of citizens and businesses which, in  many cases, go across authorities and sec- tors.  Much data is still stored differently and de- fined differently from one public authority  to another. This makes exchange of data  across sectors or administrations very dif- ficult. This in turn makes it unnecessarily  complicated for different authorities to col- laborate to deliver the best and most effi- cient services to individuals and businesses.  This calls for solutions.  Therefore, extensive development and  clear-up work is required so that citizens  and businesses can rest assured the ser- vice they receive is coherent and that the  IT systems function optimally. However, the  public sector has a solid foundation. Many  principles and methods have already been  developed by different authorities and can  be reused and disseminated to more au- thorities.   Denmark on the way  Expenditures and revenues will come  under pressure The public sector will be faced with a signifi- cant strain on public expenditure in the years to  come. This is due, in particular, to demands to  deal with an aging population, climate change,  housing and integrating refugees, as well as  more expenditure on the health services. At the  same time, impacts from the EU with regard to  the application of data across national borders,  legislation as well as language and accessi- bility requirements, will be significant for our  opportunities to develop Danish public services  and administrations.  Financing the Danish welfare system is based  on the taxes and charges paid by individuals  and businesses. However, digital development  and new business models will also challenge  the revenue models and regulatory models of  the public sector. The global, digital economy  is expected to grow and, in the long term, per- haps require new solutions.  New, internet-based business models can pro- vide new opportunities for growth, greater flex- ibility and a wider range of services for users.  However, with regard to taxation and market  regulation, etc., these business models will  also challenge the structure of society.     A STRONGER AND MORE SECURE DIGITAL DENMARK12 A STRONGER AND MORE SECURE DIGITAL DENMARK 13  THE DIGITAL STRATEGY  This Digital Strategy runs up to 2020, and  in it the central, regional and local govern- ments continue a series of initiatives from  the previous Strategy. Furthermore, a large  number of new initiatives will create the  foundation for the Danish public sector of  the future.   About the Digital Strategy Since 2001, digitisation of the public sector  has been driven by close and binding collab- oration between local, regional and central  governments. This is applies especially in   areas in which it is necessary and appro- priate to develop cross-cutting solutions.  The work has been embedded in multi-year  strategies covering central, local and region- al governments.   The strategic digital initiatives make it pos- sible for the public sector to make joint   investments in areas which are particu- larly complex and in which there are inter-  dependencies across different authorities  and sectors.   Digitisation has proven to be an effective and  efficient tool to rethink processes and work- flows in the public sector. Furthermore, in  several areas, digitisation has given rise to  a break with the compartmentalised think- ing that is often applied by the public sector.  The tradition of common public sector stra- tegic work on digitisation entails continuous   endeavours for closer public sector colla-  boration to deliver good, efficient and coher- ent services to citizens and businesses.   Strategic interaction Digital strategies are not the sole answer to  all the challenges facing Denmark.   The individual authority has a responsi- bility to realise the digital potential within  its own auspice and, thus, to ensure that   digitisation leads to the desired change. In  parallel with joint public sector efforts, there  are sector-specific digitisation projects and  strategies, for example joint municipal and  regional digital strategies. This approach to  public sector digitisation efforts provides a  good balance between common strategic  targets and local adaptation and priorities.   Furthermore, interacting with the public  sector, private businesses, trade organisa- tions and NGOs are also contributing to find- ing common solutions for the digital transi- tion and helping to secure the foundation for  a strong and secure Digital Denmark.  15 years of digital strategies  2001 DIGITAL  COLLABORATION  • Digital signature   •  Citizens can send emails   to public authorities   •  Digital communication    by the authorities  •  NemID (eID solution),  NemLog-in (federated user  management and log-in to  online public services etc.),  eIndkomst (digital reporting  of income)  •  Digital Post (digital  mailbox for messages and  commications from public  authorities), NemSMS (text  message reminders from  the authorities), Borger.dk  (digital public services web  portal for citizens)  •  Authorities must use   common IT infrastructure  •  NemKonto (mandatory  default citizen's account  for payments from the  authorities) and eInvoicing  •  Virk.dk (digital public  services web portal for  businesses) and Sundhed. dk (web portal providing  personal access to all own  health data)  •  Secure government email  systems  2004 EFFICIENT  PAYMENT AND  INTERNAL  DIGITISATION  2007 COMMON  INFRASTRUCTURE  2011 DIGITAL  COMMUNICATION   •  Digital Post made  mandatory for individuals  and businesses  •  Online self-service  solutions made  mandatory for individuals  and businesses  •  Dissemination of digital  welfare services  •  The Basic Data  Programme  DENMARK IN THE DIGITAL LEAD  Over the past 15 years, Denmark has undergone a unique transition to digital public admini- stration, communication and services. A number of solutions originating from previous digi- tal strategies have now become routine.  With NemKonto (a mandatory citizen's account for payments from the authorities), the  authorities now know which account to pay benefits into. Furthermore, with the secure  eIdentification solution NemID everyone has a secure means of personal identification and  authentication online. Digital registration of real property rights makes it easier to buy and  sell property. Several common, cross-sectoral web portals have been established such as a  web portal with access to personal health data (sundhed.dk), a single-point of access to all  digital public services (borger.dk), and a public services web portal for businesses (virk.dk).  Furthermore, a digital income registry has been established so that, in a number of areas,  individuals are no longer burdened with reporting and documenting changes to their income  in order to receive benefits.   Some of the most recently introduced initiatives include mandatory Digital Post and man- datory online self-service for individuals and businesses. Telemedicine solutions for people  with chronic disorders and digital learning tools and materials are becoming more wide- spread throughout Denmark. Furthermore, much public-sector basic data is now available  online and free of charge for individuals, businesses and authorities alike. All of this makes  up the solid foundation which the public sector will develop further up to 2020.    A STRONGER AND MORE SECURE DIGITAL DENMARK14 A STRONGER AND MORE SECURE DIGITAL DENMARK 15  Vision: Public sector digitisation creates  value and growth, it provides efficiency   improvements and it secures the confidence  of Danish people in the digital society.   Digitisation can provide better quality in pub- lic services and it can lead to a more cohesive  and efficient public sector that creates value  for individuals and for businesses.   Denmark has come a long way in the digital  transition of the public sector, but a lot of  work still lies ahead.    This Digital Strategy 2016-2020 sets three  ambitious, but realistic, goals for the devel- opment of a more digital public sector in the  years to come:  The Digital Strategy sets three ambitious goals supported by focus areas. Each focus area  includes a number of underlying, specific initiatives to contribute to realising the goals.   VISION AND GOALS The Digital Strategy 2016-2020  SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE   MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES  THE PUBLIC SECTOR   PROTECTS DATA  ROBUST DIGITAL   INFRASTRUCTURE  DIGITISATION FOR   EVERYONE  7 8  DIGITAL SOLUTIONS MUST BE EASY-TO-USE,  QUICK AND ENSURE HIGH QUALITY   A USER-FRIENDLY AND  SIMPLE DIGITAL PUBLIC   SECTOR  BETTER USE OF DATA   AND QUICKER CASE    PROCESSING  BETTER AND MORE  COHESIVE WELFARE   SERVICES  1 2 3  DIGITISATION MUST PROVIDE GOOD  CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH  BETTER FRAMEWORK FOR  THE BUSINESS    COMMUNITY  PUBLIC-SECTOR DATA  AS A GROWTH DRIVER   AN EFFICIENT   UTILITIES SECTOR  4 5 6  9  Security and confidence must be in focus at all times The great confidence Danes have in each other and in the public sector is the foundation of  Danish welfare. We must safeguard this sense of security in an ever-more digital society.  Therefore, we will improve information security in the public sector and enhance the digital  competences of citizens and of businesses. A digital infrastructure for the public sector that  is crucial for society must be robust and it must meet the needs of its users. Moreover, Den- mark will be an inclusive society in which everyone can participate, both those who are ready  to digitise, and those who cannot use the digital solutions or who do not have access to them.  Public sector digitisation must provide good conditions for growth Digitisation will make it easier to run a business and will contribute to the Government’s  goal to reduce the administrative burden on the business community by DKK 3 billion by  2020. The ambition is that the administrative burden on businesses from reporting to  public  authorities is to be removed through automatic business reporting. All solutions aimed at  businesses will be integrated in the Virk.dk portal, and businesses will meet a public sector  that fully supports their digital transition. The business community will have access to more  public-sector data that can form the basis for new business opportunities and innovation.  Digital solutions must be easy-to-use, quick and ensure high quality The Danish public should see that public-sector digitisation adds real value to their lives.  The public sector must offer high-quality digital services and digital welfare solutions.   Digitisation should make life easier, make it easier for people to help themselves, and im- prove the quality of public services. The authorities will share relevant information and  work together better for the individual person or business. Furthermore, digitisation will  contribute to a more cohesive and efficient public sector.

This is  practical and it saves time for the citizens,  businesses and the authorities. Therefore,  it is vital that public-sector digital solutions  and services are user-friendly, intuitive and  of high quality, so that users continue to  have confidence in using public-sector digi- tal services.  Work to make modern, digital solutions  available for citizens and businesses has  only just begun. It has to be easy for citizens  and businesses to navigate public digital  universes to ascertain whether a digital ap- plication has been filled out and submitted  correctly, for example, and to know what to  do next in the process.  Therefore, in some areas there is a need to  improve public digital services so that digital  communication between the users and the  public sector stays up-to-date. At the same  time, digitisation can be used as a lever to  improve authority communication and coor- dination across sectors.   Being digital should be easy Denmark will have high-quality digital ser- vices. Citizens and businesses will see that  digitisation of public services adds real val- ue to their lives.  Today, we are used to seeing easy and rap- id digital services from private businesses  make a positive difference in our lives. For  example, when we can easily transfer mon- ey to each other via our mobile phones, buy  birthday presents on the internet, or check- in and choose our seats in the aeroplane  from home before we travel.  It will be equally easy and quick to be in  digital contact and have dealings with the  public authorities. This means, for exam- ple, that the individual self-service solu- tions and digital solutions (such as NemID  and Digital Post) have to be user-friendly,  up-to-date and of high quality. The plan  is that increasingly digital services from  the various authorities will also be acces- sible from those places on the internet  where citizens and businesses are already   active. The common public-sector portals,   borger.dk and Virk, will also continue to play  a central role as entrances to digital public-  sector solutions.  Digital developments are so rapid that we  cannot always predict what technical pos- sibilities and user requirements there will  be in the future. Therefore, the user-friend- liness of public digital solutions for citizens  and for businesses must be measured  regularly. Knowledge about the effect and   DIGITAL SOLUTIONS MUST BE EASY-TO- USE, QUICK AND ENSURE HIGH QUALITY  FOCUS AREAS  THE GOAL  Public-sector self-service solutions, websites and portals will constantly be improved so  that it is easier to deal with administration and so that services are more targeted towards  the individual user. If services are more intelligent and more efficient, and if users are already  active on the internet, then users can serve themselves more easily and quickly at whatever  time it suits them.   The authorities will share relevant information with each other and they will automatise   administrative procedures so that citizens and businesses experience shorter case-proces- sing times for digital applications and notifications. Furthermore, users will be less likely to  have to spend time submitting the same information to several places and finding documen- tation for information that is already in public registries.   Better information sharing between authorities will also provide citizens with more cohe- sive pathways when a case crosses between authorities, for example a treatment pathway  in which both a hospital and the municipal healthcare services are involved. Furthermore,  the overall welfare of Danes will be improved through the dissemination of digital welfare  solutions.  1.  A USER-FRIENDLY AND SIMPLE DIGITAL PUBLIC SECTOR  2.

In future, business- es and the many individuals ready for digital  solutions should be confident that they will   receive in digital format all relevant post  from the public sector that can be digitised.   The right help Digital communication with the authorities  can be an advantage, for example for the el- derly who do not live close to their families.  Digital solutions mean that family members  can help by notifying change of address or  applying for housing benefits from their own  home. Using a digital power of attorney,  people will be able to let their families and  others they trust take care of their interests   and access the necessary data digitally. This  means that families and others will not have  to use solutions such as paper forms or let- ter post to help someone with their digital  administration.  Improving digital communication will mean  that fewer people will have to pick up the  phone or turn up in person at the citizen  service centre to get help, and it means  that businesses can save time. At the same  time, people who still need help will get it. It  will be easier for citizens and businesses to   locate and receive the right help, irrespec- tive of whether they are having trouble with  NemID, Digital Post, borger.dk or Virk.  value of solutions for users and for the au- thorities will be used to improve solutions  and the information and service received by  users.   Cohesive digital services Communication to citizens and businesses  must be clear and coherent so that users  are well-informed and feel secure. Users  should meet a service-oriented public sector  that can guide them rapidly and effective- ly through the relevant authority areas and  services. Poor language or complex rules  and processes must not obstruct fast and  effective communication.  User journeys through the public digital solu- tions will be easier and clearer from start to  end, so that users know what to do when  attending to matters with the public sector.    A particular common public-sector respon- sibility is to ensure that users receive a   cohesive service when they are to deal with  different elements of the same case. This is  especially relevant when a user is in contact  with several different authorities and has to  use several self-service solutions, perhaps  on different authorities’ websites.  For example, the user journey for an entre- preneur to set up a company will be made  more user-friendly and cohesive, where to- day at least five or six self-service solutions  are required. Firstly, the business has to be  registered on the business portal virk.dk to  get a central business registration number,  and a NemKonto bank account for the busi-  ness has to be set up with a bank. Next, a  NemID eID and digital signature has to be  ordered on medarbejdersignatur.dk and a  Digital Post mailbox needs setting up for the  business.  There could also be improvements in digi- tal user journeys for private individuals, for  example in connection with moving home or  filing for divorce.   Better insight and overview The public sector must be more transpar- ent. Therefore citizens and businesses must  have easier access to data about themselves  held by a specific authority. Furthermore,  users should have a greater insight into their  cases, applications, data and relationships  with the public authorities.  The public digital services will be adapted  to the current situation and needs of the  individual citizen or business, so that the  user meets personalised, relevant content  on public-sector websites or portals which  the user feels competent and confident in  navigating. For new parents, it is relevant  to know where and how to name their baby  or to enrol the child on the waiting list for  a daycare institution. People approaching  retirement require other solutions and in- formation, for example about pensions and  health benefits.  Today, the authorities can choose whet-  her they will send communications to   users digitally or by surface mail. On the  other hand, individuals and businesses have   DIGITAL POST FOR PARENTS WITH JOINT CHILD CUSTODY   The authorities are increasingly sending correspondence as Digital Post. If the authori-  ties send Digital Post to parents about their joint-custody child, there are circumstances in  which just one parent receives the correspondence. This can happen even if, in some areas,  the legislation states that both parents are to be informed about matters relating to their  child.  The regulations in sector legislation and the individual administrative area determine  whether both parents have to be informed about matters relating to their child. Therefore,  a common set of guidelines will be drawn up for the authorities, outlining the situations in  which information about a joint-custody child is to be sent to both parents.  The guidelines will help clarify how correspondence is to be sent in accordance with   relevant legislation. This will also secure equality between parents with regard to receiving  information about a joint-custody child.  In the summer of 2016, it will be technically possible for authorities to send one Digital Post  communication to several recipients. This means that it will be easier for the authorities,  with few administrative procedures, to ensure that both parents of a child receive Digital  Post about the child.  DIGITAL SOLUTIONS MUST BE EASY-TO-USE, QUICK AND ENSURE HIGH QUALITY    25DIGITAL SOLUTIONS MUST BE EASY-TO-USE, QUICK AND ENSURE HIGH QUALITY DIGITAL SOLUTIONS MUST BE EASY-TO-USE, QUICK AND ENSURE HIGH QUALITY24  1.1    MORE COHESIVE USER  PATHWAYST  Citizens and businesses will experience a more  user-friendly and coordinated service when  their need for service goes across digital solu- tions and authorities. Work on selected user  journeys, for example divorces or business  start-ups, will secure easier and more straight- forward self-service processes. Users will be  guided through the process and thereby they  will be able to serve themselves easily and sim- ply in a more cohesive administrative procedure.  1.2    BETTER DIGITAL COMMUNICATION  In order to ensure user-friendly and up-to-date  digital solutions, self-service solutions, infra- structure components and portals must meet  a few agreed requirements when new solutions  are developed or further developed. The re- quirements are drawn up in collaboration with  relevant authorities. For example, these may  include that solutions are to work on mobile  devices, be accessible for the disabled, and be  tested by users. Data will be collected about  user experience and use of the solutions so that  solutions can constantly be improved.  A USER-FRIENDLY AND  SIMPLE DIGITAL  PUBLIC SECTOR  INITIATIVES  Time is one of the important service parame- ters in a digital society. The huge amounts of  data already under the charge of the public  administration will be used more extensively  to benefit citizens and businesses wherever  possible within the framework of legislation.  Simpler rules, better processes and reduc- tions in the administrative burden will make  the public sector more efficient and easier  to use for the individual person and for bu- sinesses.  Relevant knowledge to be used   across authorities Relevant information from self-service solu- tions, public registries, etc. will be exchanged  much more extensively between the autho- rities’ specialist systems, it will support the  work of case officers and it will be reused  across authorities in order to simplify repor- ting to authorities as far as is technically and  legally possible.  In the long term, it will be possible for far  more case decisions to be made more rapid- ly, and in some cases immediately, because  the necessary information is correct and  available in the right place at the right time  in the course of a case. This is already happe- ning to some extent, for example with regard  to payment of benefits such as child allow-  ance, maternity leave benefits and state reti- rement pensions.  This means that citizens and businesses  are seeing shorter case-processing times,  and more often receive an immediate reply,  for example, as to whether they qualify for  a specific benefit,  as well as the amount to  which they are entitled. Furthermore, the  authorities can perform tasks more efficient- ly, for example when it becomes possible to  automate parts of case processing.  As far as possible, citizens and businesses  will not have to spend time submitting the  same information to several places or pro- viding documentation for information that  is already in public registries. For example,  when people have submitted information  in one context to one authority, they should  not have the inconvenience of submitting the  same information to another authority. This  could mean, for example, that digital appli- cations, reportings and notifications already  have some fields completed with relevant  information in advance. This means that ci- tizens and businesses can have their cases  processed faster, for example when applying  for something or notifying any changes.  Reusing data from public registries also con- tributes to preventing incorrect payments   Focus area 2  Better use of data and quicker   case processing  1.3    OVERVIEW OF OWN INTERACTIONS  WITH AUTHORITIES, AND BENEFITS  Citizens and businesses will be offered insight into  relevant information about themselves held by pub- lic authorities. This information will be presented in  a context tailored to the individual user. The author- ities will increasingly actively inform citizens and  businesses about important events. For example, this  may be a text reminder that it is time for children to  be vaccinated. This means that users will be better  able to react to important information in due time.  1.4    BETTER TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR  CITIZENS AND BUSINESSES  It will be easier for users to get help if they have  problems with NemID, NemLog-in, Digital Post, etc.  A number of common public-sector support pro- grammes will be gathered together so that it is easier  for citizens and businesses to get help or to be guided  to the right authority. Information about operational  problems and disruption in common solutions for de- central authorities will be enhanced so that they can  provide the best help for users. Knowledge about the  problems users meet will be collected and used to  improve the digital solutions.  1.5    ALL COMMUNICATION FROM THE  PUBLIC SECTOR IS DIGITAL  In future, businesses and the individuals ready for  digital solutions will receive all their post from public  authorities digitally. However, this will exclude specif- ic types of correspondence, for example letters that  can only be managed physically, for example sample  letters which contain vials, health-insurance cards,  etc. Similarly, exchange of digital notifications be- tween authorities will take place through efficient use  of digital channels such as secure email and Digital  Post, among other things through metadata mark-up  of notifications.    26 27DIGITAL SOLUTIONS MUST BE EASY-TO-USE, QUICK AND ENSURE HIGH QUALITY DIGITAL SOLUTIONS MUST BE EASY-TO-USE, QUICK AND ENSURE HIGH QUALITY  and fraud, among other things, because the  individual or business is not at risk of for- getting to notify changes in information. Or  because the rules are so complex that users  unintentionally submit incorrect information.   Legal framework conditions   for a digital age However, data sharing not only poses a te- chnical challenge. There is also a challenge  in safeguarding a regulatory framework to  ensure that new opportunities offered by  digitisation become assets for Danish so- ciety. The legislative framework should be  up-to-date so that it does not restrict more  than necessary data sharing across sectors  and functions. If specific legislation does not  allow digitisation of processes, this will be  examined in more detail. This might lead to  proposed legislative amendments.  Simpler rules can provide better opportunity  for smoother administrative processes and  can make the public sector more efficient  and easier to use for citizens and businesses.  At the same time, the legislative framework  should continue to set very clear limits so  that data on citizens and businesses is only  collected and used where necessary and  where it produces value for the individual  and for society.  Some Danish acts and regulations covering  digitisation originate from EU regulations.  This places requirements on the way we or- ganise the Danish digital public sector and  the way we design our digital solutions and  infrastructure, etc. The EU's General Data  Protection Regulation will influence how we  can work with data in the public sector and  in society in general in the future.  INITIATIVES  THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION The upcoming General Data Protection Regulation is expected to be adopted by the EU during  2016. The objective of the Regulation is to provide better protection of citizens' rights in con- nection with processing of personal data, to improve the possibilities for exchanging personal  data in the European single market, as well as to reduce administrative burdens and moder-  nise the regulations to reflect the realities of a digital world.   Amongst others, the regulation continues and specifies a number of obligations under the  current Data Protection Directive which has been implemented into Danish law through the  Processing of Personal Data Act. The Regulation also introduces new requirements on public  authorities, for example to appoint a data protection advisor and, in certain situations, prepare  impact analyses. Important work lies ahead with regard to establishing clarity about the sig-  nificance of the Regulation for digitisation work, including identifying the specific consequenc- es for public authorities. This work will be performed collaboratively between the relevant  public parties.  WHAT IS BASIC DATA? The public authorities register core information about individuals, businesses, real property, build- ings, addresses, and more. This information is called basic data and is used throughout the public  sector in day-to-day casework by the authorities. Basic data therefore has to be reliable, of high  quality, coherent across registries and databases, and easy to access for authorities, businesses  and citizens. All basic data will be retrievable from the Data Distributor.  ABOUT THE BASIC DATA PROGRAMME Basic Data Programme has set the framework for joint, structured and coordinated work in  a number of prioritised basic data areas. Public registries with central basic data have been  improved and data has been made available free of charge to public authorities, businesses  and citizens. Less double registration, fewer parallel registries and less expenditure on ad- ministration can lead to considerable efficiency improvements in government. Furthermore,  businesses and citizens can be spared from having to provide the same information to the au- thorities again and again. In a number of areas, businesses can moreover retrieve basic data  free of charge and use it to develop new, smart solutions and products.   2.1    CLEAR LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR  EGOVERNMENT  Legislation and regulations should be adapted to  the digital age. To address the cross-sectoral legal  challenges of more eGovernment and more use of  digital data, a standing committee will be set up  under the auspices of the Agency for Digitisation.  This committee will collect, screen and prioritise  cross-sectoral legal challenges identified by the  authorities. The committee will prepare solutions  for how to deal with the challenges identified.  2.2    PROGRESS WITH GOOD   BASIC DATA We must make even more progress in creating  good public sector basic data. Therefore, efforts  will be set in motion to improve the quality of,  and reach the targets set for, existing basic data.  The opportunity for launching potential new   basic data projects, including on pay and salaries  data, as well as joint solutions and services such  as tailored data extracts, will be examined. A per- manent governance structure will be established,  so that the authorities can continue their work to  establish reliable and coherent basic data of high  quality.  2.3    CORRECT PAYMENTS AND BETTER  DATA ON THE INDIVIDUAL  Work by the public sector to prevent incorrect  payments and fraud will be continued. Simple  and evidence-based control processes, harmoni- sation of concepts, high data quality and smooth  cross-government collaboration will contribute to  continued more efficient and effective efforts to  prevent incorrect payments and fraud.  BETTER USE OF DATA AND  QUICKER CASE PROCESSING    28 29DIGITAL SOLUTIONS MUST BE EASY-TO-USE, QUICK AND ENSURE HIGH QUALITY DIGITAL SOLUTIONS MUST BE EASY-TO-USE, QUICK AND ENSURE HIGH QUALITY  (COPD) makes these patients feel more se- cure in their everyday lives and gives them  more flexibility. Furthermore, telemedicine  involves the patients in their own treatment.  In addition, welfare technologies for home  care, such as paperless toilets, make citi- zens with disabilities less dependent on care  services. Digital welfare solutions also allow  healthcare and care staff etc. to plan their  work more intelligently and more efficiently.  Therefore, digital welfare solutions with a  proven track record should be deployed fur- ther, so that more citizens can benefit from  them.  At the end of 2016, a total of 16 projects will  have been launched or completed to test  digital welfare solutions on a large scale.   Experience from this will be used as a  launch-pad for taking things to the next lev- el and for Denmark to decide, up to 2020, on  the deployment of additional digital welfare  solutions with a proven track record of pro- viding value for citizens.  The continued development and testing of  digital welfare solutions and new technol- ogies for the public sector will in many sit- uations take place in collaboration with the  business community. This means that the  competences and experience of businesses  can be brought into play in the development  of public services. If digital welfare solutions  are deployed on a large scale throughout  Denmark, this will generate new opportuni- ties for businesses and give them additional  experience which, in turn, can lead to export  opportunities in the global market.   Digital learning materials and tools In a digital world, IT and digital tools and  learning materials should be a natural part  of didactic practices and teaching for chil- dren and young people. New digital tools and  learning materials must challenge the digi- tal generation at day-care facilities, schools  and other educational institutions, and sup- port good didactic practices and high-quality  teaching.  Many child carers and teachers are already  using digital tools and learning materials in  day-care facilities, schools and youth edu- cational programmes, etc. Digital tools and  learning materials can raise the didactic and  academic level, motivate children, young  people and college and university students,  as well as ensure they take a more active  role in their own learning, although at their  own pace and at a level suited to the indi- vidual.  Competencies  As welfare services are increasingly be- ing delivered digitally, public employees  must know how to use the digital solutions  in their work lives. Furthermore, public   employees at the frontline of the welfare  system should support and guide citizens  in the use of digital web portals, tools and  welfare solutions, as well as assist them in  their digital dealings with the authorities.  So, there is need for public employees with  the right competences, and this applies not  the least to those employees who are in di- rect contact with citizens, such as teachers,  child carers, and healthcare and care staff.  There is a need for a more holistic approach  to the digital interface between citizens and  the public sector. Citizens must find that digi-  tisation leads to improved and better coor- dinated welfare services. To realise this, the  authorities must to a greater extent share  relevant information with each other.   Knowledge sharing for better   welfare services The exchange of relevant health data be- tween the hospital and the local health  service, for example, makes it easier to co- ordinate cross-sectoral patient pathways. It  means that patients do not have to serve as  liaison and be responsible for the knowledge  transfer between various health staff. This  will provide security and improve patient  treatment.  Furthermore, it is vital that a young person  trying to build a life after prison is offered  help to re-enter society. For this to become  reality, the local social services should be  able to get timely information from the pris- on and probation services about the young  person's upcoming release from prison.  These two examples illustrate how sharing  relevant data allows government officials to  organise citizens' pathways more optimally  and coordinate things better on the basis of  the specific situation of the individual.  In the final analysis, intelligent sharing and  use of relevant data offer many benefits for   the individual as well as for society in gen- eral. However, this also places demands on  government authorities throughout the pub- lic sector to develop and expand further on  existing opportunities and arrive at a shared  understanding of IT architecture, data, clas- sification and data quality, so that data can  be exchanged securely, efficiently and ef- fectively, and taking account of the privacy  of the individual. Sharing data must always  be within the framework of the law - and  with the consent of the citizen, where this is   relevant. It should also be easier and digital- ly smoother to collect consent from individ- uals, so that processes are simpler.  Further deployment of digital   welfare solutions The majority of citizens want to live ac- tive lives, be able to cope on their own and  be free to do the things they enjoy. Digital  welfare solutions play an important role in  making this possible. As citizens in general  become increasingly more confident with  technology and digital solutions, and as new  user-friendly solutions are developed, digital  welfare solutions will become an ever more  integrated part of modern public services.  Further deployment of digital solutions  that provide freedom and empower individ- uals not only improves the quality of life  of individuals; it also improves the econo- my. For example, telemedicine for citizens  with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease   Focus area 3  Better and more cohesive welfare services    30 31DIGITAL SOLUTIONS MUST BE EASY-TO-USE, QUICK AND ENSURE HIGH QUALITY DIGITAL SOLUTIONS MUST BE EASY-TO-USE, QUICK AND ENSURE HIGH QUALITY  INITIATIVES  3.1    COHESIVE WELFARE PATHWAYS  FOR CITIZENS  Welfare pathways will be analysed: 1) cross-sec- toral, coordinating interventions for citizens with  concurrent substance use and mental health  disorders; 2) unemployed young people on edu- cational programmes; and 3) incarceration at in- stitutions under the prison and probation services  and subsequent reintegration into society. Pro- posals will be prepared for how to make pathways  more coherent for citizens, for example through  data sharing and smoother workflows. Experience  from this will be used to ensure more coordinat- ed, efficient and effective welfare pathways in the   future. At the same time, there will be pilot tests  of a shared approach to easy and uniform data  sharing across the various welfare areas.  3.4    DIGITAL LEARNING AND  TEACHING  Children and young people should benefit from  digital learning tools and materials that enhance  teaching. Before the end of 2018, the effect of   efforts to apply ICT in teaching in municipal pri- mary and lower-secondary schools will be meas- ured. There will be efforts to support the imple- mentation of the agreement that pupils, parents,  teachers and child carers have a shared user  portal as their digital access point for learning  materials, communications and other information  regarding the teaching in primary and lower-sec- ondary school. In 2019, all relevant upper-sec- ondary written exams will be digital, and in 2020  all relevant written primary and lower-secondary  school leaving exams will be digital.  3.5    DIGITAL COMPETENCES FOR  PUBLIC EMPLOYEES   Public employees should be qualified to deal with  the digital requirements of the future. The digi- tisation goals of Danish university colleges will  therefore be followed through and there will be  special efforts to enhance digital teaching skills  for school teachers and child carers. Further- more, every public employee will be continuously  informed about the requirements for information  security.  BETTER AND MORE COHESIVE  WELFARE SERVICES  3.2    BETTER DATA ABOUT DISABLED  AND MARGINALISED ADULTS  Work by local government to strengthen the  quality of social services work will be contin- ued. By supporting digitally a more uniform and  structured practice of documentation across lo- cal governments in the social services field, citi- zens will be ensured better pathways, systematic  follow-up on the effects of interventions, and  the opportunity for greater transparency across   target groups within the area. Furthermore, this  will also establish the foundation for sharing data  and collaborating across specialist fields and sec- tors.  3.3    FURTHER DEPLOYMENT OF  DIGITAL WELFARE SOLUTIONS  Experience gained from large-scale testing of digital  welfare solutions should be documented and solu- tions with a proven track record will be deployed  further to benefit citizens.  The goal is that eight dig- ital welfare solutions will have been analysed and  a binding decision taken before 2020 on nationwide  deployment of approximately four solutions. A suc- cessful deployment requires that several authorities  follow the same time schedule.    DIGITISATION  MUST PROVIDE  GOOD CONDITIONS  FOR GROWTH    34 35DIGITISATION MUST PROVIDE GOOD CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH DIGITISATION MUST PROVIDE GOOD CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH  DIGITISATION MUST PROVIDE   GOOD CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH  FOCUS AREAS  THE GOAL  Digital solutions have great significance for the framework conditions of businesses. Public  sector digitisation should contribute to realising the Government's goal to reduce the admi- nistrative burden on the business community by DKK 3 billion by 2020 and to make it easier  to run a business in Denmark. Digitisation and new technologies are drastically changing  the conditions for businesses. Also in the public sector, there is an untapped potential for  exploiting the opportunities provided by digitisation to rethink public services. It is the am- bition that a far greater part of reporting by businesses to the public authorities is to take  place automatically.  The public sector has large amounts of data which businesses can use to optimise their  procedures, and which can form the basis for new business opportunities and innovation.  Therefore, the public sector should make more public sector data available to businesses  and support exploitation of this data by businesses.  Data must to a greater extent be improved and made available in a number of specific areas  in which there is deemed to be a great potential for a more efficient and effective public  sector and new business opportunities for Danish businesses. This includes data on waste,  underground infrastructure, energy, topography, climate and water.  4.  BETTER FRAMEWORK FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY  5.  PUBLIC SECTOR DATA AS A GROWTH DRIVER  6.  AN EFFICIENT UTILITIES SECTOR  Throughout the years, the public sector has  played an important role in the digital transi- tion of businesses, for example through man- datory digital communication and e-invoi-  cing in dealings with public institutions and  authorities.  Public sector digitisation should continue  to contribute to raising the digitisation level  of businesses. At the same time, digitisa- tion must be targeted to make it easier and  more attractive to run a business. The public  sector must establish framework conditions  which strengthen productivity, business   development and competitiveness for Dan- ish businesses.  Less administrative burden Digitisation offers an opportunity to dras- tically reduce the administrative burden of  businesses. Businesses today spend a sub- stantial amount of resources on reporting  data to the authorities. Therefore, we must  continue work to reduce this administrative  burden.  Businesses should not have the nuisance  of submitting information to one authori- ty which another authority already holds.  Furthermore, there is a vision to complete- ly eliminate the many requirements for  manual reporting, and instead replace this  reporting with automatic business report-  ing. This will require that reporting become  more automatised, so that the relevant  data is retrieved directly from businesses’  own systems. This saves time for the indi- vidual business and means better and more  timely data for public authorities.  To achieve this, there is need for persistent  and strong focus over the next many years  on adapting IT systems, standardising data  and changing workflows. At the same time,  it requires addressing barriers relating to  administrative law and data law. This en- tails extremely complex work, but it is the  right way forward if digitisation is to make it  easier to run a business in Denmark.  Digital tendering procedures  As a consequence of the EU Public Procure- ment Directive, from October 2018 open  procedures must be digital, from announ-  cing to submitting tenders. Denmark should  aim even higher. The authorities are already  receiving invoices electronically. We there- fore have to aim at an even more digital  tendering and procurement procedure up to  and including payment, and we should ex- ploit the opportunities for reusing data.  A digital tendering and procurement proce- dure can make communication more effi- cient and reduce transaction costs for busi- nesses and public authorities alike. A more   Focus area 4  Better framework for the   business community    36 37DIGITISATION MUST PROVIDE GOOD CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH DIGITISATION MUST PROVIDE GOOD CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH  efficient tendering procedure will also make  it possible to stretch the taxpayers' money  further. At the same time, a digital process  can raise the visibility of relevant European  tendering procedures for Danish businesses.   Opportunity for cloud computing In upcoming years, there will be focus on  creating more competition in the market for  public IT solutions and reducing the IT oper- ating costs of the authorities.  The authori- ties should be allowed to exploit the entire  spectrum of IT solutions, including cloud  computing, and clear framework conditions  should be established for this.  For public authorities, improved possibilities  to make use of cloud computing in relevant  areas will mean that they can buy standard- ised and flexible IT solutions which, in turn,  will allow them to scale capacity up or down  as required. This can reduce queues when  many citizens want to log in to a given ser- vice at the same time. For the authorities,  cloud computing used in the right ways,  and taking the right security measures, can  therefore lead to increased technical and  commercial flexibility as well as cheaper  and more efficient IT solutions.  WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING? Cloud computing is a business model which entails buying standardised IT products (soft- ware, hardware or services) as a service over the internet. This means customers do not have  to install and maintain the IT products themselves in house.  Cloud computing can contribute to economic growth by reducing the costs of procuring and  operating IT systems. Furthermore, both customers and suppliers can scale IT products up  or down as required.  INITIATIVES  4.1    AUTOMATIC BUSINESS  REPORTING   The public sector should to a greater extent  use automation and data reuse between autho- rities and businesses. A trial process will be  carried out for a number of volunteer busines- ses in the area of financial and economic repor- ting to the public authorities. This process will  involve automatic exchange of accounting data  between the business and the authorities. This  trial process will include relevant analyses as  the basis for a decision on deploying automatic  business reporting.   4.2    DIGITAL TENDERING PROCEDURES  AND PROCUREMENT   According to the EU Public Procurement Directi- ve, digital tendering procedures must be in place  by October 2018, so that businesses can submit  tenders digitally in open procedures. An analy- sis of the tendering and procurement procedure  will be launched, which will identify opportuni- ties to use standards, technical requirements  and common public sector components, such as  interoperability with future versions of NemID,  NemLog-in, NemHandel, Virk.dk and encryption  components, etc. The analysis will describe how  a coherent digital tendering and procurement  procedure can be completed most efficiently  with a view to reducing transaction costs for the  contracting authority as well as for suppliers.   4.3    CLOUD COMPUTING IN THE  PUBLIC SECTOR  The public sector should have opportunity to use  cloud computing where this provides value and is  appropriate from both a commercial and a securi- ty perspective. Therefore, an updated legal guide- line will be prepared on the basis of the upcoming  General Data Protection Regulation, describing  the possibilities available for the authorities with  regard to cloud computing, and which also ad- dresses assessment and management of security  risks.  BETTER FRAMEWORK FOR THE  BUSINESS COMMUNITY     38 39DIGITISATION MUST PROVIDE GOOD CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH DIGITISATION MUST PROVIDE GOOD CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH  carrying out substantial new development  on existing systems. This must be with con- sideration for IT security and the protection  of data.   Smart Cities The use of new technologies such as solu- tions related to the Internet of Things (IoT)  and data used in the design of modern intel- ligent cities are often referred to as the con- cept of 'Smart City’. This could be waste bins  that automatically report when they need  emptying, intelligent traffic management  systems, and the collection, display and use  of public sector data.  Many Danish local and regional governments  have launched projects with Smart City   solutions, and Denmark has come a long way  in this area. Furthermore, Danish businesses  have a number of stronghold positions, for  example with regard to climate adaptation  and energy-efficiency improvement, waste  management, and user-friendly design and  architecture. Experience from these pro-  jects should be further developed and used  to promote the deployment of good Smart  City solutions.  In future, the use of more types of GPS data  and new technology will accelerate. It will  be easier to get dynamic localisation data in  real time, for example data about the move- ments of large crowds of people, road con- gestion, local environmental conditions in  connection with flooding and cloud bursts,  etc. Furthermore, the launch of the Euro-  pean Galileo satellite navigation system will  speed up the development of technological  solutions with accurate and dynamic data.  This new GPS data must be freely acces- sible and sharable across administrative  units and fields. Therefore, a common basis  for sharing dynamic positioning data across  public sector IT systems should be establis- hed. With this common basis, central, regio- nal and local governments can develop their  own separate systems and solutions which  can interoperate and be combined across  sectors and units.  The quantities and quality of data, as well as  our possibilities for storing and processing  these large quantities of data, are increasing  dramatically these years. The authorities at  central, regional and local government levels  today collect and produce large quantities of  data in their daily performance of tasks. Both  businesses and citizens report large quantiti- es of data to the public authorities. One of the  largest collections of data is therefore held by  the public sector.   Data as resource In an international perspective, Danish pub- lic sector data is of high quality and holds  a large commercial productivity and growth  potential. Businesses can use public sector  data to optimise their business processes  and to develop new products and services  which create value for citizens, public autho- rities and fellow businesses. In the digital  age, data is one of the most valuable resour- ces for running a business.   In recent years, the public sector has worked  to improve the framework conditions for the  accessibility of public sector data. With the  establishment of the Basic Data Program- me, businesses, citizens and authorities   gained access to an array of basic data such  as address data, business data and property  ownership data. The work to make reliable   and coherent public sector data available for  society will still be an essential focus area  in the future to boost data-driven innovation.  Benefits must be showcased Today, businesses and authorities often have  difficulty finding, combining and exploiting  public sector data. Therefore, there is a  need to improve the access of businesses  to public sector data which offers a grow- th potential for the businesses, and at the  same time promote increased use of data.   Data will not automatically be utilised me- rely by making it available. When data is  collected from a larger and more heteroge- neous number of sources, IT systems and  employees are challenged, not the least in  small and medium-sized enterprises. Expe- rience suggests that businesses should be  made more aware of the value of data and  that it should be easier for authorities and  businesses to experiment in using data.  Opening up for free access to public sector  data should take place wherever this is re- levant for businesses and cost-effective for  the authorities, and, of course, within the  framework of the law.  It can also be advantageous for the autho- rities to plan access to data from the be- ginning when buying new IT systems or   Focus area 5  Public sector data as a growth driver     40 41DIGITISATION MUST PROVIDE GOOD CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH DIGITISATION MUST PROVIDE GOOD CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH  INITIATIVES  5.1    OPEN PUBLIC SECTOR DATA    In order to promote public sector data, including  the commercial use of this type of data, a com- mon public sector partnership will be set up com- prising Open Data DK, Danish Regions, and the  Danish Business Authority. This partnership will  consult with businesses and experts to establish  a better overall picture of existing open data and  promote efforts to ensure access to more open  data. The objective of the partnership is also to  promote the use of open data, including by en- suring clear framework conditions for use, as well  as draw attention to the value of using data, for  example through hackathons and the establish- ment of a public-private data space.  5.2    SMART CITY PARTNERSHIP  A joint public sector partnership for Smart Cities  will promote the use of smart digital solutions  and data in urban development efforts as well as  support the commercial potential of Smart City  solutions. The Partnership will select three to five  action areas for focussed efforts to promote the  deployment of good Smart City solutions. This  could be in areas such as green and sustainable  development, intelligent traffic management sy- stems or use of sensor data.  5.3    INFRASTRUCTURE FOR  POSITIONING AND NAVIGATION  DATA  New, more accurate and reliable GPS data holds  the potential to alter the way authorities and pri- vate businesses solve problems, and render their  problem-solving more efficient and effective. An  analysis will be carried out of public sector and  commercial needs for establishing a common  public infrastructure for positioning and navigati- on data. The analysis will serve as the basis for  deciding on implementation of one or two pilot  projects.  PUBLIC SECTOR DATA AS A  GROWTH DRIVER  Danish society is dependent on good and ef- ficient utilities. The utilities sector supplies  electricity, gas, district heating, water and  telecommunications services to consumers  and it collects and manages waste and wa- stewater. In 2014, total costs of production  in the electricity, gas, district heating, waste  and wastewater sectors amounted to bil- lions of DKK, corresponding to 2.5 % of the  overall Danish economy.  Data on the utilities sector is important for  local government decisions about urban and  business development projects or for their  efforts to build future-proof critical infra- structure for society (to prevent flooding,  for example). At the same time, data on the  utilities sector can play a significant role in  strategic work by the public sector to realise  a cost-effective transition of Danish society  to less energy consumption, increased pro- duction, and more use of renewable energy.   Therefore, we must be good at planning and  managing the utilities area effectively and  efficiently. This will require better and more  coherent utilities data, which businesses,  authorities and citizens alike can rely on and  exploit.  Need for shared utilities data Utilities data includes topography and terra-  in data and water data, such as data about  wastewater (sewer lines). Utilities data also   includes data on the production and con- sumption of electricity, gas and heating, as  well as data about cables, for example tele- vision, traffic-light and internet cables, etc.  Many such data sets already exist, but the- se are often fragmented and difficult to find.  The quality and relevance of the information  is not homogenous, and it is often difficult to  combine the types of data necessary to op-  timise operations. This also makes it expen- sive and difficult for public authorities and  public sector companies to maintain the  many different systems and databases in  which the data is stored.  Open and quality-assured data is therefore  vital for efficient production and manage- ment in the utilities area. There is a great  untapped potential in the using data as a  driver to improve the efficiency of workflows  and procedures in the sector. This will ensure  higher returns on the Danish utilities infra- structure and, thus, lower prices for consu- mers and businesses.   At the same, an improved data basis will pro- vide new business opportunities for Danish  businesses. This applies to the primary utility  companies which can optimise their operati-  Focus area 6  An efficient utilities sector    42 43DIGITISATION MUST PROVIDE GOOD CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH DIGITISATION MUST PROVIDE GOOD CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH  ons, as well as to the businesses which, for  example, provide solutions for data-driven  decision support systems.  It is anticipated that increased integration  of different utilities systems will be vital for  conversion of the energy system to renewab- les which come from intermittent energy  sources, for example solar and wind energy.   Easy access to good utilities data Topography and terrain data as well as data  on water and the climate are vital when lo- cal and regional governments are to plan  and make decisions about, for example,  expanding water and wastewater manage- ment utilities to prevent sewers from over- flowing and to ensure clean drinking water  in connection with extreme weather events.  At the same time, effective common public  sector combining and distribution of ter- rain, climate and water data are important  and will provide positive benefits for other  sectors, such as building and construc-  tion, insurance and agriculture. Better and  more accessible data can also help promo- te innovation in private businesses, just as it  can open up for new data-driven products  and services for both private and public se- ctor clients.  Furthermore, the display and accessibility of  existing data on energy supplies, for examp- le production and consumption of electricity,  gas and heating, could greatly benefit the  Danish transition to less energy consump- tion and more renewables. This transition  has meant there is a strong demand for   coherent energy supply data, smart energy  management tools and data-driven decision  support systems, so that the transition can  be as cost-effective as possible. Better data  in the area can help produce an even more  efficient energy supply and push for the   development of new products in the energy  supply sector.  It should also be easier for businesses,  authorities and other stakeholders to get  information about underground infrastruc- ture, for example electric cables, district-  heating pipes, sewage pipes, natural-gas   pipes or antenna cables. Consistent infor- mation about the grid system will make it  easier and cheaper to maintain and establish  new underground infrastructure. Better sha- ring of data about underground infrastruc- ture can also reduce damage during digging  and excavation.  The waste area is facing serious challenges  with regard to generating data of adequate  quality and such that it is accessible and  useful for planning, inspection and develop- ment by local governments. It is necessary  to modernise existing national IT systems  used to collect data so that local govern- ments, for example, can use data about  waste to optimise waste management in  Denmark.  INITIATIVES  6.1    COMMON DATA ON TOPOGRAPHY,  CLIMATE AND WATER  Data on topography, climate and water is part of  the administrative foundation for many sectors  and authorities. Consistent provision of up-to-  date data on topography, climate and water  across sectors will contribute to more effective  administration, it will support the frequent emer- gency situations in connection with extreme we- ather events and it will promote development of  new products and technologies.   6.2    OPEN DATA ON ENERGY SUPPLY  Conversion to more renewable energy has crea- ted a substantial demand for data-driven decision  support and tools for smart energy management.  This requires the relevant data to be accessible  and of good quality. An analysis will be conduc- ted of the potential for making available data on  energy consumption in buildings. The analysis will  also identify general possibilities arising from in- tegrating this data into the utilities sector. Data  will be tested through a pilot project for ener- gy-efficient buildings.  6.3    EXCHANGE OF DATA ON  UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE   Currently, maintaining and constructing infra- structure is costly for authorities and businesses.  A digital platform will therefore be established  to exchange data on underground infrastructure  to streamline workflows, reduce damage from   digging and excavation, and to enable coordination  of digging activities as well as exploit synergies   between different supply infrastructures. The con- sequences of this initiative, including scope and  any phasing-in, will be discussed with the utilities  sector and the telecommunications sector.  6.4    OVERALL IT ARCHITECTURE FOR  DATA ON WASTE  Better data on waste will enable local govern- ments to plan, enforce and evaluate local govern- ment waste schemes more optimally to benefit  the public and businesses. Currently, waste data  is collected through a number of IT systems which  have been established separately and which can  only to a limited extent share data. An analysis will  be initiated to result in an action plan for flexible  registration, exchange and use of data between the  IT systems in the waste area.  AN EFFICIENT UTILITIES   SECTOR    SECURITY AND  CONFIDENCE  MUST BE IN FOCUS  AT ALL TIMES    46 47SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES  SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST  BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES FOCUS AREAS  THE GOAL  The public sector is to use and manage data on citizens and businesses with care and with  the appropriate level of security. Information security in the public sector must be improved.  Therefore, all authorities will have to commit to the principles set out in the international   information security standard ISO27001. This also means that public employees should  have, and be familiar with, clear guidelines on how to store and manage personal data on  citizens and confidential data on businesses.  The public sector should ensure robust and efficient operation of systems and IT infrastruc- tures that are crucial for society. New secure and user-friendly generations of NemID, Nem- Log-in and Digital Post must be able to meet future needs and allow citizens and businesses  to communicate securely and with confidence, both with each other and with public autho- rities.  Digitisation should be for everyone – also for individuals with special needs or challenges.  Digital competences of citizens and businesses and their knowledge about secure digital  behaviour must be improved. Assistance should be available to those who cannot use digital  solutions or who do not have access to them. Developing the digital skills of children and  young people already begins at preschool, and continues throughout school, further educa- tion and the rest of their lives.  7.  THE PUBLIC SECTOR PROTECTS DATA  8.  ROBUST DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE  9.  DIGITISATION FOR EVERYONE  Citizens and businesses should feel confi- dent and safe using digital public services.  The public sector must protect user data,  and therefore information security must be  improved throughout the public sector. This  should be done with emphasis on user-fri- endliness in digital solutions and on financi- al considerations.  New level of ambition Digital solutions and digital technologies  have created new possibilities for dialogue  and involvement, brand new businesses op- portunities, etc. However, increased digitisa-  tion has also brought with it a risk of new ty- pes of crime. Cyber criminals, misuse of data  and breaches of security are more serious  than ever. They pose a real risk in the form  of losses and costs for individuals, businesses  and public authorities, and they can also lead  to loss of confidence in IT solutions.   We must therefore aim high with regard to  information security in the public sector.  Not least the very serious cases of breach  of security in recent years have made it im- portant for all public authorities to be in full  control of information security and to follow  the international standards on managing and  storing data.  Secure management of information  about citizens and businesses The need to improve security has developed  in line with the increasing need for access to  personal data on citizens and confidential  data on businesses as a consequence of digi- tal transformation. Several employees deal  with sensitive or confidential data in their  work and case processing. Other security  procedures are required when manual pa- per-based workflows become digital and  sharing information becomes easier.  Citizens and businesses should feel confi- dent and safe when submitting information  to the public administration. They should be  able to trust that data will be used for rele- vant purposes and that it will not be lost or  fall into the wrong hands. The public sector  will use and manage sensitive and confiden- tial data with care and with the appropriate  level of security and privacy.   Public employees should have, and be famili- ar with, clear guidelines on how to collect, sto- re and use data, and not least sensitive per- sonal data and confidential data. Authorities  will control who has access to sensitive data  on the public and businesses. Management in  the authorities will assume responsibility for   information security, and the authorities will  ensure establishment of secure procedures   Focus area 7  The public sector protects data    48 49SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES  and workflows adapted to the individual  tasks. Among other things, this will be done  through consistently differential access to  data so that only relevant employees have  access to data on citizens and businesses.  Data protection will, as far as possible, be in- corporated into the design and development  of public IT solutions from the very outset.  Investing in security comes at a price. How- ever, in an ever-more digital world, data pro- tection is an increasing necessity to ensure  that people and businesses have confidence  in digital public services.  The public sector will work to spread the use  of common public security standards. More- over, the Danish public sector must have a  full realistic overview of the current security  situation and threat levels with regard to cy- ber and information security in order to react  and initiate preventive measures.   Secure digital identities In a globalised world, goods, services and  people are increasingly crossing borders, not  least between the EU Member States. At the  same time, the current refugee crisis means  that authorities and administrations in Den- mark will have to deal with a large number  of foreign citizens without a Danish or Euro- pean ID number. Correct digital identities  are required for citizens and employees of   businesses to communicate securely with  the authorities and with each other.  Therefore, there is an increasing need for  certainty about the identity of individuals and   businesses in a digital world. Among other  things, there is a need for a common method  and stricter process with regard to issuing  digital identities such as NemID to foreign  individuals and businesses in Denmark. This  will ensure that individuals can receive the  correct benefits, that businesses can report  correct data such as VAT returns, etc. Mo- reover, a better overview can prevent Danes  and foreigners from receiving benefits they  are not entitled to after moving away from  Denmark.  Similarly, there is a challenge with regard to  ensuring the right level of security in ID solu- tions targeted at children and young people  who are not old enough to have a NemID.  They should be able to navigate securely   online and log on to relevant digital solu-  tions, for example in connection with school.   As of 2018, digital identity (such as NemID)  must be usable in all public sector digital   solutions in all EU Member States. For  example, a Danish student will be able to use  a NemID in connection with an application to  study abroad. Moreover, a foreign employee  in Denmark will be able to log on to a Danish  self-service solution (to apply for a tax card,  for example) with the digital identity solution  of his/her own country.  Ongoing development of   common solutions The public sector has an important task in  making available central solutions to citi- zens and businesses that enable safe and  secure digital communication and interacti-  on. Individuals and businesses unable to use  digital self-service solutions must be given  the opportunity to surrender digital power  of attorney to another trusted party, and it  should also be possible to provide digital  consent.  The major common solutions, NemID, Nem- Log-in and Digital Post, will all be put up for  tender in the years to come. This will be a  good occasion to develop and rethink the  solutions in order to meet the future needs  for security, digital identities, rights manage- ment, communication, user-friendliness and  accessibility.    50 51SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES  INITIATIVES  7.1    WELL-MANAGED INFORMATION  SECURITY IN ALL AUTHORITIES   Information security must be managed better by  central, regional and local governments. All pub- lic authorities will therefore have to commit to  the principles set out in the international informa- tion security standard ISO27001. Efforts against  hacking incidents will be intensified. Information  security should be an intrinsic part of design and  development of public IT solutions on the basis of  the principles of 'data protection by design' and  'data protection by default'.  7.2    COMMON STANDARDS FOR  SECURE EXCHANGE OF  INFORMATION  Exchange of information must be conducted  securely throughout the public sector. Therefo- re, the current and future common public sector  standards for secure exchange of information will  be disseminated throughout the public sector.  7.3    DIGITAL IDENTITIES AND   RIGHTS MANAGEMENT  Systems and data must only be accessed by the  right people. This will be ensured through correct  assignment of digital identities (e-identities) and  rights. The common method to assign correct   digital identities to the public and businesses mo- ving to Denmark, for example, will be improved.  The possibility to surrender digital power of at- torney and consent will be made easier. Stricter  requirements from the EU for mutual acceptance  of e-identities across borders must also be met.  7.4    NEW GENERATIONS OF NEMID,  NEMLOG-IN AND DIGITAL POST  NemID, NemLog-in and Digital Post are necessary  to ensure efficient and secure digital self-service  for citizens and businesses. New tendering pro- cedures will be held for the three infrastructure  components in the strategy period. Among other  things, the tendering procedures will ensure con- tinuous development of the systems so that they  are up-to-date, user-friendly, and secure, and so  that they meet the needs of authorities, citizens   and businesses.  7.5    SECURE ID SOLUTIONS FOR  CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE  The need for a more secure identification solu- tion for children and young people has arisen in  line with the increasing use of digital solutions.  This need applies in particular to the group of  12-15-year-olds who do not yet have a NemID, but  have an increasing need for digital confidentiality  in connection with login to school intranets, for  example. Methods to develop an ID solution for  children and young people will be analysed.  THE PUBLIC SECTOR   PROTECTS DATA  Denmark has come a long way in estab- lishing an up-to-date and robust basis for  eGovernment. In the years to come, the  public sector will strive to consolidate the  Danish digital foundation. A robust digi- tal foundation is about ensuring common  frameworks for IT architecture, and a con- sistent IT infrastructure.  Common frameworks for IT architec- ture in the public sector Effective sharing of data across authorities  and with citizens and businesses requires  possibilities to reuse relevant data. For IT  systems in one public authority to be able to  retrieve, understand and use data originating  from a system in another authority requires  a common framework for how authorities  describe and exchange such data. While  many authorities, within their respective   areas, have developed architecture patterns  for their IT systems, common architecture  principles and guidelines are necessary for   systems to be able to exchange and use data  easily and securely across authorities. Prin- ciples and guidelines are based in part on  the common public sector work on the Basic  Data Programme.  Consistent IT infrastructure The common public sector digital infrastruc- ture and digital platforms such as NemID,  NemLogin, NemKonto bank account, virk.dk,  Digital Post, The Civil Registration System  etc. are now just as important for Danish  society as the physical infrastructure such  as roads, railways, the electricity grid and  the telephone network. The individual in- frastructure components and systems are  now so closely linked that a breakdown in  one system will impact many other systems  and solutions in the public sector as well as  in the private sector. For instance, if NemID  is down, users cannot read their digital post,  use a self-service solution, log on to their  online bank account or on to borger.dk.  Focus area 8  Robust digital infrastructure  WHAT DOES A COMMON PUBLIC SECTOR IT ARCHITECTURE MEAN  FOR DATA SHARING? IT architecture to share data consists of common principles and guidelines to describe and  exchange data, and it helps authorities retrieve and use data from each other's IT systems. The  architecture makes it easier, simpler and more secure to integrate public IT systems with one  another and it forms the basis for more efficient data sharing in the public sector.    52 53SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES  Therefore, more than ever, there is a need  for an approach in which authorities colla- borate across sectors in selected key areas  to share information and ensure stable and  robust solutions; an approach that makes  it easy to gain an overview of the current  operating status. It must be easy for the  authorities to determine the system status  if the systems become inaccessible or so  overstretched that users are queueing up  for access. This will enable the authorities  to inform citizens and businesses about the  status of their IT solutions.   The digital solutions made available by the  public sector must live up to the expecta- tions of citizens and businesses for data  protection, information security and stable   operation. The public sector must continue  to deliver professional IT operations at all  levels, so that public sector solutions can be  robust, stable and effective. The infrastruc- ture will be checked regularly, and solutions  and the common public sector components  will be kept up-to-date.  Danes must have quick access to the inter- net regardless of where they live or work in  Denmark. Denmark generally has a highly  developed broadband infrastructure, howe- ver in some parts of the country citizens and  businesses still do not have the broadband  speeds they want. Moreover, an increasing  number of activities in the digital society   require a good internet connection.  BETTER BROADBAND THROUGHOUT DENMARK The Danish Government has a target that by 2020 all households and businesses must have   access to a broadband connection with a download speed of at least 100 Mbit/s and upload  speed of at least 30 Mbit/s. The point of departure of the Government is that broadband   development should be market-driven, and regulation should be technology-neutral.   In order to promote this development and ensure good broadband coverage throughout  Denmark, the Government has taken a number of initiatives that will be implemented in the  years to come:  • Establishment of a test scheme with a government broadband funding pool of DKK 200 million  •  Better opportunities to utilise existing passive infrastructure for broadband such as empty   underground pipes and conduits  • Ambitious requirements for coverage in future frequency auctions  •  The BoligJobordning (tax deduction scheme for domestic and home-improvement services)   can be used for the deployment of broadband.  KNOWLEDGE OF CURRENT BROADBAND COVERAGE  The Tjekditnet.dk website (check your internet) allows consumers, businesses, local govern- ments and regions to check the current broadband coverage and search for suppliers for a given  address. The website is planned to be updated for smartphone use in 2016.   In the 2013-2020 Strategy for Digital Welfare it was agreed to examine the requirements  imposed by selected digital welfare services on local coverage. In 2016, a survey will be con- ducted of the broadband coverage as well as of the requirements imposed by the digital welfare  services.   8.1    GOOD DATA AND EFFICIENT   DATA SHARING  A common public sector IT architecture will be  developed to set the framework for sharing data  between authorities. Among other things, public  authorities will be able to use this architecture in  their work on standardising and improving data,  and when they need to share data with, or use data  from, other authorities in connection with case pro- cessing, for example. The architecture consists of  joint management of public architecture principles  and guidelines as well as common frameworks for  how to create and share good data.  8.2    ROBUST OPERATION OF THE  COMMON INFRASTRUCTURE  The collaboration on operation of crucial common  public sector IT infrastructure systems will be  strengthened and their mutual dependencies will  be mapped. A common public sector communica- tion platform will be developed, on which author- ities and other stakeholders can find information  about the current operating status.  ROBUST DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE  INITIATIVES  http://Tjekditnet.dk   54 55SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES  PROFESSIONAL MANAGEMENT OF IT SYSTEMS AND IT PROJECTS  The Danish welfare model requires stable and efficient IT systems, and this is why good   management of IT is crucial. The coming years will see a massive professionalisation of IT man- agement in the central government to ensure a robust IT portfolio and foundation for further  work to digitise central government. Moreover, the central government will prioritise its IT costs  to ensure efficient administration of taxpayers' money. Finally, genuine competition and profes- sional collaboration with suppliers utilising market innovation forces need to be ensured.  THE COUNCIL FOR IT PROJECTS For a number of years, the central government has been working consistently to improve man- agement of major government IT projects, e.g. under the auspices of the Council for IT Projects.  This has contributed to positive developments for IT projects. However there is a need for fur- ther professionalisation, e.g. in connection with support of contract and supplier management  as well as in agile development projects.   An analysis of the overall government IT area, which will be completed in 2016, will identify  central government management of IT and IT costs. This will contribute to even more profes- sional management of government IT systems and projects  MUNICIPAL COLLABORATION ON EXPOSURE TO MARKET  MECHANISMS AND PROFESSIONAL SUPPLIER MANAGEMENT Through the joint municipal ordering organisation KOMBIT, local governments have exposed to  market mechanisms a number of crucial business systems over which the former municipal- ly-owned KMD had a monopoly. In the coming years, local governments will face a challeng- ing task in implementing new, modernised IT solutions. By joining forces under KOMBIT, local   governments can ensure a higher level of professionalisation with regard to specification,   tendering procedures, implementation and subsequent administration of large IT projects.  KOMBIT is also the hub of municipal knowledge, building on market dialogue, contract manage- ment and efficient operation of IT solutions.  MODEL FOR MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF COMMON REGIONAL  DIGITISATION PROJECTS  For a number of years, Danish regions have been focusing on digitisation and have made   Denmark one of the world leaders with regard to IT support for hospitals. IT projects throughout  the healthcare services are increasingly becoming more complex and this increases require- ments for competences and management in projects. The regions have therefore developed a  model for management and control of digitisation projects as a basis for the common regional  projects under RSI (regional healthcare ICT). This model is in line with similar models in cen- tral government and local governments, and thereby supports collaboration on common public   sector IT projects between regions, local governments and central government.  The use of digital technologies and soluti- ons is increasing exponentially in society as  a whole. Some individuals and businesses  have welcomed these developments and  can easily adjust to the changes. Others  have taken some time to adjust to new  ways of dealing with things, e.g. commu- nication with public authorities which has  gradually become more digital in recent  years.  As a society, we are obligated to continual- ly ensure that individuals are able to cope  securely and competently in a digital world,  and not least on the labour market, where  requirements for digital skills continue to  increase. This applies to adults as well as   new to generations growing up as digital  natives.   Competences for the digital generation Children's digital learning and education  begins as early as at preschool and conti- nues throughout the educational system.  Children and young people must therefore  be able to use digital technologies, tools  and platforms. They must possess know- ledge and skills to make qualified decisions  and to navigate safely and securely on the  internet. Children and young people of the  digital generation must have the digital  skills and culture to cope in a digital world  and to communicate digitally with authori- ties.  Focus area 9  Digitisation for everyone  WHAT ARE DIGITAL COMPETENCES AND DIGITAL CULTURE?  Digital competences and culture are generally important prerequisites for being able to cope in  an evermore digital society.   Digital competences include the ability to use digital solutions, tools and online platforms  to search, collect and analyse information and knowledge. This includes being able to use a  computer, tablet or smartphone to search information on the internet, use NemID, read Digital  Post, use online banking etc.  Public employees must be able to use technical tools in their work. For example, home carers  use PDAs (Personal Data Assistant devices) and primary school teachers use digital tools and  platforms when teaching.  Digital culture is about preparing children and young people to cope socially and ethically in a  digital world. Among other things, children and young people must obtain the necessary digital  competences to enable them to use IT as a working tool and to acquire knowledge and solve  problems. They must be aware of the possibilities and restrictions of the internet and know the  consequences of their digital footprints on the internet. They must generally be able to show  safe and responsible digital behaviour.    56 57SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES  Help is available  The Denmark of the future will embrace  those who are ready to digitise as well as  those who cannot use the digital channels  and solutions or who do not have access to  them. Individuals and businesses must have  adequate knowledge and the necessary  competences to communicate and interact  digitally with the authorities. Denmark has  unique collaboration between local govern- ments, regions, the central government, vol- untary organisations, and increasingly also  the business community. All these players  are strongly committed to improving the IT  competences of the population. This collab- oration will be continued and expanded.  Many citizens have needed, and still need,  help to become digital and to use digital  solutions. Therefore, it is still necessary  to help individuals who find it difficult to  use the new technology and communicate  digitally with the authorities, or who have   special needs for help. They should be giv- en the guidance and support they need. This  could be help to learn basic digital skills such  as using NemID and Digital Post. Others  only need help now and again, for example,  to carry out a transaction in a self-service  solution. Local governments will continue to  play an important role in this context.  There should, of course, be good access to  the public sector and help should be avail- able for individuals who cannot use digital  portals to the public sector. Such individuals  will still be able to contact and communi- cate with the public sector. This means that  they can continue to receive printed letters  and get help to deal with public authorities  by other means than digitally. Moreover,  businesses, which, in contrast to individuals,  cannot be exempted from digital commu- nication and are only rarely exempted from  Digital Post, will be offered help to use these  digital channels.  Security The public sector should be co-responsi- ble for improving information security in   Denmark and for helping individuals and  businesses to navigate securely in an   increasingly digital world. Individuals  in Denmark should have a high level of  knowledge about secure online behaviour.  Protecting business secrets etc. is a pri- mary consideration for businesses. Busi- nesses should be prepared to meet the  challenges of digital security in order to  reduce the risk of losing data due to cyber  attacks.  9.1    DIGITAL SKILLS FOR CHILDREN  AND YOUNG PEOPLE  From a young age, children and young people  must build digital competences and culture to  prepare them for the digital reality. Information  campaigns about competent and safe navigation  in the digital society will make children and young  people aware of their use of technology so they  can navigate safely online. Teaching programmes  and material for pupils in primary and lower se- condary school and in upper secondary education  will provide them with digital skills to interact di- gitally with society.  9.2    INFORMATION AND HELP FOR  CITIZENS AND BUSINESSES  Individuals and businesses who find it difficult to  use digital solutions and to communicate digital- ly with the authorities must be given the neces-  sary help and support. Initiatives aimed at spe- cial target groups will be launched on a regular  basis to ensure that as many people as possible  benefit from the digital opportunities. These in- clude young people, elderly people, people from  non-western countries and businesses that are  not quite ready for IT. The authorities will provide  clear and consistent information adapted to the  target group about the digital channels and por- tals to the public sector.   9.3    HIGH LEVEL OF AWARENESS OF  INFORMATION SECURITY  Technological and digital development impo- ses increasing requirements for the knowledge  and competences of individuals and businesses.   Therefore, ongoing information campaigns and  initiatives about good digital behaviour will be lau- nched during the strategy period. The campaign  and initiatives will generate knowledge about  threats and prepare individuals and businesses for  exploiting digital possibilities safely and securely.  DIGITISATION FOR EVERYONE  INITIATIVES    58 SECURITY AND CONFIDENCE MUST BE IN FOCUS AT ALL TIMES 59  ACCESSIBILITY IN IT SOLUTIONS  As more things can be carried out digitally, citizens are given new possibilities to gain easy and  quick access to the public sector. This also applies to individuals with special challenges, e.g.  disabilities. Their special needs should be taken into consideration as much as possible when  developing digital solutions for the public sector. During 2016, a proposal for an EU directive on  accessibility to public sector websites is expected to be implemented in Danish legislation. The  directive is to ensure that public sector websites are developed such that as many people as  possible can access the information on the websites and use self-service solutions.  It is important that authorities as well as suppliers incorporate technical accessibility as an in- tegral part of digital solutions made available by the public sector. This applies to public sector  websites and the digital self-service solutions, but also when developing infrastructure compo- nents such as NemID, Digital Post, etc. Public authorities must listen to input from stakeholder  organisations, such as the Disabled Peoples Organisations Denmark, which can identify special  needs for adjusting and making available solutions, for example certain types of letters in Digital  Post.  Where possible, public authorities will incorporate technical accessibility when deploying digital  solutions in the individual sectors. For example, this could be in connection with digital welfare  services in the healthcare and care sectors or the education area. For example, institutions,  schools and local governments procuring digital teaching tools and materials may impose   requirements for accessibility to the suppliers of the teaching materials.

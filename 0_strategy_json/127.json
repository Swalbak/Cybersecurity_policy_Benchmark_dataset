Joint Doctrine Note (JDN) 1/18, Cyber and Electromagnetic Activities attempts to capture the widest concept of cyber and electromagnetic activities (CEMA) and draws together elements of existing doctrine and best practice. However, the principles and concepts expressed are not yet wholly agreed. This JDN sets a baseline for CEMA within UK Defence, Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and other partners across government (PAG). It provides a working description of the CEMA environment and will enable the single Services to develop a tailored CEMA concept whilst remaining aligned with Joint Forces Command (JFC) and GCHQ intent. Context 2. To succeed against complex and diverse threats that exploit the pervasive information environment we need to do things differently. At the heart of this concept is the enhancement of joint action and, therefore, our influence by contesting the information environment, being more integrated as a force and more adaptable to changing circumstances. Conventional and non-conventional adversaries may be state or non-state; and may employ mission-tailored, decentralised, asymmetric and agile actors. Therefore, it is important that we have doctrine that examines how we adapt operations to the changing environment rather than trying to control it. This is the context within which Defence must undertake CEMA. 3. JDN 1/18, aims to clarify the nature of CEMA and offers guidance on how to enable, realise, employ and exploit it. It considers how CEMA supports understanding, offensive and defensive actions and how it enables commanders and staff to make effective decisions and create effects within the full spectrum approach. Audience 4. This publication is aimed at military commanders and staff (J1-J9) at Permanent Joint Headquarters and at higher tactical levels. It should also JDN 1/18 iv inform staff and planners working with PAGs who may provide critical CEMA interdependencies. Finally, this JDN should further inform military and civilian staff developing related doctrine, conducting force generation and procuring future capability. Structure 5. JDN 1/18 is divided into four chapters. a. Chapter 1 explains the need for CEMA. b. Chapter 2 explores the scope of CEMA and defines the concept. c. Chapter 3 describes CEMA development and functional relationships. d. Chapter 4 explains how we plan and conduct CEMA. Linkages 6.

The outcome of future operations will be decided by the protagonist who does this to decisive advantage. Chief of the Defence Staff Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach “ ” The need for cyber and electromagnetic activities JDN 1/18 3 1 Chapter 1 – The need for cyber and electromagnetic activities 1.1. Cyber and electromagnetic activities (CEMA) are interdependent and within the electromagnetic environment (EME). The EME will be contested by actors using both cyber and electromagnetic activity to achieve operational advantage. Digitisation has led to the convergence of cyber and information activities to such an extent that CEMA coordination across the joint force will be imperative for operational success. Freedom to flexibly use or to deny, degrade or constrain adversary access to the EME and parts of cyberspace will offer significant operational advantage. 1.2. CEMA must address the longstanding challenges of acquiring, using and integrating information with physical actions to create the desired effect. In addition, information and the systems which create, collect, manage and exploit this information, are critical to successful conflict outcomes. The need for CEMA coordination, coherent with a full spectrum approach and mission assurance, has escalated in recent years because of the sheer volume of information, the ease of access to it and the increasing means by which it can be exploited.1 1 The Cyber and Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA) Vision was devised by the CEMA Capability Integration Group (CIG). Section 1 – Introduction The CEMA Vision is: ‘The synchronisation and coordination of cyber and electromagnetic activities, delivering operational advantage thereby enabling freedom of movement, and effects, whilst simultaneously, denying and degrading adversaries’ use of the electromagnetic environment and cyberspace.’1 The need for cyber and electromagnetic activities 4 JDN 1/18 1 1.3. There is also the challenge of achieving interoperability and sustaining knowledge parity while conducting joint and coalition operations. While many of these challenges will also be faced by our adversaries, low entry costs and the rapid adoption of cutting edge technology means they may be equally, or better, placed to use information as a force multiplier. However, our challenge is to operate within the constraints of UK and Allied, policy, doctrine and law, whilst our adversaries have no need to and indeed gain an edge in not doing so. 1.4. Russian operations in south-eastern and eastern Europe highlighted the effectiveness of synchronising CEMA with conventional operational activities to shape both the adversary’s and international perception.2 However, within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and specifically UK doctrine, force and capability development have not kept pace. Joint Concept Note (JCN) 1/17, Future Force Concept identified the need for CEMA while this joint doctrine note (JDN) provides clarification by exploring how the CEMA concept is implemented so it can be undertaken with decisive advantage. 1.5. There are areas where cyber activities and electromagnetic activities overlap and these need to be defined. The nature of CEMA is such that it should be coordinated and may be synchronised across any, or all, activities. To deliver operational advantage, a deployable headquarters will need to synchronise as well as coordinate electronic warfare, spectrum management, signals intelligence3 and cyber operational activities with CEMA-enabling activities and other non-CEMA operational activity. The list below indicates some of the areas to be considered by a CEMA synchronisation and coordinating authority. This list is not exhaustive and issues of mission assurance should be considered. 2 This joint doctrine note (JDN) will look at Russian use of both cyber activities and electromagnetic activities and how they have developed, drawing parallels with UK CEMA aspirations and developments. Chapter 1 looks at the problems Russia encountered during operations in Georgia. Chapter 3 points to the successes on operations in Ukraine, while Chapter 4 looks at how the Russian military has evolved and focused on coordinated and synchronised actions to achieve the commander’s intent. 3 Signals intelligence incorporates electronic intelligence and communications intelligence. The need for cyber and electromagnetic activities JDN 1/18 5 1 a. Assure CEMA capability coherence across Defence and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) for both new and existing capabilities. b. Inform and shape CEMA capability across Defence lines of development ensuring coherence across Service Commands, Defence Equipment and Support, Information Systems and Services and Defence Science and Technology Laboratory. c. Influence the production of CEMA policy and doctrine. d. Ensure key CEMA component and Service Command personnel receive core training at tactical, operational and strategic levels. e. Enable electromagnetic activities (EMA) and cyber activities to be developed coherently under the CEMA strategy.4 f. Establish relationships with Defence industrial partners for supply chain issues and vulnerabilities. 1.6. As cyber and EMA functions mature, CEMA will change. However, consideration must be given to how cyber and EMA capabilities under development can be synchronised and coordinated into the full spectrum approach. A CEMA policy, planned for 2018, will develop the links between cyber and EMA. 4 The Joint Force Cyber Group and British Army, as well as the United States of America Cyber Command, work to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework which provides a useful common language and description of functions (identify, protect, detect, respond, recover and their sub-categories). The CEMA strategy covers the period from 2017 to 2025 through three phases: phase 1 – definition and refinement (2017-2020); phase 2 – implementation (2020-2025); and phase 3 – business as usual (2025 onwards). The need for cyber and electromagnetic activities 6 JDN 1/18 1 1.7. Technology will remain an essential element of future conflict and a driver of military change over the next 20 years. Maintaining a technological advantage across key capability areas has, for many years, enabled us to succeed with relatively small, professional Armed Forces. But these key capability areas were never integrated, leading to ‘stove-piped’ capability/force development where interoperability was coincidental rather than planned. However, with the convergence of computing and telecommunications and the pace of technology, the military is now trying to rebalance its understanding of the environments to encompass electromagnetic, cyber and information aspects. 1.8. The rapid growth in non-kinetic activity challenges traditional notions of hostile action and accountability within international law. Cyber operations synchronised with electronic warfare in the context of a full spectrum approach may overmatch conventional forces that are not prepared for conflicts in the electromagnetic environment and cyberspace simultaneously. The situation now exists whereby technological advantage is being eroded by non-conventional warfare using electromagnetic and cyber activities. This has led to the United States of America (US) creating their 3rd Offset Strategy, introduced in Chapter 3. Section 2 – Background Non-conventional warfare using electromagnetic and cyberspace may overmatch unprepared conventional forces The need for cyber and electromagnetic activities JDN 1/18 7 1 Weaknesses identified in the Georgian Operation (from a Russian perspective) In August and September 2008, Russia conducted a multi-pronged operation against Georgia in support of the Russian-backed, self-proclaimed republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.5 While this operation was successful, it did highlight several weaknesses in Russian surveillance and communications capability between single Services, weaknesses that Russia has sought to address. While the use of superior numbers of conventional ground forces and artillery was successful, other softer activities requiring modern equipment operated by agile joint forces proved less so. a. The inability to counter the Georgian air defence capabilities led to limited fixed-wing air operations and almost no rotary wing air operations. Air superiority was only achieved once ground forces had neutralised Georgian air defences. b. Russian military communications had little integration between different radio systems. c. Russia had, until this time, limited their use of unmanned aircraft systems; this combined with electronic warfare weaknesses left a gap in intelligence provision. Few Russian sources directly acknowledged these weaknesses, but following the Georgian operation, the Russian military took steps to address both cyber and electronic warfare capability development.6 sds5 6 5 More infromation is available at English/MilitaryReview_20091231_art009.pdf 6 More information is available at The need for cyber and electromagnetic activities 8 JDN 1/18 1 Section 3 – Parity and pacing 1.9. Following Russian operations in eastern Europe and the Middle East; and China’s military activities worldwide, much has been discussed about regaining the initiative. Although NATO has been confident of its superiority there are areas where other nations have actually become peers, for example, where Russia and China have achieved this in relation to EMA, cyber and information activities. As a minimum they need only keep pace with NATO to maintain parity but could well be overmatching our capability.7 With the rapid acceleration of CEMA technology and capability, NATO’s lack of priority to produce up-to-date joint doctrine and policy has exacerbated the situation.8 1.10. Russia’s Chief of Electronic Warfare Troops, General-Major Yuriy Lastochkin provides an example of how Russia is maintaining parity and moving towards overmatching our capabilities in an interview in April 2017. He said:9 7 For example, the impact of the WannaCry ransomware attack on the NHS in May 2017, or the December 2015 Ukraine power grid cyberattack. 8 Whilst no US joint doctrine exists, the US Army discussed CEMA in Army Field Manual (FM) 3-38, Cyber Electromagnetic Activities, however, that publication was not updated rather it was retired and replaced with FM 3-12, Cyberspace and Electronic Warfare Operations which describes CEMA as ‘the planning, integrating and synchronising activity for echelon corps and below’. 9 More information is available at warfare-chief-interviewed-2/ “The entire system of measures of organizational development of Electronic Warfare Troops will substantially increase their contribution to winning superiority in command and control, and in employing weapons. The volume of effectively fulfilled missions in various strategic directions will grow by two to two and a half times and by 2020 will reach 85 percent. This in turn will become the basis of an effective air-ground electronic warfare system, capable of neutralizing the enemy’s technological advantage in the aerospace sphere and the information-telecommunications space.”9 The need for cyber and electromagnetic activities JDN 1/18 9 1 1.11. As the world becomes ever more connected this leads to resource contention across electromagnetic spectrum frequency bands. Government and military activities in the electromagnetic environment and cyberspace must consider non-combatant use and ensure, where possible, that operations do not adversely affect access to this global common.10 10 Future Operating Environment 2035, page 21. Key points • Low entry costs and the rapid adoption of cutting edge technology means our adversaries may be equally, or better placed to use information as a force multiplier. • Challenges exist between using and integrating information while conducting joint and coalition operations. • Cyber and electromagnetic activities (CEMA) is not the change or development agent for electromagnetic activities (EMA), nor cyber maturation; it is based on synchronising and coordinating these activities. • CEMA needs policy and doctrine to ensure it is coherently undertaken across Defence, the Government Communications Headquarters and partners across government. • It is important to learn lessons from past operations, such as events in Georgia, about the need to synchronise and coordinate cyber and electromagnetic activities. • The electromagnetic environment and cyberspace are a congested resource and operations need to consider other users, both friendly and adversarial. The need for cyber and electromagnetic activities 11JDN 1/18 Scope and definition Chapter 2 offers a definition of cyber and electromagnetic activities (CEMA) as well as scoping its application. It explains that CEMA provides a synchronisation and coordination function for these activities.

Alan Turing “ ” Scope and definition JDN 1/18 13 2 Chapter 2 – Scope and definition Section 1 – The Defence approach 2.1. The Joint Forces Command Command Plan 2016/17 sought to establish a Joint Cyber and Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA) Group to coordinate the tasking, planning and execution of Defence CEMA and produce a strategy to optimise the application of cyber and electromagnetic capabilities. The approach to its implementation should be driven by the CEMA Vision and Strategy.11 The CEMA vision will be delivered by the Ministry of Defence and partners across government. This will ensure a coherent approach for military and CEMA partners, limiting the adversary and enhancing UK Armed Forces’ freedom of manoeuvre, freedom of action, information advantage, decision superiority, and delivering operational advantage.12 These, in, turn need adequate resources, including manpower empowered to make decisions and implement change across the necessary elements of Defence. 2.2. CEMA is not the only available function to create the commander’s desired effect and must be considered as part of full spectrum effects and full spectrum targeting.13 Where CEMA is identified as appropriate then the discussions that follow inform the synchronisation and coordination of these activities and their contribution to the desired effect. 2.3. CEMA is defined as: the synchronisation and coordination of offensive, defensive, inform and enabling activities, across the electromagnetic environment and cyberspace.14 The definition broadly identifies four activities, which are conducted in the electromagnetic environment (EME), cyberspace, or a combination of both. Figure 2.1 expands on the definition with examples of these activities. 11 The strategy was devised by the Cyber and Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA) Capability Integration Group (CIG) to determine the approach for implementing CEMA. The strategy sets out a three phase, eight year programme. At the time of publishing this joint doctrine note the strategy is awaiting endorsement. 12 The CEMA Vision is at Chapter 1, paragraph 1.1. It was endorsed by the CEMA CIG in March 2017. 13 Joint Service Publication (JSP) 900, UK Targeting Policy. 14 This is a CEMA CIG working group endorsed definition. Scope and definition 14 JDN 1/18 14 2 2.4. Defensive, offensive and inform activities are underpinned by enabling activities which provide the necessary operational analysis, resources and infrastructure. While many enabling activities do not contribute directly to the military operation, a failure to conduct them will lead to less effective offensive, defensive and inform activities and ultimately pose a risk to operational success.

CEMA should be coordinated and may be synchronised across any, or all, activities. Although the intent within CEMA is to synchronise offensive, defensive and inform activities, that may not be practical against the whole range of joint force activities. 2.6. CEMA comprises cyber activities and electromagnetic activities (EMA) however, there are no approved definitions for either cyber activities or EMA. Identifying these two groups of activities would help in the understanding of the CEMA scope. The proposed definition of electromagnetic activities is: all offensive, defensive and inform activities that shape or exploit the electromagnetic environment and the enabling activities that support them.15 2.7. Cyber activities have not been defined. However, equivalents can be found in the four cyber operations’ roles:16 • offensive cyber operations (OCO); • defensive cyber operations (DCO) (including active defence); • cyber intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (cyber ISR); and • cyber operational preparation of the environment (cyber OPE). 2.8. CEMA will also coordinate with organisations and actors conducting non-CEMA activities where required. For example, CEMA is an enabler for psychological operations that are considered to be part of information operations. Figure 2.2 illustrates this relationship with some examples (not all) of non-CEMA activities.17 15 This definition was proposed and endorsed by the CEMA CIG on behalf of the Head Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance and Cyber joint user. 16 Cyber Primer, 2nd Edition, page 51. 17 Joint Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (JTTP) 3-70;1, Joint Tactics, Techniques and Procedures for Battlespace Management, Version 2, paragraph 23.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) states that operational EMA should comprise of electromagnetic operations (EMO), which are defined as: all operations that shape or exploit the electromagnetic environment, or use it for attack or defence including the use of the electromagnetic environment to support operations in all other operational environments.18 This definition does not include all enabling activities and therefore EMO must not be considered interchangeable with EMA. 2.10. There are several command considerations applicable across the entirety of CEMA. Coordination is the activity CEMA actors undertake, whereas operational imperative, agility, execution, redundancy and resilience are the ethos which guide them. a. Operational imperative.  This is the key principle upon which all others depend. As CEMA activities are not yet sufficiently established, all actors must be informed of, understand and be focused on delivering the commander’s intent. b. Agility.  Both cyberspace and the EME are being contested by the adversary. Therefore the ability to flex resource, effort and processes as required is critical. c. Coordination.  This must be conducted at the highest level and filter down to all force elements and coalition partners. d. Execution.  CEMA will be integrated with the wider military under the full spectrum approach. This means CEMA battlespace execution is likely to require a command and control approach emphasising centralised control but decentralised execution, where execution authority is delegated to the point of best understanding for decision-making. 18 NATOTerm. Section 3 – Command considerations Scope and definition 18 JDN 1/18 18 2 e. Redundancy.  As cyberspace and the EME are being contested by the adversary, planning for redundancy and reversionary practices should be undertaken and exercised. f. Resilience.  Resilience is the ability of the community, services or infrastructure to withstand the consequences of an incident.19 This is related to both execution and redundancy. 19 Joint Doctrine Publication (JDP) 02, Operations in the UK: The Defence Contribution to Resilience, 2nd Edition. Key points • Cyber and electromagnetic activities (CEMA) is defined as: the synchronisation and coordination of offensive, defensive, inform and enabling activities, across the electromagnetic environment and cyberspace. • Enabling activities provide the necessary operational analysis, resources and infrastructure. • Synchronisation and coordination of CEMA contributes to the commander’s intent. • CEMA will also coordinate with organisations and actors conducting non-CEMA activities where required. • Electromagnetic operations are not the same as electromagnetic activities. • A commander should consider the application of operational imperative, agility, coordination, execution, redundancy and resilience across CEMA.

Joint Concept Note 1/17, Future Force Concept “ ” Development and functional relationship JDN 1/18 23 3 Chapter 3 – Development and functional relationships Section 1 – Development approach 3.1. The relationships between cyber activities and electromagnetic activities are still maturing making a single approach to cyber and electromagnetic activities (CEMA) challenging. Therefore our adoption and implementation of the CEMA concept and its integration into the full spectrum approach will benefit from an incremental development approach. Individual needs, for the single Services, may need to be tailored. 3.2. A development maturity progression framework that outlines levels of synchronicity is shown in this chapter. Progression towards each of these representative maturity levels is implemented in various ways. However, all maturity levels will need to consider Defence lines of development for each step and how these levels align with the future force concept. a. Level 1: initial step.  The initial step is the most difficult to address as funding and resources will already be allocated across the current force.20 This step, demonstrated in Figure 3.1, will be set in the context of austerity and have to overcome extant doctrine, policy and 20 The current force is identified in Joint Concept Note (JCN) 1/17, Future Force Concept. At the tactical level, a planned operation requires phone use to be blocked in the operations area. This is achieved by an electronic warfare operation jamming the broadcast tower. Due to insufficient synchronisation and coordination, it was not appreciated that jamming the tower also stopped an ongoing strategic cyber operation being conducted by partners across government. Development and functional relationships 24 JDN 1/18 24 3 entrenched ways of working. The ability to point to early realisation of benefit will engender confidence in the concept. b. Level 2: evolving step.  This step provides a substantial degree of synchronisation and coordination without re-designing cyber and electromagnetic force structures, funding lines and legal frameworks.

Level 3: integrated step.  Options will be examined in future concept studies such as Joint Concept Note (JCN) 1/17, Future Force Concept. Figure 3.3 and Figure 3.4 will involve looking ten or more years into the future and this may require a reactive and agile approach due to rapid developments in technology. d. Level 4: ubiquitious step.  Figure 3.4 recognises that there may be elements of cyber and electromagnetic activities (EMA) never fully integrated into CEMA. An example of this may be down to security issues, but these boundaries will become less defined over time. Development and functional relationships 26 JDN 1/18 26 3 mcdc22 23 22 More information is available at a-new-offset-strategy-exploiting-u-s-long-term-advantages-to-restore 23 Non-linear war or hybrid war is a military strategy that blends conventional warfare, irregular warfare and cyber warfare. By combining kinetic operations with subversive efforts, the aggressor intends to avoid attribution or retribution. More information is available at doctrine-and-russian-non-linear-war/ The United States 3rd Offset Strategy22 and Russian non-linear war23 With the resurgence in Russian military effectiveness, the United States of America (US) has had to once again examine how it might ‘offset’ the asymmetrical aspects of adversaries’ development. For the 3rd Offset Strategy the Department of Defense took a more holistic approach asking ‘who are our pacing competitors, what are they doing, how can they affect the US and how can we counter the effects?’ Once understood, force development and capability development can focus on the problem. Currently, the US Department of Defense’s five key technology areas for exploitation are: • autonomous learning systems; • human-machine collaboration; • assisted human operations through technology; • advanced human-machine combat teaming; and • network-enabled autonomous weapons and high-speed weapons. Notably, all of these use the electromagnetic spectrum and cyberspace and therefore open up novel attack vectors and present novel vulnerabilities. Interestingly, the Russian non-linear war seeks to exploit and protect similar attack vectors and vulnerabilities, leaving the West to determine whether it is once again in an arms race. Development and functional relationship JDN 1/18 27 3 3.3. The roles and responsibilities addressed in this joint doctrine note (JDN) already exist with none disappearing or being created. This JDN aims to identify the CEMA-related synchronisation and coordination activities that need developing within each role and/or function with these roles evolving over time. Understanding these changes, how that role performs its CEMA duties, or when and where, is not within this JDN. A joint doctrine publication (JDP) will be developed to address these issues. 3.4. CEMA development must be driven and supported by Defence and partners across government, based on the vision and strategy.24 Implementation should be within the joint user community. Force development and generation functions are listed below. a. Force development.  CEMA is not a ‘Genesis Option’, as described by Finance and Military Capability – there is no extra funded manpower to support it.25 CEMA should be considered by the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) branch of Joint Forces Command (JFC) Capability Directorate during force testing, exploration and design rather than separately as cyber and EMA activities to identify efficiency gains that enable CEMA’s introduction. b. Force generation.  Development should be driven by a Defence-wide need rather than by the single Services. Developing doctrine and policy needs to be underpinned by a corporate programme from which all other specialist training should evolve. Examples of this generation are listed below. 24 The Cyber and Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA) vision is at Chapter 1, paragraph 1.1. The strategy was endorsed by the CEMA Capability Integration Group (CIG) to determine the approach to implement CEMA. It sets out a three phase, eight year programme. It is expected to be endorsed in 2018. 25 The Finance and Military Capability Operating Model explains force development and force generation in more detail and outlines capability development.

Whole Force management.  Whole Force by Design26 refreshes the Whole Force concept and must guide Whole Force management. The Whole Force must comprise generalists and specialists and take into consideration their development and collaboration requirements. These specialists may come from partners across government. Stove-piping branch and trades should be avoided to allow the successful implementation of the CEMA concept. ii. General education.  Education must focus on how our operations leverage CEMA and essential operations security practices.27 We must provide continuous and developing education opportunities for all personnel to ensure that CEMA is understood and in line with techological advances. iii. CEMA training.  Where possible training should be developed and delivered across the Whole Force rather than single Services or branches. Specialist training should be balanced against current needs and needs identified during force development. Aspects of CEMA training will be mandated by partners across government.28 iv. Exercises.  CEMA serials must be woven into the normal training programme and not seen as an add on. Exercises must be realistic and robustly test our Armed Forces’ defensive and offensive capabilities. We must capably deal with degraded and denied cyberspace and electromagnetic environment (EME) operations, adapting quickly to reversionary war modes. Realistic training must include security against third parties collecting cyber or EME data on our forces and the challenges of electronic warfare or offensive cyber systems degrading civil systems. This will act as a driver for synthetic cyber and EME training systems.29 26 Whole Force by Design was conceived with National Security Council Review outcomes in mind, particularly Joint Force 2025 in accordance with the principle of achieving the most cost effective balance between regular and reserve forces, Ministry of Defence civilians and contractors. 27 JCN 1/17, page 22. 28 Ibid. 29 Ibid. Development and functional relationship JDN 1/18 29 3 v. Expeditionary forces.  Expeditionary force design should take account of CEMA from inception.30 The practice of retro-fitting CEMA force elements into a conventional force may lead to under-resourcing, unclear or complex chains of command and poor integration into a full spectrum approach. vi. Lead user.  While the role of lead user for tactical CEMA capabilities can be placed within a single Service, the default for the lead user role is the C4ISR joint user in JFC. This may be the case even if the capability is operated by a single Service. vii. Joint user.  This role should always stay with the C4ISR joint user in JFC. As CEMA is focused on synchronisation, coordination and the contribution to the full spectrum approach, the C4ISR joint user will have the remit to look across Defence. viii. Lead delivery agent.  This may sit with either Defence Equipment and Support (DE&S) or Information Systems and 30 This is to include planning staff. CEMA serials need to become a part of regular training programmes Development and functional relationships 30 JDN 1/18 30 3 Services and will depend on the balance of equipment or service to be provided. 3.5. The single Services have historically conducted EMA independently, even when operating as part of a joint force. Recent UK operations have focused EMA on tactical electronic defence, particularly on counterinsurgency and stabilisation operations.31 However, our adversaries have also been developing wide-ranging EMA capabilities and employing them operationally. 3.6. Recent efforts have concentrated on developing cyber forces and capability, and while significant progress has been made, development is often conducted along single-Service lines, with the exception of offensive cyber. This is not a problem confined solely to the UK. Few North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members have developed a coherent and comprehensive cyber approach and NATO has yet to incorporate ‘cyber’ into its definitions and terms. While achieving consensus on the concept of CEMA is difficult, a debate may start with the examination of the sub functions of core CEMA and how their scope interacts with each other; these being EMA and cyber activities, and their collective management. 3.7. Electromagnetic activities.  Operationally there are four EMA that are key elements: electronic warfare; signals intelligence; spectrum management; and communications. These functions are integral parts and interlinked in our operations. a. Electronic warfare.  This is defined as: military action that exploits electromagnetic energy to provide situational awareness and achieve offensive and defensive effects.32 It is made up of four elements. 31 Tactical operational activities in Iraq and Afghanistan have been supported by a wide variety of electronic countermeasures (ECM). A key function has been the jamming, deception and neutralisation of remote-controlled improvised explosive devices. ECM is a form of active electronic defence. 32 NATOTerm. Section 3 – Evolving functions Development and functional relationship JDN 1/18 31 3 i. Electronic surveillance.  This is defined as the: use of electromagnetic energy to provide situational awareness and intelligence.33 When developing CEMA, regard must be paid to the overlap between electronic surveillance and cyber intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (cyber ISR). ii. Electronic defence.  This is defined as the: use of electromagnetic energy to provide protection and ensure effective friendly use of the electromagnetic spectrum.34 iii. Electronic attack.  This is defined as the: use of electromagnetic energy for offensive purposes.35 This is employed to diminish an adversary’s ability to understand, shape or exploit the operational environment and its use should be integrated into the full spectrum affect under CEMA. iv. Electronic warfare management.  This is the capability to coordinate and deconflict electronic warfare activities and, as such, is fundamental to coordinating CEMA. b. Signals intelligence.  This is defined as: intelligence derived from electromagnetic signals or emissions.36 In some instances this intelligence may be collected by either electronic surveillance or cyber ISR, coordination is required to optimise activities. c. Spectrum management.  This is defined as: planning, coordinating, and managing use of the electromagnetic spectrum through operational, engineering, and administrative procedures with the objective of enabling military electronic systems to perform their functions within intended environments without causing or suffering harmful interference.37 Spectrum management is a crucial CEMA-enabling activity that persists from capability development, acquisition and use, through to disposal. During military operations, 33 Ibid. 34 Ibid. 35 Ibid. 36 Ibid. 37 Spectrum management is defined in Allied Communications Publication (ACP) 190(C), Guide to Spectrum Management in Military Operations. Development and functional relationships 32 JDN 1/18 32 3 CEMA provides a coordinating function through battlespace spectrum management (BSM) to enable effective use of the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS). The end-state is to enable the commander freedom of movement in the EME. d. Communications.  Increasingly, military communications (both human and machine) face external demands for EMS to be released for commercial use. Technological advances have led to an increase in spectrum-dependent systems for gathering and transferring information with force elements increasingly reliant on detailed, immersive graphics and videos, all of which need high-bandwidth communication channels. Communications needs to be coordinated with other EMS users, through CEMA, to gain spectrum understanding and to meet operational needs while ensuring that users in the UK or host nation are not adversely affected. 3.8. Cyber activities.  Cyber operations are described as the planning and synchronisation of activities in, and through, cyberspace to enable freedom of manoeuvre and to achieve military objectives.38 With the growth of mobile and wireless connectivity it is increasingly important to consider EMA when conducting these operations. Cyber operations are categorised into four distinct roles.39 a. Offensive cyber operations.  These are defined as: activities that project power to achieve military objectives in, or through, cyberspace. b. Defensive cyber operations.  These are defined as: active and passive measures to preserve the ability to use cyberspace. c. Cyber intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.  This is defined as: intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance activities in, and through, friendly, neutral and adversary cyberspace to build understanding. 38 Cyber Primer, 2nd Edition. 39 Ibid. Development and functional relationship JDN 1/18 33 3 d. Cyber operational preparation of the environment.  This is defined as: all activities conducted to prepare, and enable, cyber intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, defensive and offensive operations. Cyber operations enable freedom of manoeuvre and the achievement of military objectives Development and functional relationships 34 JDN 1/18 34 3 3.9. Organisations and structures that define information operations, cyber operations and electronic warfare have evolved to fit a changing technological world. These actions and operations use cyberspace and the EME to operate across the five domains and co-exist in CEMA littoral areas.40 3.10. The mainstay of CEMA is the synchronisation and coordination of, and with, activities both internal and external to CEMA.41 CEMA depends on technical and procedural interoperability using standardised interfaces, protocols and approaches. This ensures information exchange across joint forces, coalition, government and industry partners, which in turn improves integration and fosters adaptability. 3.11. Cyber and signals intelligence.  Cyber operations and signals intelligence (SIGINT) are predominately reliant on the same infrastructure, organisations, access to personnel training and skill-sets. However, they must also be seen as complementary, and not competing capabilities. The key difference between cyber and SIGINT is the intent and effect of the two. 3.12. Information bearer.  The EMS can be used indirectly as a bearer of information, or directly as a means of creating an effect. As a bearer of information, be that voice communications or digital-based information systems, this is an example of where EMA and cyber share a littoral. Responsibilities within this function include security and resilience and this is where the overlap with cyber is greatest. Defensive cyber operations are an integral and non-discretionary component of network operations and security resilience. 3.13. Coordination and synchronisation of activities external to CEMA.  Information operations and activities are not included within CEMA but elements are closely associated with the CEMA cyber capability. There is a large amount of overlap with the key distinguishing feature between the 40 JCN 1/17, Future Force Concept, paragraph 3.1 lists the domains as air, land, maritime, space and cyber. 41 This is illustrated in Figures 2.1 and 2.2 in Chapter 2. Section 4 – Development summary Development and functional relationship JDN 1/18 35 3 two areas being the scope of the operating environment. Whilst cyber operations take place in, and through, cyberspace, information operations can also use other means. 3.14. Centralised control, decentralised execution.  CEMA battlespace execution will require a command and control approach that emphasises centralised control but decentralised execution. As well as integrating our own offensive actions, we must be able to mitigate the threat from adversaries’ cyber or electromagnetic weapons while preventing negative impact to, and from, friendly or neutral systems. 3.15. Development challenges for Defence.  The CEMA evolution required by Defence roles and responsibilities presents a change which needs support through all Defence lines of development. It also requires each of us to change, cognitively and behaviourly, so that CEMA becomes routine. This cannot be achieved wholly through training but comes from embracing change. It should be noted that human factors present the biggest impact to CEMA in terms of enabling or threatening its success. 3.16. Training and education.  To prevent CEMA remaining the preserve of technically capable and interested individuals a programme of training and education is key to the successful integration of CEMA if it is to be ingrained in routine.42 42 The 1* CEMA Training Group is co-chaired by the Head Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance and Cyber Joint User and the Commander Joint CEMA Group. Training and education are key to ingraining CEMA Development and functional relationships 36 JDN 1/18 36 3 asas 43s 43 Based on Internet research pieced together for this joint doctrine note, an example of which is available at Addressing the weaknesses43 During the 2008 Georgian operation the Russian military identified several capability and organisational weaknesses and sought to address the causes. Although their response was not the same as this doctrine note discusses, it reflects their investment in the same operational arena. In a similar vein, the Russian military has supported a drive for a more ‘joint’ approach across the formerly stovepiped single Services. In addition, they have invested in specialist units notably across cyber, electronic warfare and strategic military communications. All of this is underpinned by a series of strategic and operational command and control programmes such as the National Defence Control Center. This, combined with a plan to replace 70% of old equipment by 2020, means that Russian electronic warfare capabilities will approach, or exceed, those of many North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members well before that date. In many ways, this, like the changes in capability development and acquisition, parallel those changes undertaken by NATO members, most notably the United States of America. Development and functional relationship JDN 1/18 37 3 Key points • Both the cyber and the electromagnetic activities concepts are still maturing; so the adoption and implementation of the cyber and electromagnetic activities (CEMA) concept will benefit from an incremental development approach. • A four level CEMA development approach is proposed. • CEMA roles and responsibilities will evolve, driven by Defence, based on the CEMA vision and strategy. • Realistic training must include security against third parties collecting cyber or electromagnetic environment data on our forces and the challenges of electronic warfare or offensive cyber systems degrading civil systems. • CEMA battlespace execution will require a command and control approach emphasising centralised control, but decentralised execution. • Human factors present the biggest impact to CEMA in terms of enabling or threatening the success of its use. Therefore implementing CEMA successfully relies on embracing cognitive and behavioural change to make CEMA an automatic action, not an additional task.

A cyber and electromagnetic activities (CEMA) synchronisation and coordination group is needed to implement the national direction. This group will ensure all strategic and operational effect is mapped against higher intent. Figure 4.1 outlines a suggested functional organisation. The structure that the CEMA synchronisation and coordination group sits within is illustrative and will need to be endorsed.

The planning and conduct of CEMA needs to be considered within strategic- and operational-level planning frameworks at a joint level. During the options development process, liaison and coordination between planning staff responsible for CEMA is paramount. This coordination will assess how these capabilities can be best used against the developing options or courses of action within legal boundaries or other restrictions. Force generation activities involving CEMA planning staffs are used to advise the commander on the CEMA component of the Whole Force, especially where deployed personnel numbers are fixed and where CEMA may be conducted with reachback to non-deployed CEMA specialists. 4.3. The synchronisation and coordination of CEMA within a joint force headquarters (JFHQ) can be conducted by the electromagnetic battlestaff (EMB) with cyber representation. The EMB structure uses and builds on the existing Electronic Warfare Coordination Cell (EWCC).44 It is the role of the EMB to coordinate and monitor all aspects of electromagnetic activities within the electromagnetic environment on behalf of the Joint Forces Command (JFC) directorate staff.45 4.4. Joint Concept Note (JCN) 1/17, Future Force Concept, states that ‘Influence will only be achieved with a clear focus on audiences and effects, and by integrating and synchronising kinetic and non-kinetic activities conducted across the physical and virtual domains to try to achieve those 44 The Electronic Warfare Coordination Cell (EWCC) may comprise a liaison officer with reachback to supporting national bodies, or a staff of between three to as many as 12 or more, as necessary for a specific operation. Training is an essential element to EWCC where there is a need for highly skilled staff to carry out its activities. It is fundamental that in undertaking CEMA, extant functions such as EWCC are included. See Allied Joint Publication (AJP)-3.6, Allied Joint Doctrine for Electronic Warfare, Edition B, paragraphs 0205 and 0207 for more details. 45 Allied Joint Publication (AJP)-3.6 explains that electromagnetic battlestaff (EMB) would include members from the Joint Forces Headquarters (JFHQ) J3 (Operations), J5 (Planning), J2 (Knowledge) and J6 (Communications and information support) staff. The director of the EMB will be designated by J3. Note AJP-3.6, Edition C, was being drafted at the time of publishing. Section 2 – Synchronising and coordinating Planning and conducting 4 JDN 1/18 43 effects.’46 CEMA must be considered an integral part of joint action47 and fully integrated alongside non-CEMA, sequencing and combining actions through the full spectrum approach to achieve the desired influence. Figure 4.2 provides an example of how CEMA may contribute to joint actions. 4.5. Under the full spectrum approach, and enabled by interoperable command and control systems, CEMA actions may be planned and conducted collaboratively. This can be carried out in a number of ways. a. Action options against a single effect.  Rather than simply considering a kinetic action to create a desired effect, commanders should consider other effects, with CEMA providing these options. For example, if the target was in a non-combatant urban area an electronic attack or offensive cyber operations (OCO) may be more appropriate, according to the targeting policy. b. Sequence of actions.  Where a commander may put into operation a series of interconnected actions to create effect. For example, OCO against several adversarial networks to shift communication onto a specific communications system, followed by the destruction of a 46 Influence is defined as: the capacity to have an effect on the character, or behaviour of someone or something or the effect itself.

Deny Enemy passage of information Destroy Equipment and personnel at communications node Disrupt Communications links Neutralise A specic communications node Attack Locations or facility Electronic attack Jam a frequency Degrade Oensive cyber operations, denial of service attack Higher commander’s eect Subordinate commander’s eect Subordinate commander’s action Figure 4.2 – An example of CEMA contribution to joint actions Planning and conducting 44 JDN 1/18 44 4 number of soft-target nodes on that system, which further drives all communications onto a single, fortified node. Then at an appointed time, an electronic attack of that communication node leads to the adversaries’ denial of communications or to the exploitation of their cyber intelligence. c. Combination of actions.  For a large or complex target, the creation of a single action may not achieve the commander’s intent. For example, a kinetic attack against a communications node will destroy a limited amount of equipment, but software-based system diagnostics may aid speedy recovery. However, when a kinetic attack is combined with an electronic attack that renders diagnostic software useless, repair may be impossible. 4.6. A common operational picture (COP) is a command and control tool that provides situational awareness as a graphical display, facilitating collaborative planning based on current or planned activities. A COP is defined as: an operational picture tailored to the user’s requirements, based on common data and information shared by more than one command.48 A COP is blended by Joint Task Force Headquarters on the basis of correlated, assessed and validated data from a variety of common tactical pictures with the graphic displayed dependent on the commander’s requirement.49 4.7. The requirement for a recognised electromagnetic picture (REMP) within a COP has been recognised and defined as: a complete and seamless depiction of the electromagnetic environment aiming at positively identifying and continuously tracking all the emitters and associated platforms and weapons in the area of responsibility.50 48 NATOTerm. 49 Joint Doctrine Publication (JDP) 3-70, Battlespace Management, paragraph 118. 50 NATOTerm. Section 3 – The recognised cyber and electromagnetic picture Planning and conducting 4 JDN 1/18 45 4.8. To support the planning and conduct of CEMA and to contribute to the COP, the REMP would need to include details of cyberspace activity, creating a recognised cyber and electromagnetic picture (RCEMP). The need for the RCEMP as a key enabler is identified and discussed in Joint Doctrine Publication (JDP) 0-50, UK Cyber Doctrine. 4.9. The RCEMP, within a COP, will provide situational awareness and improved understanding of activities and entities51 in cyberspace and the electromagnetic environment, enabling decision support and the selection of the correct CEMA effect. This enhanced situational awareness also provides for effective battlespace management and combat identification.52 4.10. It would be preferable to create a RCEMP real time in an integrated system. However, the reality of dealing with multiple data sources across multiple classifications means that the best case for generating a RCEMP can only be near-real time (slightly slower than real time). 51 These entities are considered friendly, adversarial or neutral. 52 JDP 3-00, Campaign Execution, 3rd Edition (Change 1). UK and Afghan personnel plan operations in Afghanistan Planning and conducting 46 JDN 1/18 46 4 4.11. Adding the RCEMP as a common tactical picture into the COP allows the joint force commander, subordinate staff, partners across government and non-governmental organisations tailored views based on a single data set. The arrangement is demonstrated in Figure 4.3.

Inherent in the Gerasimov Doctrine is the exploitation of cyber to create effects that are consistent with Russia’s reflexive control techniques. These are: constructive reflexive control in which “the enemy is influenced to voluntarily make a decision favourable to the controlling party”; and destructive reflexive control in which means are employed “to destroy, paralyse, or neutralise the enemy’s decision making processes”.55 Cyber and electronic warfare forces along with robust end-to-end military communications support are key to non-linear warfare. Pro-Russian forces made extensive use of unmanned aerial vehicles in both surveillance and coordination functions. Pro-Russian cyber operations were coordinated with electronic warfare and conventional activities, in contrast to the limited use in Georgia.56 Russia has continued development along lines where they appear to be overmatching the West and specifically the United States of America with electronic warfare and cyber coming to prominence. 4.12. zxzxzx53 54 55 56 53 More information is available at 54 More information is available at new-tools-confronting-west 55 More information is available at russia%27s%20renewed%20Military%20Thinking.pdf 56 More information is available at europe/georgia/2539157/Georgia-Russia-conducting-cyber-war.html Planning and conducting 48 JDN 1/18 48 4 Key points • A cyber and electromagnetic activities (CEMA) synchronisation and coordination group is needed to implement the national direction. • CEMA must be considered an integral part of joint action and fully integrated alongside non-CEMA, sequencing and combining actions through the full spectrum approach. • The planning and conduct of CEMA needs to be considered within strategic- and operational-level planning frameworks and appropriately resourced. • A recognised cyber and electromagnetic picture (RCEMP) will provide a combined depiction of the cyber and electromagnetic environment. • A RCEMP needs to be added to the common operating picture to define the totality of intelligence available.

Joint Doctrine Note (JDN) 1/18, Cyber and Electromagnetic Activities  attempts to capture the widest concept of cyber and electromagnetic  activities (CEMA) and draws together elements of existing doctrine and  best practice.  However, the principles and concepts expressed are not  yet wholly agreed.  This JDN sets a baseline for CEMA within UK Defence,  Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) and other partners  across government (PAG).  It provides a working description of the CEMA  environment and will enable the single Services to develop a tailored CEMA  concept whilst remaining aligned with Joint Forces Command (JFC) and  GCHQ intent.  Context  2. To succeed against complex and diverse threats that exploit the  pervasive information environment we need to do things differently.  At the  heart of this concept is the enhancement of joint action and, therefore, our  influence by contesting the information environment, being more integrated  as a force and more adaptable to changing circumstances.   Conventional and  non-conventional adversaries may be state or non-state; and may employ  mission-tailored, decentralised, asymmetric and agile actors.  Therefore, it is  important that we have doctrine that examines how we adapt operations to  the changing environment rather than trying to control it.  This is the context  within which Defence must undertake CEMA.  3. JDN 1/18, aims to clarify the nature of CEMA and offers guidance  on how to enable, realise, employ and exploit it.  It considers how CEMA  supports understanding, offensive and defensive actions and how it enables  commanders and staff to make effective decisions and create effects within  the full spectrum approach.  Audience  4. This publication is aimed at military commanders and staff (J1-J9) at  Permanent Joint Headquarters and at higher tactical levels.

The outcome of future operations will be   decided by the protagonist who does this   to decisive advantage.  Chief of the Defence Staff  Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach   “  ”  The need for cyber and electromagnetic activities    JDN 1/18 3  1  Chapter 1 – The need for  cyber and electromagnetic   activities  1.1. Cyber and electromagnetic activities (CEMA) are interdependent and  within the electromagnetic environment (EME).  The EME will be contested  by actors using both cyber and electromagnetic activity to achieve  operational advantage.  Digitisation has led to the convergence of cyber and  information activities to such an extent that CEMA coordination across the  joint force will be imperative for operational success.  Freedom to flexibly use  or to deny, degrade or constrain adversary access to the EME and parts of  cyberspace will offer significant operational advantage.  1.2. CEMA must address the longstanding challenges of acquiring, using  and integrating information with physical actions to create the desired effect.   In addition, information and the systems which create, collect, manage and  exploit this information, are critical to successful conflict outcomes.  The  need for CEMA coordination, coherent with a full spectrum approach and  mission assurance, has escalated in recent years because of the sheer volume  of information, the ease of access to it and the increasing means by which it  can be exploited.1   1 The Cyber and Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA) Vision was devised by the CEMA  Capability Integration Group (CIG).   Section 1 – Introduction  The CEMA Vision is:   ‘The synchronisation and coordination of cyber and electromagnetic  activities, delivering operational advantage thereby enabling freedom of  movement, and effects, whilst simultaneously, denying and degrading  adversaries’ use of the electromagnetic environment and cyberspace.’1  The need for cyber and electromagnetic activities    4 JDN 1/18   1  1.3. There is also the challenge of achieving interoperability and sustaining  knowledge parity while conducting joint and coalition operations.  While  many of these challenges will also be faced by our adversaries, low entry  costs and the rapid adoption of cutting edge technology means they may be  equally, or better, placed to use information as a force multiplier.  However,  our challenge is to operate within the constraints of UK and Allied, policy,  doctrine and law, whilst our adversaries have no need to and indeed gain an  edge in not doing so.  1.4. Russian operations in south-eastern and eastern Europe highlighted  the effectiveness of synchronising CEMA with conventional operational  activities to shape both the adversary’s and international perception.2    However, within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and  specifically UK doctrine, force and capability development have not kept  pace.  Joint Concept Note (JCN) 1/17, Future Force Concept identified the  need for CEMA while this joint doctrine note (JDN) provides clarification by  exploring how the CEMA concept is implemented so it can be undertaken  with decisive advantage.   1.5. There are areas where cyber activities and electromagnetic activities  overlap and these need to be defined.  The nature of CEMA is such that it  should be coordinated and may be synchronised across any, or all, activities.   To deliver operational advantage, a deployable headquarters will need to  synchronise as well as coordinate electronic warfare, spectrum management,  signals intelligence3 and cyber operational activities with CEMA-enabling  activities and other non-CEMA operational activity.  The list below indicates  some of the areas to be considered by a CEMA synchronisation and  coordinating authority.  This list is not exhaustive and issues of mission  assurance should be considered.  2 This joint doctrine note (JDN) will look at Russian use of both cyber activities and  electromagnetic activities and how they have developed, drawing parallels with UK CEMA  aspirations and developments.  Chapter 1 looks at the problems Russia encountered  during operations in Georgia.  Chapter 3 points to the successes on operations in Ukraine,  while Chapter 4 looks at how the Russian military has evolved and focused on coordinated  and synchronised actions to achieve the commander’s intent.  3 Signals intelligence incorporates electronic intelligence and communications  intelligence.  The need for cyber and electromagnetic activities    JDN 1/18 5  1  a. Assure CEMA capability coherence across Defence and the  Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) for both new and  existing capabilities.  b. Inform and shape CEMA capability across Defence lines of  development ensuring coherence across Service Commands, Defence  Equipment and Support, Information Systems and Services and  Defence Science and Technology Laboratory.  c. Influence the production of CEMA policy and doctrine.  d. Ensure key CEMA component and Service Command personnel  receive core training at tactical, operational and strategic levels.  e. Enable electromagnetic activities (EMA) and cyber activities to be  developed coherently under the CEMA strategy.4   f. Establish relationships with Defence industrial partners for supply  chain issues and vulnerabilities.  1.6. As cyber and EMA functions mature, CEMA will change.  However,  consideration must be given to how cyber and EMA capabilities under  development can be synchronised and coordinated into the full spectrum  approach.  A CEMA policy, planned for 2018, will develop the links between  cyber and EMA.  4 The Joint Force Cyber Group and British Army, as well as the United States of America  Cyber Command, work to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber  Security Framework which provides a useful common language and description of  functions (identify, protect, detect, respond, recover and their sub-categories).  The CEMA  strategy covers the period from 2017 to 2025 through three phases: phase 1 – definition  and refinement (2017-2020); phase 2 – implementation (2020-2025); and phase 3 – business  as usual (2025 onwards).  The need for cyber and electromagnetic activities    6 JDN 1/18   1  1.7. Technology will remain an essential element of future conflict  and a driver of military change over the next 20 years.  Maintaining a  technological advantage across key capability areas has, for many years,  enabled us to succeed with relatively small, professional Armed Forces.  But  these key capability areas were never integrated, leading to ‘stove-piped’  capability/force development where interoperability was coincidental  rather than planned.  However, with the convergence of computing and  telecommunications and the pace of technology, the military is now  trying to rebalance its understanding of the environments to encompass  electromagnetic, cyber and information aspects.  1.8. The rapid growth in non-kinetic activity challenges traditional  notions of hostile action and accountability within international law.   Cyber operations synchronised with electronic warfare in the context of a  full spectrum approach may overmatch conventional forces that are not  prepared for conflicts in the electromagnetic environment and cyberspace  simultaneously.  The situation now exists whereby technological advantage  is being eroded by non-conventional warfare using electromagnetic and  cyber activities.  This has led to the United States of America (US) creating  their 3rd Offset Strategy, introduced in Chapter 3.  Section 2 – Background   Non-conventional warfare using electromagnetic and cyberspace   may overmatch unprepared conventional forces  The need for cyber and electromagnetic activities    JDN 1/18 7  1    Weaknesses identified in the Georgian Operation (from a    Russian perspective)   In August and September 2008, Russia conducted a multi-pronged  operation against Georgia in support of the Russian-backed, self-proclaimed  republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.5  While this operation was  successful, it did highlight several weaknesses in Russian surveillance and  communications capability between single Services, weaknesses that Russia  has sought to address.  While the use of superior numbers of conventional ground forces and  artillery was successful, other softer activities requiring modern equipment  operated by agile joint forces proved less so.  a. The inability to counter the Georgian air defence capabilities  led to limited fixed-wing air operations and almost no rotary wing air  operations.  Air superiority was only achieved once ground forces had  neutralised Georgian air defences.  b. Russian military communications had little integration between  different radio systems.   c. Russia had, until this time, limited their use of unmanned aircraft  systems; this combined with electronic warfare weaknesses left a gap  in intelligence provision.   Few Russian sources directly acknowledged these weaknesses, but following  the Georgian operation, the Russian military took steps to address both  cyber and electronic warfare capability development.6  sds5 6   5 More infromation is available at http://usacac.army.mil/CAC2/MilitaryReview/Archives/ English/MilitaryReview_20091231_art009.pdf 6 More information is available at http://ssi.armywarcollege.edu/pdffiles/pub1069.pdf   The need for cyber and electromagnetic activities    8 JDN 1/18   1  Section 3 – Parity and pacing  1.9. Following Russian operations in eastern Europe and the Middle  East; and China’s military activities worldwide, much has been discussed  about regaining the initiative.  Although NATO has been confident of its  superiority there are areas where other nations have actually become peers,  for example, where Russia and China have achieved this in relation to EMA,  cyber and information activities.  As a minimum they need only keep pace  with NATO to maintain parity but could well be overmatching our capability.7   With the rapid acceleration of CEMA technology and capability, NATO’s lack  of priority to produce up-to-date joint doctrine and policy has exacerbated  the situation.8   1.10. Russia’s Chief of Electronic Warfare Troops, General-Major Yuriy  Lastochkin provides an example of how Russia is maintaining parity and  moving towards overmatching our capabilities in an interview in April 2017.   He said:9  7 For example, the impact of the WannaCry ransomware attack on the NHS in May 2017,  or the December 2015 Ukraine power grid cyberattack. 8 Whilst no US joint doctrine exists, the US Army discussed CEMA in Army Field Manual  (FM) 3-38, Cyber Electromagnetic Activities, however, that publication was not updated  rather it was retired and replaced with FM 3-12, Cyberspace and Electronic Warfare  Operations which describes CEMA as ‘the planning, integrating and synchronising activity  for echelon corps and below’.  9 More information is available at https://russiandefpolicy.blog/2017/05/30/electronic- warfare-chief-interviewed-2/  “The entire system of measures of organizational development of Electronic  Warfare Troops will substantially increase their contribution to winning  superiority in command and control, and in employing weapons.  The volume  of effectively fulfilled missions in various strategic directions will grow by two  to two and a half times and by 2020 will reach 85 percent.  This in turn will  become the basis of an effective air-ground electronic warfare system, capable  of neutralizing the enemy’s technological advantage in the aerospace sphere  and the information-telecommunications space.”9  The need for cyber and electromagnetic activities    JDN 1/18 9  1  1.11. As the world becomes ever more connected this leads to resource  contention across electromagnetic spectrum frequency bands.  Government  and military activities in the electromagnetic environment and cyberspace  must consider non-combatant use and ensure, where possible, that  operations do not adversely affect access to this global common.10  10 Future Operating Environment 2035, page 21.  Key points  • Low entry costs and the rapid adoption of cutting edge technology  means our adversaries may be equally, or better placed to use  information as a force multiplier.  • Challenges exist between using and integrating information while  conducting joint and coalition operations.  • Cyber and electromagnetic activities (CEMA) is not the change or  development agent for electromagnetic activities (EMA), nor cyber  maturation; it is based on synchronising and coordinating these  activities.  • CEMA needs policy and doctrine to ensure it is coherently  undertaken across Defence, the Government Communications  Headquarters and partners across government.  • It is important to learn lessons from past operations, such as events  in Georgia, about the need to synchronise and coordinate cyber  and electromagnetic activities.     • The electromagnetic environment and cyberspace are a congested  resource and operations need to consider other users, both friendly  and adversarial.  The need for cyber and electromagnetic activities      11JDN 1/18   Scope and definition  Chapter 2 offers a definition of cyber and  electromagnetic activities (CEMA) as well as  scoping its application.  It explains that CEMA  provides a synchronisation and coordination  function for these activities.

The Joint Forces Command Command Plan 2016/17 sought to establish a  Joint Cyber and Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA) Group to coordinate the  tasking, planning and execution of Defence CEMA and produce a strategy  to optimise the application of cyber and electromagnetic capabilities.  The  approach to its implementation should be driven by the CEMA Vision and  Strategy.11  The CEMA vision will be delivered by the Ministry of Defence  and partners across government.  This will ensure a coherent approach for  military and CEMA partners, limiting the adversary and enhancing UK Armed  Forces’ freedom of manoeuvre, freedom of action, information advantage,  decision superiority, and delivering operational advantage.12  These, in,  turn need adequate resources, including manpower empowered to make  decisions and implement change across the necessary elements of Defence.  2.2. CEMA is not the only available function to create the commander’s  desired effect and must be considered as part of full spectrum effects and  full spectrum targeting.13  Where CEMA is identified as appropriate then the  discussions that follow inform the synchronisation and coordination of these  activities and their contribution to the desired effect.    2.3. CEMA is defined as: the synchronisation and coordination of offensive,  defensive, inform and enabling activities, across the electromagnetic  environment and cyberspace.14  The definition broadly identifies four  activities, which are conducted in the electromagnetic environment (EME),  cyberspace, or a combination of both.  Figure 2.1 expands on the definition  with examples of these activities.  11 The strategy was devised by the Cyber and Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA)  Capability Integration Group (CIG) to determine the approach for implementing CEMA.   The strategy sets out a three phase, eight year programme.  At the time of publishing this  joint doctrine note the strategy is awaiting endorsement. 12 The CEMA Vision is at Chapter 1, paragraph 1.1.  It was endorsed by the CEMA CIG in  March 2017. 13 Joint Service Publication (JSP) 900, UK Targeting Policy. 14 This is a CEMA CIG working group endorsed definition.  Scope and definition    14 JDN 1/18 14  2  2.4. Defensive, offensive and inform activities are underpinned by enabling  activities which provide the necessary operational analysis, resources and  infrastructure.  While many enabling activities do not contribute directly to  the military operation, a failure to conduct them will lead to less effective  offensive, defensive and inform activities and ultimately pose a risk to  operational success.

CEMA should be coordinated and may be synchronised across any, or  all, activities.  Although the intent within CEMA is to synchronise offensive,  defensive and inform activities, that may not be practical against the whole  range of joint force activities.     2.6. CEMA comprises cyber activities and electromagnetic activities (EMA)  however, there are no approved definitions for either cyber activities or EMA.   Identifying these two groups of activities would help in the understanding  of the CEMA scope.  The proposed definition of electromagnetic activities  is: all offensive, defensive and inform activities that shape or exploit the  electromagnetic environment and the enabling activities that support  them.15  2.7. Cyber activities have not been defined.  However, equivalents can be  found in the four cyber operations’ roles:16    • offensive cyber operations (OCO);  • defensive cyber operations (DCO) (including active defence);  • cyber intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (cyber ISR); and  • cyber operational preparation of the environment (cyber OPE).  2.8. CEMA will also coordinate with organisations and actors conducting  non-CEMA activities where required.  For example, CEMA is an enabler for  psychological operations that are considered to be part of information  operations.  Figure 2.2 illustrates this relationship with some examples (not  all) of non-CEMA activities.17  15 This definition was proposed and endorsed by the CEMA CIG on behalf of the  Head Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and  Reconnaissance and Cyber joint user. 16 Cyber Primer, 2nd Edition, page 51. 17 Joint Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (JTTP) 3-70;1, Joint Tactics, Techniques and  Procedures for Battlespace Management, Version 2, paragraph 23.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) states that operational  EMA should comprise of electromagnetic operations (EMO), which are  defined as: all operations that shape or exploit the electromagnetic  environment, or use it for attack or defence including the use of the  electromagnetic environment to support operations in all other operational  environments.18  This definition does not include all enabling activities and  therefore EMO must not be considered interchangeable with EMA.  2.10. There are several command considerations applicable across the  entirety of CEMA.  Coordination is the activity CEMA actors undertake,  whereas operational imperative, agility, execution, redundancy and resilience   are the ethos which guide them.   a. Operational imperative.  This is the key principle upon which all  others depend.  As CEMA activities are not yet sufficiently established,  all actors must be informed of, understand and be focused on  delivering the commander’s intent.   b. Agility.  Both cyberspace and the EME are being contested by the  adversary.  Therefore the ability to flex resource, effort and processes as  required is critical.  c. Coordination.  This must be conducted at the highest level and  filter down to all force elements and coalition partners.  d. Execution.  CEMA will be integrated with the wider military under  the full spectrum approach.  This means CEMA battlespace execution  is likely to require a command and control approach emphasising  centralised control but decentralised execution, where execution  authority is delegated to the point of best understanding for   decision-making.   18 NATOTerm.  Section 3 – Command considerations  Scope and definition    18 JDN 1/18 18  2  e. Redundancy.  As cyberspace and the EME are being contested by  the adversary, planning for redundancy and reversionary practices  should be undertaken and exercised.  f. Resilience.  Resilience is the ability of the community, services or  infrastructure to withstand the consequences of an incident.19  This is  related to both execution and redundancy.  19 Joint Doctrine Publication (JDP) 02, Operations in the UK: The Defence Contribution to  Resilience, 2nd Edition.  Key points   • Cyber and electromagnetic activities (CEMA) is defined as: the  synchronisation and coordination of offensive, defensive, inform  and enabling activities, across the electromagnetic environment and  cyberspace.  • Enabling activities provide the necessary operational analysis,  resources and infrastructure.    • Synchronisation and coordination of CEMA contributes to the  commander’s intent.  • CEMA will also coordinate with organisations and actors conducting  non-CEMA activities where required.  • Electromagnetic operations are not the same as electromagnetic  activities.  • A commander should consider the application of operational  imperative, agility, coordination, execution, redundancy and resilience  across CEMA.

Joint Concept Note 1/17, Future Force Concept  “  ”  Development and functional relationship    JDN 1/18 23  3  Chapter 3 – Development and  functional relationships  Section 1 – Development approach  3.1. The relationships between cyber activities and electromagnetic  activities are still maturing making a single approach to cyber and  electromagnetic activities (CEMA) challenging.  Therefore our adoption  and implementation of the CEMA concept and its integration into the full  spectrum approach will benefit from an incremental development approach.   Individual needs, for the single Services, may need to be tailored.    3.2. A development maturity progression framework that outlines levels  of synchronicity is shown in this chapter.  Progression towards each of these  representative maturity levels is implemented in various ways.  However, all  maturity levels will need to consider Defence lines of development for each  step and how these levels align with the future force concept.  a. Level 1: initial step.  The initial step is the most difficult to address  as funding and resources will already be allocated across the current  force.20  This step, demonstrated in Figure 3.1, will be set in the  context of austerity and have to overcome extant doctrine, policy and   20 The current force is identified in Joint Concept Note (JCN) 1/17, Future Force Concept.  At the tactical level, a planned operation requires phone use to be  blocked in the operations area.  This is achieved by an electronic  warfare operation jamming the broadcast tower.  Due to insufficient  synchronisation and coordination, it was not appreciated that jamming  the tower also stopped an ongoing strategic cyber operation being  conducted by partners across government.

Level 2: evolving step.  This step provides a substantial degree of  synchronisation and coordination without re-designing cyber and  electromagnetic force structures, funding lines and legal frameworks.

Level 4: ubiquitious step.  Figure 3.4 recognises that there may be  elements of cyber and electromagnetic activities (EMA) never fully  integrated into CEMA.  An example of this may be down to security  issues, but these boundaries will become less defined over time.

For the 3rd Offset Strategy the Department of Defense took a more  holistic approach asking ‘who are our pacing competitors, what are they  doing, how can they affect the US and how can we counter the effects?’   Once understood, force development and capability development can  focus on the problem.  Currently, the US Department of Defense’s five key technology areas for  exploitation are:  • autonomous learning systems; • human-machine collaboration;  • assisted human operations through technology; • advanced human-machine combat teaming; and • network-enabled autonomous weapons and high-speed   weapons.     Notably, all of these use the electromagnetic spectrum and cyberspace  and therefore open up novel attack vectors and present novel  vulnerabilities.  Interestingly, the Russian non-linear war seeks to exploit  and protect similar attack vectors and vulnerabilities, leaving the West to  determine whether it is once again in an arms race.  Development and functional relationship    JDN 1/18 27  3  3.3. The roles and responsibilities addressed in this joint doctrine note  (JDN) already exist with none disappearing or being created.  This JDN aims  to identify the CEMA-related synchronisation and coordination activities  that need developing within each role and/or function with these roles  evolving over time.  Understanding these changes, how that role performs  its CEMA duties, or when and where, is not within this JDN.  A joint doctrine  publication (JDP) will be developed to address these issues.  3.4. CEMA development must be driven and supported by Defence  and partners across government, based on the vision and strategy.24   Implementation should be within the joint user community.  Force  development and generation functions are listed below.  a. Force development.  CEMA is not a ‘Genesis Option’, as described  by Finance and Military Capability – there is no extra funded manpower  to support it.25  CEMA should be considered by the Command,  Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance  and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) branch of Joint Forces Command (JFC)  Capability Directorate during force testing, exploration and design  rather than separately as cyber and EMA activities to identify efficiency  gains that enable CEMA’s introduction.    b. Force generation.  Development should be driven by a  Defence-wide need rather than by the single Services.  Developing  doctrine and policy needs to be underpinned by a corporate  programme from which all other specialist training should evolve.   Examples of this generation are listed below.  24 The Cyber and Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA) vision is at Chapter 1, paragraph 1.1.    The strategy was endorsed by the CEMA Capability Integration Group (CIG) to determine  the approach to implement CEMA.  It sets out a three phase, eight year programme.  It is  expected to be endorsed in 2018. 25 The Finance and Military Capability Operating Model explains force development  and force generation in more detail and outlines capability development.

Whole Force management.  Whole Force by Design26  refreshes the Whole Force concept and must guide Whole Force  management.  The Whole Force must comprise generalists and  specialists and take into consideration their development and  collaboration requirements.  These specialists may come from  partners across government.  Stove-piping branch and trades  should be avoided to allow the successful implementation of the  CEMA concept.   ii. General education.  Education must focus on how our  operations leverage CEMA and essential operations security  practices.27  We must provide continuous and developing  education opportunities for all personnel to ensure that CEMA is  understood and in line with techological advances.    iii. CEMA training.  Where possible training should be  developed and delivered across the Whole Force rather than  single Services or branches.  Specialist training should be  balanced against current needs and needs identified during force  development.  Aspects of CEMA training will be mandated by  partners across government.28   iv. Exercises.  CEMA serials must be woven into the normal  training programme and not seen as an add on.  Exercises must  be realistic and robustly test our Armed Forces’ defensive and  offensive capabilities.  We must capably deal with degraded and  denied cyberspace and electromagnetic environment (EME)  operations, adapting quickly to reversionary war modes.  Realistic  training must include security against third parties collecting  cyber or EME data on our forces and the challenges of electronic  warfare or offensive cyber systems degrading civil systems.  This  will act as a driver for synthetic cyber and EME training systems.29  26 Whole Force by Design was conceived with National Security Council Review  outcomes in mind, particularly Joint Force 2025 in accordance with the principle of  achieving the most cost effective balance between regular and reserve forces, Ministry of  Defence civilians and contractors.  27 JCN 1/17, page 22. 28 Ibid. 29 Ibid.  Development and functional relationship    JDN 1/18 29  3  v. Expeditionary forces.  Expeditionary force design should take  account of CEMA from inception.30  The practice of   retro-fitting CEMA force elements into a conventional force may  lead to under-resourcing, unclear or complex chains of command  and poor integration into a full spectrum approach.   vi. Lead user.  While the role of lead user for tactical CEMA  capabilities can be placed within a single Service, the default for  the lead user role is the C4ISR joint user in JFC.  This may be the  case even if the capability is operated by a single Service.   vii. Joint user.  This role should always stay with the C4ISR joint  user in JFC.  As CEMA is focused on synchronisation, coordination  and the contribution to the full spectrum approach, the C4ISR  joint user will have the remit to look across Defence.  viii. Lead delivery agent.  This may sit with either Defence  Equipment and Support (DE&S) or Information Systems and   30 This is to include planning staff.  CEMA serials need to become a part of regular training programmes  Development and functional relationships    30 JDN 1/18 30  3  Services and will depend on the balance of equipment or service  to be provided.  3.5. The single Services have historically conducted EMA independently,  even when operating as part of a joint force.  Recent UK operations  have focused EMA on tactical electronic defence, particularly on  counterinsurgency and stabilisation operations.31  However, our adversaries  have also been developing wide-ranging EMA capabilities and employing  them operationally.  3.6. Recent efforts have concentrated on developing cyber forces and  capability, and while significant progress has been made, development is  often conducted along single-Service lines, with the exception of offensive  cyber.  This is not a problem confined solely to the UK.  Few North Atlantic  Treaty Organization (NATO) members have developed a coherent and  comprehensive cyber approach and NATO has yet to incorporate ‘cyber’ into  its definitions and terms.  While achieving consensus on the concept of CEMA  is difficult, a debate may start with the examination of the sub functions of  core CEMA and how their scope interacts with each other; these being EMA  and cyber activities, and their collective management.  3.7. Electromagnetic activities.  Operationally there are four EMA that  are key elements: electronic warfare; signals intelligence; spectrum  management; and communications.  These functions are integral parts and  interlinked in our operations.  a. Electronic warfare.  This is defined as: military action that exploits  electromagnetic energy to provide situational awareness and achieve  offensive and defensive effects.32  It is made up of four elements.  31 Tactical operational activities in Iraq and Afghanistan have been supported by a  wide variety of electronic countermeasures (ECM).  A key function has been the jamming,  deception and neutralisation of remote-controlled improvised explosive devices.  ECM is a  form of active electronic defence. 32 NATOTerm.  Section 3 – Evolving functions  Development and functional relationship    JDN 1/18 31  3  i. Electronic surveillance.  This is defined as the: use of  electromagnetic energy to provide situational awareness and  intelligence.33  When developing CEMA, regard must be paid  to the overlap between electronic surveillance and cyber  intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (cyber ISR).   ii. Electronic defence.  This is defined as the: use of  electromagnetic energy to provide protection and ensure  effective friendly use of the electromagnetic spectrum.34  iii. Electronic attack.  This is defined as the: use of  electromagnetic energy for offensive purposes.35  This is  employed to diminish an adversary’s ability to understand, shape  or exploit the operational environment and its use should be  integrated into the full spectrum affect under CEMA.   iv. Electronic warfare management.  This is the capability to  coordinate and deconflict electronic warfare activities and, as  such, is fundamental to coordinating CEMA.  b. Signals intelligence.  This is defined as: intelligence derived  from electromagnetic signals or emissions.36  In some instances this  intelligence may be collected by either electronic surveillance or cyber  ISR, coordination is required to optimise activities.  c. Spectrum management.  This is defined as: planning, coordinating,  and managing use of the electromagnetic spectrum through  operational, engineering, and administrative procedures with the  objective of enabling military electronic systems to perform their  functions within intended environments without causing or suffering  harmful interference.37  Spectrum management is a crucial   CEMA-enabling activity that persists from capability development,  acquisition and use, through to disposal.  During military operations,   33 Ibid. 34 Ibid. 35 Ibid. 36 Ibid. 37 Spectrum management is defined in Allied Communications Publication (ACP) 190(C),  Guide to Spectrum Management in Military Operations.  Development and functional relationships    32 JDN 1/18 32  3  CEMA provides a coordinating function through battlespace spectrum  management (BSM) to enable effective use of the electromagnetic  spectrum (EMS).  The end-state is to enable the commander freedom of  movement in the EME.   d. Communications.  Increasingly, military communications (both  human and machine) face external demands for EMS to be released  for commercial use.  Technological advances have led to an increase  in spectrum-dependent systems for gathering and transferring  information with force elements increasingly reliant on detailed,  immersive graphics and videos, all of which need high-bandwidth  communication channels.  Communications needs to be coordinated  with other EMS users, through CEMA, to gain spectrum understanding  and to meet operational needs while ensuring that users in the UK or  host nation are not adversely affected.  3.8. Cyber activities.  Cyber operations are described as the planning and  synchronisation of activities in, and through, cyberspace to enable freedom  of manoeuvre and to achieve military objectives.38  With the growth of  mobile and wireless connectivity it is increasingly important to consider EMA  when conducting these operations.  Cyber operations are categorised into  four distinct roles.39   a. Offensive cyber operations.  These are defined as: activities that  project power to achieve military objectives in, or through, cyberspace.     b. Defensive cyber operations.  These are defined as: active and  passive measures to preserve the ability to use cyberspace.   c. Cyber intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.  This is  defined as: intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance activities  in, and through, friendly, neutral and adversary cyberspace to build  understanding.  38 Cyber Primer, 2nd Edition. 39 Ibid.  Development and functional relationship    JDN 1/18 33  3  d. Cyber operational preparation of the environment.  This is defined  as: all activities conducted to prepare, and enable, cyber intelligence,  surveillance and reconnaissance, defensive and offensive operations.  Cyber operations enable freedom of manoeuvre and   the achievement of military objectives  Development and functional relationships    34 JDN 1/18 34  3  3.9. Organisations and structures that define information operations,  cyber operations and electronic warfare have evolved to fit a changing  technological world.  These actions and operations use cyberspace and the  EME to operate across the five domains and co-exist in CEMA littoral areas.40  3.10. The mainstay of CEMA is the synchronisation and coordination of,  and with, activities both internal and external to CEMA.41  CEMA depends  on technical and procedural interoperability using standardised interfaces,  protocols and approaches.  This ensures information exchange across joint  forces, coalition, government and industry partners, which in turn improves  integration and fosters adaptability.  3.11. Cyber and signals intelligence.  Cyber operations and signals  intelligence (SIGINT) are predominately reliant on the same infrastructure,  organisations, access to personnel training and skill-sets.  However, they  must also be seen as complementary, and not competing capabilities.  The  key difference between cyber and SIGINT is the intent and effect of the two.      3.12. Information bearer.  The EMS can be used indirectly as a bearer of  information, or directly as a means of creating an effect.  As a bearer of  information, be that voice communications or digital-based information  systems, this is an example of where EMA and cyber share a littoral.   Responsibilities within this function include security and resilience and this  is where the overlap with cyber is greatest.  Defensive cyber operations are  an integral and non-discretionary component of network operations and  security resilience.  3.13. Coordination and synchronisation of activities external to CEMA.   Information operations and activities are not included within CEMA but  elements are closely associated with the CEMA cyber capability.  There is a  large amount of overlap with the key distinguishing feature between the   40 JCN 1/17, Future Force Concept, paragraph 3.1 lists the domains as air, land, maritime,  space and cyber. 41 This is illustrated in Figures 2.1 and 2.2 in Chapter 2.  Section 4 – Development summary  Development and functional relationship    JDN 1/18 35  3  two areas being the scope of the operating environment.  Whilst cyber  operations take place in, and through, cyberspace, information operations  can also use other means.  3.14. Centralised control, decentralised execution.  CEMA battlespace  execution will require a command and control approach that emphasises  centralised control but decentralised execution.  As well as integrating  our own offensive actions, we must be able to mitigate the threat from  adversaries’ cyber or electromagnetic weapons while preventing negative  impact to, and from, friendly or neutral systems.   3.15. Development challenges for Defence.  The CEMA evolution required  by Defence roles and responsibilities presents a change which needs support  through all Defence lines of development.  It also requires each of us to  change, cognitively and behaviourly, so that CEMA becomes routine.  This  cannot be achieved wholly through training but comes from embracing  change.  It should be noted that human factors present the biggest impact to  CEMA in terms of enabling or threatening its success.   3.16. Training and education.  To prevent CEMA remaining the preserve of  technically capable and interested individuals a programme of training and  education is key to the successful integration of CEMA if it is to be ingrained  in routine.42   42 The 1* CEMA Training Group is co-chaired by the Head Command, Control,  Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance and Cyber  Joint User and the Commander Joint CEMA Group.  Training and education are key to ingraining CEMA  Development and functional relationships    36 JDN 1/18 36  3  asas 43s  43 Based on Internet research pieced together for this joint doctrine note, an example of  which is available at http://ssi.armywarcollege.edu/pdffiles/pub1069.pdf  Addressing the weaknesses43  During the 2008 Georgian operation the Russian military identified several  capability and organisational weaknesses and sought to address the  causes.  Although their response was not the same as this doctrine note  discusses, it reflects their investment in the same operational arena.  In a  similar vein, the Russian military has supported a drive for a more ‘joint’  approach across the formerly stovepiped single Services.  In addition, they  have invested in specialist units notably across cyber, electronic warfare  and strategic military communications.  All of this is underpinned by a  series of strategic and operational command and control programmes  such as the National Defence Control Center.   This, combined with a plan  to replace 70% of old equipment by 2020, means that Russian electronic  warfare capabilities will approach, or exceed, those of many North Atlantic  Treaty Organization (NATO) members well before that date.  In many ways,  this, like the changes in capability development and acquisition, parallel  those changes undertaken by NATO members, most notably the United  States of America.   Development and functional relationship    JDN 1/18 37  3    Key points   • Both the cyber and the electromagnetic activities concepts are  still maturing; so the adoption and implementation of the cyber  and electromagnetic activities (CEMA) concept will benefit from an  incremental development approach.    • A four level CEMA development approach is proposed.  • CEMA roles and responsibilities will evolve, driven by Defence, based  on the CEMA vision and strategy.  • Realistic training must include security against third parties collecting  cyber or electromagnetic environment data on our forces and the  challenges of electronic warfare or offensive cyber systems degrading  civil systems.    • CEMA battlespace execution will require a command and control  approach emphasising centralised control, but decentralised  execution.  • Human factors present the biggest impact to CEMA in terms  of enabling or threatening the success of its use.  Therefore  implementing CEMA successfully relies on embracing cognitive  and behavioural change to make CEMA an automatic action, not an  additional task.

A cyber and electromagnetic activities (CEMA) synchronisation and  coordination group is needed to implement the national direction.  This  group will ensure all strategic and operational effect is mapped against  higher intent.  Figure 4.1 outlines a suggested functional organisation.   The structure that the CEMA synchronisation and coordination group sits  within is illustrative and will need to be endorsed.

The planning and conduct of CEMA needs to be considered within  strategic- and operational-level planning frameworks at a joint level.  During  the options development process, liaison and coordination between  planning staff responsible for CEMA is paramount.  This coordination will  assess how these capabilities can be best used against the developing  options or courses of action within legal boundaries or other restrictions.   Force generation activities involving CEMA planning staffs are used to advise  the commander on the CEMA component of the Whole Force, especially  where deployed personnel numbers are fixed and where CEMA may be  conducted with reachback to non-deployed CEMA specialists.  4.3. The synchronisation and coordination of CEMA within a joint force  headquarters (JFHQ) can be conducted by the electromagnetic battlestaff  (EMB) with cyber representation.  The EMB structure uses and builds on the  existing Electronic Warfare Coordination Cell (EWCC).44  It is the role of the  EMB to coordinate and monitor all aspects of electromagnetic activities  within the electromagnetic environment on behalf of the Joint Forces  Command (JFC) directorate staff.45   4.4. Joint Concept Note (JCN) 1/17, Future Force Concept, states that  ‘Influence will only be achieved with a clear focus on audiences and effects,  and by integrating and synchronising kinetic and non-kinetic activities  conducted across the physical and virtual domains to try to achieve those   44  The Electronic Warfare Coordination Cell (EWCC) may comprise a liaison officer with  reachback to supporting national bodies, or a staff of between three to as many as 12  or more, as necessary for a specific operation.  Training is an essential element to EWCC  where there is a need for highly skilled staff to carry out its activities.  It is fundamental  that in undertaking CEMA, extant functions such as EWCC are included.  See Allied Joint  Publication (AJP)-3.6, Allied Joint Doctrine for Electronic Warfare, Edition B, paragraphs 0205  and 0207 for more details. 45 Allied Joint Publication (AJP)-3.6 explains that electromagnetic battlestaff (EMB)  would include members from the Joint Forces Headquarters (JFHQ) J3 (Operations), J5  (Planning), J2 (Knowledge) and J6 (Communications and information support) staff.  The  director of the EMB will be designated by J3.  Note AJP-3.6, Edition C, was being drafted at  the time of publishing.  Section 2 – Synchronising and coordinating  Planning and conducting    4  JDN 1/18 43  effects.’46  CEMA must be considered an integral part of joint action47 and  fully integrated alongside non-CEMA, sequencing and combining actions  through the full spectrum approach to achieve the desired influence.   Figure  4.2 provides an example of how CEMA may contribute to joint actions.  4.5. Under the full spectrum approach, and enabled by interoperable  command and control systems, CEMA actions may be planned and  conducted collaboratively.  This can be carried out in a number of ways.   a. Action options against a single effect.  Rather than simply  considering a kinetic action to create a desired effect, commanders  should consider other effects, with CEMA providing these options.  For  example, if the target was in a non-combatant urban area an electronic  attack or offensive cyber operations (OCO) may be more appropriate,  according to the targeting policy.   b. Sequence of actions.  Where a commander may put into operation  a series of interconnected actions to create effect.  For example, OCO  against several adversarial networks to shift communication onto a  specific communications system, followed by the destruction of a   46 Influence is defined as: the capacity to have an effect on the character, or behaviour of  someone or something or the effect itself.

Then at an appointed  time, an electronic attack of that communication node leads to the  adversaries’ denial of communications or to the exploitation of their  cyber intelligence.  c. Combination of actions.  For a large or complex target, the creation  of a single action may not achieve the commander’s intent.  For  example, a kinetic attack against a communications node will destroy a  limited amount of equipment, but software-based system diagnostics  may aid speedy recovery.  However, when a kinetic attack is combined  with an electronic attack that renders diagnostic software useless,  repair may be impossible.  4.6. A common operational picture (COP) is a command and control  tool that provides situational awareness as a graphical display, facilitating  collaborative planning based on current or planned activities.  A COP is  defined as: an operational picture tailored to the user’s requirements, based  on common data and information shared by more than one command.48  A  COP is blended by Joint Task Force Headquarters on the basis of correlated,  assessed and validated data from a variety of common tactical pictures with  the graphic displayed dependent on the commander’s requirement.49    4.7. The requirement for a recognised electromagnetic picture (REMP)  within a COP has been recognised and defined as: a complete and seamless  depiction of the electromagnetic environment aiming at positively  identifying and continuously tracking all the emitters and associated  platforms and weapons in the area of responsibility.50     48 NATOTerm. 49 Joint Doctrine Publication (JDP) 3-70, Battlespace Management, paragraph 118. 50 NATOTerm.  Section 3 – The recognised cyber and   electromagnetic picture  Planning and conducting    4  JDN 1/18 45  4.8. To support the planning and conduct of CEMA and to contribute to  the COP, the REMP would need to include details of cyberspace activity,  creating a recognised cyber and electromagnetic picture (RCEMP).  The need  for the RCEMP as a key enabler is identified and discussed in Joint Doctrine  Publication (JDP) 0-50, UK Cyber Doctrine.      4.9. The RCEMP, within a COP, will provide situational awareness and  improved understanding of activities and entities51 in cyberspace and the  electromagnetic environment, enabling decision support and the selection  of the correct CEMA effect.  This enhanced situational awareness also  provides for effective battlespace management and combat identification.52  4.10. It would be preferable to create a RCEMP real time in an integrated  system.  However, the reality of dealing with multiple data sources across  multiple classifications means that the best case for generating a RCEMP can  only be near-real time (slightly slower than real time).   51 These entities are considered friendly, adversarial or neutral. 52 JDP 3-00, Campaign Execution, 3rd Edition (Change 1).

Adding the RCEMP as a common tactical picture into the COP allows  the joint force commander, subordinate staff, partners across government  and non-governmental organisations tailored views based on a single data  set.

Inherent in the Gerasimov Doctrine is the exploitation of cyber to create  effects that are consistent with Russia’s reflexive control techniques.  These  are: constructive reflexive control in which “the enemy is influenced to  voluntarily make a decision favourable to the controlling party”; and  destructive reflexive control in which means are employed “to destroy,  paralyse, or neutralise the enemy’s decision making processes”.55   Cyber and electronic warfare forces along with robust end-to-end military  communications support are key to non-linear warfare.  Pro-Russian forces  made extensive use of unmanned aerial vehicles in both surveillance and  coordination functions.  Pro-Russian cyber operations were coordinated  with electronic warfare and conventional activities, in contrast to the limited  use in Georgia.56  Russia has continued development along lines where they appear to be  overmatching the West and specifically the United States of America with  electronic warfare and cyber coming to prominence.  4.12. zxzxzx53 54 55 56   53 More information is available at http://posse.gatech.edu/node/8732 54 More information is available at https://www.chathamhouse.org/publication/russias- new-tools-confronting-west 55 More information is available at http://cco.ndu.edu/Portals/96/Documents/Articles/ russia%27s%20renewed%20Military%20Thinking.pdf 56 More information is available at http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ europe/georgia/2539157/Georgia-Russia-conducting-cyber-war.html  Planning and conducting    48 JDN 1/18 48  4    Key points  • A cyber and electromagnetic activities (CEMA) synchronisation  and coordination group is needed to implement the national  direction.  • CEMA must be considered an integral part of joint action  and fully integrated alongside non-CEMA, sequencing and  combining actions through the full spectrum approach.     • The planning and conduct of CEMA needs to be considered  within strategic- and operational-level planning frameworks and  appropriately resourced.  • A recognised cyber and electromagnetic picture (RCEMP) will  provide a combined depiction of the cyber and electromagnetic  environment.   • A RCEMP needs to be added to the common operating picture  to define the totality of intelligence available.

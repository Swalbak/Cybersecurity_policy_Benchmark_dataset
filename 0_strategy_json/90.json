Our security environment has become more fragmented and more complex and thus more difficult to assess. The significant increase in the number of non-state actors, the possibilities of hybrid warfare, the return of power politics, in some cases with a marked tendency toward unilateralism, heightened tensions between the Western states and Russia, as well as the political and economic challenges in European countries are all part of a situa- tion that increasingly difficult to grasp. The old order is changing under the pressure exerted by political, economic, military but also technological, social and cultural forces. The outcome of these changes is uncertain. In this world of insecurity and growing uncertainty, the intelligence service is becoming increasingly important. Its anticipation and early detection capabilities are needed in order to identify and assess threats in good time and – where opportune – to take preventive measures. The intelligence picture of the overall situation, pieced together from countless fragments, is a key element in the decision making of those responsible for security policy. With its new design and simpler layout, this yearʼs annual report of the FIS pre- sents to the interested members of the public the major developments from an intel- ligence point of view. In each section, the FIS details its observations on the issue in question and states what it expects to happen. A new ʻkey figuresʼ section contains information and data, which were previously published in the Federal Councilʼs annual report. It also contains the key figures on intelligence-gathering measures requiring authorisation. These figures show that such measures, which are particu- larly restrictive in terms of fundamental rights, remain focused on combating terror- ism and illegal intelligence. I hope that this yearʼs situation report of the FIS will again be of interest to a wide audience. S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S 9 The situation report in brief T H E S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T I N B R I E F S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S 11 For years, the challenges faced by the security agencies have become more com- plexity. The FIS’s situation radar tool is one of the instruments giving direction to Switzerland’s security policy and providing Switzerland’s inhabitants with an out- line of the key issues from an intelligence viewpoint. ▪ Political stability and economic robustness in Europe are diminishing. Europe is spellbound by its own crises and global power struggles: against this background, the adverse impact on Switzerland’s security of the return of power politics and the hence growing power-political rivalry between the USA, Russia and China is becoming more and more evident. The growing insecurity in its surrounding is becoming more relevant to Switzerland with regard to security policy. ▪ Russia's increased confidence is based chiefly on its regained military strength and its tightly organized power apparatus under President Putin. It wants to be perceived as a superpower on an equal footing with the USA. Nonetheless, there are still limitations to its military capabilities. Russia will therefore continue to focus on influence operations, ranging from activities such as information cam- paigns, manipulation and propaganda to the exercise of overt political, military and economic pressure. The practices of extortion and, in certain cases, commit- ting violent actions remain a possibility. ▪ Besides military strength, the USA relies heavily on the use of economic pressure to safeguard its security and its national interests in the global strategic competi- tion. Secondary sanctions with extraterritorial effect are an important instrument. These are designed to force third countries and large companies operating inter- nationally to accept the USA’s demands, particularly in the context of its policy on Iran. President Trump rejects restrictions on the USA’s national sovereignty by multilateral mechanisms, has a sceptical view of the USA’s alliances and is clearly keen for the USA to go it alone as a nation. ▪ China will continue to do everything in its power to keep growing economically and militarily. It remains very unlikely that it will depart fundamentally from its current course. Iran will try to wait out Trump’s presidency without capitulating. It remains unlikely that North Korea will completely renounce nuclear weapons and delivery systems suitable for deploying them, even though it intermittently sends out disarmament signals. T H E S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T I N B R I E F S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S12 ▪ The Middle East and North Africa, including the Sahel region, remain the scene of numerous wars and armed conflicts. For example, the Syrian regime and its Russian and Iranian allies have strategically defeated the rebels, but have not yet secured victory. Despite massive losses, the ʻIslamic Stateʼ and other jihadist groups remain capable of launching major attacks. Jihadist groups and the indi- viduals and small groups controlled or inspired by them pose the dominant ter- rorist threat in Europe. In Switzerland, the terrorist threat remains at a heightened level. ▪ The right-wing extremist scene is becoming more active. Several groups now have open websites, and one group in Vaud has even opened its own premises. At the same time, the scene continues to behave conspiratorially, and for the time being it remains unclear whether it is once again moving increasingly toward the direct use of violence. However, its potential for violence remains unchanged, as does that of the left-wing extremist scene. The latter has a network of interna- tional links, which is probably one of the reasons for the partially intensified use of violence by some groups that has been seen since 2017. Left-wing extremists combine their actions to form campaigns, especially against alleged repression and in particular against the expansion of the Bässlergut prison in Basel, and express their solidarity with the PKK in support of the Kurdish autonomously administered areas in northern Syria. The return from these areas of left-wing extremists trained in the use of weapons is a matter of concern for the European security authorities. ▪ With regard to the issue of proliferation, the appeal of weapons of mass destruc- tion remains high, and technological advances are facilitating their acquisition. In the field of civil nuclear technology, China is the country currently driving dynamics. The centre of gravity with regard to responsibility for non-prolifera- tion and for preventing the emergence of new nuclear weapon states is thus also shifting. In the proliferation target countries – Pakistan, Iran, Syria (possible replacement of chemical weapons programme) and North Korea – the situation has not changed. ▪ The return of power politics has also given renewed impetus to espionage – its use as a tool for information gathering is on the rise worldwide. Russia, with an agenda driven by superpower politics, and China, with an agenda driven primar- T H E S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T I N B R I E F S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S 13 ily by economic considerations, rank first and second in this respect. The broader trend, extending to numerous other states, toward attempting to assert interests increasingly by force rather than through legal channels or multinational bodies could increasingly lead to serious criminal acts such as kidnappings or killings being carried out at the behest of the state. Foreign intelligence services will prob- ably play a role in preparing and executing such actions and dealing with the subsequent aftermath. The use of cyber tools as a key instrument in the exercise of power by nations will probably also continue to grow in importance. T H E S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T I N B R I E F S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S 15 Situation radar tool The FIS uses a situation radar tool to depict the threats affecting Switzerland. A simplified version of the situation radar, without any confidential data, has also been incorporated into this report. The public version lists the threats that fall within the FIS’s remit, together with those classified under the categories of ‘migra- tion risks’ and ‘organised crime’, which are also relevant from the point of view of security policy. This report does not go into detail about these two categories, for more information on which readers are referred to the reports of the relevant federal authorities.

Unlike the Baltic states, Poland and Ukraine, Switzerland is not directly affected by Russia’s efforts to regain its sphere of influence in Eastern Europe. Moreover, the approximately 136,000 migrants who reached Europe via Mediterranean and overland routes in 2018 did not initially land in Switzerland, but in Spain, Italy or Greece. Despite this, Switzerland’s security buffer zone has weakened overall, as political stability and economic robustness have been diminishing in Europe as a whole for a number of years. Political polarization in the EU is being exacerbated and a strain is being placed on its cohesion, in particular by intra-European migra- tion movements and the 628,000 asylum applications, which were filed EU-wide in 2018. The increasing uncertainty in its surrounding has also made security policy a more important issue for Switzerland. The security authorities are already facing challenges from the continuing heightened terrorist threat, intensive intelligence activities by Russia, in particular, and cyber attacks on the Swiss economy ema- nating from China, Russia and other states. Regional powers such as Turkey or What does the FIS see? S T R AT E G I C E N V I R O N M E N T S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S20 Iran track regime opponents even on European soil and are not afraid to carry out abductions or, in the case of Iran, attempted attacks. Countering proliferation attempts also calls for a high degree of alertness and requires a lot of effort. Europe: under the spell of its own crises and global power struggles In recent years, political tensions in the EU have increased significantly, mainly due to migration pressure and economic weaknesses. The process of Great Britain’s withdrawal and concern about the stability of the eurozone mean that the EU is very much preoccupied with its own affairs. The signs of polarisation between north and south, west and east, the centre and the periphery are clearly visible. In the face of increasing pressure from Russia, European security continues to depend primar- ily on the political will and military capabilities of the United States and NATO. Meanwhile, the proposals to establish a European army which were put forward in November 2018 by President Macron of France and Chancellor Merkel of Germany remain vague. Most importantly, they express doubts about the American willing- ness to defend Europe and have accordingly been welcomed by President Putin of Russia as a contribution to the construction of a multipolar world. However, since the attacks on eastern Ukraine and the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, the USA has actually been strengthening its military capabilities in Europe. In Novem- ber 2018, NATO used its large-scale exercise Trident Juncture to test amongst other things the operational readiness of its rapid reaction force. It demonstrated with this military exercise, the largest since 2002, and the involvement of 50,000 participants its defensive readiness and capabilities to Russia. Against the background of internal difficulties in European institutions, the adverse impact on Switzerland’s security of the growing power-political rivalry between the USA, Russia and China is becoming more and more evident – in par- ticular through an increase in intelligence activities. The USA is seeing its military dominance come under increasing pressure from the expanding capabilities of the Russian and Chinese armed forces. Its main challenger in the global competition for controlling influence is China, with its large and rapidly growing economic potential. S T R AT E G I C E N V I R O N M E N T S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S 21 Russia: impress and intimidate For nearly two decades, Russia has been steadily growing in strength and con- fidence in domestic as well as foreign affairs. Putin’s re-election as President created the conditions for the Kremlin to continue to adhere to its determined foreign-policy strategy of restoring Russia’s role as a major power on the inter- national stage. Russia’s increased confidence is based chiefly on its regained military strength and its tightly organized power apparatus under President Putin. In September 2018, the large-scale military exercise Vostok 2018 took place in the Eastern Military Dis- trict. Troops from the Central Military District and the Northern Fleet took part, as did token contingents from China and Mongolia. According to official figures, it was the largest manoeuvre since 1981, with 300,000 participants. One of the objectives of the exercise was to move troops over long distances. With its annual large-scale exercises in one of its four military districts, Russia is displaying in an effective way, both at home and abroad, the modernisation and restructuring of its armed forces and At the end of 2018, Russia successfully tested a hypersonic weapons system. Avangard will form an important pillar of Russia’s nuclear deterrence; China and the USA are striving to make up lost ground in the area of hypersonic technology. The operational availability of such weapons systems is likely to have an adverse impact on the stability of the global security situation. S T R AT E G I C E N V I R O N M E N T S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S22 the military strength it has regained. Its armed forces are also continuously gaining valuable experience, most notably through the successful deployment of the air force in Syria. On 4 March 2018, a former Russian double agent and his daughter were poisoned with a military nerve agent in Salisbury, in the UK. By a stroke of luck, both sur- vived the attack. However, one person not directly involved in the attack died after coming into contact with the toxic substance. It is now considered highly likely that the perpetrators were Russian. The Russian regime was sending out a signal that the West and traitors in its own ranks should be afraid. The subsequent Rus- sian disinformation campaign followed the pattern of similar influence operations, intended to sow the seeds of conflict between EU members, to adversely influence Europe’s relations with the USA and to generally spread uncertainty, fear and mis- trust. However, the West’s response to the attempted assassination was probably far stronger and more united than Russia had expected. By the end of March 2018, 29 Western states had expelled around 150 Russians, most of whom had an intel- ligence background. This blatant assassination attempt and the subsequent denial of responsibility for the crime have led in the West to a further loss of trust in the Russian leadership. USA: focus on global strategic competition President Donald Trump and his administration see the strategic environment as one in which the security, prosperity and global interests of the USA are being threatened by a number of state actors. The National Security Strategy published in December 2017 sees one of the main challenges facing the USA as being the intensified strategic competition with the ʻrevisionist powersʼ Russia and China. The USA initially responded to this with measures to strengthen its armed forces. A significant increase in defence spending is intended to remedy deficits in the operational readiness and to finance certain reinforcements and extensive mod- ernisation programmes. In order to improve its deterrence and defence capabili- ties against Russia, the USA is also increasing its military capabilities in Europe. These actual measures are in marked contrast to the President’s remarks sharply criticising NATO and raising doubts about his transatlantic commitment. However, the USA continues to call forcefully for substantial increases in European contri- butions to common defence. Moreover, it is no longer prepared to accept Russian violations of the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty) and on 2 February 2019 gave notice that it was terminating the Treaty. In 1987, the USA S T R AT E G I C E N V I R O N M E N T S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S 23 and the Soviet Union entered into a commitment under the INF Treaty to disman- tle their land-based ballistic guided missiles and medium-range cruise missiles. Also in the FIS’s assessment, Russia today possesses a substantial number of land- based cruise missiles with a range banned by the INF Treaty. The USA relies heavily on the use of economic pressure to assert its national interests. Sanctions remain a key element of US foreign policy, and the USA uses not least secondary measures with impact outside its territory. An example of this is its policy towards Iran. The threat of exclusion from the US market and from the USA’s globally dominant financial system leaves large companies operating internationally, in particular, with practically no choice other than to withdraw from doing business with Iran. President Trump has set himself the goal of correcting the massive imbalances in foreign trade, which he sees in the first instance as being due to unfair trade with China but also with other key trading partners. He intends to counter these imbalances primarily by threatening to impose or actually imposing tariffs. This is intended at the same time to protect US industry and to increase pressure on the USA’s trading partners to open up markets further and to improve intellectual prop- erty protection. China: The long economic march is nearing its goal In 1978, under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, China began to open up its econ- omy and embarked on the long march to the forefront of the global economy. The ʻMade in China 2025ʼ programme, adopted in 2015, together with other programmes is designed to transform China into the leading technological power in just a few years. To this end, the country is systematically promoting its own key industries by methods including espionage and forced technology transfer. Disproportion- ately high hurdles are placed in the path of foreign investors; the Communist Party remains closely linked to private companies. At the same time, strategically impor- tant investments are financed with generous loans from state banks. For example, since 2013 China has invested hundreds of billions of dollars in dozens of states in its new Silk Road Initiative, thereby securing numerous opportunities to exert eco- nomic, financial, political and cultural influence far beyond the boundaries of Asia. Militarily, too, China continues to work consistently and in a target oriented manner on expanding its capabilities. The Chinese development model of high growth rates under the control of an authoritarian and anti-liberal political system meets with admiration in Asia and Africa, in particular. S T R AT E G I C E N V I R O N M E N T S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S24 However, the rise of China is increasingly meeting resistance. In June 2018, by imposing tariffs on imports from China, the USA started a trade conflict, the out- come of which is still unclear and which might turn out to be extremely costly for the USA and the global economy. Xi Jinping’s Chinese dream of the resurgence of the former world power is seen by a broad political spectrum in the USA as a nightmare for the liberal Western world, geared as it is toward market economics, democracy and human rights. US Vice President Pence articulated this in a strongly worded speech on China at the Hudson Institute in Washington on 4 October 2018. He accused China of using unfair and illegal measures to strengthen the Chinese economy and above all of striving for military power. He said that China was aiming to drive the USA out of the Western Pacific and thereby also seeking to prevent the USA from providing military support to its allies. He said that the Chinese leader- ship was also systematically suppressing the freedom of expression of its citizens and was attempting to exert massive pressure, even in the USA, in order to influence media reporting on China and the film industry’s image of China. S T R AT E G I C E N V I R O N M E N T S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S 25 Iran: standing alone against its arch-enemies, the USA, Israel and Saudi Arabia Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, ritualized death wishes to the USA and Israel have been chanted at religious events and state-organized demonstrations. Enmity toward Israel and the USA, both of which supported the Shah of Per- sia against the revolutionaries, and toward the Wahhabi kingdom of Saudi Arabia is at the ideological core of the regime. Obama, at the time acting President of the USA, and the Western allies hoped that the conclusion of the nuclear treaty (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA) and the associated reintegration of Iran into the global economy, aside from the remaining restrictions on Iran in the nuclear sector, would lead to the gradual liberalisation of the Iranian regime from the inside and the discontinuation of its radically anti-Israeli, anti-American and anti-Saudi policies. The Trump administration obviously does not share this hope. In May 2018, President Trump announced the USA’s withdrawal from the JCPOA. By reintro- ducing sanctions against Iran that had been lifted or suspended, the USA is aiming Iran’s influence in the region S T R AT E G I C E N V I R O N M E N T S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S26 not only at massively reducing Iranian oil exports and thus its most important foreign exchange earner, but also as far as possible at isolating Iran economically, with secondary economic sanctions, which also work against third countries and foreign companies, playing a major role. In this way, the USA wants to tighten and extend indefinitely the existing restrictions on Iran’s nuclear programme, as well as putting a stop to its ballistic missile programme and its regional expansion of its power. The US views the JCPOA as a political agreement and not a legally binding treaty. However, in the view of the other states involved and in particular Iran, the US action constitutes a breach of the treaty. The EU has attempted, so far largely in vain, to continue facilitating trade with Iran. This shows once more clearly the severely limited scope for economic and political action vis-à-vis the USA. The initial effect of US sanction provisions has been to cut Iranian crude oil exports by at least half, to approximately one million barrels a day. This, together with further measures and in particular the de facto exclusion of Iran from interna- tional payment transactions, will hit Iran hard economically. The external value of the Iranian currency dropped by more than 70 per cent between March and Decem- ber 2018. The inflation rate already stands at around 30 per cent and is still rising. The International Monetary Fund is forecasting a fall in Iran’s economic output of around 3.6 per cent for 2019. Syria and Libya: crises persist The Syrian regime and its Russian and Iranian allies have strategically defeated the rebels, but have not yet secured victory. It still needs to regain control over the entire territory. The Syrian armed forces are understaffed and capable only of limited offensives. They are therefore still reliant on military support from Russia and on the militias financed and led by Iran. Despite massive losses, the ʻIslamic Stateʼ and other jihadist groups remain capable of launching major attacks. Libya still lacks the political and military strength to restore the state’s monopoly on the use of force. The main features of the currently prevailing anarchy are two weak competing centres of power, a multitude of militias, which often engage in criminal activities, and a continuing threat from cells of the local affiliate of the ʻIslamic Stateʼ. Oil production, Libya’s main legal source of foreign exchange, is constantly under threat of disruption. S T R AT E G I C E N V I R O N M E N T S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S 27 Migration: decline of movements to Europe Migration movements do not in themselves constitute a security threat to Switzer- land. Migrants may, however, include isolated individuals who have links to terrorist circles or who have terrorist intentions. Migration can also foster ethnic tensions or violent extremism and influence crime trends. In 2018, the asylum and migration situation in Europe continued to ease com- pared to previous years. A total of approximately 628,000 asylum applications were submitted in the EU in 2018, down from over a million in 2015. The asylum sit- uation in Switzerland is mainly dictated by migration movements on the central Mediterranean route to Italy. This route was used by around 23,000 people in 2018, significantly fewer than in previous years. This decline is not least a consequence of the Italian government’s tough policy on migration and the increased effectiveness of the Libyan coastguard. The migrants on the central Mediterranean route came mainly from Tunisia, Eritrea, Iraq, Sudan and Pakistan, and the majority entered via Libya, with around a quarter coming via Tunisia. In 2018, the western route from Morocco to Spain by sea and by land became the main route, travelled by S T R AT E G I C E N V I R O N M E N T S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S28 around 65,000 mainly French-speaking people from Morocco, Guinea, Mali, Côte d’Ivoire, Algeria and other states. Thus far, Switzerland has scarcely been affected by migration via this route. The eastern Mediterranean route saw an increase on last year, with around 48,000 people following it. Most of the migrants came from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkey and the Congo and reached Europe by sea and by land via Turkey. S T R AT E G I C E N V I R O N M E N T S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S 29 What does the FIS expect? Russia: continuing military threat The pressure exerted by a resurgent Russia, on Eastern Europe in particular, is likely to increase further. The ideological stance of the Russian leadership continues to focus its attention on Ukraine, where a war with periodic fragile ceasefires has been ongoing in the east of the country since 2014. Long-term control of Ukraine is key to the establishment of a Russian zone of influence. Belarus has already been very much reintegrated into Russia's sphere of influence. The Baltic states, too, are under considerable pressure from Russia, which is likely to increase further in the years to come. The US efforts to strengthen NATO militarily are primarily about keeping Russia from undertaking military actions against NATO allies in Europe. Russia wants to be perceived as a resurgent superpower on an equal footing with the USA. However, existing restrictions on the military capacity of its air and naval forces, in particular, will remain in place for some time to come, partly because of Russia's limited economic strength. In future, Russia will therefore make greater use of a wide range of methods from the field of influence operations. These range from grey-area activities, such as information campaigns, manipulation and propaganda, to overt political, military and economic pressure. The practices of extortion and, in certain cases, committing violent actions are likely to continue. S T R AT E G I C E N V I R O N M E N T S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S30 USA: continuation of national power politics The strategic rivalry between the USA and China will remain a decisive factor in global politics. In the years to come, the USA will make substantial efforts to assert its military capability in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China’s growing potential. How far the USA will go in the economic conflict with China is currently an open question. President Trump may content himself, at least for the time being, with Chinese concessions to correct the imbalance in bilateral trade. However, there are voices in the administration calling for a more ambitious strategy for curbing China, wanting to also severely restrict the strategic rival’s access to the American market and to American technology. There is currently no sign of an imminent thaw in frosty US-Russian relations. President Trump has repeatedly made it clear that he wants to accommodate Russia in order to improve the tense relationship. However, he is encountering widespread opposition to this in US institutions, particularly in Congress, where the majority favour a hard line and continued pressure through sanctions on Russia. The Presi- dent’s room for manoeuvre has so far in his Presidency also been limited by ongoing investigations and continuing speculation about problematic links with the Kremlin. In contrast to his administration’s national security strategy, President Trump’s stance toward the USA’s alliances is one of marked disregard, and he clearly shows his willingness for the USA to go it alone as a nation. This has manifested itself particularly problematically in the withdrawal from the nuclear deal with Iran and the resulting breach of a multilateral agreement without regard to the position of the European allies. It can be assumed that the President’s aversion to restrictions on US sovereignty by multilateral mechanisms will remain a defining feature of his foreign policy. Donald Trump would like, if possible, to disengage the USA from costly opera- tions in the Islamic world. He seems to take little account of the question of whether a further reduction in US engagement might promote destabilizing developments in the regions concerned and give other actors the opportunity to gain influence at the USA’s expense. Broadly speaking, the question remains as to how far a withdrawal of the USA from its previous role as a global regulatory power and reliable partner to its allies could be reconciled with a successful strategy in the global competition with other powers. The USA’s strength rests not least on its global network of alli- ances and partnerships, and a policy of self-interest, which does not take this into account, could jeopardize what has so far been a key advantage in the competition with rival states. S T R AT E G I C E N V I R O N M E N T S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S 31 Nuclear arms control: ongoing blockade The nuclear arms control process between the USA and Russia has stalled since the signing in 2010 of the ̒ New STARTʼ treaty to limit strategic nuclear forces. From the Russian point of view, possible advances in missile defence and the increasing importance of conventional precision weapons are among the arguments against fur- ther nuclear disarmament. Arms control sceptics in the USA point in particular to Russia’s violations of the INF Treaty and the fundamental doubts these raise about Russian compliance with the treaty. Nonetheless, the ʻNew STARTʼ treaty’s limits are being observed by both sides, and the treaty, with its detailed verification regime, also provides effective means for monitoring. New START will expire in February 2021, but provides for the possibility of an extension for another five years without renewed ratification. While Russia’s President Putin has declared his readiness to extend the treaty, the USA has not yet made its decision. China: practically unstoppable progress China will continue to do everything in its power to grow in economic and mil- itary terms. The USA under President Trump, however, no longer wants to stand idly by watching China’s seemingly unstoppable rise to becoming an anti-liberal superpower. The USA’s opposition means that President Xi Jinping is now at a political crossroads: should China align itself with the rules of the international market economy, even domestically, or continue to stake everything on economic, political and military dominance? China is capable of adapting pragmatically to new frame conditions and making tactical concessions. It will try to prevent the formation of an anti-Chinese block. However, a fundamental departure from its current course of authoritarian rule internally and pursuit of dominance externally is very unlikely. Iran: no capitulation to the USA The fundamental change in Iran’s attitude sought by the USA will not take place. The Iranian leadership will try to wait out Trump’s presidency with strategic patience. Iran will initially continue to observe the treaty provisions of the nuclear deal, which in 2016 put an end to its extensive international political isolation. However, it will continue to support anti-Israeli forces in the region, albeit with a significantly reduced financial input. Furthermore, Iran will not renounce its ballistic missile programme, thanks to which it already possesses accurate short-range missiles. A collapse of the Iranian regime remains unlikely despite repeated flare-ups of public protest. Influence in Syria of regional powers and superpowers S T R AT E G I C E N V I R O N M E N T S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S32 Syria: political football of the regional powers and superpowers and target for Israel It will probably take years for sovereignty over the last areas still controlled by rebels and Kurds in the north of Syria to be fully regained. The main obstacle is Turkey, which insists on a zone of influence controlled by Turkish security forces in Syrian territory for defence against the Kurdish Workers’ Party (PKK). Israel sees itself threatened by the military presence in Syria of Iran and its ally the Lebanese Hezbollah, and remains determined to use air strikes against Iranian military instal- lations. It remains to be seen how Russia will respond in future with its ground-based air defences in Syria. There is a considerable risk of escalation. Israel must bear in mind that it is Russia’s priority to stabilise the Syrian regime.

Despite the strengthened measures taken by Libya and Italy to this end, Libya will remain the main departure point for crossings to Italy. Crossings from Tuni- sia are expected to increase. The migration agreement between the EU and Turkey applies only to migration by sea, not via the land border, where irregular border crossings increased in 2018 and are likely to persist in 2019. The battles being waged at the time of going to press around the capital Tripoli are unlikely to immediately lead to the reestablishment of the monopoly on the use of force, even if one side were to secure a military victory. Migration pressure on the western Mediterranean route to Spain will probably persist or even increase. Due to the continuing jihadist threat, the possibility remains that terrorists or individuals with terrorist motives will enter Europe in the flow of migrants. Thorough monitoring of migrants and of asylum documents is therefore still necessary.

It stems mainly from jihadist actors, first and foremost supporters of the ʻIslamic Stateʼ. The threat from ethno-nationalist terrorism in Europe and Switzerland continues. Threat from supporters of jihadism Although the ʻIslamic Stateʼ’s caliphate has been militarily defeated, networks and cells of the ʻIslamic Stateʼ and its supporters and sympathisers, operating covertly, continue to shape the terrorist threat in Europe. However, the capability of the ʻIslamic Stateʼ itself to plan, direct and carry out attacks in Europe, such as the ones that took place in Paris in November 2015, is now limited. It is able to carry out attacks primarily in locations where it has a physical presence – be it in its core territory in Syria and Iraq or in one of the main areas of opera- tion of one of its affiliates. Nonetheless, its supporters and sympathisers remain independently capable of undertaking terrorist activities in Europe or inspiring others to do so. The ʻIslamic Stateʼ’s propaganda remains a continuing source of inspiration in this regard. Its anti-Western and anti-democratic jihadist ideology is still popular. Switzerland has so far remained untouched by jihad-motivated acts of violence. However, the FIS has observed that the ideology of the ʻIslamic Stateʼ and al-Qaeda, which legitimises the use of violence, continues to resonate with radicalised or receptive individuals in Switzerland, especially adolescents and young adults. Fewer jihad-motivated attacks in Europe The frequency of terrorist attacks in Europe has decreased significantly. Since autumn 2017, seven acts of violence linked to jihadism have been identified, four of which the ʻIslamic Stateʼ claimed responsibility for. However, claims of responsi- bility by the ʻIslamic Stateʼ no longer have the impact they once had. It is also often difficult to assess whether an attack has actually been carried out for jihadist reasons. While the major attacks in Paris in November 2015 and Brussels in March 2016 were complex attacks ordered by the ʻIslamic Stateʼ, the tendency since then has been towards simpler attacks by inspired lone actors. However, we should not let this trend hide the fact that the security authorities of various European states have prevented numerous attacks and have uncovered planned attacks since autumn 2017. For example, a bomb attack involving the What does the FIS see?

Al-Qaeda remains in the shadow of the ‘Islamic State’ The dismantlement of the caliphate provided core al-Qaeda, under the leadership of Ayman al-Zawahiri, the opportunity to regain its influence and its leadership role in the global jihadist movement. To date, however, core al-Qaeda has failed to do so – neither through spectacular attacks nor through effective propaganda. Calls and efforts to unite the various jihadist groups have likewise remained unsuccessful so far.

It still intends to carry out attacks on Western targets. Some of its regional affiliates, for example al-Shabaab in Somalia and al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, have stronger operational capabilities and will be able to maintain their influence in their respec- tive main areas of operation. Assessment-changing elements are worth mentioning regarding two groups within the al-Qaeda movement. Hurras al-Din (Guardians of the Religion) presents a growing threat. This jihadist group, based in Idlib province in Syria, is a spin-off of the al-Qaeda-linked Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS, Organisation for the Liberation of the Levant). While the HTS has pursued an increasingly local, i.e. ʻSyrianʼ, agenda in the last few years, Hurras al-Din represents al-Qaeda’s global jihadist agenda. It therefore also aims to attack Western interests. Currently, however, it lacks the necessary resources. The future threat emanating from HTS and Hurras al-Din will depend significantly on the developments of the military situation on the ground. The threat from al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has diminished. It has suffered numerous losses over the last one and a half years. Targeted air attacks and various ground operations have severely reduced its capacity and capabilities. AQAP is still keen to attack Western targets, but no longer really has the necessary capabilities and access to do so. In particular, it no longer has the same degree of bomb-making expertise it had at the time of its spectacular attempted attacks against Western targets in 2009 and 2010. This has led to a reduction in the threat to civil aviation from AQAP.

Western interests locally, however, remain legitimate targets for most of these groups. For example, a Swiss woman abducted in the Sahel region in Mali in January 2016 was still being held hostage by an al-Qaeda affiliate at the time of going to press. Furthermore, the ʻIs- lamic Stateʼ claimed responsibility for the attack on a group of Western cyclists in Tajikistan at the end of July 2018, in which a Swiss man was among those killed and a Swiss woman was among those injured. Switzerland is not an island Switzerland is affected by developments in neighbouring countries: Islamic and jihadist movements are more likely to stop at language barriers than at national borders. Accordingly, Switzerland’s language regions are much influenced by movements in neighbouring countries where the same language is spoken. Salafist organisations and adherents have come under pressure from the authorities in a num- ber of European states in recent years. For example, the Koran distribution campaign ʻRead!ʼ, whose initiators come from Germany, is banned in some countries and has been severely pushed back in Switzerland. In 2018, Switzerland saw only isolated Koran distribution campaigns. Influences from abroad can also be detected among imams and preachers, who may contribute to the radicalisation of individuals in Switzerland. Like other states, Switzerland has imposed entry bans or other measures under laws on foreign nation- als on numerous preachers, who glorify or legitimise violence. Jihadist radicalisation in Europe and Switzerland The success story of the ʻIslamic Stateʼ in 2014 and 2015 triggered a significant increase in cases of radicalisation – in Switzerland as well as abroad. The experi- ence of recent years has shown that particularly adolescents and young adults were susceptible to radicalization in Switzerland. In individual cases, this may lead to a willingness to use violence and thus present a threat to Switzerland. Although religious fundamentalism is often a contributing factor, in Switzerland it seldom appears to be the sole cause of processes of violent radicalisation. In recent years, the FIS has observed that these can often be traced back to disruptive events in an individual’s life, personal crises, the perception of being disadvantaged or mar- J I H A D I S T A N D E T H N O - N AT I O N A L I S T T E R R O R I S M S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S 41 ginalised (with a corresponding fixation on having been a victim), polarising events (with a corresponding creation of a concept of the enemy), feelings of disorientation and hopelessness or psychological problems. Radicalisation in prisons and the release of radicalised prisoners The FIS has been observing an increase in cases of radicalisation of prisoners for a number of years. Although the phenomenon in Switzerland is not comparable in numerical terms with the worrying situation in other countries such as France, the FIS has for some time been working to raise awareness of this issue among penal institutions. The treatment of released prisoners poses a challenge to both Europe and Switzer- land. European prisons are holding hundreds of jihadists and people, who have been radicalised during their time in prison. They will be released in the coming months and years. Despite rehabilitation as required under criminal law, they could still, or more than ever, be influenced by jihadist thinking. Switzerland, too, is faced with individual cases of radicalised released prisoners.

Since 2016, number of depatures have plummeted. The corresponding statistics from other European states show a similar picture. The FIS has not detected any individuals travelling to or returning from the conflict area in Syria and Iraq since August 2016. However, one individual travelled to the Philippines in 2017 and was arrested there at the beginning of 2018. Jihadists in migration movements The European security authorities began paying increased attention to migration movements when it became known in 2015 and 2016 that in isolated cases attackers had made their way to Europe disguised as refugees. Newly arrived asylum seekers concerning whom there is evidence of involvement in terrorist activities or of links to terrorist networks are the exception rather than the rule. The migration-related counterterrorism cases handled by the FIS since then have generally involved indi- viduals who have or had already been in Switzerland for some time. Ethno-nationalist terrorism The threat emanating from ethno-nationalist terrorism is estimated to be lower. This is because in recent years, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) has shown itself to be largely nonviolent in Europe and in particularly in Switzerland; there have been isolated cases of rioting, for example at rallies. Violent clashes between PKK supporters and Turkish nationalists and/or supporters of Turkish President Erdogan currently pose the main threat in Switzerland. Confrontations are generally the result of direct provocation. The PKK receives at times support from Turkish and Swiss left-wing extremist groups. In spring 2018, increased PKK activism was recorded across Europe. This was due to the Turkish military interventions in Syria and Iraq. There were no violent riots in Switzerland.

The ʻIslamic Stateʼ and its supporters and sympathisers will remain the key actors. The ʻIslamic Stateʼ will also remain the most influential resistance group among Arab Sunnis in eastern Syria and central Iraq beyond 2018. It does not appear that any other group will be able to take over its leadership position. Iraq will remain the cradle of the ʻIslamic Stateʼ. The soil on which Sunni jihadist ideology thrived will continue to remain fertile. In this environment, the ʻIslamic Stateʼ will continue to be able to rely on a broad network of supporters and sympathisers from which it can continuously recruit new fighters. Jihadism will remain a threat to Europe Irrespective of the current state of individual groups, jihadist ideology is still pop- ular; the utopia of a global caliphate, the legitimisation of the use of violence in order to bring about such a caliphate and the associated glorification of martyrdom live on in many minds. Sympathisers and supporters of the jihadist movement will continue What does the FIS expect?

A few of them will in future also allow themselves to be inspired to provide specific support or even to carry out attacks. Trend toward jihadist radicalisation in Europe The trend of jihadist-oriented radicalisation in Europe, particularly among adoles- cents, will continue. It is unlikely that the reinforced official measures, which have also in Switzerland been adopted in recent years as part of counterterrorism, will be relaxed in the future. However, these measures might be seen by affected individuals as discrimination, thereby reinforcing their perception of themselves as victims and contributing to their radicalisation. Challenges posed by potential jihad returnees Switzerland has for some time been confronted with the issue of individual cases of returning jihadists travellers. It is possible that future returnees will include Swiss citizens or persons with links to Switzerland, who pose a specific threat to Switzerland’s security. It must be assumed that some men and women, who wish to return will bring minors with them. Dealing with traumatised children will pose a particular challenge to the authorities responsible. The question of repatriating jihadist travellers arrested in the conflict area, at least those willing to return, will continue to preoccupy the authorities. Dealing with non-state actors with whom Switzerland has no formal contacts will pose a particular challenge. Migration issues and counter-terrorism Over the next few years, Europe and Switzerland will continue to face challenges due to migration issues despite increasingly restrictive migration policies. Future asy- lum seekers may include individuals who have been engaged in jihadists activities. Even after fleeing to Europe, some of them might maintain their jihadist ideological convictions and accordingly be motivated to convene with like-minded people, to form cells and networks or even to carry out attacks. Furthermore, after their arrival individual asylum seekers may, as a result of disorientation and dissatisfying future prospects, become violently radicalised or become receptive to jihadist ideas.

Released prisoners who are Swiss or who for a variety of reasons cannot be returned to their home country will present a particular challenge. Moreover, jihad veterans and released prisoners with a valid residence document can move freely in the Schengen area. New means of terror Jihadist militias in Syria and Iraq have employed drones as well as chemical agents; both methods are often recommended in their propaganda. Uncovered plans for attacks using hydrogen sulphide in 2017 in Australia and for attacks using toxins in 2018 in Germany and Italy highlight the fact that attacks employing chemical or biological agents are a realistic scenario; attacks using radioactive material are less likely. Attacks using explosives, drones, simple chemicals such as toxic gases or other poisonous substances require relatively little outlay and resources. Instructions for their manufacture and use are easy to find. In addition, new technologies such as Jihad-motivated travellers J I H A D I S T A N D E T H N O - N AT I O N A L I S T T E R R O R I S M S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S46 3D printing have opened up new opportunities for terrorists to circumvent security arrangements at airports and other protected locations. Although terrorist groups have repeatedly expressed their intentions to use cyberterrorism, they seem to lack the necessary capabilities to cause major damage. Switzerland as a possible target for attacks From the jihadist point of view, Switzerland is part of the Western world classified as Islamophobic and thus constitutes a legitimate, albeit not a priority target. Swit- zerland and its interests have so far rarely featured in jihadist propaganda. There are no signs of any foreign or domestic policy developments in the coming months, which might make Switzerland a priority target for jihadist actors. However, polar- ising events, such as a high-profile initiative with Islamophobic elements, could rap- idly make Switzerland the focus of jihadist propaganda. Attacks on Swiss territory could also target the interests of states perceived by jihadists to be Islamophobic or of states, which play a prominent international role in combating jihadism. Jewish interests could also be affected. Jihadist threat to Switzerland remains elevated In view of the developments described above, the terrorist threat to Switzerland remains elevated. Attacks are still to be expected. The target location and the modus operandi selected for attacks will often depend on opportunity and/or accessibil- ity, i.e. on the personal background, interests and contacts of the persons involved. Inspired lone actors and small groups often act spontaneously, without any instruc- tions or financial support from outside. Since from the point of view of the ʻIslamic Stateʼ and al-Qaeda no courses of action are excluded, the nature of the jihadist threat will continue to be wide-ranging. Attacks on soft targets such as transport infrastructure or gatherings of people, involving little logistical outlay and exe- cuted by jihad-inspired lone actors or small groups, remain the most likely threat to Switzerland. Threat from ethno-nationalist groups remains It can be assumed that the PKK will maintain its structures and will continue to be able to mobilise large numbers of supporters rapidly when required. Although the PKK is generally willing to resort to violence, the leadership has so far prohibited the use of violence by its members in the West. However, the ban might be lifted in the event of Öcalan’s death or if Turkey or European states were to take extraor- J I H A D I S T A N D E T H N O - N AT I O N A L I S T T E R R O R I S M S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S 47 dinary measures against the PKK or against Kurdish interests in general, or in the event of credible rumours to this effect.

Despite having regressed to being a traditional terrorist organisation operating underground, at the end of 2018 the ‘Islamic State’ in Syria was still holding individ- ual settlements in the middle Euphrates valley, not far from the Iraqi border. The last of its territories were lost in the first few months of 2019. Many of the remain- ing foreign fighters and jihadist travellers are located in this area. There are still ‘Islamic State’ fighters and supporters active on Syrian and Iraqi territory. Despite numerous losses and fighters being captured or fleeing, numbers have stabilised since the end of 2017 due to local recruitment. Syrians and especially Iraqis are increasingly taking up leadership positions again. The ‘Islamic State’ operates in clandestine decentralised cells in towns and vil- lages, but mobile groups also hide out in desert areas, which are hard to control. Over the last few years, large numbers of leaders and fighters have gone under- ground in Syria and Iraq or for example in Turkey. Terrorist attacks are still being J I H A D I S T A N D E T H N O - N AT I O N A L I S T T E R R O R I S M S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S 49 carried out in Syria and Iraq. The ‘Islamic State’ continues to be able to draw on cash reserves; it moreover obtains funds through robbery and the extortion of protec- tion money. The FIS looks at the ‘Islamic State’ as an integral phenomenon. Its transnational jihadist ideology thrives on a breeding ground of resentment, and manifestations of this ideology are flourishing to varying degrees within the jihadist movement. State/Caliphate | At the end of 2018, after approximately three and a half years, the ‘Islamic State’’s caliphate was defeated. Its strategic goal, the creation of a global caliphate, remains unchanged. The ‘Islamic State’ still wants to be a state in the literal sense of the word. Armed group | With the break-up of its state-like structures, the military units which previously operated openly have been destroyed or driven underground. Nonetheless, the ‘Islamic State’ uses guerrilla tactics to carry out frequent attacks on security forces in Syria and above all in Iraq. Regional power | With the dismantlement of the caliphate at the end of 2017, the ‘Islamic State’ lost its status as a regional power. It is now no longer a power with the ability to threaten states, but remains a security problem at the regional level. Terrorist actor | The ‘Islamic State’ has never abandoned its policy of systemat- ically spreading fear and terror: terror remains its primary method. The ‘Islamic State’ and the supporters inspired by it carry out terrorist activities almost all around the globe. The ‘Islamic State’ also claims responsibility for attacks, which it did not carry out itself. Utopia | The utopia of an Islamic world state, the caliphate, in which Muslims can live according to Islamic law, is not a new idea. However, the ‘Islamic State’ has succeeded in revitalising this utopia and giving it a new form. In its early days, it was able to attract mass support and to establish, finance, defend and adminis- ter a rudimentary state structure. Furthermore, outside Syria and Iraq, numerous jihadist organisations pledged allegiance to the ‘Islamic State’, thereby extending its influence and power. Unlike al-Qaeda, the ‘Islamic State’ temporarily realised the utopia in a rudimentary form.

There has been a significant decline in the quality and quantity of its mul- tilingual propaganda products. Nonetheless, the ‘Islamic State’, together with the movement inspired by it, still manages to reach people worldwide and induce them act in coherence with its ideology Affiliates | The ‘Islamic State’ still has influence in numerous conflict zones world- wide, although its affiliates for the most part pursue a local agenda and often have nothing in common but the logo or brand. The dismantlement of the caliphate has not so far had a negative impact on the affiliates. They operate in their regions independently of developments in Syria and Iraq. The ‘Islamic State’ movement | The ‘Islamic State’ as a whole is part of the jihad- ist movement; this consists of numerous individuals, cells, networks and groups worldwide. These each fight autonomously for their own causes under the banner of the ‘Islamic State’. As with all movements, what is relevant is not just the active members of the individual groups, but also the numerous supporters and sympa- thisers worldwide, who are active to a greater or lesser degree. Besides the openly available propaganda on the internet, they communicate across borders in closed online forums and via encrypted communication apps.

This represents more than a three-fold increase in the case of right-wing extremism and an increase of 13 per cent in the case of left-wing extremism. The FIS is not aware of any acts of violence motivated by right-wing extremism, and the propor- tion of incidents related to left-wing extremism at which acts of violence occurred fell from half to just over a third. The scale of intensity of left-wing extremist vio- lence ranges up to and including arson attacks. Causing injury to or endangering the lives of in particular members of the security forces but also members of other emergency services during confrontations (e.g. at demonstrations) is not only an acceptable possible outcome but is in isolated cases clearly the aim. The potential for violence in both extremist circles remains unchanged; when and how it will manifest itself can in certain contexts be estimated based on experience, but can rarely be predicted in advance in a specific individual case. Both right-wing and left-wing extremist circles have contacts abroad. In the case of left-wing extrem- Events motivated by left- or right-wing extremism reported to the FIS since 2012 (excluding graffiti) What does the FIS see?

For example, in October 2018 an arson attack was carried out in Berlin for which Federazione Anarchica Informale / Fronte Rivoluzionario Internazionale claimed responsibility. The group’s statement referred to an arson attack in Thun BE and the campaign against the expansion of the Bässlergut prison in Basel. It closed with a call for solidarity with 18 left-wing extremists simultaneously standing trial in Basel. In violent clashes between left- wing extremists and security forces, the involvement of football hooligans may be a factor contributing to increased aggression, particularly in Zurich. Violent right-wing extremism In 2018, the FIS noted a significantly higher number of incidents connected with right-wing extremism. The Swiss right-wing extremist scene is experiencing an awakening. Whether it is also moving toward the use of violence remains unclear for the time being; in 2018, at least, no acts of violence were recorded. Several right-wing extremist groups now have open websites. One of these groups has even opened its own premises in Vaud. Regular podium discussions and themed events, which are also open to the general public, are held. These groups obviously think they have a good chance of winning wider approval for their ideas and actions. Some of these actions, such as patrols to protect the local population, feature more in their propaganda than in reality. The impact of public appearances is assessed in advance. And right-wing extremists continue to behave conspiratorially, especially when planning actions. There is good reason for this. For example, an event organ- iser in Valais had to cancel a concert by a band regarded as right-wing extremist, due to public reaction. No concerts by right-wing extremist bands were recorded in Switzerland in 2018. However, right-wing extremists attend events such as concerts all over Europe. This has long been the case. Members of the right-wing extremist scene overall continue to have large quantities of functioning weapons at their disposal. Furthermore, they practise the use of firearms and train in martial arts. Violent left-wing extremism On the one hand, the activities of left-wing extremists remain dependent on day- to-day developments and tied to events, which they cannot induce themselves. On the other hand, however, they are capable of combining their activities into cam- paigns and taking targeted action.

In both cases, security pre- cautions are taken against actions motivated by left-wing extremism. For example, on Labour Day in 2018 the police in Zurich foiled plans for a violent follow-up demonstration against air attacks by Turkey on Kurdish areas in Syria. The demon- strations against the WEF in 2019 passed largely peacefully and with no damage to property. Other actions, of which there were only a few, included the blowing up of the post-box of the Brazilian Consulate General in Zurich. In addition, a wide variety of different circumstances may trigger demonstrations or property damage by left-wing extremists. Their aggressive stance towards right-wing extremists remains unchanged. For example, in November 2018 left-wing extremists in Basel largely thwarted an authorised demonstration by the Swiss Nationalist Party, where right-wing extrem- ists prepared to use violence were among the participants. In their counter-demon- stration, the left-wing extremists assaulted the demonstrators physically. They also used violence against the police. Arson attack as part of the anti-repression campaign.

Depending on the day to day events, the situation in the areas autonomously administered by the Kurds (ʻRojavaʼ) in Syria, a country riven by civil war, continues to preoccupy left-wing extremists. For example, the majority of the activities in spring 2018 were linked to the Turkish military offensive in Afrin, part of Rojava; in response to this, arson attacks were carried out in January and April 2018 on the Turkish Consulate in Zurich and in May on the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs in Bern. In January 2018, the latter was also the target of an attempted IED attack, which was linked to the WEF. Altogether, over a dozen arson attacks were recorded in 2018. Eight of them tar- geted vehicles belonging to companies having dealings with the Bässlergut prison, and in one case the target was the ʻmachinery of deportationʼ. Two coordinated attacks at the end of September, like the sabotage action of June 2016, targeted the Swiss Federal Railways’ rail network.

However, there is currently no sign of the heated atmosphere and high levels of aggression that prevailed at the turn of the year 2017/2018. Especially in the case of the Riding School in Bern, high levels of potential aggression from violent left- wing extremists can be expected if the emergency services are deployed.

This means that the diffi- culties faced by right-wing extremists persist. Anyone recognised as a right-wing extremist or accused of being one or of being linked to events motivated by right- wing extremism will face personal consequences. There are therefore still grounds for their conspiratorial behaviour. Nonetheless, the right-wing extremist scene is currently trying to campaign openly for itself and its beliefs. In doing so, it generally avoids taking action that it is certain will lead to social rejection. For example, it avoids references to National Socialism. Nonetheless, reaction to the right-wing extremist scene is likely to increase as its public presence grows. This pressure will influence the way right-wing extremists behaviour and will probably cause them to withdraw into the shadows once again. Such a scenario might entail violent reactions provoked by frustration. Aside from their filtered public appearances, right-wing extremists will continue to behave con- spiratorially. Right-wing extremists currently have no pressing concerns, let alone a strategy. However, the potential for violence is still present and could manifest itself the moment they perceive a situation arising in the news and thus in society as a trig- ger for action. A significant increase in migration movements to Switzerland or a jihadist attack in this country could provide such a trigger. Right-wing extremists could also react violently to campaigns against them by left-wing extremists, espe- cially the anti-fascist movement, or else target them on their own initiative. Such actions by right-wing extremists are likely to be spontaneous, with little specific preparation. Violent left-wing extremism The violent left-wing extremist scene is not monolithic. This is due not only to the ultimately incompatible ideologies of communism and anarchism or to the wide variety of issues, which do not always succeed in motivating everyone, but also to individual attitudes toward violence. These range from a willingness to approve vio- lence to some extent right up to those who are prepared to use violence themselves to varying degrees, ranging from damaging property to carrying out arson attacks or causing serious injury or death. Depending on the context, left-wing extremist vio- lence is expressed with varying degrees of intensity. Whereas frequent reference to the availability of functioning weapons is made in the context of right-wing extrem- What does the FIS expect?

The potential for violence in left-wing extremist circles remains at a heightened level. The FIS assesses that the following situations and circumstances can lead to the use of violence. ▪ Gatherings of people offer violent left-wing extremists the opportunity to commit violence from under the protection of the crowd. In principle, the potential for aggression against security forces remains particularly high. ▪ Combining issues to form a campaign that transcends current events encourages the use of violence. Such violence is targeted and is sometimes used not only as a symbolic protest or to cause damage, but also for sabotage purposes. ▪ The latter applies in particular to anarchism, which is gaining ground at the expense of communism. Anarchists are more violent in their actions than Marx- ist-Leninist left-wing extremists. They want to damage the ʻsystemʼ as such or more precisely to sabotage it. For many left-wing extremists, the Kurds’ autonomously-administered zones on Syrian soil represent the realisation of their political ideas. Left-wing extremists from all over Europe have been and still are on the ground there. They have stud- ied the conditions, but have also participated directly in the fighting in one form or another, and in some cases are still doing so. They constantly report on their experi- ences in the hope of identifying starting points for applying their own ʻrevolutionary practiceʼ and for altering conditions in their countries of origin. In the light of the way in which the Syrian conflict is playing out, we must expect not only disap- pointment and frustration, which could also erupt violently at demonstrations, but also the arrival of returnees from the war zone. The latter might have acquired new skills, for example in handling weapons and explosives, or they might now be more willing to use violence. It is likely that they will want to use these skills in the fight against the ʻsystemʼ in Europe. However, there are no indications that they intend to attack individuals directly. Their first choice will probably continue to be attacks on symbolic targets in the form of damage to property, with collateral damage being always a possibility.

In 2018, there was a striking increase in the number of incidents linked to animal rights extremism. The motive behind these has recently often been described as ‘antispeciesism’: ‘Speciesism’ describes the systematic favouring of human interests over animal interests; it refers to all forms of exploitation of animals for human purposes, for example for food, clothing or entertainment. Analysis of the recorded incidents puts them into three categories. These are: firstly, actions against hunting – frequently under the banner of the Animal Libera- tion Front (ALF) and particularly in Zurich canton; secondly, damage to property con- nected with the consumption of meat, primarily in western Switzerland; and thirdly, the group 269 Libération animale. A number of other actions complete the picture, but these had frequently been observed in the past and are not specific to 2018. ▪ In 2018, an increased number of hunting high seats were damaged or destroyed, mainly in Zurich canton. This is probably not a coincidence, as it was here that the vote on the hunting initiative took place in September. The recorded dam- age to property is therefore probably a hard-to-define mixture of temporarily increased motivation on the part of the perpetrators, increased willingness to report damage on the part of the victims, and increased awareness on the part of the authorities. In several cases, the unknown perpetrators claimed responsi- bility under the well-known ALF banner. ▪ Numerous acts of damage to property were committed in western Switzerland, principally in the first half of 2018. For example, in just one night at the end of February, attacks were carried out on six companies in Geneva. The attacks were aimed at the meat processing industry, and in many cases the windows of butcher shops were broken. ▪ A group called 269 Libération animale, which has been in existence in vari- ous countries for years and was named after the number of a calf intended for slaughter in Israel, also became active in western Switzerland in 2018. This was probably due to personal links with existing French structures. In Switzerland, the high-profile actions for which the group has claimed responsibility have taken the form of civil disobedience. As far as animal rights extremism is concerned, 2018 showed that an existing movement can recommence violent action even after long years of inactivity. To date, their activities have not by far reached the same sort of criminal energy levels as were seen years ago in the Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty campaign. However, as the example of Zurich shows, the movement is capable of conducting a cam- paign on its own. What is more, the personal and ideological links needed in order to import a violent campaign already exist in Switzerland.

Weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons, are attributes of super- powers, who want to exert influence globally. At the same time, they provide protec- tion against external military intervention. This aspect is, especially for the smaller unofficial nuclear powers, often key as it ensures the survival of the regime. The appeal of weapons of mass destruction remains high, and technological advances are facilitating their acquisition. Switzerland is in demand As a world-renowned high tech and research hub, Switzerland is automatically part of this dynamic. Proliferating states continue to seek out Swiss goods, tech- nology and know-how, which were developed for peaceful purposes, in order to misappropriate them for use in WMD programmes. The Swiss universities con- vey knowledge that could also be used in WMD programmes. Switzerland as an active partner in the fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and as a member of all export control regimes is obliged to implement preven- tive measures also in the academic field. Switzerland is a neutral country, which enjoys a high degree of credibility due to its objective political stance. Switzer- land’s opinion on proliferation issues is therefore important and is the subject of foreign influence operations, as the attempted attack on the Spiez laboratory has already shown. Long-term significance Unlike terrorism, proliferation is not an issue that regularly hits the headlines in the daily news. Its effects are long-term and often not immediately obvious. Unlike terrorism in Europe, it is not a phenomenon which accompanies developments in society; it does, however, accompany and promote strategic rivalry between states seeking to unilaterally shape or change structures within their sphere of influence. The issue is therefore of major long-term importance to Switzerland, as Switzerland favours multilateral consensus and a stable regulatory framework. China’s important role The shift in the balance away from the USA and toward China is particularly marked in the area of civil nuclear technology. China already dominates develop- What does the FIS see? P R O L I F E R AT I O N S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S68 ments in this area. The centre of gravity is thus also shifting with regard to the responsibility for non-proliferation and for preventing the emergence of new nuclear weapon states. Current and future target countries Pakistan is striving to expand its nuclear programme, for which it continues to need know-how from foreign countries including Switzerland. Besides actually pro- ducing fissile material, it is also focussing on procurements, which will help it to acquire the capability to deploy or store nuclear weapons. It will continue to do so. The normalisation of Iranian foreign trade, which began with the nuclear treaty, has been hampered by the USA’s withdrawal from it. In future, Iran will once again increasingly be purchasing goods, which in themselves are legitimate, using mech- anisms that from the commercial point of view appear suspect, as the commercial business channels provided under the JCPOA are not functioning. This will make it more difficult to detect critical transactions. Iran’s continued focus on trade with Asia will reinforce the trend toward the procurement even of European goods e.g. in China. With the end of the war in Syria pending and the reconstruction of the country, an increased number of procurement transactions in this region can be expected. In this context, Lebanon is also likely to feature more prominently as a transit destination for logistical reasons. Ensuring that goods and funds intended for the reconstruction are not misused will be a challenge. The Iranian presence in the region could also lead to procurements benefiting Iranian interests being made via Lebanon and Syria. North Korea will continue to make rarely any direct purchases in Switzerland. However, the indirect purchase of Swiss goods via neighbouring countries will once again be easier thanks to the less stringent implementation of UN sanctions in the East Asia region. P R O L I F E R AT I O N S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S 69 Procurement of goods and know-how Proliferating states’ interest in Switzerland as a centre of innovation will not diminish. The close links that already exist between espionage and proliferation will intensify further. States like Iran and North Korea, which have developed their cyber tools due to conflicts with third states or for other reasons, might follow the Chinese example and use these tools in a more targeted way for economic espionage or to support their WMD programmes. They are interested not just in technology, but also in a company’s network, its sources of supply and its customers. The possession of such information may be crucial in order to be able to appear to a Swiss company as a credible customer or to effect procurements via third parties. The target countries subject of counter-proliferation are unlikely to change. Country programmes The nuclear and missile programmes of India and Pakistan will probably, as in previous years, continuously undergo further development. As regards Pakistan, the question is whether the country will also, like its Indian rival, develop interconti- nental missiles. This would bring Europe within range of another nuclear weapon An electronic measuring instrument that according to certain indications was to be used in Pakistan’s nuclear weapons programme (private photo) What does the FIS expect?

It is anticipated that Iran will remain in the JCPOA for as long as possible and wait for a new administration in Washington. Its nuclear programme will thus continue to be monitored. As far as missiles are concerned, Iran will pursue its efforts to improve the precision of its longer-range missiles. An increase in their range above the limit of 2,000 kilometres allegedly set by revolutionary leader Khamenei for political rea- sons will not be possible in the near term, also for technical reasons. It remains unlikely that North Korea will completely renounce nuclear weapons and delivery systems suitable for deploying them. North Korea will maintain and continue to expand its missile and nuclear weapons programme for many years to come, even while intermittently sending out ostentatious disarmament signals. The country’s existing capacity in the area of biological and chemical weapons is also likely to remain at a high level.

However, shortly before the Hanoi summit on 27/28 February 2019 North Korea began re-erecting the test facility. By the begin- ning of March, it had been rebuilt again (right-hand photo, 13 March 2019, GE1).

Saudi Arabia is planning to establish a very ambitious civil nuclear programme comprising 16 nuclear reactors and the production of its own fuel. If the country implements this and arranges for the required specialist personnel to be trained, the announcement by the Saudi Crown Prince that Saudi Arabia would seek to develop nuclear weapons if Iran were to do so will become technically feasible. P R O L I F E R AT I O N S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S72 The end of the INF: horizontal versus vertical proliferation Proliferation comes in two forms: horizontal and vertical. Horizontal prolifera- tion describes the activities and processes by means of which states without weap- ons of mass destruction or delivery systems seek to come into possession of such weapons and thereby acquire new capabilities. Vertical proliferation, by contrast, denotes the qualitative and quantitative expansion of existing arsenals. There is an interrelationship between the two forms of proliferation. Pakistan remains a horizontal proliferation problem, for example in that it procures calibration instru- ments in Switzerland. These will ultimately be used to arm cruise missiles with nuclear weapons, i.e. to build up a new capability in the air-based section of the nuclear triad. At the same time, Pakistan is using existing know-how to optimise its nuclear weapons and increases their numbers, i.e. is also engaging in vertical proliferation. Horizontal nuclear proliferation is banned globally and can therefore not be the subject of multilateral agreements. Vertical proliferation, on the other hand, is driven primarily by technological development in the recognised nuclear weapon states and is the subject of arms control agreements between individ- ual states. Vertical proliferation among the leading nuclear weapon states is a technology driver and is correspondingly expensive. Disruptive technologies such as precision navigation by means of inertial sensors or GPS, which now- adays any mobile phone is capable of, were originally developed for military purposes. It has always been one of the goals of arms control to limit the use of resources by states for vertical proliferation. There is therefore a high degree of interaction between arms control and the current status of cutting-edge tech- nology and the global spread of such cutting-edge technology at the time a treaty is agreed. The INF Treaty signed in 1987 is a good example of such interaction. It prohib- its the deployment of land-based, but not of air-based or sea-based, unmanned delivery systems with ranges of between 500 and 5,500 kilometres by the armed forces of the USA and the Soviet Union – or nowadays its legal successor. In 1987, the two states had a duopoly as far as the quality and quantity of such systems was concerned, and both states were restricted by the technology of the 1980s to pre- cision navigation systems with an accuracy of around a hundred metres. The term ‘delivery system’ was thus a synonym for ‘nuclear delivery system’, as operations against tactical targets could be carried out successfully only with nuclear weap- ons. In the early 1990s, the USA acquired the capability to attack large point tar- gets such as airfields from distances of hundreds of kilometres successfully using conventionally equipped cruise missiles. By the mid-1990s, it also became possible P R O L I F E R AT I O N S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S 73 to engage smaller point targets such as bunkers. In Russia, this development took place around a decade later. China now has the same – and in some areas even more advanced – capabilities. Technological development and the rise of China have thus led to a situation where an instrument of strategic arms control between two contracting states sud- denly obstructs the development of new core competencies of the conventional armed forces in these – but only in these – contracting states, namely the engage- ment of high-value point targets using conventional standoff weapons. As a tradi- tional naval power with a superior air force, the USA has, thanks to its air-based and sea-based resources, been able to cope with this ‘collateral damage from the past’ more readily than Russia with its powerful land forces. However, it was foreseeable that both states would look, within the framework of their policies, for ways out of this impasse. The consensus on banning horizontal proliferation is under pressure politically – even if only a few countries are openly speaking out against it. Nonetheless, it will probably prevail. Vertical proliferation, on the other hand, is under constant pressure from technological development and new geopolitical realities. Its con- trol mechanisms must therefore be renewed periodically to take account of the current status of cutting-edge technology and its spread around the globe. The end of the INF Treaty thus also holds out the possibility of a global system of arms control that is more appropriate to the times. S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S 75 Illegal intelligence I L L E G A L I N T E L L I G E N C E S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S 77 Motives and aims Espionage is driven by a variety of different motives and has more than one aim. For example, states strive, using information obtained by their intelligence services, to gain a fuller picture of the situation in order to improve the effectiveness of their actions. It can furthermore be observed that information is increasingly being pro- cured with the aim of influencing (in so-called influence operations) or damaging the actions of rivals. Both can be achieved through the selective publication of infor- mation. The aim of such activities is often to weaken the cohesion of international groups or institutions and thereby to restrict their ability to act. In addition, there have recently been several cases in which states used their intelligence services – outside the scope of traditional espionage missions – for attacks on regime oppo- nents or defectors. Methods There are various methods of gathering information covertly: in addition to sifting through and analysing openly available information and the ʻtraditional’ recruitment of human sources and acquisition of information from them, other so-called sensors have gained in importance. The latter have not, however, replaced the conventional methods. Intelligence services continue to rely on a mix of different sensors and are continuously developing these. Espionage operations which have come to light reveal that cyber tools and other communications reconnaissance instruments are being used in parallel and in inter- action with human sources. Depending on the objective, information is also being procured exclusively via cyberspace. The latter has gained in importance insofar as the use of cyber-based information-gathering tools has proven successful for many actors. Cyber espionage is difficult to detect, the perpetrators can hardly be successfully prosecuted, as the purported country of origin does of course not help to elucidate the affair and determination by the means of intelligence of the origins of the cyber-attack (ʻattributionʼ) can simply be denied based on the lack of provability. Switzerland as a target Switzerland is affected by these developments in many ways: Swiss authorities, international organisations based in this country and Swiss companies are themselves the target of reconnaissance activity by intelligence services. So-called third-country meetings, i.e. meetings between members of foreign intelligence services and their What does the FIS see? I L L E G A L I N T E L L I G E N C E S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S78 sources on the territory of a country, which is not the country of origin of neither the case officer nor the source, also take place on Swiss territory. Among the targets of intelligence activities identified by the FIS are Swiss author- ities, the army, the international city of Geneva or, more precisely, diplomats from other states, the arms industry, the technology sector, banking and trading venues, sports organisations, foreign diplomatic missions in Switzerland, international organ- isations based in Switzerland, Swiss companies from various sectors, and universi- ties. These also include critical infrastructure. It has also been observed that some states attempt to engage in reconnaissance on regime opponents or their respective diaspora community in Switzerland. Switzerland is an attractive target for economic espionage. States are increasingly turning to cyber tools in order to engage in economic espionage. Since 2015, the FIS has recorded a growing number of state cyber attacks on Swiss economic entities. These have tended to involve on the one hand the theft of business and manufactur- ing secrets and on the other hand the procurement of information ahead of corporate takeovers. Targets of state cyber attacks in Switzerland I L L E G A L I N T E L L I G E N C E S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S 79 Russian espionage activities with a link to Switzerland Last year, the FIS identified persistent aggressive Russian espionage activities in Switzerland. The Russian foreign intelligence service, the SVR, the military intelli- gence service, the GRU, and the domestic intelligence service, the FSB, maintain a presence in Switzerland. Most operate under diplomatic cover. Switzerland is now probably one of the most important locations in Europe for the Russian intelligence services. According to the information available to the FIS, cur- rently around a third of the Russian diplomats accredited in Switzerland are known or suspected members of the intelligence services. There are also members who stay for just short periods in Switzerland and for example are involved in third-country meetings or in one-off operations or take part in international conferences. Recently, Russian espionage efforts against Switzerland have predominantly been related to two issues: firstly the investigations by the Organisation for the Pro- hibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) into chemical weapons use in Syria and secondly the attempted murder of the former member of the Russian intelligence ser- vice Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in the UK. The FIS contributed substantially to the success of the OPCW operation’s counter-reconnaissance, in particular because the GRU unit concerned was already known to it. This unit had repeatedly carried out cyber operations against Swiss interests. Evidence of its activities had been traced in Switzerland in 2016 and 2017 already. The FIS shared its information with partner services. This allowed the partners to identify the GRU team when it entered their country. The team arrested by the Dutch authorities would in all probability have subsequently commenced activities against Switzerland; international cooperation is thought to have prevented a cyber attack on the Spiez laboratory. The FIS also established that Russian services have engaged in activities against several international sports organisations based in Switzerland, including the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and various sports associations. These activities were carried out in the context of the investigations into the Russian doping programme, which were ongoing at the time. Espionage activities of other states The intelligence services of other states also have personnel operating and gather- ing information in Switzerland. The second-greatest threat is posed by China. Hacker groups from Asia are among of the most active economic espionage actors globally. The relatively large number of cyber attacks that have been attributed to Chinese hacker groups is striking. The investigations into these incidents revealed I L L E G A L I N T E L L I G E N C E S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S80 that the interests of the attackers coincided with the key industries in China’s eco- nomic plan. The knowledge obtained is probably being used to benefit the technical development and growth of Chinese companies. The findings relating to the incidents identified in Switzerland point to the exist- ence of a number of hacker groups, which have recently been linked to the Chi- nese intelligence services. It is not unusual for Chinese IT service providers to be behind these cyber attacks: they are commissioned by the state to gather sensitive data domestically and abroad and are coordinated by the Chinese intelligence ser- vices. The Chinese government’s massive investments in its cyber infrastructure and the steady expansion of its civil and military cyber capabilities are also reflected in the increasing complexity of the cyber attacks. The FIS is observing this trend also in Switzerland. The number of technologically-advanced targeted cyber attacks on strategically relevant targets has increased sharply since 2016. Examples have included large-scale cyber attacks on international IT service providers, whose net- works the attackers used to gain access unnoticed to a large quantity of sensitive data. Chinese intelligence services are also interested in political information about Switzerland and diaspora communities resident in Switzerland, including the Tibetan community and its organisations. The FIS is aware of only a small Iranian intelligence presence in Switzerland. In 2018, the French and Danish authorities were able to thwart attacks by Iran on regime opponents. Both states ascribe the attempted attacks to the Iranian intelli- gence service MOIS in both cases. This represents a departure from the previously observed division of responsibilities among the Iranian security authorities. In the past, the Quds units of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards had generally been responsible for extraterritorial operations. I L L E G A L I N T E L L I G E N C E S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S 81 Espionage: an ever-growing challenge The return of power politics has also given renewed impetus to illegal intelligence. Espionage as a tool for information gathering is on the rise worldwide. States and private actors are now making intensive use of covert means to obtain information, probably to a greater extent than was the case a few years ago. The main factors behind the noticeably intensified espionage activity in Switzerland’s strategic envi- ronment and in Switzerland itself are the intensifying conflict between Russia and Western states and economic rivalries. ▪ Regarding Europe, it can be observed that Russia, in particular, is aggressively gathering information about NATO, the EU and the foreign, security and eco- nomic policies of European states. Switzerland is directly affected by this, either as a target of espionage or as an arena for intelligence activities against third par- ties. This will continue to be the case. ▪ China is not expected to depart from its economic agenda. The USA is currently in a trade conflict with China; in Europe, states have started to introduce investment controls, thus making Chinese takeovers, in particular, more difficult. Chinese companies will increasingly focus on states that have more liberal legislation on foreign direct investment, such as Switzerland. Based on global trends, it is expected that foreign states’ espionage activities both in and against Switzerland will further intensify. If the trend whereby states seek to assert their interests unilaterally by force rather than by legal means or through multinational bodies continues, their intelligence services will also have a role to play in this. This will not be limited to information gathering. Intelligence services will probably play a role in preparing, executing and dealing with the aftermath of serious criminal acts. Examples of these have multiplied recently – in addition to the annexation of Crimea in violation of international law, they include the murder of a brother of Kim Jong-un in Malaysia, the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the UK, the abduction of a Vietnamese citizen in Germany, the planned attack against Iranian opposition figures in France and the murder of the Saudi jour- nalist Jamal Kashoggi in Turkey. Consequences for Switzerland The focus of foreign espionage will continue to be on international and diplomatic processes, Switzerland’s status as a business and research location and Switzerland’s positioning on international issues. What does the FIS expect? I L L E G A L I N T E L L I G E N C E S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S82 Cyber attacks on critical infrastructure represent just a small fraction of state or state-sponsored cyber attacks. However, because this infrastructure really is criti- cal, such attacks, which are primarily politically or economically motivated, can do considerable damage. Critical infrastructure in Switzerland may also find itself on the target list for such attacks, as indicated by the foiled cyber attack on the Spiez laboratory. Economic cyber espionage poses an ongoing threat to economic targets in Swit- zerland. The FIS assesses that cyber attacks on companies and organisations in Switzerland will continue in the coming year. These will focus primarily on those industries which the Chinese government is prioritising in order to implement its economic policy objectives. Espionage constitutes an attack on the sovereignty of Switzerland, can impair the government’s freedom to act, threatens Switzerland as a centre of business and industry and is detrimental to Geneva’s standing and capacity to function as an inter- national city. Counterespionage is consequently a matter of protecting not only the population, but also the Swiss legal system and the ability of the authorities to act, the international organisations operating in this country, Switzerland’s economic prosperity and Switzerland as a research location.

For example, despite being uncovered, the frequency of cyber operations of some actors have not decreased. At the end of 2018, just a few weeks after the media had reported on a campaign by the GRU, the service launched a broad campaign against targets in Europe. I L L E G A L I N T E L L I G E N C E S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S84 Protection of critical infrastructure Targeted attacks on industrial control systems | The Triton/Trisis malware is designed to manipulate systems monitoring industrial control systems in such a way that faulty behaviour goes undetected. Until now, attacks have been focussed directly on the plant control systems. A safety control system monitors and con- trols the operation of a plant. If, for example, the pressure or the temperature of the process being monitored exceeds a critical value, alarms are triggered, coun- termeasures are initiated automatically or the system is shut down. If such systems are successfully manipulated, a plant may be damaged or even destroyed as a result. Triton/Trisis is only the fifth known malware that is specifically directed at industrial control systems. The best-known malware in this context is Stuxnet. The malware which was used to attack the power supply in Ukraine in December 2015 and in 2016 falls into the same category. Such attacks have until now been deployed with a great deal of restraint; to date, the use of acts of sabotage has primarily been limited to war-like or strategic conflicts. The restraint is probably linked to the fact that such operations run the risk of causing uncontrollable collateral damage, which also entails incalculable consequences for the attacker. Such attacks are therefore generally aimed in a very targeted manner against a specific system configuration, and they are correspond- ingly costly. Typically, only state actors are capable of going to such lengths. In addition to this, industrial control systems and their operators are increasingly being spied on, possibly in order to gain an overview of ways in which they could be manipulated and in order to be prepared for future political developments. For example, the Dragonfly group, which targets the energy sector, has been observed to engage in such activities. Risks imported with ICT components | Hardware and software manufacturers from certain states have been in the spotlight, and not just since the Snowden rev- elations. Soon after the Chinese manufacturer Huawei entered the global market, doubts were raised, particularly in a number of Western states, about the integrity of its products and the company’s independence from the Chinese authorities. The Snowden leaks in 2013 confirmed, at least in part, the suspicion that US manu- facturers like Cisco, Microsoft or Google were also giving the authorities access to their products. Actions are being taken to deal with the issue of states potentially having access to and control over ICT manufacturers based in them. The measures currently being taken are aimed in the broadest sense at manufacturers and suppliers of I L L E G A L I N T E L L I G E N C E S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S 85 hardware and software solutions. For example, the US government is excluding Kaspersky from its procurement processes across the board. There have also been growing calls to exclude the procurement of Huawei devices. China does not exclude manufacturers and suppliers per se, but it does impose conditions. Russia does not license certain components without FSB certification. Since 2014, federal authorities in Switzerland have demanded in-depth clarifications from manufac- turers and suppliers in the case of critical procurements. While these approaches offer short- to medium-term solutions to certain issues, a broader discussion is being held in a number of countries, including Switzer- land, as to how they can reduce their dependence on countries with technological supremacy. At the level of international security policy, too, state access to and control over manufacturers of ICT solutions has been an issue for some time. For example, in 2015 a report by the UN Group of Governmental Cyber Experts drew up an initial political, non-binding code of conduct for states. The follow-up report in 2017 was meant to flesh out the details, but in the much harsher climate prevail- ing at that time it proved impossible to reach a consensus. It must therefore be assumed that states will continue to legally compel man- ufacturers of ICT solutions to cooperate with their authorities. It is unlikely that a private company will contravene the law applicable in its home country. On the other hand, it is unlikely that Switzerland will be able to develop alternatives to the dominant hardware and software solutions from foreign suppliers in the fore- seeable future. The digitalisation of business processes is already taking place. The risks remain to be analysed and the appropriate risk-reducing measures remain to be taken. This may mean that the apparently most cost-effective offer leads to additional internal costs as a result of said risk-reducing measures or that a further service has to be purchased for control and safeguarding.

The gender ratio was approximately 1 to 2. The FIS attaches particular importance to family-friendliness. In 2016, it was one of the first federal offices to be certified as a particularly family-friendly employer. The breakdown of employees by first language was as follows: almost three-quarters German-, a good fifth French-, around four per cent Italian- and about one per cent Romansh-speaking. The cantons spent CHF 12.4 million on their intelligence services; expenditure on personnel amounted to CHF 53,178,643 and expenditure on materials and operating expenses amounted to CHF 19,392,156. International cooperation The FIS works together with foreign authorities to perform its duties under the Intelligence Service Act (ISA). To this end, the FIS has also represented Switzerland in international bodies. Specifically, the FIS has exchanged intelligence with over a hundred partner services from various states and with international organisations, for example with the competent bodies at the UN and with EU institutions and bodies dealing with security issues. The FIS currently receives around 12,500 messages a year from foreign partner services. The FIS currently sends around 6,000 messages a year to foreign partner services. Information and storage systems In 2018, a total of 73 requests for information based on Art. 63 ISA and Art. 8 Data Protection Act were received. In 33 cases, the FIS informed the applicants whether or not it had processed data about them and if so what that data was. In those cases in which it had actually processed data on the requesting person, it provided complete information, while keeping in mind the protection of third parties. In 35 cases, the provision of information was deferred in accordance with the legal provisions. In one case, the requested copy of the requesting person’s identity document was not submitted, despite a reminder, and the application had to be writ- ten off. One request was withdrawn. At the end of 2018, 3 requests for information were still being processed. In 2018, the FIS also received nine requests for access under the Freedom of Information Act. K E Y F I G U R E S S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S90 Situation assessments The FIS presents its situation report on Switzerland’s security annually. This con- tains the situation radar, the classified version of which is used on a monthly basis by the Security Core Group for assessing the threat situation and for setting priorities. Recipients of the FIS’s situation assessments included the Federal Council, as well as other political decision-makers and competent authorities at the federal and can- tonal levels, military decision-makers and the law enforcement agencies. The FIS provides them, either when requested or on its own initiative, with periodic, spon- taneous or scheduled strategic reports, either in written or verbal form, covering all areas of the ISA and the FIS’s classified mission statement. For example, in 2018 the FIS once again supported the cantons with a platform for intelligence sharing man- aged from its Federal Situation Centre (World Economic Forum Davos). In addition to these mainly strategically-oriented reports, the FIS provides unclas- sified information to competent authorities for use in criminal or administrative pro- ceedings. In 2018, for example, it delivered 24 official reports to the Office of the Attorney General, 19 to other federal authorities such as the Federal Office of Police, the State Secretariat for Migration or the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, and 2 to cantonal authorities (excluding supplements to existing official reports). 31 of these reports were related to terrorism, four to cyber security, three to illegal intelli- gence, three to proliferation, two to violent extremism, and two were not dedicated exclusively to any of these topics. K E Y F I G U R E S S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S 91 Measures Counterterrorism | The FIS regularly publishes figures relating to counterterrorism – individuals assessed to pose a risk, jihadist travellers, jihad monitoring – on its website. (Weitere Themen / Nachrichtenbeschaffung / Dschihadreisende) – available in German, French and Italian The Prophylax prevention and awareness-raising programme | In 2018, the FIS, together with the cantons, continued its prevention and awareness-raising pro- grammes, Prophylax and Technopol (in the context of higher education), for raising awareness of illegal activities relating to espionage and to the proliferation of weap- ons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. The FIS and the cantonal intel- ligence services contacted firstly companies and secondly universities and research institutes as well as federal offices. In 2018, 91 sensitising conversations were held in the context of the Prophylax programme and three as part of the Technopol pro- gramme. In addition, 35 awareness-raising sessions relating to espionage and non- proliferation were conducted. – available in German, French and Italian Cooperation to protect critical infrastructure | Melani is a model for cooperation between the Federal IT Steering Unit (FITSU) of the Federal Department of Finance and the FIS. The strategic management of Melani and the technical competence centre are placed within FITSU, while the operational intelligence units of Melani are placed within the FIS. Melani is tasked to provide subsidiary support to Swiss critical infrastructure in its procedures for information assurance, in order to pre- ventatively – and in the case of IT incidents in a coordinating manner – ensure the functioning of Swiss information infrastructure together with companies. In order to achieve this aim, in the year under review Melani and the operators of 294 of Switzerland’s critical infrastructure facilities worked together on a voluntary basis, under a public-private partnership. Melani published two half-yearly reports on the situation regarding information assurance for the public, 123 notices and reports for the operators of critical infrastructure facilities, seven specialist reports for the Fed- eral Council and the FIS’s intelligence network partners and six public newsletters and blog entries, and it processed around 9,000 notifications and requests from the public. The public reported over 5,700 phishing sites via the antiphishing.ch portal. K E Y F I G U R E S S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S92 Intelligence-gathering measures requiring authorisation | In cases presenting a particularly serious threat in the areas of terrorism, illegal intelligence, proliferation, attacks on critical infrastructure or the protection of other important national inter- ests as defined under Article 3 ISA, the FIS can use intelligence-gathering measures requiring authorisation. Such measures are regulated under Article 26 ISA. They must in each case be authorised by the Federal Administrative Court and approved by the head of the DDPS following consultation with the head of the FDFA and the head of the FDJP. They are subject to close monitoring by the independent supervi- sory authority which oversees intelligence activities and by the Control Delegation. At the suggestion of the Control Delegation, the data published now includes, in addition to the number of operations with intelligence-gathering measures requiring authorisation and the number of measures in each area of activity of the FIS, the number of persons affected by the measures. Authorised and approved measures Area of activity (Art. 6 ISA) Operations Measures Terrorism 4 23 Illegal intelligence 4 170 NBC proliferation 0 0 Attacks on critical infrastructure 0 0 Total 8 193 Persons affected by the measures Category Number Targets 20 Third persons (as defined under Article 28 ISA) 3 Unknown persons (e.g. only phone number known) 5 Total 28 K E Y F I G U R E S S I T U AT I O N R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 | F I S 93 Cable reconnaissance | The Intelligence Service Act has also given the FIS the powers to conduct cable reconnaissance in order to gather information about secu- rity relevant incidents abroad (Article 39 ff. ISA). As the purpose of cable reconnais- sance is to gather information about other countries, it is not designed to be used as a domestic intelligence-gathering measure requiring authorisation. However, cable reconnaissance can be carried out only where Swiss telecommunications service providers are required to forward relevant data flows to the Swiss Army’s Centre for Electronic Operations. The ISA therefore provides under Article 40 f. an authorisa- tion and approval procedure for orders to the providers, which is similar to that for intelligence-gathering measures requiring authorisation. In 2018, one cable recon- naissance order was issued. Radio reconnaissance | Radio reconnaissance is also targeted at foreign coun- tries (Article 38 ISA), which means that only radio systems located abroad may be recorded. In practice, this concerns primarily telecommunication satellites and short-wave transmitters. In contrast to cable reconnaissance, radio reconnaissance is not subject to authorisation, because in radio reconnaissance, it is not necessary to oblige telecommunications service providers to reroute data. In 2018, 31 radio reconnaissance orders were issued. Immigration checks | In 2018, the FIS screened 5,443 immigration applications for threats to internal security (accreditation of diplomats and international officials or visa applications and applications for work and residence permits required under the law on foreign nationals). The FIS recommended the refusal of four applications for accreditation, of three visa applications and of four applications for residence per- mits. The FIS also screened 5,333 asylum dossiers for threats to the internal security of Switzerland. In 21 cases it either recommended refusal of the asylum application based on relevant security concerns or it pointed to a security risk. Of the 49,168 applications for naturalisation screened by the FIS in accordance with the ISA, it recommended refusal of the naturalisation application or raised security concerns in 5 cases. As part of the Schengen visa consultation procedure called ʻVisionʼ, the FIS screened 900,880 data records for any threat to Switzerland’s internal security. It recommended the refusal of 4 visa applications. The FIS also submitted applica- tions to fedpol for the order of 101 entry bans (86 were ordered, 15 were still being processed at the year end) and 1 expulsion (being processed). In addition, the FIS screened the API (Advance Passenger Information) data for 1,748,930 individuals on 10,824 flights. API data that does not yield any matches with the data held by the FIS is deleted after a processing period of 96 hours. Personnel security screening | In the context of personnel security screening, the FIS conducted 1262 verifications abroad and undertook 99 in-depth assessments of individuals recorded in its information and storage systems on behalf of the national specialist unit for personnel security screening of the DDPS’s information security and facility protection office and the Federal Chancellery.

Our security environment  has become more fragmented and more complex and thus more difficult to assess.  The significant increase in the number of non-state actors, the possibilities of hybrid  warfare, the return of power politics, in some cases with a marked tendency toward  unilateralism, heightened tensions between the Western states and Russia, as well as  the political and economic challenges in European countries are all part of a situa- tion that increasingly difficult to grasp. The old order is changing under the pressure  exerted by political, economic, military but also technological, social and cultural  forces. The outcome of these changes is uncertain.   In this world of insecurity and growing uncertainty, the intelligence service is  becoming increasingly important. Its anticipation and early detection capabilities are  needed in order to identify and assess threats in good time and – where opportune –  to take preventive measures. The intelligence picture of the overall situation, pieced  together from countless fragments, is a key element in the decision making of those  responsible for security policy.  With its new design and simpler layout, this yearʼs annual report of the FIS pre- sents to the interested members of the public the major developments from an intel- ligence point of view. In each section, the FIS details its observations on the issue in  question and states what it expects to happen. A new ʻkey figuresʼ section contains  information and data, which were previously published in the Federal Councilʼs  annual report. It also contains the key figures on intelligence-gathering measures  requiring authorisation. These figures show that such measures, which are particu- larly restrictive in terms of fundamental rights, remain focused on combating terror- ism and illegal intelligence.  I hope that this yearʼs situation report of the FIS will again be of interest to a wide  audience.       S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9  |  F I S 9  The situation report in brief    T H E  S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  I N  B R I E F   S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9  |  F I S 11  For years, the challenges faced by the security agencies have become more com- plexity. The FIS’s situation radar tool is one of the instruments giving direction to  Switzerland’s security policy and providing Switzerland’s inhabitants with an out- line of the key issues from an intelligence viewpoint.   ▪ Political stability and economic robustness in Europe are diminishing. Europe is  spellbound by its own crises and global power struggles: against this background,  the adverse impact on Switzerland’s security of the return of power politics and  the hence growing power-political rivalry between the USA, Russia and China is  becoming more and more evident. The growing insecurity in its surrounding is  becoming more relevant to Switzerland with regard to security policy.    ▪ Russia's increased confidence is based chiefly on its regained military strength  and its tightly organized power apparatus under President Putin. It wants to be  perceived as a superpower on an equal footing with the USA. Nonetheless, there  are still limitations to its military capabilities. Russia will therefore continue to  focus on influence operations, ranging from activities such as information cam- paigns, manipulation and propaganda to the exercise of overt political, military  and economic pressure. The practices of extortion and, in certain cases, commit- ting violent actions remain a possibility.   ▪ Besides military strength, the USA relies heavily on the use of economic pressure  to safeguard its security and its national interests in the global strategic competi- tion. Secondary sanctions with extraterritorial effect are an important instrument.  These are designed to force third countries and large companies operating inter- nationally to accept the USA’s demands, particularly in the context of its policy  on Iran. President Trump rejects restrictions on the USA’s national sovereignty by  multilateral mechanisms, has a sceptical view of the USA’s alliances and is clearly  keen for the USA to go it alone as a nation.   ▪ China will continue to do everything in its power to keep growing economically  and militarily. It remains very unlikely that it will depart fundamentally from its  current course. Iran will try to wait out Trump’s presidency without capitulating.  It remains unlikely that North Korea will completely renounce nuclear weapons  and delivery systems suitable for deploying them, even though it intermittently  sends out disarmament signals.    T H E  S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  I N  B R I E F   S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9  |  F I S12   ▪ The Middle East and North Africa, including the Sahel region, remain the scene  of numerous wars and armed conflicts. For example, the Syrian regime and its  Russian and Iranian allies have strategically defeated the rebels, but have not yet  secured victory. Despite massive losses, the ʻIslamic Stateʼ and other jihadist  groups remain capable of launching major attacks. Jihadist groups and the indi- viduals and small groups controlled or inspired by them pose the dominant ter- rorist threat in Europe. In Switzerland, the terrorist threat remains at a heightened  level.   ▪ The right-wing extremist scene is becoming more active. Several groups now  have open websites, and one group in Vaud has even opened its own premises.  At the same time, the scene continues to behave conspiratorially, and for the time  being it remains unclear whether it is once again moving increasingly toward the  direct use of violence. However, its potential for violence remains unchanged, as  does that of the left-wing extremist scene. The latter has a network of interna- tional links, which is probably one of the reasons for the partially intensified use  of violence by some groups that has been seen since 2017. Left-wing extremists  combine their actions to form campaigns, especially against alleged repression  and in particular against the expansion of the Bässlergut prison in Basel, and  express their solidarity with the PKK in support of the Kurdish autonomously  administered areas in northern Syria. The return from these areas of left-wing  extremists trained in the use of weapons is a matter of concern for the European  security authorities.   ▪ With regard to the issue of proliferation, the appeal of weapons of mass destruc- tion remains high, and technological advances are facilitating their acquisition.  In the field of civil nuclear technology, China is the country currently driving  dynamics. The centre of gravity with regard to responsibility for non-prolifera- tion and for preventing the emergence of new nuclear weapon states is thus also  shifting. In the proliferation target countries – Pakistan, Iran, Syria (possible  replacement of chemical weapons programme) and North Korea – the situation  has not changed.   ▪ The return of power politics has also given renewed impetus to espionage – its  use as a tool for information gathering is on the rise worldwide. Russia, with an  agenda driven by superpower politics, and China, with an agenda driven primar-    T H E  S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  I N  B R I E F   S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9  |  F I S 13  ily by economic considerations, rank first and second in this respect. The broader  trend, extending to numerous other states, toward attempting to assert interests  increasingly by force rather than through legal channels or multinational bodies  could increasingly lead to serious criminal acts such as kidnappings or killings  being carried out at the behest of the state. Foreign intelligence services will prob- ably play a role in preparing and executing such actions and dealing with the  subsequent aftermath. The use of cyber tools as a key instrument in the exercise  of power by nations will probably also continue to grow in importance.

A simplified version of the situation radar, without any confidential data, has also  been incorporated into this report. The public version lists the threats that fall  within the FIS’s remit, together with those classified under the categories of ‘migra- tion risks’ and ‘organised crime’, which are also relevant from the point of view of  security policy. This report does not go into detail about these two categories, for  more information on which readers are referred to the reports of the relevant federal  authorities.

Unlike the Baltic states, Poland and Ukraine, Switzerland is not directly affected  by Russia’s efforts to regain its sphere of influence in Eastern Europe. Moreover,  the approximately 136,000 migrants who reached Europe via Mediterranean and  overland routes in 2018 did not initially land in Switzerland, but in Spain, Italy or  Greece. Despite this, Switzerland’s security buffer zone has weakened overall, as  political stability and economic robustness have been diminishing in Europe as a  whole for a number of years. Political polarization in the EU is being exacerbated  and a strain is being placed on its cohesion, in particular by intra-European migra- tion movements and the 628,000 asylum applications, which were filed EU-wide  in 2018.  The increasing uncertainty in its surrounding has also made security policy a  more important issue for Switzerland. The security authorities are already facing  challenges from the continuing heightened terrorist threat, intensive intelligence  activities by Russia, in particular, and cyber attacks on the Swiss economy ema- nating from China, Russia and other states. Regional powers such as Turkey or   What does the FIS see?

Countering proliferation  attempts also calls for a high degree of alertness and requires a lot of effort.   Europe: under the spell of its own crises and global power struggles In recent years, political tensions in the EU have increased significantly, mainly   due to migration pressure and economic weaknesses. The process of Great Britain’s  withdrawal and concern about the stability of the eurozone mean that the EU is very  much preoccupied with its own affairs. The signs of polarisation between north and  south, west and east, the centre and the periphery are clearly visible. In the face of  increasing pressure from Russia, European security continues to depend primar- ily on the political will and military capabilities of the United States and NATO.  Meanwhile, the proposals to establish a European army which were put forward in  November 2018 by President Macron of France and Chancellor Merkel of Germany  remain vague. Most importantly, they express doubts about the American willing- ness to defend Europe and have accordingly been welcomed by President Putin of  Russia as a contribution to the construction of a multipolar world. However, since  the attacks on eastern Ukraine and the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, the  USA has actually been strengthening its military capabilities in Europe. In Novem- ber 2018, NATO used its large-scale exercise Trident Juncture to test amongst other  things the operational readiness of its rapid reaction force. It demonstrated with this  military exercise, the largest since 2002, and the involvement of 50,000 participants  its defensive readiness and capabilities to Russia.   Against the background of internal difficulties in European institutions, the  adverse impact on Switzerland’s security of the growing power-political rivalry  between the USA, Russia and China is becoming more and more evident – in par- ticular through an increase in intelligence activities. The USA is seeing its military  dominance come under increasing pressure from the expanding capabilities of the  Russian and Chinese armed forces. Its main challenger in the global competition  for controlling influence is China, with its large and rapidly growing economic  potential.    S T R AT E G I C  E N V I R O N M E N T   S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9  |  F I S 21  Russia: impress and intimidate For nearly two decades, Russia has been steadily growing in strength and con-  fidence in domestic as well as foreign affairs. Putin’s re-election as President  created the conditions for the Kremlin to continue to adhere to its determined  foreign-policy strategy of restoring Russia’s role as a major power on the inter- national stage.  Russia’s increased confidence is based chiefly on its regained military strength  and its tightly organized power apparatus under President Putin. In September 2018,  the large-scale military exercise Vostok 2018 took place in the Eastern Military Dis- trict. Troops from the Central Military District and the Northern Fleet took part, as  did token contingents from China and Mongolia. According to official figures, it was  the largest manoeuvre since 1981, with 300,000 participants. One of the objectives  of the exercise was to move troops over long distances. With its annual large-scale  exercises in one of its four military districts, Russia is displaying in an effective way,  both at home and abroad, the modernisation and restructuring of its armed forces and   At the end of 2018, Russia successfully tested a hypersonic weapons system. Avangard will form  an important pillar of Russia’s nuclear deterrence; China and the USA are striving to make up lost  ground in the area of hypersonic technology. The operational availability of such weapons systems  is likely to have an adverse impact on the stability of the global security situation.    S T R AT E G I C  E N V I R O N M E N T   S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9  |  F I S22  the military strength it has regained. Its armed forces are also continuously gaining  valuable experience, most notably through the successful deployment of the air force  in Syria.   On 4 March 2018, a former Russian double agent and his daughter were poisoned  with a military nerve agent in Salisbury, in the UK. By a stroke of luck, both sur- vived the attack. However, one person not directly involved in the attack died after  coming into contact with the toxic substance. It is now considered highly likely  that the perpetrators were Russian. The Russian regime was sending out a signal  that the West and traitors in its own ranks should be afraid. The subsequent Rus- sian disinformation campaign followed the pattern of similar influence operations,  intended to sow the seeds of conflict between EU members, to adversely influence  Europe’s relations with the USA and to generally spread uncertainty, fear and mis- trust. However, the West’s response to the attempted assassination was probably  far stronger and more united than Russia had expected. By the end of March 2018,  29 Western states had expelled around 150 Russians, most of whom had an intel- ligence background. This blatant assassination attempt and the subsequent denial  of responsibility for the crime have led in the West to a further loss of trust in the  Russian leadership.   USA: focus on global strategic competition President Donald Trump and his administration see the strategic environment   as one in which the security, prosperity and global interests of the USA are being  threatened by a number of state actors. The National Security Strategy published  in December 2017 sees one of the main challenges facing the USA as being the  intensified strategic competition with the ʻrevisionist powersʼ Russia and China.  The USA initially responded to this with measures to strengthen its armed  forces. A significant increase in defence spending is intended to remedy deficits in  the operational readiness and to finance certain reinforcements and extensive mod- ernisation programmes. In order to improve its deterrence and defence capabili- ties against Russia, the USA is also increasing its military capabilities in Europe.  These actual measures are in marked contrast to the President’s remarks sharply  criticising NATO and raising doubts about his transatlantic commitment. However,  the USA continues to call forcefully for substantial increases in European contri- butions to common defence. Moreover, it is no longer prepared to accept Russian  violations of the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty) and on  2 February 2019 gave notice that it was terminating the Treaty. In 1987, the USA     S T R AT E G I C  E N V I R O N M E N T   S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9  |  F I S 23  and the Soviet Union entered into a commitment under the INF Treaty to disman- tle their land-based ballistic guided missiles and medium-range cruise missiles.  Also in the FIS’s assessment, Russia today possesses a substantial number of land- based cruise missiles with a range banned by the INF Treaty.  The USA relies heavily on the use of economic pressure to assert its national  interests. Sanctions remain a key element of US foreign policy, and the USA uses not  least secondary measures with impact outside its territory. An example of this is its  policy towards Iran. The threat of exclusion from the US market and from the USA’s  globally dominant financial system leaves large companies operating internationally,  in particular, with practically no choice other than to withdraw from doing business  with Iran.  President Trump has set himself the goal of correcting the massive imbalances  in foreign trade, which he sees in the first instance as being due to unfair trade  with China but also with other key trading partners. He intends to counter these  imbalances primarily by threatening to impose or actually imposing tariffs. This  is intended at the same time to protect US industry and to increase pressure on the  USA’s trading partners to open up markets further and to improve intellectual prop- erty protection.  China: The long economic march is nearing its goal In 1978, under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, China began to open up its econ-  omy and embarked on the long march to the forefront of the global economy. The  ʻMade in China 2025ʼ programme, adopted in 2015, together with other programmes  is designed to transform China into the leading technological power in just a few  years. To this end, the country is systematically promoting its own key industries  by methods including espionage and forced technology transfer. Disproportion- ately high hurdles are placed in the path of foreign investors; the Communist Party  remains closely linked to private companies. At the same time, strategically impor- tant investments are financed with generous loans from state banks. For example,  since 2013 China has invested hundreds of billions of dollars in dozens of states in  its new Silk Road Initiative, thereby securing numerous opportunities to exert eco- nomic, financial, political and cultural influence far beyond the boundaries of Asia.  Militarily, too, China continues to work consistently and in a target oriented manner  on expanding its capabilities. The Chinese development model of high growth rates  under the control of an authoritarian and anti-liberal political system meets with  admiration in Asia and Africa, in particular.

In June 2018, by  imposing tariffs on imports from China, the USA started a trade conflict, the out- come of which is still unclear and which might turn out to be extremely costly for  the USA and the global economy. Xi Jinping’s Chinese dream of the resurgence  of the former world power is seen by a broad political spectrum in the USA as a  nightmare for the liberal Western world, geared as it is toward market economics,  democracy and human rights. US Vice President Pence articulated this in a strongly  worded speech on China at the Hudson Institute in Washington on 4 October 2018.  He accused China of using unfair and illegal measures to strengthen the Chinese  economy and above all of striving for military power. He said that China was aiming  to drive the USA out of the Western Pacific and thereby also seeking to prevent the  USA from providing military support to its allies. He said that the Chinese leader- ship was also systematically suppressing the freedom of expression of its citizens  and was attempting to exert massive pressure, even in the USA, in order to influence  media reporting on China and the film industry’s image of China.

Enmity toward Israel and the USA, both of which supported the Shah of Per- sia against the revolutionaries, and toward the Wahhabi kingdom of Saudi Arabia  is at the ideological core of the regime. Obama, at the time acting President of  the USA, and the Western allies hoped that the conclusion of the nuclear treaty  (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA) and the associated reintegration of  Iran into the global economy, aside from the remaining restrictions on Iran in the  nuclear sector, would lead to the gradual liberalisation of the Iranian regime from  the inside and the discontinuation of its radically anti-Israeli, anti-American and  anti-Saudi policies.  The Trump administration obviously does not share this hope. In May 2018,  President Trump announced the USA’s withdrawal from the JCPOA. By reintro- ducing sanctions against Iran that had been lifted or suspended, the USA is aiming   Iran’s influence in the region    S T R AT E G I C  E N V I R O N M E N T   S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9  |  F I S26  not only at massively reducing Iranian oil exports and thus its most important  foreign exchange earner, but also as far as possible at isolating Iran economically,  with secondary economic sanctions, which also work against third countries and  foreign companies, playing a major role. In this way, the USA wants to tighten and  extend indefinitely the existing restrictions on Iran’s nuclear programme, as well  as putting a stop to its ballistic missile programme and its regional expansion of  its power.   The US views the JCPOA as a political agreement and not a legally binding treaty.  However, in the view of the other states involved and in particular Iran, the US  action constitutes a breach of the treaty. The EU has attempted, so far largely in vain,  to continue facilitating trade with Iran. This shows once more clearly the severely  limited scope for economic and political action vis-à-vis the USA.  The initial effect of US sanction provisions has been to cut Iranian crude oil  exports by at least half, to approximately one million barrels a day. This, together  with further measures and in particular the de facto exclusion of Iran from interna- tional payment transactions, will hit Iran hard economically. The external value of  the Iranian currency dropped by more than 70 per cent between March and Decem- ber 2018. The inflation rate already stands at around 30 per cent and is still rising.  The International Monetary Fund is forecasting a fall in Iran’s economic output of  around 3.6 per cent for 2019.  Syria and Libya: crises persist The Syrian regime and its Russian and Iranian allies have strategically defeated   the rebels, but have not yet secured victory. It still needs to regain control over the  entire territory. The Syrian armed forces are understaffed and capable only of limited  offensives. They are therefore still reliant on military support from Russia and on  the militias financed and led by Iran. Despite massive losses, the ʻIslamic Stateʼ and  other jihadist groups remain capable of launching major attacks.   Libya still lacks the political and military strength to restore the state’s monopoly  on the use of force. The main features of the currently prevailing anarchy are two  weak competing centres of power, a multitude of militias, which often engage in  criminal activities, and a continuing threat from cells of the local affiliate of the   ʻIslamic Stateʼ. Oil production, Libya’s main legal source of foreign exchange, is  constantly under threat of disruption.

Migrants may, however, include isolated individuals who have links to terrorist  circles or who have terrorist intentions. Migration can also foster ethnic tensions or  violent extremism and influence crime trends.   In 2018, the asylum and migration situation in Europe continued to ease com- pared to previous years. A total of approximately 628,000 asylum applications were  submitted in the EU in 2018, down from over a million in 2015. The asylum sit- uation in Switzerland is mainly dictated by migration movements on the central  Mediterranean route to Italy. This route was used by around 23,000 people in 2018,  significantly fewer than in previous years. This decline is not least a consequence of  the Italian government’s tough policy on migration and the increased effectiveness  of the Libyan coastguard. The migrants on the central Mediterranean route came  mainly from Tunisia, Eritrea, Iraq, Sudan and Pakistan, and the majority entered  via Libya, with around a quarter coming via Tunisia. In 2018, the western route  from Morocco to Spain by sea and by land became the main route, travelled by     S T R AT E G I C  E N V I R O N M E N T   S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9  |  F I S28  around 65,000 mainly French-speaking people from Morocco, Guinea, Mali, Côte  d’Ivoire, Algeria and other states. Thus far, Switzerland has scarcely been affected  by migration via this route. The eastern Mediterranean route saw an increase on last  year, with around 48,000 people following it. Most of the migrants came from Syria,  Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkey and the Congo and reached Europe by sea and by land via  Turkey.    S T R AT E G I C  E N V I R O N M E N T   S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9  |  F I S 29  What does the FIS expect?  Russia: continuing military threat The pressure exerted by a resurgent Russia, on Eastern Europe in particular, is   likely to increase further. The ideological stance of the Russian leadership continues  to focus its attention on Ukraine, where a war with periodic fragile ceasefires has  been ongoing in the east of the country since 2014. Long-term control of Ukraine  is key to the establishment of a Russian zone of influence. Belarus has already been  very much reintegrated into Russia's sphere of influence. The Baltic states, too, are  under considerable pressure from Russia, which is likely to increase further in the  years to come. The US efforts to strengthen NATO militarily are primarily about  keeping Russia from undertaking military actions against NATO allies in Europe.  Russia wants to be perceived as a resurgent superpower on an equal footing with  the USA. However, existing restrictions on the military capacity of its air and naval  forces, in particular, will remain in place for some time to come, partly because of  Russia's limited economic strength. In future, Russia will therefore make greater use  of a wide range of methods from the field of influence operations. These range from  grey-area activities, such as information campaigns, manipulation and propaganda,  to overt political, military and economic pressure. The practices of extortion and, in  certain cases, committing violent actions are likely to continue.    S T R AT E G I C  E N V I R O N M E N T   S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9  |  F I S30  USA: continuation of national power politics The strategic rivalry between the USA and China will remain a decisive factor in   global politics. In the years to come, the USA will make substantial efforts to assert  its military capability in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China’s growing potential.  How far the USA will go in the economic conflict with China is currently an open  question. President Trump may content himself, at least for the time being, with  Chinese concessions to correct the imbalance in bilateral trade. However, there are  voices in the administration calling for a more ambitious strategy for curbing China,  wanting to also severely restrict the strategic rival’s access to the American market  and to American technology.   There is currently no sign of an imminent thaw in frosty US-Russian relations.  President Trump has repeatedly made it clear that he wants to accommodate Russia  in order to improve the tense relationship. However, he is encountering widespread  opposition to this in US institutions, particularly in Congress, where the majority  favour a hard line and continued pressure through sanctions on Russia. The Presi- dent’s room for manoeuvre has so far in his Presidency also been limited by ongoing  investigations and continuing speculation about problematic links with the Kremlin.  In contrast to his administration’s national security strategy, President Trump’s  stance toward the USA’s alliances is one of marked disregard, and he clearly shows  his willingness for the USA to go it alone as a nation. This has manifested itself  particularly problematically in the withdrawal from the nuclear deal with Iran and  the resulting breach of a multilateral agreement without regard to the position of the  European allies. It can be assumed that the President’s aversion to restrictions on US  sovereignty by multilateral mechanisms will remain a defining feature of his foreign  policy.  Donald Trump would like, if possible, to disengage the USA from costly opera- tions in the Islamic world. He seems to take little account of the question of whether  a further reduction in US engagement might promote destabilizing developments in  the regions concerned and give other actors the opportunity to gain influence at the  USA’s expense. Broadly speaking, the question remains as to how far a withdrawal  of the USA from its previous role as a global regulatory power and reliable partner  to its allies could be reconciled with a successful strategy in the global competition  with other powers. The USA’s strength rests not least on its global network of alli- ances and partnerships, and a policy of self-interest, which does not take this into  account, could jeopardize what has so far been a key advantage in the competition  with rival states.

From  the Russian point of view, possible advances in missile defence and the increasing  importance of conventional precision weapons are among the arguments against fur- ther nuclear disarmament. Arms control sceptics in the USA point in particular to  Russia’s violations of the INF Treaty and the fundamental doubts these raise about  Russian compliance with the treaty. Nonetheless, the ʻNew STARTʼ treaty’s limits  are being observed by both sides, and the treaty, with its detailed verification regime,  also provides effective means for monitoring. New START will expire in February  2021, but provides for the possibility of an extension for another five years without  renewed ratification. While Russia’s President Putin has declared his readiness to  extend the treaty, the USA has not yet made its decision.   China: practically unstoppable progress  China will continue to do everything in its power to grow in economic and mil-  itary terms. The USA under President Trump, however, no longer wants to stand  idly by watching China’s seemingly unstoppable rise to becoming an anti-liberal  superpower. The USA’s opposition means that President Xi Jinping is now at a  political crossroads: should China align itself with the rules of the international  market economy, even domestically, or continue to stake everything on economic,  political and military dominance? China is capable of adapting pragmatically to  new frame conditions and making tactical concessions. It will try to prevent the  formation of an anti-Chinese block. However, a fundamental departure from its  current course of authoritarian rule internally and pursuit of dominance externally  is very unlikely.  Iran: no capitulation to the USA The fundamental change in Iran’s attitude sought by the USA will not take place.   The Iranian leadership will try to wait out Trump’s presidency with strategic patience.  Iran will initially continue to observe the treaty provisions of the nuclear deal, which  in 2016 put an end to its extensive international political isolation. However, it will  continue to support anti-Israeli forces in the region, albeit with a significantly reduced  financial input. Furthermore, Iran will not renounce its ballistic missile programme,  thanks to which it already possesses accurate short-range missiles. A collapse of the  Iranian regime remains unlikely despite repeated flare-ups of public protest.

The main obstacle is  Turkey, which insists on a zone of influence controlled by Turkish security forces in  Syrian territory for defence against the Kurdish Workers’ Party (PKK). Israel sees  itself threatened by the military presence in Syria of Iran and its ally the Lebanese  Hezbollah, and remains determined to use air strikes against Iranian military instal- lations. It remains to be seen how Russia will respond in future with its ground-based  air defences in Syria. There is a considerable risk of escalation. Israel must bear in  mind that it is Russia’s priority to stabilise the Syrian regime.

Despite the strengthened measures taken by Libya and Italy to this end, Libya  will remain the main departure point for crossings to Italy. Crossings from Tuni- sia are expected to increase. The migration agreement between the EU and Turkey  applies only to migration by sea, not via the land border, where irregular border  crossings increased in 2018 and are likely to persist in 2019. The battles being waged  at the time of going to press around the capital Tripoli are unlikely to immediately  lead to the reestablishment of the monopoly on the use of force, even if one side  were to secure a military victory. Migration pressure on the western Mediterranean  route to Spain will probably persist or even increase. Due to the continuing jihadist  threat, the possibility remains that terrorists or individuals with terrorist motives  will enter Europe in the flow of migrants. Thorough monitoring of migrants and of  asylum documents is therefore still necessary.

It   stems mainly from jihadist actors, first and foremost supporters of the ʻIslamic  Stateʼ. The threat from ethno-nationalist terrorism in Europe and Switzerland  continues.  Threat from supporters of jihadism Although the ʻIslamic Stateʼ’s caliphate has been militarily defeated, networks   and cells of the ʻIslamic Stateʼ and its supporters and sympathisers, operating  covertly, continue to shape the terrorist threat in Europe. However, the capability  of the ʻIslamic Stateʼ itself to plan, direct and carry out attacks in Europe, such  as the ones that took place in Paris in November 2015, is now limited. It is able  to carry out attacks primarily in locations where it has a physical presence – be  it in its core territory in Syria and Iraq or in one of the main areas of opera- tion of one of its affiliates. Nonetheless, its supporters and sympathisers remain  independently capable of undertaking terrorist activities in Europe or inspiring  others to do so. The ʻIslamic Stateʼ’s propaganda remains a continuing source of  inspiration in this regard. Its anti-Western and anti-democratic jihadist ideology  is still popular. Switzerland has so far remained untouched by jihad-motivated  acts of violence. However, the FIS has observed that the ideology of the ʻIslamic  Stateʼ and al-Qaeda, which legitimises the use of violence, continues to resonate  with radicalised or receptive individuals in Switzerland, especially adolescents  and young adults.  Fewer jihad-motivated attacks in Europe The frequency of terrorist attacks in Europe has decreased significantly. Since   autumn 2017, seven acts of violence linked to jihadism have been identified, four of  which the ʻIslamic Stateʼ claimed responsibility for. However, claims of responsi- bility by the ʻIslamic Stateʼ no longer have the impact they once had. It is also often  difficult to assess whether an attack has actually been carried out for jihadist reasons.   While the major attacks in Paris in November 2015 and Brussels in March 2016  were complex attacks ordered by the ʻIslamic Stateʼ, the tendency since then has  been towards simpler attacks by inspired lone actors.   However, we should not let this trend hide the fact that the security authorities  of various European states have prevented numerous attacks and have uncovered  planned attacks since autumn 2017. For example, a bomb attack involving the   What does the FIS see?

Al-Qaeda remains in the shadow of the ‘Islamic State’ The dismantlement of the caliphate provided core al-Qaeda, under the leadership   of Ayman al-Zawahiri, the opportunity to regain its influence and its leadership role  in the global jihadist movement. To date, however, core al-Qaeda has failed to do  so – neither through spectacular attacks nor through effective propaganda. Calls and  efforts to unite the various jihadist groups have likewise remained unsuccessful so  far.

It still  intends to carry out attacks on Western targets. Some of its regional affiliates, for  example al-Shabaab in Somalia and al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, have stronger  operational capabilities and will be able to maintain their influence in their respec- tive main areas of operation.  Assessment-changing elements are worth mentioning regarding two groups  within the al-Qaeda movement. Hurras al-Din (Guardians of the Religion) presents  a growing threat. This jihadist group, based in Idlib province in Syria, is a spin-off of  the al-Qaeda-linked Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS, Organisation for the Liberation of  the Levant). While the HTS has pursued an increasingly local, i.e. ʻSyrianʼ, agenda  in the last few years, Hurras al-Din represents al-Qaeda’s global jihadist agenda.  It therefore also aims to attack Western interests. Currently, however, it lacks the  necessary resources. The future threat emanating from HTS and Hurras al-Din will  depend significantly on the developments of the military situation on the ground.  The threat from al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has diminished. It has  suffered numerous losses over the last one and a half years. Targeted air attacks  and various ground operations have severely reduced its capacity and capabilities.  AQAP is still keen to attack Western targets, but no longer really has the necessary  capabilities and access to do so. In particular, it no longer has the same degree of  bomb-making expertise it had at the time of its spectacular attempted attacks against  Western targets in 2009 and 2010. This has led to a reduction in the threat to civil  aviation from AQAP.

Western interests locally,  however, remain legitimate targets for most of these groups. For example, a Swiss  woman abducted in the Sahel region in Mali in January 2016 was still being held  hostage by an al-Qaeda affiliate at the time of going to press. Furthermore, the ʻIs- lamic Stateʼ claimed responsibility for the attack on a group of Western cyclists in  Tajikistan at the end of July 2018, in which a Swiss man was among those killed and  a Swiss woman was among those injured.  Switzerland is not an island  Switzerland is affected by developments in neighbouring countries: Islamic and   jihadist movements are more likely to stop at language barriers than at national  borders. Accordingly, Switzerland’s language regions are much influenced by  movements in neighbouring countries where the same language is spoken. Salafist  organisations and adherents have come under pressure from the authorities in a num- ber of European states in recent years. For example, the Koran distribution campaign   ʻRead!ʼ, whose initiators come from Germany, is banned in some countries and has  been severely pushed back in Switzerland. In 2018, Switzerland saw only isolated  Koran distribution campaigns.   Influences from abroad can also be detected among imams and preachers, who  may contribute to the radicalisation of individuals in Switzerland. Like other states,  Switzerland has imposed entry bans or other measures under laws on foreign nation- als on numerous preachers, who glorify or legitimise violence.   Jihadist radicalisation in Europe and Switzerland The success story of the ʻIslamic Stateʼ in 2014 and 2015 triggered a significant   increase in cases of radicalisation – in Switzerland as well as abroad. The experi- ence of recent years has shown that particularly adolescents and young adults were  susceptible to radicalization in Switzerland. In individual cases, this may lead to a  willingness to use violence and thus present a threat to Switzerland.  Although religious fundamentalism is often a contributing factor, in Switzerland it  seldom appears to be the sole cause of processes of violent radicalisation. In recent  years, the FIS has observed that these can often be traced back to disruptive events  in an individual’s life, personal crises, the perception of being disadvantaged or mar-    J I H A D I S T  A N D  E T H N O - N AT I O N A L I S T  T E R R O R I S M   S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9  |  F I S 41  ginalised (with a corresponding fixation on having been a victim), polarising events  (with a corresponding creation of a concept of the enemy), feelings of disorientation  and hopelessness or psychological problems.   Radicalisation in prisons and the release of radicalised prisoners The FIS has been observing an increase in cases of radicalisation of prisoners for   a number of years. Although the phenomenon in Switzerland is not comparable in  numerical terms with the worrying situation in other countries such as France, the  FIS has for some time been working to raise awareness of this issue among penal  institutions.   The treatment of released prisoners poses a challenge to both Europe and Switzer- land. European prisons are holding hundreds of jihadists and people, who have been  radicalised during their time in prison. They will be released in the coming months  and years. Despite rehabilitation as required under criminal law, they could still, or  more than ever, be influenced by jihadist thinking. Switzerland, too, is faced with  individual cases of radicalised released prisoners.     J I H A D I S T  A N D  E T H N O - N AT I O N A L I S T  T E R R O R I S M   S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9  |  F I S42  Significant decrease in travel movements The successful establishment of the ʻIslamic Stateʼ in 2014 triggered a global   wave of jihad-motivated travel to Syria and Iraq. Since 2016, number of depatures  have plummeted. The corresponding statistics from other European states show a  similar picture. The FIS has not detected any individuals travelling to or returning  from the conflict area in Syria and Iraq since August 2016. However, one individual  travelled to the Philippines in 2017 and was arrested there at the beginning of 2018.  Jihadists in migration movements  The European security authorities began paying increased attention to migration   movements when it became known in 2015 and 2016 that in isolated cases attackers  had made their way to Europe disguised as refugees. Newly arrived asylum seekers  concerning whom there is evidence of involvement in terrorist activities or of links  to terrorist networks are the exception rather than the rule. The migration-related  counterterrorism cases handled by the FIS since then have generally involved indi- viduals who have or had already been in Switzerland for some time.   Ethno-nationalist terrorism  The threat emanating from ethno-nationalist terrorism is estimated to be lower.   This is because in recent years, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) has shown itself  to be largely nonviolent in Europe and in particularly in Switzerland; there have  been isolated cases of rioting, for example at rallies. Violent clashes between PKK  supporters and Turkish nationalists and/or supporters of Turkish President Erdogan  currently pose the main threat in Switzerland. Confrontations are generally the result  of direct provocation. The PKK receives at times support from Turkish and Swiss  left-wing extremist groups.  In spring 2018, increased PKK activism was recorded across Europe. This was  due to the Turkish military interventions in Syria and Iraq. There were no violent  riots in Switzerland.

The ʻIslamic Stateʼ and its  supporters and sympathisers will remain the key actors.   The ʻIslamic Stateʼ will also remain the most influential resistance group among  Arab Sunnis in eastern Syria and central Iraq beyond 2018. It does not appear that  any other group will be able to take over its leadership position. Iraq will remain the  cradle of the ʻIslamic Stateʼ. The soil on which Sunni jihadist ideology thrived will  continue to remain fertile. In this environment, the ʻIslamic Stateʼ will continue to  be able to rely on a broad network of supporters and sympathisers from which it can  continuously recruit new fighters.  Jihadism will remain a threat to Europe Irrespective of the current state of individual groups, jihadist ideology is still pop-  ular; the utopia of a global caliphate, the legitimisation of the use of violence in order  to bring about such a caliphate and the associated glorification of martyrdom live on  in many minds. Sympathisers and supporters of the jihadist movement will continue   What does the FIS expect?

A few of them will in  future also allow themselves to be inspired to provide specific support or even to  carry out attacks.  Trend toward jihadist radicalisation in Europe The trend of jihadist-oriented radicalisation in Europe, particularly among adoles-  cents, will continue. It is unlikely that the reinforced official measures, which have also in Switzerland   been adopted in recent years as part of counterterrorism, will be relaxed in the future.  However, these measures might be seen by affected individuals as discrimination,  thereby reinforcing their perception of themselves as victims and contributing to  their radicalisation.  Challenges posed by potential jihad returnees  Switzerland has for some time been confronted with the issue of individual cases   of returning jihadists travellers. It is possible that future returnees will include  Swiss citizens or persons with links to Switzerland, who pose a specific threat to  Switzerland’s security. It must be assumed that some men and women, who wish  to return will bring minors with them. Dealing with traumatised children will pose  a particular challenge to the authorities responsible.   The question of repatriating jihadist travellers arrested in the conflict area, at  least those willing to return, will continue to preoccupy the authorities. Dealing  with non-state actors with whom Switzerland has no formal contacts will pose a  particular challenge.  Migration issues and counter-terrorism Over the next few years, Europe and Switzerland will continue to face challenges   due to migration issues despite increasingly restrictive migration policies. Future asy- lum seekers may include individuals who have been engaged in jihadists activities.  Even after fleeing to Europe, some of them might maintain their jihadist ideological  convictions and accordingly be motivated to convene with like-minded people, to  form cells and networks or even to carry out attacks. Furthermore, after their arrival  individual asylum seekers may, as a result of disorientation and dissatisfying future  prospects, become violently radicalised or become receptive to jihadist ideas.

Released prisoners who are Swiss or who for a variety of reasons cannot be  returned to their home country will present a particular challenge. Moreover, jihad  veterans and released prisoners with a valid residence document can move freely in  the Schengen area.  New means of terror Jihadist militias in Syria and Iraq have employed drones as well as chemical   agents; both methods are often recommended in their propaganda. Uncovered plans  for attacks using hydrogen sulphide in 2017 in Australia and for attacks using toxins  in 2018 in Germany and Italy highlight the fact that attacks employing chemical or  biological agents are a realistic scenario; attacks using radioactive material are less  likely. Attacks using explosives, drones, simple chemicals such as toxic gases or  other poisonous substances require relatively little outlay and resources. Instructions  for their manufacture and use are easy to find.

Although terrorist groups  have repeatedly expressed their intentions to use cyberterrorism, they seem to lack  the necessary capabilities to cause major damage.  Switzerland as a possible target for attacks From the jihadist point of view, Switzerland is part of the Western world classified   as Islamophobic and thus constitutes a legitimate, albeit not a priority target. Swit- zerland and its interests have so far rarely featured in jihadist propaganda. There  are no signs of any foreign or domestic policy developments in the coming months,  which might make Switzerland a priority target for jihadist actors. However, polar- ising events, such as a high-profile initiative with Islamophobic elements, could rap- idly make Switzerland the focus of jihadist propaganda. Attacks on Swiss territory  could also target the interests of states perceived by jihadists to be Islamophobic or  of states, which play a prominent international role in combating jihadism. Jewish  interests could also be affected.  Jihadist threat to Switzerland remains elevated In view of the developments described above, the terrorist threat to Switzerland   remains elevated. Attacks are still to be expected. The target location and the modus  operandi selected for attacks will often depend on opportunity and/or accessibil- ity, i.e. on the personal background, interests and contacts of the persons involved.  Inspired lone actors and small groups often act spontaneously, without any instruc- tions or financial support from outside. Since from the point of view of the ʻIslamic  Stateʼ and al-Qaeda no courses of action are excluded, the nature of the jihadist  threat will continue to be wide-ranging. Attacks on soft targets such as transport  infrastructure or gatherings of people, involving little logistical outlay and exe- cuted by jihad-inspired lone actors or small groups, remain the most likely threat  to Switzerland.   Threat from ethno-nationalist groups remains It can be assumed that the PKK will maintain its structures and will continue to   be able to mobilise large numbers of supporters rapidly when required. Although the  PKK is generally willing to resort to violence, the leadership has so far prohibited  the use of violence by its members in the West.

Despite having regressed to being a traditional terrorist organisation operating  underground, at the end of 2018 the ‘Islamic State’ in Syria was still holding individ- ual settlements in the middle Euphrates valley, not far from the Iraqi border. The  last of its territories were lost in the first few months of 2019. Many of the remain- ing foreign fighters and jihadist travellers are located in this area. There are still   ‘Islamic State’ fighters and supporters active on Syrian and Iraqi territory. Despite  numerous losses and fighters being captured or fleeing, numbers have stabilised  since the end of 2017 due to local recruitment. Syrians and especially Iraqis are  increasingly taking up leadership positions again.    The ‘Islamic State’ operates in clandestine decentralised cells in towns and vil- lages, but mobile groups also hide out in desert areas, which are hard to control.  Over the last few years, large numbers of leaders and fighters have gone under- ground in Syria and Iraq or for example in Turkey. Terrorist attacks are still being     J I H A D I S T  A N D  E T H N O - N AT I O N A L I S T  T E R R O R I S M   S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9  |  F I S 49  carried out in Syria and Iraq. The ‘Islamic State’ continues to be able to draw on cash  reserves; it moreover obtains funds through robbery and the extortion of protec- tion money.  The FIS looks at the ‘Islamic State’ as an integral phenomenon. Its transnational  jihadist ideology thrives on a breeding ground of resentment, and manifestations  of this ideology are flourishing to varying degrees within the jihadist movement.  State/Caliphate | At the end of 2018, after approximately three and a half years,  the ‘Islamic State’’s caliphate was defeated. Its strategic goal, the creation of a  global caliphate, remains unchanged. The ‘Islamic State’ still wants to be a state in  the literal sense of the word.  Armed group | With the break-up of its state-like structures, the military units  which previously operated openly have been destroyed or driven underground.  Nonetheless, the ‘Islamic State’ uses guerrilla tactics to carry out frequent attacks  on security forces in Syria and above all in Iraq.  Regional power | With the dismantlement of the caliphate at the end of 2017, the  ‘Islamic State’ lost its status as a regional power. It is now no longer a power with  the ability to threaten states, but remains a security problem at the regional level.  Terrorist actor | The ‘Islamic State’ has never abandoned its policy of systemat- ically spreading fear and terror: terror remains its primary method. The ‘Islamic  State’ and the supporters inspired by it carry out terrorist activities almost all  around the globe. The ‘Islamic State’ also claims responsibility for attacks, which  it did not carry out itself.  Utopia | The utopia of an Islamic world state, the caliphate, in which Muslims can  live according to Islamic law, is not a new idea. However, the ‘Islamic State’ has  succeeded in revitalising this utopia and giving it a new form. In its early days, it  was able to attract mass support and to establish, finance, defend and adminis- ter a rudimentary state structure. Furthermore, outside Syria and Iraq, numerous  jihadist organisations pledged allegiance to the ‘Islamic State’, thereby extending  its influence and power. Unlike al-Qaeda, the ‘Islamic State’ temporarily realised the  utopia in a rudimentary form.

There has been a significant decline in the quality and quantity of its mul- tilingual propaganda products. Nonetheless, the ‘Islamic State’, together with the  movement inspired by it, still manages to reach people worldwide and induce  them act in coherence with its ideology  Affiliates | The ‘Islamic State’ still has influence in numerous conflict zones world- wide, although its affiliates for the most part pursue a local agenda and often have  nothing in common but the logo or brand. The dismantlement of the caliphate  has not so far had a negative impact on the affiliates. They operate in their regions  independently of developments in Syria and Iraq.   The ‘Islamic State’ movement | The ‘Islamic State’ as a whole is part of the jihad- ist movement; this consists of numerous individuals, cells, networks and groups  worldwide. These each fight autonomously for their own causes under the banner  of the ‘Islamic State’. As with all movements, what is relevant is not just the active  members of the individual groups, but also the numerous supporters and sympa- thisers worldwide, who are active to a greater or lesser degree. Besides the openly  available propaganda on the internet, they communicate across borders in closed  online forums and via encrypted communication apps.

This represents more than a three-fold increase in the case of right-wing extremism  and an increase of 13 per cent in the case of left-wing extremism. The FIS is not  aware of any acts of violence motivated by right-wing extremism, and the propor- tion of incidents related to left-wing extremism at which acts of violence occurred  fell from half to just over a third. The scale of intensity of left-wing extremist vio- lence ranges up to and including arson attacks. Causing injury to or endangering  the lives of in particular members of the security forces but also members of other  emergency services during confrontations (e.g. at demonstrations) is not only an  acceptable possible outcome but is in isolated cases clearly the aim.  The potential for violence in both extremist circles remains unchanged; when and  how it will manifest itself can in certain contexts be estimated based on experience,  but can rarely be predicted in advance in a specific individual case. Both right-wing  and left-wing extremist circles have contacts abroad. In the case of left-wing extrem-  Events motivated by left- or right-wing extremism reported to the FIS since 2012  (excluding graffiti)  What does the FIS see?

For example, in October 2018 an  arson attack was carried out in Berlin for which Federazione Anarchica Informale /  Fronte Rivoluzionario Internazionale claimed responsibility. The group’s statement  referred to an arson attack in Thun BE and the campaign against the expansion of  the Bässlergut prison in Basel. It closed with a call for solidarity with 18 left-wing  extremists simultaneously standing trial in Basel. In violent clashes between left- wing extremists and security forces, the involvement of football hooligans may be a  factor contributing to increased aggression, particularly in Zurich.  Violent right-wing extremism In 2018, the FIS noted a significantly higher number of incidents connected with   right-wing extremism. The Swiss right-wing extremist scene is experiencing an  awakening. Whether it is also moving toward the use of violence remains unclear  for the time being; in 2018, at least, no acts of violence were recorded.  Several right-wing extremist groups now have open websites. One of these groups  has even opened its own premises in Vaud. Regular podium discussions and themed  events, which are also open to the general public, are held. These groups obviously  think they have a good chance of winning wider approval for their ideas and actions.  Some of these actions, such as patrols to protect the local population, feature more  in their propaganda than in reality. The impact of public appearances is assessed in  advance. And right-wing extremists continue to behave conspiratorially, especially  when planning actions. There is good reason for this. For example, an event organ- iser in Valais had to cancel a concert by a band regarded as right-wing extremist, due  to public reaction.  No concerts by right-wing extremist bands were recorded in Switzerland in 2018.  However, right-wing extremists attend events such as concerts all over Europe. This  has long been the case. Members of the right-wing extremist scene overall continue  to have large quantities of functioning weapons at their disposal. Furthermore, they  practise the use of firearms and train in martial arts.  Violent left-wing extremism On the one hand, the activities of left-wing extremists remain dependent on day-  to-day developments and tied to events, which they cannot induce themselves. On  the other hand, however, they are capable of combining their activities into cam- paigns and taking targeted action.     V I O L E N T  R I G H T- W I N G  A N D  L E F T- W I N G  E X T R E M I S M   S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9  |  F I S 57  The World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos and Labour Day are annual events,  which have become traditional occasions for actions. In both cases, security pre- cautions are taken against actions motivated by left-wing extremism. For example,  on Labour Day in 2018 the police in Zurich foiled plans for a violent follow-up  demonstration against air attacks by Turkey on Kurdish areas in Syria. The demon- strations against the WEF in 2019 passed largely peacefully and with no damage to  property. Other actions, of which there were only a few, included the blowing up  of the post-box of the Brazilian Consulate General in Zurich. In addition, a wide  variety of different circumstances may trigger demonstrations or property damage  by left-wing extremists.  Their aggressive stance towards right-wing extremists remains unchanged. For  example, in November 2018 left-wing extremists in Basel largely thwarted an  authorised demonstration by the Swiss Nationalist Party, where right-wing extrem- ists prepared to use violence were among the participants. In their counter-demon- stration, the left-wing extremists assaulted the demonstrators physically. They also  used violence against the police.  Arson attack as part of the anti-repression campaign.

Depending on the day to day events, the situation in the  areas autonomously administered by the Kurds (ʻRojavaʼ) in Syria, a country riven  by civil war, continues to preoccupy left-wing extremists. For example, the majority  of the activities in spring 2018 were linked to the Turkish military offensive in Afrin,  part of Rojava; in response to this, arson attacks were carried out in January and  April 2018 on the Turkish Consulate in Zurich and in May on the State Secretariat  for Economic Affairs in Bern. In January 2018, the latter was also the target of an  attempted IED attack, which was linked to the WEF.  Altogether, over a dozen arson attacks were recorded in 2018. Eight of them tar- geted vehicles belonging to companies having dealings with the Bässlergut prison,  and in one case the target was the ʻmachinery of deportationʼ. Two coordinated  attacks at the end of September, like the sabotage action of June 2016, targeted the  Swiss Federal Railways’ rail network.

However, there is currently no sign of the heated atmosphere and high levels  of aggression that prevailed at the turn of the year 2017/2018. Especially in the case  of the Riding School in Bern, high levels of potential aggression from violent left- wing extremists can be expected if the emergency services are deployed.

This means that the diffi- culties faced by right-wing extremists persist. Anyone recognised as a right-wing  extremist or accused of being one or of being linked to events motivated by right- wing extremism will face personal consequences. There are therefore still grounds  for their conspiratorial behaviour.  Nonetheless, the right-wing extremist scene is currently trying to campaign openly  for itself and its beliefs. In doing so, it generally avoids taking action that it is certain  will lead to social rejection. For example, it avoids references to National Socialism.  Nonetheless, reaction to the right-wing extremist scene is likely to increase as its  public presence grows. This pressure will influence the way right-wing extremists  behaviour and will probably cause them to withdraw into the shadows once again.  Such a scenario might entail violent reactions provoked by frustration. Aside from  their filtered public appearances, right-wing extremists will continue to behave con- spiratorially.  Right-wing extremists currently have no pressing concerns, let alone a strategy.  However, the potential for violence is still present and could manifest itself the  moment they perceive a situation arising in the news and thus in society as a trig- ger for action. A significant increase in migration movements to Switzerland or a  jihadist attack in this country could provide such a trigger. Right-wing extremists  could also react violently to campaigns against them by left-wing extremists, espe- cially the anti-fascist movement, or else target them on their own initiative. Such  actions by right-wing extremists are likely to be spontaneous, with little specific  preparation.  Violent left-wing extremism The violent left-wing extremist scene is not monolithic. This is due not only to   the ultimately incompatible ideologies of communism and anarchism or to the wide  variety of issues, which do not always succeed in motivating everyone, but also to  individual attitudes toward violence. These range from a willingness to approve vio- lence to some extent right up to those who are prepared to use violence themselves  to varying degrees, ranging from damaging property to carrying out arson attacks or  causing serious injury or death. Depending on the context, left-wing extremist vio- lence is expressed with varying degrees of intensity. Whereas frequent reference to  the availability of functioning weapons is made in the context of right-wing extrem-  What does the FIS expect?

The potential for violence in left-wing extremist circles remains at a heightened  level. The FIS assesses that the following situations and circumstances can lead to  the use of violence.   ▪ Gatherings of people offer violent left-wing extremists the opportunity to commit   violence from under the protection of the crowd. In principle, the potential for  aggression against security forces remains particularly high.   ▪ Combining issues to form a campaign that transcends current events encourages  the use of violence. Such violence is targeted and is sometimes used not only as a  symbolic protest or to cause damage, but also for sabotage purposes.   ▪ The latter applies in particular to anarchism, which is gaining ground at the  expense of communism. Anarchists are more violent in their actions than Marx- ist-Leninist left-wing extremists. They want to damage the ʻsystemʼ as such or  more precisely to sabotage it. For many left-wing extremists, the Kurds’ autonomously-administered zones on   Syrian soil represent the realisation of their political ideas. Left-wing extremists  from all over Europe have been and still are on the ground there. They have stud- ied the conditions, but have also participated directly in the fighting in one form or  another, and in some cases are still doing so. They constantly report on their experi- ences in the hope of identifying starting points for applying their own ʻrevolutionary  practiceʼ and for altering conditions in their countries of origin. In the light of the  way in which the Syrian conflict is playing out, we must expect not only disap- pointment and frustration, which could also erupt violently at demonstrations, but  also the arrival of returnees from the war zone. The latter might have acquired new  skills, for example in handling weapons and explosives, or they might now be more  willing to use violence. It is likely that they will want to use these skills in the fight  against the ʻsystemʼ in Europe. However, there are no indications that they intend  to attack individuals directly. Their first choice will probably continue to be attacks  on symbolic targets in the form of damage to property, with collateral damage being  always a possibility.

In 2018, there was a striking increase in the number of incidents linked to animal  rights extremism. The motive behind these has recently often been described as   ‘antispeciesism’: ‘Speciesism’ describes the systematic favouring of human interests  over animal interests; it refers to all forms of exploitation of animals for human  purposes, for example for food, clothing or entertainment.  Analysis of the recorded incidents puts them into three categories. These are:  firstly, actions against hunting – frequently under the banner of the Animal Libera- tion Front (ALF) and particularly in Zurich canton; secondly, damage to property con- nected with the consumption of meat, primarily in western Switzerland; and thirdly,  the group 269 Libération animale. A number of other actions complete the picture,  but these had frequently been observed in the past and are not specific to 2018.   ▪ In 2018, an increased number of hunting high seats were damaged or destroyed,  mainly in Zurich canton. This is probably not a coincidence, as it was here that  the vote on the hunting initiative took place in September. The recorded dam- age to property is therefore probably a hard-to-define mixture of temporarily  increased motivation on the part of the perpetrators, increased willingness to  report damage on the part of the victims, and increased awareness on the part  of the authorities. In several cases, the unknown perpetrators claimed responsi- bility under the well-known ALF banner.    ▪ Numerous acts of damage to property were committed in western Switzerland,  principally in the first half of 2018. For example, in just one night at the end  of February, attacks were carried out on six companies in Geneva. The attacks  were aimed at the meat processing industry, and in many cases the windows of  butcher shops were broken.    ▪ A group called 269 Libération animale, which has been in existence in vari- ous countries for years and was named after the number of a calf intended for  slaughter in Israel, also became active in western Switzerland in 2018. This was  probably due to personal links with existing French structures. In Switzerland,  the high-profile actions for which the group has claimed responsibility have  taken the form of civil disobedience.   As far as animal rights extremism is concerned, 2018 showed that an existing  movement can recommence violent action even after long years of inactivity. To  date, their activities have not by far reached the same sort of criminal energy levels  as were seen years ago in the Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty campaign. However,  as the example of Zurich shows, the movement is capable of conducting a cam- paign on its own. What is more, the personal and ideological links needed in order  to import a violent campaign already exist in Switzerland.

Weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons, are attributes of super- powers, who want to exert influence globally. At the same time, they provide protec- tion against external military intervention. This aspect is, especially for the smaller  unofficial nuclear powers, often key as it ensures the survival of the regime. The  appeal of weapons of mass destruction remains high, and technological advances are  facilitating their acquisition.   Switzerland is in demand As a world-renowned high tech and research hub, Switzerland is automatically   part of this dynamic. Proliferating states continue to seek out Swiss goods, tech- nology and know-how, which were developed for peaceful purposes, in order to  misappropriate them for use in WMD programmes. The Swiss universities con- vey knowledge that could also be used in WMD programmes. Switzerland as an  active partner in the fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,  and as a member of all export control regimes is obliged to implement preven- tive measures also in the academic field. Switzerland is a neutral country, which  enjoys a high degree of credibility due to its objective political stance. Switzer- land’s opinion on proliferation issues is therefore important and is the subject of  foreign influence operations, as the attempted attack on the Spiez laboratory has  already shown.  Long-term significance Unlike terrorism, proliferation is not an issue that regularly hits the headlines in   the daily news. Its effects are long-term and often not immediately obvious. Unlike  terrorism in Europe, it is not a phenomenon which accompanies developments in  society; it does, however, accompany and promote strategic rivalry between states  seeking to unilaterally shape or change structures within their sphere of influence.  The issue is therefore of major long-term importance to Switzerland, as Switzerland  favours multilateral consensus and a stable regulatory framework.  China’s important role The shift in the balance away from the USA and toward China is particularly   marked in the area of civil nuclear technology. China already dominates develop-  What does the FIS see?    P R O L I F E R AT I O N   S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9  |  F I S68  ments in this area. The centre of gravity is thus also shifting with regard to the  responsibility for non-proliferation and for preventing the emergence of new nuclear  weapon states.  Current and future target countries Pakistan is striving to expand its nuclear programme, for which it continues to   need know-how from foreign countries including Switzerland. Besides actually pro- ducing fissile material, it is also focussing on procurements, which will help it to  acquire the capability to deploy or store nuclear weapons. It will continue to do so.  The normalisation of Iranian foreign trade, which began with the nuclear treaty,  has been hampered by the USA’s withdrawal from it. In future, Iran will once again  increasingly be purchasing goods, which in themselves are legitimate, using mech- anisms that from the commercial point of view appear suspect, as the commercial  business channels provided under the JCPOA are not functioning. This will make  it more difficult to detect critical transactions. Iran’s continued focus on trade with  Asia will reinforce the trend toward the procurement even of European goods e.g. in  China.  With the end of the war in Syria pending and the reconstruction of the country, an  increased number of procurement transactions in this region can be expected. In this  context, Lebanon is also likely to feature more prominently as a transit destination  for logistical reasons. Ensuring that goods and funds intended for the reconstruction  are not misused will be a challenge. The Iranian presence in the region could also  lead to procurements benefiting Iranian interests being made via Lebanon and Syria.  North Korea will continue to make rarely any direct purchases in Switzerland.  However, the indirect purchase of Swiss goods via neighbouring countries will once  again be easier thanks to the less stringent implementation of UN sanctions in the  East Asia region.    P R O L I F E R AT I O N   S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9  |  F I S 69  Procurement of goods and know-how Proliferating states’ interest in Switzerland as a centre of innovation will not   diminish. The close links that already exist between espionage and proliferation will  intensify further. States like Iran and North Korea, which have developed their cyber  tools due to conflicts with third states or for other reasons, might follow the Chinese  example and use these tools in a more targeted way for economic espionage or to  support their WMD programmes. They are interested not just in technology, but also  in a company’s network, its sources of supply and its customers. The possession of  such information may be crucial in order to be able to appear to a Swiss company as  a credible customer or to effect procurements via third parties.  The target countries subject of counter-proliferation are unlikely to change.  Country programmes The nuclear and missile programmes of India and Pakistan will probably, as in   previous years, continuously undergo further development. As regards Pakistan, the  question is whether the country will also, like its Indian rival, develop interconti- nental missiles. This would bring Europe within range of another nuclear weapon   An electronic measuring instrument  that according to certain indications  was to be used in Pakistan’s nuclear   weapons programme (private photo)  What does the FIS expect?

It is anticipated that Iran will remain in the JCPOA for as long as possible and wait  for a new administration in Washington. Its nuclear programme will thus continue to  be monitored. As far as missiles are concerned, Iran will pursue its efforts to improve  the precision of its longer-range missiles. An increase in their range above the limit  of 2,000 kilometres allegedly set by revolutionary leader Khamenei for political rea- sons will not be possible in the near term, also for technical reasons.   It remains unlikely that North Korea will completely renounce nuclear weapons  and delivery systems suitable for deploying them. North Korea will maintain and  continue to expand its missile and nuclear weapons programme for many years to  come, even while intermittently sending out ostentatious disarmament signals. The  country’s existing capacity in the area of biological and chemical weapons is also  likely to remain at a high level.

Saudi  Arabia is planning to establish a very ambitious civil nuclear programme comprising  16 nuclear reactors and the production of its own fuel. If the country implements this  and arranges for the required specialist personnel to be trained, the announcement by  the Saudi Crown Prince that Saudi Arabia would seek to develop nuclear weapons if  Iran were to do so will become technically feasible.     P R O L I F E R AT I O N   S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9  |  F I S72  The end of the INF: horizontal versus vertical proliferation  Proliferation comes in two forms: horizontal and vertical. Horizontal prolifera- tion describes the activities and processes by means of which states without weap- ons of mass destruction or delivery systems seek to come into possession of such  weapons and thereby acquire new capabilities. Vertical proliferation, by contrast,  denotes the qualitative and quantitative expansion of existing arsenals. There is  an interrelationship between the two forms of proliferation. Pakistan remains a  horizontal proliferation problem, for example in that it procures calibration instru- ments in Switzerland. These will ultimately be used to arm cruise missiles with  nuclear weapons, i.e. to build up a new capability in the air-based section of the  nuclear triad. At the same time, Pakistan is using existing know-how to optimise  its nuclear weapons and increases their numbers, i.e. is also engaging in vertical  proliferation.  Horizontal nuclear proliferation is banned globally and can therefore not be  the subject of multilateral agreements. Vertical proliferation, on the other hand,  is driven primarily by technological development in the recognised nuclear  weapon states and is the subject of arms control agreements between individ- ual states. Vertical proliferation among the leading nuclear weapon states is a  technology driver and is correspondingly expensive. Disruptive technologies  such as precision navigation by means of inertial sensors or GPS, which now- adays any mobile phone is capable of, were originally developed for military  purposes. It has always been one of the goals of arms control to limit the use of  resources by states for vertical proliferation. There is therefore a high degree of  interaction between arms control and the current status of cutting-edge tech- nology and the global spread of such cutting-edge technology at the time a  treaty is agreed.   The INF Treaty signed in 1987 is a good example of such interaction. It prohib- its the deployment of land-based, but not of air-based or sea-based, unmanned  delivery systems with ranges of between 500 and 5,500 kilometres by the armed  forces of the USA and the Soviet Union – or nowadays its legal successor. In 1987,  the two states had a duopoly as far as the quality and quantity of such systems was  concerned, and both states were restricted by the technology of the 1980s to pre- cision navigation systems with an accuracy of around a hundred metres. The term  ‘delivery system’ was thus a synonym for ‘nuclear delivery system’, as operations  against tactical targets could be carried out successfully only with nuclear weap- ons. In the early 1990s, the USA acquired the capability to attack large point tar- gets such as airfields from distances of hundreds of kilometres successfully using  conventionally equipped cruise missiles. By the mid-1990s, it also became possible     P R O L I F E R AT I O N   S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9  |  F I S 73  to engage smaller point targets such as bunkers. In Russia, this development took  place around a decade later. China now has the same – and in some areas even  more advanced – capabilities.  Technological development and the rise of China have thus led to a situation  where an instrument of strategic arms control between two contracting states sud- denly obstructs the development of new core competencies of the conventional  armed forces in these – but only in these – contracting states, namely the engage- ment of high-value point targets using conventional standoff weapons. As a tradi- tional naval power with a superior air force, the USA has, thanks to its air-based and  sea-based resources, been able to cope with this ‘collateral damage from the past’  more readily than Russia with its powerful land forces. However, it was foreseeable  that both states would look, within the framework of their policies, for ways out of  this impasse.  The consensus on banning horizontal proliferation is under pressure politically  – even if only a few countries are openly speaking out against it. Nonetheless, it  will probably prevail. Vertical proliferation, on the other hand, is under constant  pressure from technological development and new geopolitical realities. Its con- trol mechanisms must therefore be renewed periodically to take account of the  current status of cutting-edge technology and its spread around the globe. The  end of the INF Treaty thus also holds out the possibility of a global system of arms  control that is more appropriate to the times.

For example, states strive, using information obtained by their intelligence services,  to gain a fuller picture of the situation in order to improve the effectiveness of their  actions. It can furthermore be observed that information is increasingly being pro- cured with the aim of influencing (in so-called influence operations) or damaging  the actions of rivals. Both can be achieved through the selective publication of infor- mation. The aim of such activities is often to weaken the cohesion of international  groups or institutions and thereby to restrict their ability to act. In addition, there  have recently been several cases in which states used their intelligence services –  outside the scope of traditional espionage missions – for attacks on regime oppo- nents or defectors.   Methods There are various methods of gathering information covertly: in addition to sifting   through and analysing openly available information and the ʻtraditional’ recruitment  of human sources and acquisition of information from them, other so-called sensors  have gained in importance. The latter have not, however, replaced the conventional  methods. Intelligence services continue to rely on a mix of different sensors and are  continuously developing these.  Espionage operations which have come to light reveal that cyber tools and other  communications reconnaissance instruments are being used in parallel and in inter- action with human sources. Depending on the objective, information is also being  procured exclusively via cyberspace. The latter has gained in importance insofar  as the use of cyber-based information-gathering tools has proven successful for  many actors. Cyber espionage is difficult to detect, the perpetrators can hardly  be successfully prosecuted, as the purported country of origin does of course not  help to elucidate the affair and determination by the means of intelligence of the  origins of the cyber-attack (ʻattributionʼ) can simply be denied based on the lack  of provability.  Switzerland as a target Switzerland is affected by these developments in many ways: Swiss authorities,   international organisations based in this country and Swiss companies are themselves  the target of reconnaissance activity by intelligence services. So-called third-country  meetings, i.e. meetings between members of foreign intelligence services and their   What does the FIS see?

Among the targets of intelligence activities identified by the FIS are Swiss author- ities, the army, the international city of Geneva or, more precisely, diplomats from  other states, the arms industry, the technology sector, banking and trading venues,  sports organisations, foreign diplomatic missions in Switzerland, international organ- isations based in Switzerland, Swiss companies from various sectors, and universi- ties. These also include critical infrastructure. It has also been observed that some  states attempt to engage in reconnaissance on regime opponents or their respective  diaspora community in Switzerland.  Switzerland is an attractive target for economic espionage. States are increasingly  turning to cyber tools in order to engage in economic espionage. Since 2015, the FIS  has recorded a growing number of state cyber attacks on Swiss economic entities.  These have tended to involve on the one hand the theft of business and manufactur- ing secrets and on the other hand the procurement of information ahead of corporate  takeovers.   Targets of state cyber attacks in Switzerland    I L L E G A L  I N T E L L I G E N C E   S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9  |  F I S 79  Russian espionage activities with a link to Switzerland Last year, the FIS identified persistent aggressive Russian espionage activities in   Switzerland. The Russian foreign intelligence service, the SVR, the military intelli- gence service, the GRU, and the domestic intelligence service, the FSB, maintain a  presence in Switzerland. Most operate under diplomatic cover.  Switzerland is now probably one of the most important locations in Europe for the  Russian intelligence services. According to the information available to the FIS, cur- rently around a third of the Russian diplomats accredited in Switzerland are known  or suspected members of the intelligence services. There are also members who stay  for just short periods in Switzerland and for example are involved in third-country  meetings or in one-off operations or take part in international conferences.   Recently, Russian espionage efforts against Switzerland have predominantly  been related to two issues: firstly the investigations by the Organisation for the Pro- hibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) into chemical weapons use in Syria and  secondly the attempted murder of the former member of the Russian intelligence ser- vice Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in the UK. The FIS contributed substantially to the  success of the OPCW operation’s counter-reconnaissance, in particular because the  GRU unit concerned was already known to it. This unit had repeatedly carried out  cyber operations against Swiss interests. Evidence of its activities had been traced in  Switzerland in 2016 and 2017 already. The FIS shared its information with partner  services. This allowed the partners to identify the GRU team when it entered their  country. The team arrested by the Dutch authorities would in all probability have  subsequently commenced activities against Switzerland; international cooperation  is thought to have prevented a cyber attack on the Spiez laboratory.  The FIS also established that Russian services have engaged in activities against  several international sports organisations based in Switzerland, including the World  Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and various sports associations. These activities were  carried out in the context of the investigations into the Russian doping programme,  which were ongoing at the time.  Espionage activities of other states The intelligence services of other states also have personnel operating and gather-  ing information in Switzerland. The second-greatest threat is posed by China. Hacker groups from Asia are among of the most active economic espionage actors   globally. The relatively large number of cyber attacks that have been attributed to  Chinese hacker groups is striking. The investigations into these incidents revealed     I L L E G A L  I N T E L L I G E N C E   S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9  |  F I S80  that the interests of the attackers coincided with the key industries in China’s eco- nomic plan. The knowledge obtained is probably being used to benefit the technical  development and growth of Chinese companies.   The findings relating to the incidents identified in Switzerland point to the exist- ence of a number of hacker groups, which have recently been linked to the Chi- nese intelligence services. It is not unusual for Chinese IT service providers to be  behind these cyber attacks: they are commissioned by the state to gather sensitive  data domestically and abroad and are coordinated by the Chinese intelligence ser- vices. The Chinese government’s massive investments in its cyber infrastructure and  the steady expansion of its civil and military cyber capabilities are also reflected  in the increasing complexity of the cyber attacks. The FIS is observing this trend  also in Switzerland. The number of technologically-advanced targeted cyber attacks  on strategically relevant targets has increased sharply since 2016. Examples have  included large-scale cyber attacks on international IT service providers, whose net- works the attackers used to gain access unnoticed to a large quantity of sensitive data.  Chinese intelligence services are also interested in political information about  Switzerland and diaspora communities resident in Switzerland, including the Tibetan  community and its organisations.  The FIS is aware of only a small Iranian intelligence presence in Switzerland.  In 2018, the French and Danish authorities were able to thwart attacks by Iran on  regime opponents. Both states ascribe the attempted attacks to the Iranian intelli- gence service MOIS in both cases. This represents a departure from the previously  observed division of responsibilities among the Iranian security authorities. In the  past, the Quds units of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards had generally been responsible  for extraterritorial operations.

Espionage as a tool for information gathering is on the rise worldwide. States and  private actors are now making intensive use of covert means to obtain information,  probably to a greater extent than was the case a few years ago. The main factors  behind the noticeably intensified espionage activity in Switzerland’s strategic envi- ronment and in Switzerland itself are the intensifying conflict between Russia and  Western states and economic rivalries.   ▪ Regarding Europe, it can be observed that Russia, in particular, is aggressively  gathering information about NATO, the EU and the foreign, security and eco- nomic policies of European states. Switzerland is directly affected by this, either  as a target of espionage or as an arena for intelligence activities against third par- ties. This will continue to be the case.   ▪ China is not expected to depart from its economic agenda. The USA is currently in  a trade conflict with China; in Europe, states have started to introduce investment  controls, thus making Chinese takeovers, in particular, more difficult. Chinese  companies will increasingly focus on states that have more liberal legislation on  foreign direct investment, such as Switzerland. Based on global trends, it is expected that foreign states’ espionage activities both   in and against Switzerland will further intensify. If the trend whereby states seek  to assert their interests unilaterally by force rather than by legal means or through  multinational bodies continues, their intelligence services will also have a role to  play in this. This will not be limited to information gathering. Intelligence services  will probably play a role in preparing, executing and dealing with the aftermath of  serious criminal acts. Examples of these have multiplied recently – in addition to the  annexation of Crimea in violation of international law, they include the murder of a  brother of Kim Jong-un in Malaysia, the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal and his  daughter in the UK, the abduction of a Vietnamese citizen in Germany, the planned  attack against Iranian opposition figures in France and the murder of the Saudi jour- nalist Jamal Kashoggi in Turkey.  Consequences for Switzerland The focus of foreign espionage will continue to be on international and diplomatic   processes, Switzerland’s status as a business and research location and Switzerland’s  positioning on international issues.  What does the FIS expect?    I L L E G A L  I N T E L L I G E N C E   S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9  |  F I S82  Cyber attacks on critical infrastructure represent just a small fraction of state or  state-sponsored cyber attacks. However, because this infrastructure really is criti- cal, such attacks, which are primarily politically or economically motivated, can do  considerable damage. Critical infrastructure in Switzerland may also find itself on  the target list for such attacks, as indicated by the foiled cyber attack on the Spiez  laboratory.  Economic cyber espionage poses an ongoing threat to economic targets in Swit- zerland. The FIS assesses that cyber attacks on companies and organisations in  Switzerland will continue in the coming year. These will focus primarily on those  industries which the Chinese government is prioritising in order to implement its  economic policy objectives.  Espionage constitutes an attack on the sovereignty of Switzerland, can impair  the government’s freedom to act, threatens Switzerland as a centre of business and  industry and is detrimental to Geneva’s standing and capacity to function as an inter- national city. Counterespionage is consequently a matter of protecting not only the  population, but also the Swiss legal system and the ability of the authorities to act,  the international organisations operating in this country, Switzerland’s economic  prosperity and Switzerland as a research location.

For example,  despite being uncovered, the frequency of cyber operations of some actors have  not decreased. At the end of 2018, just a few weeks after the media had reported on  a campaign by the GRU, the service launched a broad campaign against targets in  Europe.    I L L E G A L  I N T E L L I G E N C E   S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9  |  F I S84  Protection of critical infrastructure  Targeted attacks on industrial control systems | The Triton/Trisis malware is  designed to manipulate systems monitoring industrial control systems in such a  way that faulty behaviour goes undetected. Until now, attacks have been focussed  directly on the plant control systems. A safety control system monitors and con- trols the operation of a plant. If, for example, the pressure or the temperature of  the process being monitored exceeds a critical value, alarms are triggered, coun- termeasures are initiated automatically or the system is shut down. If such systems  are successfully manipulated, a plant may be damaged or even destroyed as a  result. Triton/Trisis is only the fifth known malware that is specifically directed at  industrial control systems. The best-known malware in this context is Stuxnet. The  malware which was used to attack the power supply in Ukraine in December 2015  and in 2016 falls into the same category.  Such attacks have until now been deployed with a great deal of restraint; to  date, the use of acts of sabotage has primarily been limited to war-like or strategic  conflicts. The restraint is probably linked to the fact that such operations run the  risk of causing uncontrollable collateral damage, which also entails incalculable  consequences for the attacker. Such attacks are therefore generally aimed in a very  targeted manner against a specific system configuration, and they are correspond- ingly costly. Typically, only state actors are capable of going to such lengths.  In addition to this, industrial control systems and their operators are increasingly  being spied on, possibly in order to gain an overview of ways in which they could  be manipulated and in order to be prepared for future political developments. For  example, the Dragonfly group, which targets the energy sector, has been observed  to engage in such activities.   Risks imported with ICT components | Hardware and software manufacturers  from certain states have been in the spotlight, and not just since the Snowden rev- elations. Soon after the Chinese manufacturer Huawei entered the global market,  doubts were raised, particularly in a number of Western states, about the integrity  of its products and the company’s independence from the Chinese authorities. The  Snowden leaks in 2013 confirmed, at least in part, the suspicion that US manu- facturers like Cisco, Microsoft or Google were also giving the authorities access to  their products.   Actions are being taken to deal with the issue of states potentially having access  to and control over ICT manufacturers based in them. The measures currently  being taken are aimed in the broadest sense at manufacturers and suppliers of     I L L E G A L  I N T E L L I G E N C E   S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9  |  F I S 85  hardware and software solutions. For example, the US government is excluding  Kaspersky from its procurement processes across the board. There have also been  growing calls to exclude the procurement of Huawei devices. China does not  exclude manufacturers and suppliers per se, but it does impose conditions. Russia  does not license certain components without FSB certification. Since 2014, federal  authorities in Switzerland have demanded in-depth clarifications from manufac- turers and suppliers in the case of critical procurements.  While these approaches offer short- to medium-term solutions to certain issues,  a broader discussion is being held in a number of countries, including Switzer- land, as to how they can reduce their dependence on countries with technological  supremacy. At the level of international security policy, too, state access to and  control over manufacturers of ICT solutions has been an issue for some time. For  example, in 2015 a report by the UN Group of Governmental Cyber Experts drew  up an initial political, non-binding code of conduct for states. The follow-up report  in 2017 was meant to flesh out the details, but in the much harsher climate prevail- ing at that time it proved impossible to reach a consensus.  It must therefore be assumed that states will continue to legally compel man- ufacturers of ICT solutions to cooperate with their authorities. It is unlikely that a  private company will contravene the law applicable in its home country. On the  other hand, it is unlikely that Switzerland will be able to develop alternatives to  the dominant hardware and software solutions from foreign suppliers in the fore- seeable future. The digitalisation of business processes is already taking place. The  risks remain to be analysed and the appropriate risk-reducing measures remain  to be taken. This may mean that the apparently most cost-effective offer leads to  additional internal costs as a result of said risk-reducing measures or that a further  service has to be purchased for control and safeguarding.

The gender ratio was approximately 1 to 2. The FIS  attaches particular importance to family-friendliness. In 2016, it was one of the  first federal offices to be certified as a particularly family-friendly employer. The  breakdown of employees by first language was as follows: almost three-quarters  German-, a good fifth French-, around four per cent Italian- and about one per cent  Romansh-speaking.  The cantons spent CHF 12.4 million on their intelligence services; expenditure on  personnel amounted to CHF 53,178,643 and expenditure on materials and operating  expenses amounted to CHF 19,392,156.  International cooperation The FIS works together with foreign authorities to perform its duties under the   Intelligence Service Act (ISA). To this end, the FIS has also represented Switzerland  in international bodies. Specifically, the FIS has exchanged intelligence with over a  hundred partner services from various states and with international organisations, for  example with the competent bodies at the UN and with EU institutions and bodies  dealing with security issues. The FIS currently receives around 12,500 messages a  year from foreign partner services. The FIS currently sends around 6,000 messages  a year to foreign partner services.  Information and storage systems In 2018, a total of 73 requests for information based on Art. 63 ISA and Art. 8   Data Protection Act were received. In 33 cases, the FIS informed the applicants  whether or not it had processed data about them and if so what that data was. In those  cases in which it had actually processed data on the requesting person, it provided  complete information, while keeping in mind the protection of third parties.   In 35 cases, the provision of information was deferred in accordance with the  legal provisions. In one case, the requested copy of the requesting person’s identity  document was not submitted, despite a reminder, and the application had to be writ- ten off. One request was withdrawn. At the end of 2018, 3 requests for information  were still being processed.  In 2018, the FIS also received nine requests for access under the Freedom of  Information Act.    K E Y  F I G U R E S   S I T U AT I O N  R E P O R T  2 0 1 9  |  F I S90  Situation assessments The FIS presents its situation report on Switzerland’s security annually. This con-  tains the situation radar, the classified version of which is used on a monthly basis by  the Security Core Group for assessing the threat situation and for setting priorities.  Recipients of the FIS’s situation assessments included the Federal Council, as well  as other political decision-makers and competent authorities at the federal and can- tonal levels, military decision-makers and the law enforcement agencies. The FIS  provides them, either when requested or on its own initiative, with periodic, spon- taneous or scheduled strategic reports, either in written or verbal form, covering all  areas of the ISA and the FIS’s classified mission statement. For example, in 2018 the  FIS once again supported the cantons with a platform for intelligence sharing man- aged from its Federal Situation Centre (World Economic Forum Davos).   In addition to these mainly strategically-oriented reports, the FIS provides unclas- sified information to competent authorities for use in criminal or administrative pro- ceedings. In 2018, for example, it delivered 24 official reports to the Office of the  Attorney General, 19 to other federal authorities such as the Federal Office of Police,  the State Secretariat for Migration or the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, and  2 to cantonal authorities (excluding supplements to existing official reports). 31 of  these reports were related to terrorism, four to cyber security, three to illegal intelli- gence, three to proliferation, two to violent extremism, and two were not dedicated  exclusively to any of these topics.

The FIS and the cantonal intel- ligence services contacted firstly companies and secondly universities and research  institutes as well as federal offices. In 2018, 91 sensitising conversations were held  in the context of the Prophylax programme and three as part of the Technopol pro- gramme. In addition, 35 awareness-raising sessions relating to espionage and non- proliferation were conducted. www.ndb.admin.ch/wirtschaftsspionnage – available in German, French and Italian  Cooperation to protect critical infrastructure | Melani is a model for cooperation  between the Federal IT Steering Unit (FITSU) of the Federal Department of Finance  and the FIS. The strategic management of Melani and the technical competence  centre are placed within FITSU, while the operational intelligence units of Melani  are placed within the FIS. Melani is tasked to provide subsidiary support to Swiss  critical infrastructure in its procedures for information assurance, in order to pre- ventatively – and in the case of IT incidents in a coordinating manner – ensure the  functioning of Swiss information infrastructure together with companies. In order  to achieve this aim, in the year under review Melani and the operators of 294 of  Switzerland’s critical infrastructure facilities worked together on a voluntary basis,  under a public-private partnership. Melani published two half-yearly reports on the  situation regarding information assurance for the public, 123 notices and reports for  the operators of critical infrastructure facilities, seven specialist reports for the Fed- eral Council and the FIS’s intelligence network partners and six public newsletters  and blog entries, and it processed around 9,000 notifications and requests from the  public.

Such measures are regulated under Article 26 ISA. They  must in each case be authorised by the Federal Administrative Court and approved  by the head of the DDPS following consultation with the head of the FDFA and the  head of the FDJP. They are subject to close monitoring by the independent supervi- sory authority which oversees intelligence activities and by the Control Delegation.  At the suggestion of the Control Delegation, the data published now includes, in  addition to the number of operations with intelligence-gathering measures requiring  authorisation and the number of measures in each area of activity of the FIS, the  number of persons affected by the measures.

ISA). As the purpose of cable reconnais- sance is to gather information about other countries, it is not designed to be used as  a domestic intelligence-gathering measure requiring authorisation. However, cable  reconnaissance can be carried out only where Swiss telecommunications service  providers are required to forward relevant data flows to the Swiss Army’s Centre for  Electronic Operations. The ISA therefore provides under Article 40 f. an authorisa- tion and approval procedure for orders to the providers, which is similar to that for  intelligence-gathering measures requiring authorisation. In 2018, one cable recon- naissance order was issued.  Radio reconnaissance | Radio reconnaissance is also targeted at foreign coun- tries (Article 38 ISA), which means that only radio systems located abroad may  be recorded. In practice, this concerns primarily telecommunication satellites and  short-wave transmitters. In contrast to cable reconnaissance, radio reconnaissance  is not subject to authorisation, because in radio reconnaissance, it is not necessary  to oblige telecommunications service providers to reroute data. In 2018, 31 radio  reconnaissance orders were issued.  Immigration checks | In 2018, the FIS screened 5,443 immigration applications for  threats to internal security (accreditation of diplomats and international officials or  visa applications and applications for work and residence permits required under the  law on foreign nationals). The FIS recommended the refusal of four applications for  accreditation, of three visa applications and of four applications for residence per- mits. The FIS also screened 5,333 asylum dossiers for threats to the internal security  of Switzerland. In 21 cases it either recommended refusal of the asylum application  based on relevant security concerns or it pointed to a security risk. Of the 49,168  applications for naturalisation screened by the FIS in accordance with the ISA, it  recommended refusal of the naturalisation application or raised security concerns  in 5 cases. As part of the Schengen visa consultation procedure called ʻVisionʼ, the  FIS screened 900,880 data records for any threat to Switzerland’s internal security.  It recommended the refusal of 4 visa applications. The FIS also submitted applica- tions to fedpol for the order of 101 entry bans (86 were ordered, 15 were still being  processed at the year end) and 1 expulsion (being processed). In addition, the FIS  screened the API (Advance Passenger Information) data for 1,748,930 individuals     on 10,824 flights. API data that does not yield any matches with the data held by the  FIS is deleted after a processing period of 96 hours.  Personnel security screening | In the context of personnel security screening, the  FIS conducted 1262 verifications abroad and undertook 99 in-depth assessments of  individuals recorded in its information and storage systems on behalf of the national  specialist unit for personnel security screening of the DDPS’s information security  and facility protection office and the Federal Chancellery.

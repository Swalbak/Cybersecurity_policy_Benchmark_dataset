ISBN: 978-981-11-3519-4 Cyber Security Agency of Singapore Designed by: APT811 Design & Innovation Agency 2 3 The global cyber landscape in 2016 saw new attempts to disrupt critical information infrastructure, rising ransomware incidents and the growing use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices to launch attacks. Singapore similarly faced such threats. Our high level of connectivity comes with a corresponding level of vulnerability. While advances in digital technology have opened up new possibilities to enhance our lives, they have also exposed us to cyber threats that aim to cheat us, steal or alter our data, disrupt our daily business activities, and cripple our critical infrastructure. Cyber-attacks are becoming more frequent and damaging. The impact of a cyber-attack was keenly felt in the United States of America in October 2016, when a major Domain Name System (DNS) faced a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. Usually, DDoS attacks target websites, but that attack struck at a core infrastructure of the Internet – essentially the Web’s “telephone directory”. More than 80 organisations that relied on it to connect visitors to their respective websites, could not do so. That incident may have resulted in inconvenience mostly, but it could also be considered a harbinger of things to come. Even as this publication reviews the incidents in 2016, major cyber-attacks in the first half of 2017 continue to put everyone on alert. The “WannaCry” and “NotPetya” cyber-attacks led to disruptions in many services. These incidents will be more fully presented in the Cyber Landscape 2017 report, including how Singapore managed them even though we were relatively unscathed. Such incidents, and their rapid global impact, remind us that we must continue to do our part, to make cyberspace a safer and more trustworthy one. We hope that this first edition of the Singapore Cyber Landscape can point you in the right direction. This review of Singapore’s cyber threat situation provides some understanding of the gravity of what we as individuals, organisations and the nation, are dealing with. Knowing the enemy, their motivations and techniques, will allow us to have a fighting chance of detecting intrusions earlier and dealing with them promptly. In cyber, it is important to aim for resilience. This is because it is impossible to prevent successful attacks 100 per cent of the time. As Singapore pursues its plans to build a Smart Nation, we cannot afford to ignore the threats that come with it. The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) will be your partner in making cyberspace a safer space for all. FOREWORD David Koh Chief Executive Cyber Security Agency of Singapore 4 5 At the frontline to monitor and respond to cyber threats in Singapore is CSA’s National Cyber Security Command (NCSC). It comprises the National Cyber Threat Monitoring Centre (NCTMC), National Cyber Incident Response Centre (NCIRC), and the National Cyber Threat Analysis Centre (NCTAC). The centres work closely together and with stakeholders to respond to cyber threats, research, and make sense of the cyber landscape to protect 1 SingCERT is the focal point in Singapore for the public to report cybersecurity incidents and issues, and liaises with CERTs in other countries to better manage the borderless nature of cyber threats. Businesses and individuals could report incidents to SingCERT by dialling its hotline – (+65) 6323 5052 or e-mail to singcert@csa.gov.sg access patient data. However, the attacks did not disrupt Singapore’s healthcare system as the incidents were contained and no other systems were compromised. The Government sector also continued to be targeted, facing attacks from website defacements to phishing. The Internet Surfing Separation (ISS) policy announced in June 2016 will go a significant way towards securing the Government’s Infocommunications Technology (ICT) environment as it would enhance the security of the Government’s network from attacks originating from the Internet. Besides attacks targeting these critical sectors, NCSC also saw individuals and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) being victims of website defacements, business e-mail scams, phishing, and ransomware. In Singapore, 43 per cent of cybersecurity CYBER LANDSCAPE 2016 THE NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY COMMAND Globally, in 2016, IoT devices like Wi-Fi routers and webcams were hijacked to launch cyber-attacks, specifically DDoS attacks. This resulted in many websites and services being inaccessible. Ransomware was another significant type of cyber-attack that hit industries and individuals, locking them out of their systems. Singapore is certainly not immune to these cyber threats, which can be expected to evolve and emerge in bigger, bolder and faster ways. CSA is keeping a close watch on the cyber landscape and, in this publication, will provide an analysis of the cyber threats that Singapore faced between January and December 2016. The cyber-attacks and threats covered in this publication are just the tip of the iceberg. The absolute number of incidents will be hard to determine – despite best efforts, not all cases are reported or can be detected – but CSA’s observations could provide a baseline towards a further understanding of Singapore’s cyber threat landscape. In turn, that may illuminate more ways to better defend ourselves against similar or new threats. The Government will take the lead, and partner the industry, academia, public and people sectors, and international counterparts, to enhance cybersecurity for the nation, so that Singaporeans and Singapore can reap the long term benefits of having a safe and trustworthy cyberspace. Cybercrime Under Singapore’s Cybersecurity Strategy launched in 2016, one key priority is to build a safer cyberspace for Singaporeans and businesses. The area of cybercrime comes under the responsibility of the Singapore Police Force (SPF). The SPF noted an increase in the proportion of cybercrimes to overall crime cases from 7.9 per cent in 2014 to 13.7 per cent in 2016, underscoring the growing attractiveness of digital platforms for criminals. Cases reported under the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act (CMCA) more than doubled year-on-year to 2016, with ransomware, and the compromise of online and banking accounts, constituting the top five categories in 2016. CMCA Cases CRITICAL CYBER CONCERNS Actors Targeting Singapore Cyber threats can be carried out by a host of different cyber- attackers, or threat actors as they are commonly known. The cyber community has long struggled with the challenge of definitively attributing the specific source of a cyber-attack or crime, as attackers can use a range of tools to cover or distort their tracks. Threat actors targeting Singapore run the gamut from script- kiddies to Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). Their behaviour, intentions, and capabilities are always evolving and require close watch. Globally, APTs are a growing concern as they are often undetectable in networks for long periods. APTs may refer to both the nature of the attack (persistent and sophisticated), and the attackers (well-organised and usually state-sponsored). APT groups generally target government institutions and large organisations for the purpose of espionage and other illegal acts. Singapore’s Critical Information Infrastructure (CII), and to enable a safer cyberspace for businesses and individuals. In 2016, NCSC saw cyber-attacks of varying nature and impact across many sectors, including the Government, Banking & Finance, and Healthcare sectors. For instance, the Healthcare sector was struck by ransomware attacks that left some individual healthcare practitioners unable to EXECUTIVE SUMMARY incidents reported by individuals and SMEs to the Singapore Computer Emergency Response Team (SingCERT)¹ were phishing attacks. One of the most common cyber threats SMEs reported to SingCERT was business e-mail scams. 6 7 Raising Cyber Awareness Our outreach programmes and roadshows aim to promote cyber-savviness among businesses and individuals. SingCERT has issued advisories to educate the public on cyber issues such as ransomware, DDoS attacks and compromised remote servers. Developing Cybersecurity Professionals Singapore is also growing its cybersecurity ecosystem, which includes boosting the talent pool. The Cyber Security Associates and Technologists (CSAT) programme, a joint initiative by CSA and the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), was launched in 2016 to train and upskill new and existing ICT and engineering professionals for cybersecurity roles. Regional and International Exchanges Singapore has been actively involved in the past year in various international platforms on cybersecurity, from multilateral discussions on cyber norms to bilateral co-operation and regional capacity-building programmes. KEEPING OUR CYBERSPACE SAFE AND TRUSTWORTHY TOGETHER Prevalent cyber threats observed in Singapore’s cyberspace² in 2016 were defacements, phishing, ransomware, and compromised Command & Control (C&C) Servers, the last being potential launch-pads for other cyber-attacks, such as DDoS. A snapshot of these common cyber threats is as follows: Examples of Phishing Scams: Ransomware: It is one of the biggest cybersecurity threats to businesses and individuals today. Some reports noted that there may be as many as 550 ransomware-related attacks every day in Singapore. However, many cases may go unreported. Some people may decide to reformat their affected computer, and companies may not want to report it to protect their corporate reputation. CSA received 19 reports of ransomware cases from individuals and SMEs in 2016. Cerber, CryptoLocker and Locky were among the types of ransomware reported. As ransomware attacks grew in 2016, SingCERT issued an advisory in May 2016 to warn the public of such dangers and provided precautionary measures to be adopted. Phishing: More than 2,500 phishing URLs were detected in 2016, with the Banking & Finance sector appearing to be the most spoofed (31 per cent of all observed phishing URLs). Among online services, PayPal was spoofed most often in phishing campaigns. CSA also observed that file- hosting service providers were popular targets as hackers could easily harvest user credentials from there. Some Government institutions were also spoofed, as attackers sought personal data such as passport numbers that could be traded in underground markets. Defacements: Nearly 1,800 website defacements were detected in Singapore in 2016, with the majority being websites of SMEs from a range of businesses such as interior design and manufacturing. The perpetrators included hacktivists keen to promote a certain ideology, and whose attacks were observed across other countries as well. One in 10 defaced websites was hosted on servers running outdated operating systems, which may have resulted in them being vulnerable to such attacks. C&C Servers & DDoS: More than 60 C&C servers were detected. It is not immediately apparent who might have set them up, what they intended to do with these servers, and if any damage was done. Whenever a new C&C server is detected, SingCERT will inform the respective Web hosting providers to rectify the issue. Potentially, C&C servers could be used to control botnets – a network of compromised computers ¬– that in turn could be mobilised for DDoS attacks. The thousands of IoT devices marshalled for DDoS attacks in the USA in October 2016 may hint of similar threats to come. DDoS ransom threats were also observed in Singapore’s cyberspace, believed to be carried out by cyber criminal groups. 2“Singapore cyberspace” refers to websites ending with the .SG domain or mention Singapore in its URL, IP addresses used in Singapore or Internet Service Providers (ISP) that are located in Singapore. COMMON CYBER THREATS IN SINGAPORE Phishing Site Phishing E-mail A conducive environment for monitoring, early detection, and quick response to cyber threats and attacks also requires effort in these areas: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 8 9Chapter 1 | Cyber Threats Singapore Faces CYBER THREATS SINGAPORE FACES This inaugural edition of the Singapore Cyber Landscape 2016 will provide a closer look at the cybersecurity situation here, including qualitative and quantitative reviews of the nation’s cyber health, and some of the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore’s (CSA) response and recovery efforts. On the frontline of such efforts is the National Cyber Security Command (NCSC), which monitors and responds to cyber threats, and research and makes sense of the implications of these threats to Singapore’s CII, businesses and individuals. The NCSC carries out such work through three teams, namely the National Cyber Threat Monitoring Centre (NCTMC), National Cyber Incident Response Centre (NCIRC), and National Cyber Threat Analysis Centre (NCTAC). Through the NCSC, data from incidents in Singapore’s cyberspace are analysed. “Singapore’s cyberspace” will include domain names with “.sg” or Singapore-mentions, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses used in Singapore, or Internet Service Providers (ISPs) based in Singapore. In the event of major cyber incidents affecting Singapore’s CIIs, CSA, supported by NCSC, will take on the role of the national incident manager, coordinating cross-sector incident response, implementing specific national-level mitigation measures, and providing incident response assistance to the affected CIIs. CHAPTER 1 THREATS TO CRITICAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE (CII) Cyber-attacks on CIIs can result in widespread disruptive and destructive impact on society and the economy. A particularly severe attack could even have spillover effects on the region and the rest of the world. Cyber- attackers are constantly sharpening their ability to carry out such attacks, and their objectives range from financial gain to ideological or nationalistic causes. CSA has identified 11 CII sectors. They are: Energy, Water, Banking & Finance, Government, Healthcare, Media, Infocomm, Land Transport, Maritime, Aviation, and Security & Emergency. In 2016, several CIIs were affected by malware infection, in particular, ransomware. To better guard against such threats and attacks, the Government has been conducting cyber exercises over the years to improve the critical sectors’ readiness and incident response plans. In March 2016, Exercise Cyber Star, a multi-sector exercise was conducted by CSA. It brought together representatives from the Infocomm, Energy, Banking & Finance, and Government sectors to exercise their responses to a nationwide cyber-attack. 10 11 Chapter 1 Cyber Threats Singapore Faces NCIRC is the operational arm of NCSC that responds to cyber threats and incidents affecting the critical information infrastructure in Singapore. As the National Cyber Incident Manager, NCIRC maintains strategic oversight of significant cyber incidents in the critical sectors to assess Singapore’s cyber posture. During cyber crises, NCIRC is responsible for coordinating cross-sector incident response efforts and directing national-level mitigation measures. SingCERT is the national CERT. Under the aegis of NCIRC, it tracks the broader Singapore cyber landscape to identify significant threats, and issues cybersecurity advisories to Singaporeans. SingCERT also works with foreign CERTs to manage cross-border cyber incidents. NCTMC plays a key role in maintaining cyber situational awareness to aid in the discovery of cyber threats that are of national significance. NCTMC also forewarns the nation’s critical sectors on emerging cyber threats unique to their operating environment. In cyber incidents involving multiple sectors, the centre will coordinate with the Sector Leads to provide quick and timely alerts to cross-sector threats as part of the national-level response. NCTAC conducts all-source research and analysis to provide strategic insights on the Singapore cyber landscape. NCTAC’s research and analysis also include geopolitical perspectives, which often underpin the motivations and actions of cyber actors. NCTAC’s insights aim to inform CSA operations, national cyber policy-making, and contribute to public education. NATIONAL CYBER INCIDENT RESPONSE CENTRE (NCIRC) NATIONAL CYBER THREAT MONITORING CENTRE (NCTMC) NATIONAL CYBER THREAT ANALYSIS CENTRE (NCTAC) NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY COMMAND One example of segregating networks is the Internet Surfing Separation policy the Singapore Government announced in June 2016, that will help to prevent data from being transmitted to or extracted from the Internet. 12 13 THREATS TO GOVERNMENT The Singapore Government had its share of cyber-attacks in 2016. Public agencies faced attacks that included phishing and APTs (See Chapter 2, Page 24 for an analysis on APT). The Internet Surfing Separation (ISS) policy announced in June 2016 will go a significant way towards securing the Government’s CASE STUDY APT Malware Infection in Government Organisation WHEN Late-2016 BACKGROUND CSA was alerted to a possible APT malware infection in an organisation in the public sector. CSA found the malware infection – which had backdoor capabilities – on one Internet-facing computer. Fortunately, the infected computer had not been used to process sensitive information. EVIDENCE Suspicious attempts to connect at regular intervals to a C&C server, which was later determined to be a compromised server. CASE ANALYSIS From the investigations, CSA assessed it to be the work of a state-sponsored APT actor, which up till then had not been known to be active in Asia. The incident however was assessed to be more an opportunistic one than a targeted attack. Investigations also concluded that data was not exfiltrated, though the malware had the capability to do so. The malware was also not observed to have spread beyond the infected computer to the rest of the organisation’s network. The organisation did not detect the malicious network traffic earlier because the warning indicators and malware signatures were not on known anti-malware databases. The APT actor was believed to be a group supported by a foreign government (also referred to as a “state-sponsored group”), to engage in cyber espionage to further their national interests. It had not been known to value targets in Asia, but with this incident, it could suggest an expanded scope of targets in the region. TACTICS, TECHNIQUES & PROCEDURES Attackers used sophisticated anti-detection and infection techniques: multi-stage infection through a phishing e-mail that ultimately allowed the attacker backdoor access. FOLLOW-UP ACTION Recommendations were provided to the organisation to further secure its ICT environment and prevent similar incidents. These included blocking unauthorised macros or programs, implementing application whitelisting, and segregating networks. ICT environment. In removing the link between the public officers’ computers from the Internet, it can disrupt the attackers’ cyber kill chain. Without a path out to the Internet, the attacker will not have remote access to the Government’s network, and will not be able to extract data as easily. Chapter 1 Cyber Threats Singapore Faces Chapter 1 Cyber Threats Singapore Faces INVOICE SCAM! HOSPITAL 14 15 THREATS TO HEALTHCARE SECTOR In 2016, the Healthcare sector experienced the highest number of ransomware attacks compared to other sectors. Although these attacks did not affect Singapore’s overall healthcare system, they served to remind everyone to be more careful when handling files and data in their day-to-day work. CASE STUDY Ransomware in Healthcare Sector THREATS TO SMEs As more SMEs go digital, they may find themselves facing new threats, such as phishing attacks and defacements. Through greater awareness and some technical know-how, SMEs may be better able to defend themselves against cyber-attacks. In Singapore, 43 per cent of security incidents reported to SingCERT by individuals and SMEs occurred through phishing attacks. Cyber criminals may attack SMEs as a means of getting to larger corporations, to which SMEs are suppliers. One of the most common cyber threats SMEs reported to SingCERT in 2016 was business e-mail scams. Millions of dollars were lost through phishing scams where hackers impersonated company executives or business partners via e-mail. SPF figures also showed that there was a 20 per cent rise in e-mail impersonation scams in 2016 compared to 2015. WHEN May 2016 BACKGROUND A Singapore company received an e-mail apparently from a known supplier, requesting for the payment for the purchase of company supplies from Japan. The company found the e-mail suspicious as it contained an unfamiliar domain name, and reported it to SingCERT. No funds were transferred to a bank in Hong Kong as requested in the e-mail, and no financial loss was reported. EVIDENCE Invoice attachments, e-mail headers. CASE ANALYSIS Results from an analysis of the e-mail headers showed that the e-mail was spoofed, and suggested that the Japanese supplier’s e-mail account might have been compromised. TACTICS, TECHNIQUES & PROCEDURES E-mail spoofing, impersonation. FOLLOW-UP ACTION SingCERT provided its findings to the Singapore company owner, and proposed that they alert the Japanese supplier of the possible compromise of its e-mail account. The company owner also lodged police reports in Singapore and Hong Kong. Such incidents are not new; SingCERT observed that several businesses have been tricked into transferring funds to scammers. It recommends SMEs to always verify details – for instance to call the supplier (telephone) first to confirm the sums – before making any funds transfer. WHEN Late-2016 BACKGROUND Ransomware incidents were detected in Singapore’s Healthcare sector, with individual users unable to access their files on the network. Investigations by CSA showed that these users were infected after they opened attachments or clicked on links found in e-mails they had received. Immediate action by the respective institutions and the healthcare authorities helped to contain the issue. EVIDENCE Cryptoware found in system, and files were encrypted. CASE ANALYSIS Upon detection, affected computers were successfully isolated to prevent the ransomware infection from spreading to the wider network. As a result, there was no impact to the sector’s CII assets. The affected computers were wiped clean, had their programs reinstalled, and data restored from back-ups. TACTICS, TECHNIQUES & PROCEDURES Phishing e-mails, websites hosting malicious files. FOLLOW-UP ACTION Strengthen human security of networks and systems by increasing user awareness of ways to avoid ransomware and other malware infections. CASE STUDY Invoice Scam Case 16 17 THREATS TO INDIVIDUALS From CSA’s Public Awareness Survey conducted in August 2016, one in three respondents said that they did not install security apps in their mobile phones, citing reasons such as not seeing the need to, or that the app took up too much space. Other poor practices include not managing their passwords securely, connecting to open and non-password protected Wi-Fi networks in public places, and not adopting Two-Factor Authentication when the option is available. The most common cyber threats to individuals are compromised e-mail accounts and malicious websites. E-mail accounts may be compromised by malware sent through e-mails (e.g. phishing e-mails). Such e-mails are targeted and may appear personal. They prey on the likelihood of a person clicking on links or opening attachments, with messages containing payment requests, warnings, threats or other triggers for action. By clicking on malicious links or opening malicious attachments, individuals unwittingly allow unauthorised access to their e-mail account. Once the attackers have gained entry, they can carry out more e-mail scams by impersonating the legitimate e-mail account holder, or they could dig deeper into the victim’s system to steal login credentials, banking information and other personal data. Individuals tend to fall victim to cybercrime for two reasons: lack of cybersecurity awareness, and poor cyber hygiene practices. While having a connected lifestyle is almost a necessity today, many individuals are not sufficiently diligent about securing their digital lives. Some users assume that the standard filters in Web-based or corporate e-mail servers will block out all malicious e-mails, and therefore exercise less care when opening e-mails. As attack methods evolve, attackers will keep trying to circumvent such filters. In short, e-mails should always be handled with caution. Many individuals may also fall victim to malicious websites when they click on unfamiliar Web links or pop-ups while surfing the Web. Malicious websites generally attempt to spoof legitimate ones, luring people into transacting there instead of the actual website. This is a common technique to elicit personal data, login credentials, or even money from unsuspecting individuals. In Singapore, legitimate online merchants and services that have been spoofed include PayPal, Google, Dropbox, and the e-services offered by the Ministry of Manpower and the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority. As e-commerce, e-services, and Cloud storage services continue to grow in availability and use, users need to be more aware of such attempts to steal their personal data and money, to avoid falling into such traps. 2016 also saw an increase in the number of ransomware incidents reported to SingCERT. Individuals and SMEs in Singapore who reported being victims of ransomware have generally chosen not to pay the ransoms, but instead would restore their data from backups. Performing regular backups is one of the key ways to deal with ransomware3. (See Page 31 on ways to deal with ransomware) Ransomware is a category of malware used by attackers to encrypt data on targeted systems and demanding a ransom for the data to be decrypted. 3 SingCERT released an advisory on May 2016 providing tips on how to deal with ransomware – [SingCERT] Ransomware. (2016 May 6). Retrieved from Chapter 1 Cyber Threats Singapore Faces WHEN February 2016 BACKGROUND An individual reported to SingCERT that his computer was displaying a message that his files had been encrypted, and that payment in Bitcoins was required to restore the files. EVIDENCE Ransom note displayed on computer screen, detailing steps that needed to be taken to decrypt the files. CASE ANALYSIS SingCERT found that the individual’s computer had been infected with the CryptoLocker ransomware. TACTICS, TECHNIQUES & PROCEDURES Malware infection, encryption. FOLLOW-UP ACTION As a decryption tool for this ransomware was available online, SingCERT guided the affected individual in using it to restore his files. The individual was also advised on cyber hygiene best practices to avoid being infected again. Screenshot of Ransom Note CASE STUDY Individual infected with Ransomware 18 19 WHEN February 2016 BACKGROUND An individual reported to SingCERT that his Gmail account may have been compromised. This was after he had clicked on an attachment in an e-mail that led him to a website apparently containing Google Doc templates. At the website, he was prompted to enter his e-mail password. Concerned that he might have already gone too far by opening the attachment, he checked with the sender of the e-mail, who informed him that the e-mail was fake. EVIDENCE Suspicious e-mail with a malicious document attached. CASE ANALYSIS A hyperlink was observed when the mouse cursor hovered over the attachment icon. The hyperlink directed the individual to a website set up to phish information from Internet users. TACTICS, TECHNIQUES & PROCEDURES E-mail with suspicious links or malicious attachments, stealing credentials. FOLLOW-UP ACTION SingCERT advised the individual to check if his account had indeed been compromised by reviewing the log-in sessions via his Gmail security settings, a section which would show the devices that had access to his account. SingCERT also advised the individual to strengthen his e-mail account settings by activating the Two-Factor Authentication option. CASE STUDY Compromised Gmail Account Chapter 1 Cyber Threats Singapore Faces 22 23 ACTORS TARGETING SINGAPORE CYBER THREATS IN FOCUS CHAPTER 2 Because of the nature of cyberspace and the design of the Internet, it is always a challenge to attribute cyber-attacks to specific individuals or groups. There may be some who would openly publish their success story – such as those who post on public websites about their website defacements – but even then, they hide behind a pseudonym or “nickname” that may be hard to link to a specific individual or group. There are elusive cyber-attackers that remain at-large, after having caused significant damage or losses. For example, the attackers behind major global cyber-attacks in 2016 who remain largely unknown include those behind the attacks against the SWIFT global banking network and the DDoS attacks in the United States of America and France. These actors often hide or mask their tracks to make it difficult to pin them down physically or geographically. Some usual means of doing so include using spoofed IP addresses that may not show the physical location in which they operate. Threat actors targeting Singapore run the gamut from the script- kiddies to APTs. Their behaviour, intentions, capabilities, are always evolving and require close monitoring. CSA studies the trends of cyber- attacks in order to identify measures that individuals, businesses and the nation can adopt to better defend against similar or new threats. Chapter 2 | Cyber Threats in Focus: Actors Targeting Singapore 24 25 ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREAT(APT) APTs operate stealthily and with sophistication, often hiding in networks for prolonged periods to plan their targeted attacks. APTs, which may refer to the type of attack, or the threat actor or group, are also often state-sponsored. Their mission includes espionage, data exfiltration, and data manipulation. Cyberspace presents a rich target environment and the rise in geopolitical tensions may potentially spill over into cyberspace with APT groups targeting key assets in Singapore and the region. Cyber activities associated with state actors are becoming more overt in recent times. Cyberspace is one environment through which sensitive information is obtained for state-on-state espionage. As geopolitical tensions rise, the need for international cyber norms becomes more pressing. (See Page 40 on Singapore’s efforts to promote International Cyber Norms). APT groups active in the Asia- Pacific region include APT1 and APT30; and Southeast Asia-based PLATINUM. CII sectors such as the Government, Banking & Finance, Healthcare and Energy sectors are attractive targets for APT attacks because a strike on them could have significant impact on the economy and society. One APT Hacktivism is the act of hacking, or breaking into a computer system, and/or defacing webpages to promote a political or ideological message. Hacking has arguably become an increasingly attractive alternative to conducting physical street protests as the Internet affords hacktivists anonymity and reach. In 2016, there were a total of 1,750 Web defacement cases related to Singapore. Most of the websites defaced belonged to SMEs from a range of sectors including home interior design to healthcare. The hacktivists appear to be politically-motivated groups from the Middle East, and had also concurrently conducted their mass defacement activities on websites around the world. group was discovered to be eyeing a Singapore institution, using its signature tactic of phishing on individuals there. Through close collaboration between the institution and the authorities, the APT attempt was detected and halted before further harm could be done. The early identification and stopping of malicious APT activity is a multi-stakeholder effort that would involve the intelligence community, law enforcement agencies, the targeted institution, and even foreign counterparts. This group appears to be a politically-motivated hacktivist group from the Middle East. The group carried out website defacement attacks that often included messages bearing their views on issues such as the conflicts in Syria and Palestine. The group would typically replace the home page of the affected website with a cartoon of a devil carrying a pitchfork. This group has been responsible for defacing as many as 339 Singapore websites in 2016, accounting for about 20 per cent of Singapore websites that were defaced last year. Targets included organisations in the non-profit sector. However, the group does not appear to target Singapore companies alone, as their acts of mass defacements were also carried out against company websites in other countries, including India and Iran. (See Page 32: Common Cyber Threats in Singapore - Website Defacement). HACKTIVISTS CII SECTORS SUCH AS THE GOVERNMENT, BANKING & FINANCE, HEALTHCARE AND ENERGY SECTORS ARE ATTRACTIVE TARGETS FOR APT ATTACKS BECAUSE A STRIKE ON THEM COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY AND SOCIETY. Owned by Defacer G Chapter 2 Cyber Threats in Focus: Actors Targeting Singapore CASE STUDY Top Defacer in Singapore PROPORTION OF CYBERCRIME TO OVERALL CRIME CASES ROSE FROM 7.9 PER CENT IN 2014 TO 13.7 PER CENT IN 2016 26 27 CYBER CRIMINALS Singaporeans rely on the Internet for news and information, to connect with friends on social media, and to shop and transact online. Consequently, they have also become targets of cyber criminals who go online to seek illicit monetary gains. SPF has observed that criminals have been increasingly moving their activities online, with the proportion of cybercrimes to the total number of crimes in all categories (inclusive of physical crimes) increasing over the past two years. The proportion of cybercrime to the total number of crime cases has been growing from 7.9 per cent in 2014 to 13.7 per cent in 2016. In 2016, cyber criminals mostly committed online cheating cases (83 per cent), followed by CMCA cases such as unauthorised access to computer material (15 per cent) and cyber extortion (2 per cent) respectively4. The top three categories of online cheating 4 The term cybercrime refers to (a) offences where a computer system is the target of a criminal act; and (b) offences where traditional crimes are committed via the means of a computer system. The first category of offences refers to offences under the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act (CMCA) and the second category of offences refer to traditional crimes performed online such as online cheating, and cyber extortion. Ministry of Home Affairs, National Cybercrime Action Plan. (2016, July 20). Retrieved from news-and-publications/media- releases/20160720_others_-launch_ of_the_national_cybercrime_action_ plan_others In June 2016, a Singapore institution received a cyber threat which appeared to be from a cyber criminal group known for its DDoS attacks. They demanded the payment of a ransom, failing which they would launch a DDoS attack on the institution. The threat was sent in the form of a ransom e-mail to the institution, demanding for Bitcoins to be paid. A “demo attack” – akin to a warning shot by the attackers – was launched before the due date, but the DDoS threat was eventually not carried out. CSA assessed that the threat was likely from a copycat group. The actual cyber criminal group is infamous for being able to launch DDoS attacks of more than 1 Tbps, and had previously issued similar ransom threats to several companies in Switzerland. Identifying attackers and attributing attacks to them becomes even more challenging as actors within the community mimic one another to hide their tracks. CASE STUDY DDoS Copycats cases were namely e-commerce, Internet love scam and credit- for-sex. Notably, CMCA cases more than doubled year-on-year, from 280 in 2015 to 691 in 2016. The top five CMCA cases in 2016, in no particular order, were related to ransomware, hacking, compromise of online accounts (such as Facebook), SingPass and Internet banking accounts. Cyber criminals will continue to be a significant threat actor group as they adopt more sophisticated social engineering techniques to lure their victims. The anonymity provided by the Internet and the borderless nature of cyberspace allow cyber criminals to operate freely and anonymously. Given this challenge, the Government, law enforcement agencies and the international community will have to work even more closely together to fight cybercrimes. 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 0 2014 2015 2016 Chapter 2 Cyber Threats in Focus: Actors Targeting Singapore 28 29 INSIDER THREATS Insider threats pose a significant threat to organisations. Insiders – unintentionally or intentionally malicious – can weaken the best cyber defences. From IBM’s 2016 Cyber Security Intelligence Index, insiders were found to be responsible for 60 per cent of cyber-attacks5. Insiders are a potent source of threat and a significant concern as they can unintentionally or intentionally leak data or compromise systems, and it takes more than technology to prevent insider threats. Processes for instance, need to be in place to ensure access to the organisation’s data, especially sensitive ones, is strictly controlled. Many Singaporeans were found to be unaware of proper cybersecurity practices based on a Public Awareness Survey conducted by CSA6. Consequently, this may make them potential “insider threats”. They may inadvertently cause their office network to be compromised when they use an infected thumb drive that opens a “backdoor” for the attacker to enter the system. Using weak passwords that can be easily guessed, like “ABC123” or “password”, would allow the attacker to enter otherwise confidential areas of the organisation’s network. There are also malicious insiders who could abuse their existing access to sensitive data and intellectual property for unlawful purposes. Malicious insiders could be disgruntled former employees who leave deliberate backdoors to exfiltrate data after they leave the organisation. They are a particularly dangerous group of threat actors because they know the network well and can find ways to disrupt or degrade critical services without raising suspicion. 5 “Reviewing a year of Serious data breaches, major attacks, and new vulnerabilities,” IBM X-Force Research 2016 Cyber Security Intelligence Index, p.11. 6 Tiffany Fumiko Tay, “6 in 10 connect to unprotected Wi-Fi networks: Cyber Security Agency, The Straits Times, 16 February, 2017, connect-to-unprotected-wi-fi-networks-cyber-security-agency In March 2016, an employee from the Healthcare sector used her workplace computer to access her personal e-mail account. She opened what appeared to be a Microsoft Office document but was in fact a malicious file, that downloaded a ransomware into the workplace computer. As the computer was connected to the rest of the organisation, the infection quickly spread to other machines on the network. The infection forced the organisation to reformat all the affected computers and restore data from backups. This incident highlights the need to heighten cyber awareness among employees, and always be ready to kick-in business continuity plans. FROM CSA’S SURVEY CONDUCTED IN AUGUST 2016, MANY SINGAPOREANS WERE FOUND TO BE UNAWARE OF PROPER CYBERSECURITY PRACTICES CASE STUDY Ransomware downloaded via personal e-mail infects office network Chapter 2 Cyber Threats in Focus: Actors Targeting Singapore 30 31 Following a noticeable rise in ransomware infections in Singapore and overseas, SingCERT released an advisory on ransomware in May 2016. Preventive measures against ransomware include: • Follow Internet-browsing best practices, such as not clicking on suspect links as that may download ransomware; • Updating software with the recommended patches to reduce the likelihood of known vulnerabilities being exploited; • Performing regular backups to recover files that have been encrypted; • Using available decryption tools to restore files that the attacker has “locked up”. COMMON CYBER THREATS IN SINGAPORE NCSC analyses internal and other data sources, which include open source data, to provide actionable insights on four common threats and attacks in Singapore’s cyberspace7. The four cyber threats in focus are ransomware, website defacement, phishing websites/URLs, C&C servers and DDoS. By understanding the means and motivation behind these attacks on Singaporeans and Singapore, one can try to take measures to prevent, detect and/or mitigate such threats. 8 Shukla, A. (2016, July 13). Singapore receives 550 cyber threats each day. Retrieved from 9 Singapore ranks 4th in Asia in terms of Internet penetration rate (81.3 per cent), after South Korea (92.1 per cent), Japan (91.0 per cent), and Taiwan (83.8 per cent) respectively. Source: RANSOMWARE Definition: A type of malware that encrypts files on a victim’s device, rendering them unusable until a ransom is paid, usually in the form of Bitcoin. It is spread through e-mail or malicious advertisements that appear when users access unsafe websites. Motivation: Financial gains and/or business disruptions. Target(s): Usually opportunistic, involving any individuals and companies of all sizes. Singapore has joined the “No More Ransom” initiative by Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) to fight cybercrime in both the public and private sectors. The initiative aims to assist victims of ransomware to decrypt their encrypted data by offering the decryption tools made available free of charge on the portal and to teach users how to protect themselves. The portal is now available in 14 languages and contains 40 free decryption tools. More about EC3’s initiative can be found here: In 2016, there were 19 ransomware cases reported to SingCERT, up from the two cases reported in 2015. Cerber, CryptoLocker and Locky were among the types of ransomware reported. The actual number of victims may be more as ransomware cases tend to go unreported. According to Trend Micro, an international cybersecurity company, it detected about 550 ransomware-related threats in Singapore each day8. Singapore is especially vulnerable due to its high Internet penetration rate.9 Individuals and “NO ONE IS SPARED FROM RANSOMWARE” SMEs accounted for most of the ransomware cases reported to CSA. Companies may be reluctant to admit being affected, as this may affect the reputation of their business. Globally, hospitals and universities were also hit by ransomware attacks in 2016. Payments are usually made using Bitcoin, a type of online currency preferred by cyber criminals given it is harder to trace it back to them. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the hacker will decrypt the files as promised once they receive the payment. 7 “Singapore cyberspace” can refer to websites ending with the .SG domain or mention Singapore in its URL, IP addresses used in Singapore or Internet Service Providers (ISP) that are located in Singapore. Chapter 2 Cyber Threats in Focus: Common Cyber Threats in Singapore 32 33 Definition: Much like virtual graffiti, hackers change the visual appearance of a single webpage or an entire website by gaining unauthorised access to the web hosting server. Defaced websites may also contain malicious code to infect visitors to the affected site. Motivation: Promote political or religious agendas through “hacktivism”, achieve online fame in hacker communities, and/or distract victims from the “real” cyber-attack such as a data breach. Target(s): Usually opportunistic, involving websites and/or web servers with known vulnerabilities. Website owners should keep their applications (including plug-ins) and operating systems regularly updated to prevent hackers from exploiting known vulnerabilities on outdated systems. Companies that rely on third-party hosting providers for their Web hosting needs should find out from their providers about the measures that are in place to address potential vulnerabilities. WEBSITE DEFACEMENT In Singapore, 1,750 website defacements were reported in 2016. The majority of the affected websites belonged to SMEs from a range of businesses, including interior design, logistics, manufacturing and construction. One in 10 defaced websites were hosted on outdated operating systems such as Windows Server 2003 for which Microsoft ended its support in July 2015. Such operating systems may no longer have security patches Number of defaced Singapore websites “1 IN 10 WEBSITES FOUND HOSTED ON OUTDATED OPERATING SYSTEMS” PHISHING WEBSITE / URLS In 2016, 2,512 phishing URLs with a Singapore-link were found. Banking and financial services websites appeared to be the most commonly spoofed websites in Singapore. They represented more than 30 per cent of the phishing websites found. File-hosting service providers such as Dropbox and Google Drive, and technology companies such as Apple and Google are commonly spoofed by hackers. Number of phishing URLs linked to Singapore 10 Sucuri is a security company which focused on detecting and remediating compromised websites. 11 PayPal holds 77 per cent of the market share in online payment industry. Source: datanyze.com/market-share/payments/ Most targeted brands for phishing campaigns for new vulnerabilities and hence are easier for hackers to exploit. According to Sucuri10, an American website security company, WordPress was the most targeted content management system (CMS) in 2016 globally. Popular CMS such as Joomla and WordPress, which most websites run on, can be infiltrated by hackers due to vulnerabilities, and improper deployment, configuration or maintenance by their webmasters. Government organisations such as Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) were also spoofed in 2016. Online payment service provider PayPal was the most targeted brand, likely due its widespread use among online merchants and its customers11. File-hosting and Cloud storage service providers are becoming popular targets as well. Definition: Websites that are compromised or created by hackers to trick Internet users into believing they are accessing a legitimate, trusted website. Motivation: Obtain personal information, which can be used for future cyber-attacks, and/or financial gain. Target(s): Usually opportunistic, involving potentially anybody and everybody. Users should always seek to verify the URL and e-mail address of senders, and look out for warning signs such as poor spelling or grammar. When in doubt, users should always verify the website’s address before submitting any sensitive information online. Chapter 2 Cyber Threats in Focus: Common Cyber Threats in Singapore SingCERT published an advisory in Oct 2016 to inform business and individuals of the need to enhance the security of IoT devices. This could reduce the likelihood of that these devices are leveraged to conduct widespread DDoS attacks. Some measures include: • Ensuring that remote access capabilities were disabled; and • Changing device usernames and passwords from the default. 34 35 COMMAND & CONTROL (C&C) SERVERS AND DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE (DDOS) More than 60 C&C servers were observed within Singapore’s cyberspace in 2016. The number of C&C servers was observed to be growing gradually in the first eight months of 2016, peaking in August, before decreasing towards the end of the year. Such servers often serve as the launch pad for cyber-attacks, including DDoS attacks. Whenever a new C&C server is detected, SingCERT will inform the respective Web-hosting providers to rectify the issue. In 2016, DDoS attacks globally crossed the peak attack volume of 1 Tbps (DDoS attacks commonly fall in the 10 – 50 Gigabit per second range). Attacks of this scale were enabled through new malware (e.g. Mirai) that exploited vulnerabilities in unsecured IoT devices, such as webcams, routers and printers. The malware essentially would hijack these devices, causing them to generate malicious traffic that can be directed at specific systems. 2016 also saw the growth of DDoS extortion threats. Organisations receive e-mails from hackers threatening to launch a DDoS attack against them unless payment is made, usually via Bitcoin. A number of organisations in Singapore have received such threats. Misconfigured services on servers continued to be seen in Singapore’s cyberspace throughout 2016. Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP), DNS and Network Time Protocol (NTP) are some of the services that, if not configured properly, can be used to facilitate DDoS attacks. Remediation for these vulnerabilities can be as simple as unchecking an option in the server settings. Number of Unique C&C Servers observed per month in Singapore “SSDP, DNS AND NTP ACCOUNT FOR 70 PER CENT OF VULNERABLE SERVICES IN SINGAPORE THAT CAN BE USED IN A DDOS ATTACK” Definition: A C&C server is a machine operated by hackers to communicate with devices that have been infected with malware. Instructions are communicated to the group of infected devices, collectively known as a botnet, to perform malicious activities such as DDoS attacks. A DDoS attack occurs when a system is bombarded with large volumes of data or specially-crafted malicious traffic sent from a botnet, affecting the system’s ability to respond to legitimate users in a timely manner. Motivation: Conduct malicious activities such as data theft, e-mail spam campaigns and DDoS attacks. DDoS attacks create disruptions to victim’s business operations, and/ or distract victim from the “real” cyber-attack such as a data breach. Target(s): Any organisation, although those in the financial and gaming industries are commonly targeted. Chapter 2 Cyber Threats in Focus: Common Cyber Threats in Singapore 36 37 CHAPTER 3 KEEPING OUR CYBERSPACE SAFE AND TRUSTWORTHY TOGETHER Raising Cyber Awareness Among Individuals and Businesses Developing Singapore’s Cybersecurity Professionals Facilitating Exchanges with Regional and International Partners Cybersecurity for a Smart Nation While digital connectivity exposes everyone to cyber threats, it also continues to open up opportunities for all. Through cyberspace, we keep in touch with one another, do our work, and run enterprises. Given the heavy reliance on cyberspace, it is therefore important that our cyberspace is kept safe and trustworthy, for everyone to continue benefitting from it. The ways to doing so include: raising cyber awareness and capabilities among individuals and businesses, developing cybersecurity professionals in Singapore, facilitating exchanges with regional and international partners, and investing in Research and Development (R&D) for a secure Smart Nation. a) b) c) d) Chapter 3 | Keeping Our Cyberspace Safe and Trustworthy Together 38 39 RAISING CYBER AWARENESS AMONG INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES CSA conducted a Public Awareness Survey in August 2016 with 2,000 respondents on their cybersecurity awareness and cyber hygiene. While seven in 10 respondents agreed that everyone has a role to play in cybersecurity, many of them were also found to be not taking safety measures when going online. For example, one in three respondents do not manage their passwords carefully. These findings, among others, reveal that there is room for improvement when it comes to individual cyber hygiene practices. To educate and reach out to the public on cybersecurity, CSA manages the GoSafeOnline and SingCERT websites and social media platforms that provide cybersecurity news and resources to individuals and businesses. Members of the Cyber Security Awareness Alliance, which CSA co-chairs, have also been giving media interviews, talks to schools, the public, and businesses to raise cybersecurity awareness. Advisories issued by SingCERT in 2016 covered topics like ransomware, DDoS attacks, and compromised remote servers, which were timely given the increasing number of incidents stemming from ransomware infections and exploitations of weak system configurations. To bring the message to an even wider audience, two episodes of CrimeWatch, a long-running television programme, were produced on cyber-related topics. These were aired on free-to-air television channels in Singapore. CSA worked with the SPF and National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) to produce these episodes covering cybercrimes involving banking malware, ransomware, and unauthorised access to data in computer networks and systems. Together with the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC), CSA produced a series of activity books to educate primary school students on cyber safety. Two issues were produced in 2016 and distributed to all Primary 5 students in Singapore with copies made available online. To expand the outreach to SMEs, CSA worked with the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) and the National Security Coordination Cyber Safety Activity Book DEVELOPING SINGAPORE’S CYBERSECURITY PROFESSIONALS While Singapore works towards increasing cyber- savviness among her people, it requires competent cybersecurity professionals, capable of protecting both the infrastructure and the individuals who use the infrastructure. Singapore’s efforts to groom its pool of cybersecurity professionals include: A way to build a common identity and increase the recognition of the cybersecurity profession is to foster strong Communities of Practice (COPs). Professional bodies are instrumental to driving the development of COPs to tackle cyber threats and career pathways for professionals. Such bodies are also integral to enhancing talent retention in the profession. CSA has engaged four key professional bodies – Association of Information Security Professionals; Singapore Computer Society; International Information System Security Certification Consortium also known as (ISC)2; and Information System Audit and Control Association (ISACA) – to build stronger communities. CSA will also work with IMDA and Workforce Singapore (WSG) on delivering better training and career opportunities for cybersecurity professionals. Complementing these efforts is the development of Singapore’s cybersecurity industry to spur the growth of high value jobs in Singapore that will in turn sustain efforts at developing the nation’s manpower. The availability of sophisticated and high value jobs, provided by a vibrant cybersecurity industry, provides for the professional growth and career progression of professionals, all of which are critical to countering cyber threats effectively. Enhancing and augmenting the professional pipeline The Cyber Security Associates and Technologists (CSAT) programme, a joint initiative by CSA and IMDA, aims to boost the pipeline of cybersecurity professionals. CSAT trains and upskills new and existing ICT and Engineering professionals for cybersecurity roles. Deepening the technical depth of professionals. CSA has been engaging the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHL) to shape cybersecurity into their curriculum. CSA will promote industry-IHL collaborations for more structured internships and leading edge cybersecurity training facilities. Young participants at the WhiteHacks@SG cybersecurity workshop and competition held from 12-13 Mar 2016. The event was organised by SMU Whitehat Society in partnership with ThinkSecure and CSA. Close to 40 students and young professional participated in the ‘The Future For You: Be a Cyber Security Champion’ engagement session organised by CSA on 23 Feb 2016 Chapter 3 Keeping Our Cyberspace Safe and Trustworthy Together Secretariat (NSCS) on the National Security Conference in November 2016 to raise cybersecurity awareness among businesses. The conference attracted more than 500 attendees from SMEs. To help SMEs build their digital capabilities to seize opportunities for growth in the digital economy, CSA is working with IMDA on the cybersecurity aspects of the SMEs Go Digital programme. For example, the new SME Digital Tech Hub (slated to be opened in the third quarter of 2017) will provide specialist technology advice to assist SMEs on their cybersecurity needs. 40 41 FACILITATING EXCHANGES WITH REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS In 2016, CSA signed Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with the Netherlands and the USA. The MoUs cover cooperation in areas such as operational exchange of cyber threat and attack- related information; sharing of best practices on national cybersecurity approaches, strategies and procedures and CII protection; certification of cybersecurity products and services; and training. Singapore has also initiated discussions on cyber norms with its ASEAN partners, including at the ASEAN Ministerial Conference on Cybersecurity (AMCC). The AMCC was organised during the Singapore International Cyber Week (SICW) in October 2016 for ASEAN Ministers and senior officials from the telecommunications and other relevant sectors to discuss regional cybersecurity issues. It also saw ASEAN Member States agreeing on the value of developing a set of practical cybersecurity norms of behaviour in ASEAN, and calling for closer cooperation and stronger coordination on regional capacity-building initiatives. Such new initiatives will add to existing efforts which have been ongoing for many years. These include a capacity-building workshop jointly organised by Singapore and the USA for ASEAN countries in August 2016, and the annual ASEAN CERT Incident Drill (referred to as “ACID” by its participants), which has been testing the incident-handling procedures of ASEAN CERTS over the last 10 years. CYBERGREEN Initiated by the Japan Computer Emergency Response Team in 2014, the CyberGreen project aims to provide a cyber- health check of countries by highlighting the levels of infections seen in each country. In 2016, Singapore became one of the founding sponsors of the global initiative. CSA will work with IMDA and telcos to clean up the infections in cyberspace to improve Singapore’s overall cyber hygiene. International collaboration is pivotal to global cybersecurity. Singapore has been actively involved in various international platforms on cybersecurity, from multilateral discussions on international cyber norms to bilateral cooperation. Cyber Norms discussion at the International Cyber Leaders’ Symposium held at the inaugural Singapore International Cyber Week on 10 Oct 2016 Ministers and Senior Officials from ASEAN Member States at the inaugural ASEAN Ministerial Conference on Cybersecurity held on 11 Oct 2016 Chapter 3 Keeping Our Cyberspace Safe and Trustworthy Together 42 43 CYBERSECURITY FOR A SMART NATION CSA strongly advocates the security-by- design approach, which means designing and building in security from the outset, and throughout every phase of the software and hardware development lifecycle. This approach involves a rigorous process that includes (i) threat-risk assessments, (ii) optimising system design by balancing the trade-offs among security, usability and cost, and (iii) penetration testing. This approach will also underpin the design and development of Singapore’s Smart Nation. While a Smart Nation creates new opportunities for work and leisure, it inadvertently expands the attack surface as well with the greater connectivity between devices, and among us. The cyber- attack in the United States in October 2016, carried out through compromised IoT devices, exemplifies such a threat. The Singapore Cyber Landscape 2016 has given an initial glimpse of the nation’s cyber health. We believe it is but the tip of the iceberg. We hope it will spur greater involvement of all stakeholders – Government agencies, Singapore’s cyber industry, professionals and students, academia and researchers, and providers of essential services – to come up with new ways to better defend ourselves against ever-evolving cyber threats. Cybersecurity is a team effort. Everyone has a part to play, and everyone has to play their part. At the national level, CSA will continue to spearhead initiatives and engage stakeholders to enhance Singapore’s cybersecurity posture. At the organisational and individual levels, efforts must be made too to raise awareness, capabilities and resilience to counter the cyber threats that Singapore will continue to face. If we work together as a team, we can make Singapore a safe and trustworthy Smart Nation. In April 2016, the CREST Singapore Chapter was established by CSA in collaboration with the Association of Information Security Professionals (AISP), IMDA, GovTech, the Association of Banks in Singapore and the Monetary Authority of Singapore. This is also the first CREST Chapter in Asia. CSA has directed that from June 2017, all penetration testing professionals and service providers who provide penetration testing services for CII need to be certified and accredited through CREST or equivalent certifying bodies. R&D work in cybersecurity will also be another critical front to push in the Smart Nation journey. Together with the National Research Foundation (NRF) and the other stakeholder agencies, CSA is driving Singapore’s cybersecurity R&D effort through the S$190m National Cybersecurity R&D programme, which aims at improving the trustworthiness of cyber infrastructure, raising the barrier for attackers, and developing threat-based solutions.

Singapore similarly faced such threats. Our high level of connectivity  comes with a corresponding level of vulnerability. While advances in  digital technology have opened up new possibilities to enhance our lives,  they have also exposed us to cyber threats that aim to cheat us, steal  or alter our data, disrupt our daily business activities, and cripple our  critical infrastructure.   Cyber-attacks are becoming more frequent and damaging. The impact of  a cyber-attack was keenly felt in the United States of America in October  2016, when a major Domain Name System (DNS) faced a Distributed  Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. Usually, DDoS attacks target websites,  but that attack struck at a core infrastructure of the Internet – essentially  the Web’s “telephone directory”. More than 80 organisations that relied  on it to connect visitors to their respective websites, could not do so. That  incident may have resulted in inconvenience mostly, but it could also be  considered a harbinger of things to come.   Even as this publication reviews the incidents in 2016, major cyber-attacks  in the first half of 2017 continue to put everyone on alert. The “WannaCry”  and “NotPetya” cyber-attacks led to disruptions in many services. These  incidents will be more fully presented in the Cyber Landscape 2017 report,  including how Singapore managed them even though we were relatively  unscathed. Such incidents, and their rapid global impact, remind us that  we must continue to do our part, to make cyberspace a safer and more  trustworthy one.   We hope that this first edition of the Singapore Cyber Landscape can point  you in the right direction. This review of Singapore’s cyber threat situation  provides some understanding of the gravity of what we as individuals,  organisations and the nation, are dealing with. Knowing the enemy, their  motivations and techniques, will allow us to have a fighting chance of  detecting intrusions earlier and dealing with them promptly.   In cyber, it is important to aim for resilience. This is because it is impossible  to prevent successful attacks 100 per cent of the time. As Singapore  pursues its plans to build a Smart Nation, we cannot afford to ignore the  threats that come with it. The Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA)  will be your partner in making cyberspace a safer space for all.  FOREWORD  David Koh Chief Executive Cyber Security Agency of Singapore  https://www.csa.gov.sg/singcert/news/advisories-alerts/wanacrypt0r-aka-wannacry--what-you-need-to-know-and-the-actions-to-take https://www.csa.gov.sg/singcert/news/advisories-alerts/technical-advisory-on-petya-petna-ransomware   4 5  At the frontline to monitor  and respond to cyber threats  in Singapore is CSA’s National  Cyber Security Command  (NCSC). It comprises the National  Cyber Threat Monitoring Centre  (NCTMC), National Cyber Incident  Response Centre (NCIRC), and the  National Cyber Threat Analysis  Centre (NCTAC). The centres  work closely together and with  stakeholders to respond to cyber  threats, research, and make sense  of the cyber landscape to protect   1 SingCERT is the focal point in Singapore for the public to report cybersecurity incidents and issues, and liaises with CERTs in other countries  to better manage the borderless nature of cyber threats. Businesses and individuals could report incidents to SingCERT by dialling its hotline –  (+65) 6323 5052 or e-mail to singcert@csa.gov.sg   access patient data. However, the  attacks did not disrupt Singapore’s  healthcare system as the incidents  were contained and no other  systems were compromised.   The Government sector also  continued to be targeted, facing  attacks from website defacements  to phishing. The Internet Surfing  Separation (ISS) policy announced  in June 2016 will go a significant  way towards securing the  Government’s Infocommunications   Technology (ICT) environment   as it would enhance the security   of the Government’s network   from attacks originating from   the Internet.   Besides attacks targeting these  critical sectors, NCSC also saw  individuals and small and medium  enterprises (SMEs) being victims  of website defacements, business  e-mail scams, phishing, and  ransomware. In Singapore,   43 per cent of cybersecurity   CYBER  LANDSCAPE  2016  THE NATIONAL  CYBER SECURITY  COMMAND  Globally, in 2016, IoT devices like  Wi-Fi routers and webcams were  hijacked to launch cyber-attacks,  specifically DDoS attacks. This  resulted in many websites and  services being inaccessible.  Ransomware was another  significant type of cyber-attack  that hit industries and individuals,  locking them out of their systems.  Singapore is certainly not immune  to these cyber threats, which can  be expected to evolve and emerge  in bigger, bolder and faster ways.  CSA is keeping a close watch  on the cyber landscape and, in  this publication, will provide an  analysis of the cyber threats that  Singapore faced between January  and December 2016.  The cyber-attacks and threats  covered in this publication are  just the tip of the iceberg. The  absolute number of incidents  will be hard to determine – despite  best efforts, not all cases are  reported or can be detected – but  CSA’s observations could provide  a baseline towards a further  understanding of Singapore’s  cyber threat landscape. In turn,  that may illuminate more ways   to better defend ourselves against  similar or new threats. The  Government will take the lead, and  partner the industry, academia,  public and people sectors, and  international counterparts, to  enhance cybersecurity for the  nation, so that Singaporeans  and Singapore can reap the long  term benefits of having a safe and  trustworthy cyberspace.   Cybercrime   Under Singapore’s Cybersecurity  Strategy launched in 2016, one  key priority is to build a safer  cyberspace for Singaporeans  and businesses. The area of  cybercrime comes under the  responsibility of the Singapore  Police Force (SPF).   The SPF noted an increase in  the proportion of cybercrimes to  overall crime cases from 7.9 per  cent in 2014 to 13.7 per cent in  2016, underscoring the growing  attractiveness of digital platforms  for criminals. Cases reported  under the Computer Misuse and  Cybersecurity Act (CMCA) more  than doubled year-on-year to  2016, with ransomware, and the  compromise of online and banking  accounts, constituting the top five  categories in 2016.   CMCA Cases  CRITICAL  CYBER  CONCERNS  Actors Targeting Singapore  Cyber threats can be carried  out by a host of different cyber- attackers, or threat actors as they  are commonly known. The cyber  community has long struggled  with the challenge of definitively  attributing the specific source  of a cyber-attack or crime, as  attackers can use a range of tools  to cover or distort their tracks.  Threat actors targeting Singapore  run the gamut from script- kiddies to Advanced Persistent  Threats (APTs). Their behaviour,  intentions, and capabilities are  always evolving and require  close watch. Globally, APTs are  a growing concern as they are  often undetectable in networks  for long periods. APTs may refer  to both the nature of the attack  (persistent and sophisticated),  and the attackers (well-organised  and usually state-sponsored).  APT groups generally target  government institutions and large  organisations for the purpose of  espionage and other illegal acts.  Singapore’s Critical Information  Infrastructure (CII), and to enable  a safer cyberspace for businesses  and individuals.  In 2016, NCSC saw cyber-attacks  of varying nature and impact  across many sectors, including  the Government, Banking &  Finance, and Healthcare sectors.  For instance, the Healthcare  sector was struck by ransomware  attacks that left some individual  healthcare practitioners unable to   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  incidents reported by individuals  and SMEs to the Singapore  Computer Emergency Response  Team (SingCERT)¹ were phishing  attacks. One of the most   common cyber threats SMEs  reported to SingCERT was  business e-mail scams.    6 7  Raising Cyber Awareness     Our outreach programmes  and roadshows aim to promote  cyber-savviness among  businesses and individuals.  SingCERT has issued advisories  to educate the public on cyber  issues such as ransomware,  DDoS attacks and compromised  remote servers.  Developing Cybersecurity  Professionals    Singapore is also growing its  cybersecurity ecosystem, which  includes boosting the talent pool.  The Cyber Security Associates   and Technologists (CSAT)  programme, a joint initiative by  CSA and the Infocomm Media  Development Authority (IMDA),  was launched in 2016 to train and  upskill new and existing ICT and  engineering professionals for  cybersecurity roles.  Regional and  International Exchanges  Singapore has been actively  involved in the past year in   various international platforms   on cybersecurity, from multilateral  discussions on cyber norms to  bilateral co-operation and regional  capacity-building programmes.  KEEPING OUR  CYBERSPACE SAFE AND  TRUSTWORTHY TOGETHER  Prevalent cyber threats observed in Singapore’s  cyberspace² in 2016 were defacements, phishing,  ransomware, and compromised Command & Control  (C&C) Servers, the last being potential launch-pads  for other cyber-attacks, such as DDoS. A snapshot  of these common cyber threats is as follows:  Examples of Phishing Scams:  Ransomware:  It is one of the biggest  cybersecurity threats  to businesses and  individuals today. Some  reports noted that there  may be as many as 550  ransomware-related  attacks every day in  Singapore. However,  many cases may go  unreported. Some people  may decide to reformat  their affected computer,  and companies may  not want to report  it to protect their  corporate reputation.  CSA received 19 reports  of ransomware cases  from individuals and  SMEs in 2016. Cerber,  CryptoLocker and Locky  were among the types of  ransomware reported.  As ransomware attacks  grew in 2016, SingCERT  issued an advisory in May  2016 to warn the public  of such dangers and  provided precautionary  measures to be adopted.   Phishing:  More than 2,500 phishing  URLs were detected in  2016, with the Banking  & Finance sector  appearing to be the most  spoofed (31 per cent of  all observed phishing  URLs). Among online  services, PayPal was  spoofed most often in  phishing campaigns. CSA  also observed that file- hosting service providers  were popular targets  as hackers could easily  harvest user credentials  from there. Some  Government institutions  were also spoofed,  as attackers sought  personal data such  as passport numbers  that could be traded in  underground markets.   Defacements:  Nearly 1,800 website  defacements were  detected in Singapore in  2016, with the majority  being websites of  SMEs from a range of  businesses such as  interior design and  manufacturing. The  perpetrators included  hacktivists keen to  promote a certain  ideology, and whose  attacks were observed  across other countries as  well. One in 10 defaced  websites was hosted on  servers running outdated  operating systems, which  may have resulted in  them being vulnerable  to such attacks.   C&C Servers & DDoS:  More than 60 C&C  servers were detected.  It is not immediately  apparent who might  have set them up, what  they intended to do with  these servers, and if  any damage was done.  Whenever a new C&C  server is detected,  SingCERT will inform the  respective Web hosting  providers to rectify the  issue. Potentially, C&C  servers could be used  to control botnets – a  network of compromised  computers ¬– that in  turn could be mobilised  for DDoS attacks. The  thousands of IoT devices  marshalled for DDoS  attacks in the USA in  October 2016 may hint of  similar threats to come.  DDoS ransom threats  were also observed in  Singapore’s cyberspace,  believed to be carried out  by cyber criminal groups.  2“Singapore cyberspace” refers to websites ending with the .SG domain or mention Singapore in its URL, IP addresses used in Singapore or Internet Service  Providers (ISP) that are located in Singapore.  COMMON  CYBER THREATS  IN SINGAPORE  Phishing Site  Phishing E-mail  A conducive environment for monitoring,  early detection, and quick response to  cyber threats and attacks also requires  effort in these areas:  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY    8 9Chapter 1   |   Cyber Threats Singapore Faces  CYBER THREATS SINGAPORE FACES  This inaugural edition of the Singapore Cyber  Landscape 2016 will provide a closer look at the  cybersecurity situation here, including qualitative  and quantitative reviews of the nation’s cyber  health, and some of the Cyber Security Agency of  Singapore’s (CSA) response and recovery efforts.   On the frontline of such efforts is the National  Cyber Security Command (NCSC), which monitors  and responds to cyber threats, and research  and makes sense of the implications of these  threats to Singapore’s CII, businesses and  individuals. The NCSC carries out such work  through three teams, namely the National Cyber  Threat Monitoring Centre (NCTMC), National  Cyber Incident Response Centre (NCIRC), and  National Cyber Threat Analysis Centre (NCTAC).  Through the NCSC, data from incidents in  Singapore’s cyberspace are analysed. “Singapore’s  cyberspace” will include domain names with “.sg”  or Singapore-mentions, Internet Protocol (IP)  addresses used in Singapore, or Internet Service  Providers (ISPs) based in Singapore.  In the event of major cyber incidents affecting  Singapore’s CIIs, CSA, supported by NCSC, will  take on the role of the national incident manager,  coordinating cross-sector incident response,  implementing specific national-level mitigation  measures, and providing incident response  assistance to the affected CIIs.   CHAPTER 1    THREATS TO   CRITICAL  INFORMATION  INFRASTRUCTURE  (CII)  Cyber-attacks on CIIs can result in widespread disruptive  and destructive impact on society and the economy.  A particularly severe attack could even have spillover  effects on the region and the rest of the world. Cyber- attackers are constantly sharpening their ability to  carry out such attacks, and their objectives range from  financial gain to ideological or nationalistic causes.   CSA has identified 11 CII sectors. They are: Energy,  Water, Banking & Finance, Government, Healthcare,  Media, Infocomm, Land Transport, Maritime, Aviation,  and Security & Emergency. In 2016, several CIIs were  affected by malware infection, in particular, ransomware.   To better guard against such threats and attacks, the  Government has been conducting cyber exercises over  the years to improve the critical sectors’ readiness and  incident response plans. In March 2016, Exercise Cyber  Star, a multi-sector exercise was conducted by CSA.  It brought together representatives from the Infocomm,  Energy, Banking & Finance, and Government sectors to  exercise their responses to a nationwide cyber-attack.  10 11  Chapter 1 Cyber Threats Singapore Faces  NCIRC is the operational arm of NCSC that responds  to cyber threats and incidents affecting the critical  information infrastructure in Singapore.   As the National Cyber Incident Manager, NCIRC  maintains strategic oversight of significant cyber  incidents in the critical sectors to assess Singapore’s  cyber posture.  During cyber crises, NCIRC is responsible for  coordinating cross-sector incident response efforts  and directing national-level mitigation measures.  SingCERT is the national CERT. Under the aegis  of NCIRC, it tracks the broader Singapore cyber  landscape to identify significant threats, and  issues cybersecurity advisories to Singaporeans.  SingCERT also works with foreign CERTs to  manage cross-border cyber incidents.  NCTMC plays a key role in maintaining cyber situational  awareness to aid in the discovery of cyber threats that  are of national significance.   NCTMC also forewarns the nation’s critical sectors  on emerging cyber threats unique to their operating  environment.    In cyber incidents involving multiple sectors, the centre  will coordinate with the Sector Leads to provide quick  and timely alerts to cross-sector threats as part of the  national-level response.  NCTAC conducts all-source research and analysis to provide strategic insights on the Singapore  cyber landscape.   NCTAC’s research and analysis also include geopolitical  perspectives, which often underpin the motivations and  actions of cyber actors.  NCTAC’s insights aim to inform CSA operations,  national cyber policy-making, and contribute to  public education.

Public agencies faced  attacks that included phishing  and APTs (See Chapter 2,  Page 24 for an analysis on  APT). The Internet Surfing  Separation (ISS) policy  announced in June 2016 will  go a significant way towards  securing the Government’s   CASE STUDY  APT Malware Infection in  Government Organisation  WHEN  Late-2016   BACKGROUND  CSA was alerted to a  possible APT malware  infection in an organisation  in the public sector.  CSA found the malware  infection – which had  backdoor capabilities –  on one Internet-facing  computer. Fortunately,  the infected computer had  not been used to process  sensitive information.   EVIDENCE  Suspicious attempts to  connect at regular intervals  to a C&C server, which was  later determined to be a  compromised server.  CASE ANALYSIS  From the investigations,  CSA assessed it to be the  work of a state-sponsored  APT actor, which up till then  had not been known to be  active in Asia. The incident  however was assessed to be  more an opportunistic one  than a targeted attack.   Investigations also  concluded that data was  not exfiltrated, though the  malware had the capability  to do so. The malware was  also not observed to have  spread beyond the infected  computer to the rest of the  organisation’s network. The  organisation did not detect  the malicious network  traffic earlier because the  warning indicators and  malware signatures were  not on known anti-malware  databases.  The APT actor was believed  to be a group supported  by a foreign government  (also referred to as a  “state-sponsored group”),  to engage in cyber  espionage to further their  national interests. It had not  been known to value targets  in Asia, but with this  incident, it could suggest  an expanded scope of  targets in the region.  TACTICS, TECHNIQUES  & PROCEDURES  Attackers used  sophisticated anti-detection  and infection techniques:  multi-stage infection  through a phishing e-mail  that ultimately allowed the  attacker backdoor access.  FOLLOW-UP ACTION  Recommendations were  provided to the organisation  to further secure its  ICT environment and  prevent similar incidents.  These included blocking  unauthorised macros or  programs, implementing  application whitelisting,  and segregating networks.   ICT environment. In removing  the link between the public  officers’ computers from the  Internet, it can disrupt the  attackers’ cyber kill chain.  Without a path out to the  Internet, the attacker will  not have remote access to  the Government’s network,  and will not be able to  extract data as easily.   Chapter 1 Cyber Threats Singapore Faces    Chapter 1 Cyber Threats Singapore Faces  INVOICE  SCAM!  HOSPITAL  14 15  THREATS TO HEALTHCARE SECTOR In 2016, the Healthcare sector  experienced the highest number  of ransomware attacks compared  to other sectors. Although these  attacks did not affect Singapore’s  overall healthcare system, they  served to remind everyone to be  more careful when handling files  and data in their day-to-day work.  CASE STUDY  Ransomware in Healthcare Sector  THREATS TO   SMEs As more SMEs go digital, they  may find themselves facing new  threats, such as phishing attacks  and defacements. Through greater  awareness and some technical  know-how, SMEs may be better  able to defend themselves against  cyber-attacks.   In Singapore, 43 per cent of security  incidents reported to SingCERT  by individuals and SMEs occurred  through phishing attacks. Cyber  criminals may attack SMEs as  a means of getting to larger  corporations, to which SMEs are  suppliers. One of the most common  cyber threats SMEs reported to  SingCERT in 2016 was business  e-mail scams. Millions of dollars  were lost through phishing scams  where hackers impersonated  company executives or business  partners via e-mail. SPF figures also  showed that there was a 20 per cent  rise in e-mail impersonation scams  in 2016 compared to 2015.  WHEN  May 2016   BACKGROUND  A Singapore company  received an e-mail  apparently from a known  supplier, requesting for  the payment for the  purchase of company  supplies from Japan.   The company found the  e-mail suspicious as it  contained an unfamiliar  domain name, and reported  it to SingCERT. No funds  were transferred to a bank  in Hong Kong as requested  in the e-mail, and no  financial loss was reported.   EVIDENCE  Invoice attachments,  e-mail headers.  CASE ANALYSIS  Results from an analysis of  the e-mail headers showed  that the e-mail was spoofed,  and suggested that the  Japanese supplier’s e-mail  account might have been  compromised.   TACTICS, TECHNIQUES  & PROCEDURES  E-mail spoofing,  impersonation.  FOLLOW-UP ACTION  SingCERT provided its  findings to the Singapore  company owner, and  proposed that they alert  the Japanese supplier of  the possible compromise  of its e-mail account. The  company owner also lodged  police reports in Singapore  and Hong Kong.   Such incidents are not  new; SingCERT observed  that several businesses  have been tricked into  transferring funds to  scammers. It recommends  SMEs to always verify  details – for instance  to call the supplier  (telephone) first to confirm  the sums – before making  any funds transfer.   WHEN  Late-2016  BACKGROUND  Ransomware incidents  were detected in Singapore’s  Healthcare sector, with  individual users unable to  access their files on the  network. Investigations  by CSA showed that these  users were infected after  they opened attachments  or clicked on links found in  e-mails they had received.   Immediate action by the  respective institutions and  the healthcare authorities  helped to contain the issue.   EVIDENCE  Cryptoware found in system,  and files were encrypted.  CASE ANALYSIS  Upon detection,  affected computers were  successfully isolated to  prevent the ransomware  infection from spreading  to the wider network.  As a result, there was  no impact to the sector’s  CII assets. The affected  computers were wiped  clean, had their programs  reinstalled, and data  restored from back-ups.  TACTICS, TECHNIQUES  & PROCEDURES  Phishing e-mails, websites  hosting malicious files.   FOLLOW-UP ACTION  Strengthen human  security of networks and  systems by increasing user  awareness of ways to avoid  ransomware and other  malware infections.  CASE STUDY  Invoice Scam Case    16 17  THREATS TO   INDIVIDUALS  From CSA’s Public Awareness Survey  conducted in August 2016, one in three  respondents said that they did not install  security apps in their mobile phones, citing  reasons such as not seeing the need to, or  that the app took up too much space. Other  poor practices include not managing their  passwords securely, connecting to open and  non-password protected Wi-Fi networks in  public places, and not adopting Two-Factor  Authentication when the option is available.  The most common cyber threats to  individuals are compromised e-mail  accounts and malicious websites. E-mail  accounts may be compromised by malware  sent through e-mails (e.g. phishing  e-mails). Such e-mails are targeted and  may appear personal. They prey on the  likelihood of a person clicking on links  or opening attachments, with messages  containing payment requests, warnings,  threats or other triggers for action. By  clicking on malicious links or opening  malicious attachments, individuals  unwittingly allow unauthorised access to  their e-mail account. Once the attackers  have gained entry, they can carry out  more e-mail scams by impersonating the  legitimate e-mail account holder, or they  could dig deeper into the victim’s system  to steal login credentials, banking  information and other personal data.   Individuals tend to fall victim to cybercrime  for two reasons: lack of cybersecurity  awareness, and poor cyber hygiene  practices. While having a connected  lifestyle is almost a necessity today,  many individuals are not sufficiently  diligent about securing their digital lives.   Some users assume that the standard  filters in Web-based or corporate e-mail  servers will block out all malicious  e-mails, and therefore exercise less care  when opening e-mails. As attack methods  evolve, attackers will keep trying to  circumvent such filters. In short, e-mails  should always be handled with caution.  Many individuals may also fall victim to  malicious websites when they click on  unfamiliar Web links or pop-ups while  surfing the Web. Malicious websites  generally attempt to spoof legitimate  ones, luring people into transacting there  instead of the actual website. This is a  common technique to elicit personal  data, login credentials, or even money  from unsuspecting individuals.   In Singapore, legitimate online merchants  and services that have been spoofed  include PayPal, Google, Dropbox, and  the e-services offered by the Ministry  of Manpower and the Immigration &  Checkpoints Authority. As e-commerce,  e-services, and Cloud storage services  continue to grow in availability and use,  users need to be more aware of such  attempts to steal their personal data and  money, to avoid falling into such traps.  2016 also saw an increase in the number of  ransomware incidents reported to SingCERT.  Individuals and SMEs in Singapore who  reported being victims of ransomware have  generally chosen not to pay the ransoms,  but instead would restore their data from  backups. Performing regular backups is  one of the key ways to deal with ransomware3.   (See Page 31 on ways to deal with ransomware)  Ransomware is a  category of malware  used by attackers to  encrypt data on targeted  systems and demanding  a ransom for the data  to be decrypted.  3 SingCERT released an advisory on May 2016 providing tips on how to deal with ransomware – [SingCERT] Ransomware.

EVIDENCE  Ransom note displayed on  computer screen, detailing  steps that needed to be  taken to decrypt the files.  CASE ANALYSIS  SingCERT found that the  individual’s computer had  been infected with the  CryptoLocker ransomware.  TACTICS, TECHNIQUES  & PROCEDURES  Malware infection,  encryption.  FOLLOW-UP ACTION  As a decryption tool for this  ransomware was available  online, SingCERT guided  the affected individual in  using it to restore his files.  The individual was also  advised on cyber hygiene  best practices to avoid  being infected again.

This was after he had  clicked on an attachment  in an e-mail that led him  to a website apparently  containing Google Doc  templates. At the website,  he was prompted to enter  his e-mail password.  Concerned that he might  have already gone too  far by opening the  attachment, he checked  with the sender of the  e-mail, who informed him  that the e-mail was fake.   EVIDENCE  Suspicious e-mail with  a malicious document  attached.  CASE ANALYSIS  A hyperlink was observed  when the mouse cursor  hovered over the attachment  icon. The hyperlink directed  the individual to a website  set up to phish information  from Internet users.  TACTICS, TECHNIQUES &  PROCEDURES  E-mail with suspicious links  or malicious attachments,  stealing credentials.  FOLLOW-UP ACTION  SingCERT advised the  individual to check if his  account had indeed been  compromised by reviewing  the log-in sessions via his  Gmail security settings,  a section which would  show the devices that had  access to his account.  SingCERT also advised the  individual to strengthen his  e-mail account settings by  activating the Two-Factor  Authentication option.

There may be some who would openly  publish their success story – such as those who  post on public websites about their website  defacements – but even then, they hide behind  a pseudonym or “nickname” that may be hard  to link to a specific individual or group.   There are elusive cyber-attackers that remain at-large, after having  caused significant damage or losses. For example, the attackers  behind major global cyber-attacks in 2016 who remain largely  unknown include those behind the attacks against the SWIFT global  banking network and the DDoS attacks in the United States of America  and France. These actors often hide or mask their tracks to make it  difficult to pin them down physically or geographically. Some usual  means of doing so include using spoofed IP addresses that may not  show the physical location in which they operate.   Threat actors targeting Singapore run the gamut from the script- kiddies to APTs. Their behaviour, intentions, capabilities, are always  evolving and require close monitoring. CSA studies the trends of cyber- attacks in order to identify measures that individuals, businesses and  the nation can adopt to better defend against similar or new threats.   Chapter 2   |   Cyber Threats in Focus: Actors Targeting Singapore    24 25  ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREAT(APT) APTs operate stealthily and with sophistication, often  hiding in networks for prolonged periods to plan their  targeted attacks. APTs, which may refer to the type  of attack, or the threat actor or group, are also often  state-sponsored. Their mission includes espionage,  data exfiltration, and data manipulation.   Cyberspace presents a rich target environment and the  rise in geopolitical tensions may potentially spill over  into cyberspace with APT groups targeting key assets  in Singapore and the region.  Cyber activities associated with  state actors are becoming more  overt in recent times. Cyberspace  is one environment through which  sensitive information is obtained  for state-on-state espionage.  As geopolitical tensions rise,  the need for international cyber  norms becomes more pressing.  (See Page 40 on Singapore’s  efforts to promote International  Cyber Norms).  APT groups active in the Asia- Pacific region include APT1 and  APT30; and Southeast Asia-based  PLATINUM. CII sectors such as the  Government, Banking & Finance,  Healthcare and Energy sectors are  attractive targets for APT attacks  because a strike on them could  have significant impact on the  economy and society. One APT   Hacktivism is the act  of hacking, or breaking  into a computer system,  and/or defacing  webpages to promote  a political or ideological  message. Hacking has  arguably become an  increasingly attractive  alternative to conducting  physical street protests  as the Internet affords  hacktivists anonymity  and reach.   In 2016, there were  a total of 1,750 Web  defacement cases  related to Singapore.  Most of the websites  defaced belonged to  SMEs from a range  of sectors including  home interior design  to healthcare. The  hacktivists appear to  be politically-motivated  groups from the Middle  East, and had also  concurrently conducted  their mass defacement  activities on websites  around the world.   group was discovered to be  eyeing a Singapore institution,  using its signature tactic of  phishing on individuals there.  Through close collaboration  between the institution and the  authorities, the APT attempt  was detected and halted before  further harm could be done.   The early identification and  stopping of malicious APT activity  is a multi-stakeholder effort that  would involve the intelligence  community, law enforcement  agencies, the targeted institution,  and even foreign counterparts.   This group appears to be a politically-motivated  hacktivist group from the Middle East. The  group carried out website defacement attacks  that often included messages bearing their  views on issues such as the conflicts in Syria  and Palestine. The group would typically replace  the home page of the affected website with  a cartoon of a devil carrying a pitchfork.  This group has been responsible for defacing  as many as 339 Singapore websites in 2016,  accounting for about 20 per cent of Singapore  websites that were defaced last year. Targets  included organisations in the non-profit sector.  However, the group does not appear to target  Singapore companies alone, as their acts of  mass defacements were also carried out against  company websites in other countries, including  India and Iran. (See Page 32: Common Cyber  Threats in Singapore - Website Defacement).  HACKTIVISTS  CII SECTORS SUCH  AS THE GOVERNMENT,  BANKING & FINANCE,  HEALTHCARE AND  ENERGY SECTORS ARE  ATTRACTIVE TARGETS  FOR APT ATTACKS  BECAUSE A STRIKE  ON THEM COULD HAVE  SIGNIFICANT IMPACT  ON THE ECONOMY  AND SOCIETY.

Consequently, they have  also become targets of cyber  criminals who go online to seek  illicit monetary gains.   SPF has observed that criminals  have been increasingly moving  their activities online, with the  proportion of cybercrimes to the  total number of crimes in all  categories (inclusive of physical  crimes) increasing over the past  two years. The proportion of  cybercrime to the total number  of crime cases has been growing  from 7.9 per cent in 2014 to 13.7  per cent in 2016.   In 2016, cyber criminals mostly  committed online cheating cases  (83 per cent), followed by CMCA  cases such as unauthorised  access to computer material (15  per cent) and cyber extortion (2  per cent) respectively4. The top  three categories of online cheating   4 The term cybercrime refers to (a)  offences where a computer system  is the target of a criminal act; and  (b) offences where traditional crimes  are committed via the means of a  computer system. The first category  of offences refers to offences  under the Computer Misuse and  Cybersecurity Act (CMCA) and the  second category of offences refer  to traditional crimes performed  online such as online cheating, and  cyber extortion. Ministry of Home  Affairs, National Cybercrime Action  Plan. (2016, July 20). Retrieved  from https://www.police.gov.sg/ news-and-publications/media- releases/20160720_others_-launch_ of_the_national_cybercrime_action_ plan_others  In June 2016, a Singapore institution received a cyber  threat which appeared to be from a cyber criminal  group known for its DDoS attacks. They demanded  the payment of a ransom, failing which they would  launch a DDoS attack on the institution. The threat  was sent in the form of a ransom e-mail to the  institution, demanding for Bitcoins to be paid. A “demo  attack” – akin to a warning shot by the attackers – was  launched before the due date, but the DDoS threat was  eventually not carried out.   CSA assessed that the threat was likely from a copycat  group. The actual cyber criminal group is infamous for  being able to launch DDoS attacks of more than 1 Tbps,  and had previously issued similar ransom threats to  several companies in Switzerland.  Identifying attackers and attributing attacks to them  becomes even more challenging as actors within the  community mimic one another to hide their tracks.  CASE STUDY  DDoS Copycats  cases were namely e-commerce,  Internet love scam and credit- for-sex.   Notably, CMCA cases more  than doubled year-on-year,  from 280 in 2015 to 691 in 2016.  The top five CMCA cases in 2016,  in no particular order, were  related to ransomware, hacking,  compromise of online accounts  (such as Facebook), SingPass  and Internet banking accounts.   Cyber criminals will continue to  be a significant threat actor group  as they adopt more sophisticated  social engineering techniques to  lure their victims. The anonymity  provided by the Internet and the  borderless nature of cyberspace  allow cyber criminals to operate  freely and anonymously. Given  this challenge, the Government,  law enforcement agencies and  the international community will  have to work even more closely  together to fight cybercrimes.  1000  2000  3000  4000  5000  0 2014 2015 2016  Chapter 2 Cyber Threats in Focus: Actors Targeting Singapore  https://www.police.gov.sg/news-and-publications/media-releases/20160720_others_-launch_of_the_national_cybercrime_action_plan_others https://www.police.gov.sg/news-and-publications/media-releases/20160720_others_-launch_of_the_national_cybercrime_action_plan_others https://www.police.gov.sg/news-and-publications/media-releases/20160720_others_-launch_of_the_national_cybercrime_action_plan_others https://www.police.gov.sg/news-and-publications/media-releases/20160720_others_-launch_of_the_national_cybercrime_action_plan_others https://www.police.gov.sg/news-and-publications/media-releases/20160720_others_-launch_of_the_national_cybercrime_action_plan_others   28 29  INSIDER THREATS Insider threats pose a significant threat to organisations.  Insiders – unintentionally or intentionally malicious – can  weaken the best cyber defences. From IBM’s 2016 Cyber  Security Intelligence Index, insiders were found to be  responsible for 60 per cent of cyber-attacks5. Insiders are  a potent source of threat and a significant concern as they  can unintentionally or intentionally leak data or compromise  systems, and it takes more than technology to prevent  insider threats. Processes for instance, need to be in place  to ensure access to the organisation’s data, especially  sensitive ones, is strictly controlled.  Many Singaporeans were found to be unaware of proper  cybersecurity practices based on a Public Awareness  Survey conducted by CSA6. Consequently, this may make  them potential “insider threats”. They may inadvertently  cause their office network to be compromised when they  use an infected thumb drive that opens a “backdoor” for the  attacker to enter the system. Using weak passwords that can  be easily guessed, like “ABC123” or “password”, would allow  the attacker to enter otherwise confidential areas of the  organisation’s network.   There are also malicious insiders who could abuse their  existing access to sensitive data and intellectual property  for unlawful purposes. Malicious insiders could be  disgruntled former employees who leave deliberate  backdoors to exfiltrate data after they leave the organisation.  They are a particularly dangerous group of threat actors  because they know the network well and can find ways to  disrupt or degrade critical services without raising suspicion.  5 “Reviewing a year of Serious data breaches, major attacks, and new vulnerabilities,” IBM  X-Force Research 2016 Cyber Security Intelligence Index, p.11.   6 Tiffany Fumiko Tay, “6 in 10 connect to unprotected Wi-Fi networks: Cyber Security Agency,  The Straits Times, 16 February, 2017, http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/6-in-10- connect-to-unprotected-wi-fi-networks-cyber-security-agency   In March 2016, an employee from the Healthcare sector  used her workplace computer to access her personal  e-mail account. She opened what appeared to be a  Microsoft Office document but was in fact a malicious  file, that downloaded a ransomware into the workplace  computer. As the computer was connected to the rest of  the organisation, the infection quickly spread to other  machines on the network. The infection forced the  organisation to reformat all the affected computers and  restore data from backups. This incident highlights the  need to heighten cyber awareness among employees,  and always be ready to kick-in business continuity plans.

Preventive measures against  ransomware include:   • Follow Internet-browsing  best practices, such as not  clicking on suspect links  as that may download  ransomware;   • Updating software with the  recommended patches to  reduce the likelihood of  known vulnerabilities being  exploited;   • Performing regular backups  to recover files that have  been encrypted;   • Using available decryption  tools to restore files that the  attacker has “locked up”.  COMMON  CYBER THREATS  IN SINGAPORE  NCSC analyses internal and other data sources,  which include open source data, to provide actionable  insights on four common threats and attacks in  Singapore’s cyberspace7. The four cyber threats  in focus are ransomware, website defacement,  phishing websites/URLs, C&C servers and DDoS.  By understanding the means and motivation behind  these attacks on Singaporeans and Singapore, one  can try to take measures to prevent, detect and/or  mitigate such threats.  8 Shukla, A. (2016, July 13). Singapore receives 550 cyber threats each day. Retrieved from   http://www.computerworld.com.sg/resource/security/singapore-receives-550-cyber-threats-each-day/  9 Singapore ranks 4th in Asia in terms of Internet penetration rate (81.3 per cent),   after South Korea (92.1 per cent), Japan (91.0 per cent), and Taiwan (83.8 per cent) respectively.   Source: www.internetworldstats.com/stats3.htm  RANSOMWARE  Definition:   A type of malware that encrypts files on a victim’s device,  rendering them unusable until a ransom is paid, usually in  the form of Bitcoin. It is spread through e-mail or malicious  advertisements that appear when users access unsafe websites.  Motivation:   Financial gains and/or business disruptions.  Target(s):  Usually opportunistic, involving any individuals and companies  of all sizes.   Singapore has joined the  “No More Ransom” initiative  by Europol’s European  Cybercrime Centre (EC3) to  fight cybercrime in both the  public and private sectors.  The initiative aims to assist  victims of ransomware to  decrypt their encrypted data  by offering the decryption  tools made available free  of charge on the portal  and to teach users how to  protect themselves. The  portal is now available in  14 languages and contains  40 free decryption tools.  More about EC3’s initiative  can be found here:  In 2016, there were 19  ransomware cases reported  to SingCERT, up from the two  cases reported in 2015. Cerber,  CryptoLocker and Locky were  among the types of ransomware  reported. The actual number  of victims may be more as  ransomware cases tend to  go unreported. According to  Trend Micro, an international  cybersecurity company, it detected  about 550 ransomware-related  threats in Singapore each day8.   Singapore is especially  vulnerable due to its high Internet  penetration rate.9 Individuals and   “NO ONE IS SPARED FROM RANSOMWARE”  SMEs accounted for most of   the ransomware cases reported   to CSA. Companies may be  reluctant to admit being affected,  as this may affect the reputation   of their business.   Globally, hospitals and universities  were also hit by ransomware  attacks in 2016. Payments are  usually made using Bitcoin, a  type of online currency preferred  by cyber criminals given it is  harder to trace it back to them.  Unfortunately, there is no  guarantee that the hacker will  decrypt the files as promised  once they receive the payment.   www.nomoreransom.org.  7 “Singapore cyberspace” can refer to websites ending with the .SG domain or mention Singapore in its URL, IP addresses used in  Singapore or Internet Service Providers (ISP) that are located in Singapore.

Defaced websites may also  contain malicious code to infect visitors to the affected site.  Motivation:   Promote political or religious agendas through “hacktivism”,  achieve online fame in hacker communities, and/or distract  victims from the “real” cyber-attack such as a data breach.  Target(s):   Usually opportunistic, involving websites and/or web   servers with known vulnerabilities.  Website owners should  keep their applications  (including plug-ins)  and operating systems  regularly updated to  prevent hackers from  exploiting known  vulnerabilities on outdated  systems. Companies that  rely on third-party hosting  providers for their Web  hosting needs should find  out from their providers  about the measures that  are in place to address  potential vulnerabilities.   WEBSITE DEFACEMENT  In Singapore, 1,750 website  defacements were reported in  2016. The majority of the affected  websites belonged to SMEs from  a range of businesses, including  interior design, logistics,  manufacturing and construction.  One in 10 defaced websites were  hosted on outdated operating systems  such as Windows Server 2003 for  which Microsoft ended its support  in July 2015. Such operating systems  may no longer have security patches   Number of defaced Singapore websites  “1 IN 10  WEBSITES  FOUND  HOSTED ON  OUTDATED  OPERATING  SYSTEMS”  PHISHING WEBSITE / URLS  In 2016, 2,512 phishing URLs with a  Singapore-link were found. Banking  and financial services websites  appeared to be the most commonly  spoofed websites in Singapore.  They represented more than 30 per  cent of the phishing websites found.  File-hosting service providers such  as Dropbox and Google Drive, and  technology companies such as Apple  and Google are commonly spoofed  by hackers.   Number of phishing URLs linked to Singapore  10 Sucuri is a security company which focused on detecting and remediating compromised websites. 11 PayPal holds 77 per cent of the market share in online payment industry. Source: https://www. datanyze.com/market-share/payments/  Most targeted brands for phishing campaigns  for new vulnerabilities and hence  are easier for hackers to exploit.  According to Sucuri10, an American  website security company, WordPress  was the most targeted content  management system (CMS) in  2016 globally. Popular CMS such as  Joomla and WordPress, which most  websites run on, can be infiltrated by  hackers due to vulnerabilities, and  improper deployment, configuration  or maintenance by their webmasters.  Government organisations such  as Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and  Immigration & Checkpoints Authority  (ICA) were also spoofed in 2016.  Online payment service provider  PayPal was the most targeted brand,  likely due its widespread use among  online merchants and its customers11.  File-hosting and Cloud storage  service providers are becoming  popular targets as well.   Definition:   Websites that are  compromised or created  by hackers to trick Internet  users into believing they  are accessing a legitimate,  trusted website.  Motivation:   Obtain personal information,   which can be used for  future cyber-attacks,  and/or financial gain.   Target(s):   Usually opportunistic,  involving potentially  anybody and everybody.  Users should always  seek to verify the URL  and e-mail address of  senders, and look out for  warning signs such as  poor spelling or grammar.  When in doubt, users  should always verify the  website’s address before  submitting any sensitive  information online.  Chapter 2 Cyber Threats in Focus: Common Cyber Threats in Singapore  https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/payments/ https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/payments/   SingCERT published an  advisory in Oct 2016 to  inform business and  individuals of the need   to enhance the security   of IoT devices. This could  reduce the likelihood of   that these devices are  leveraged to conduct  widespread DDoS attacks.  Some measures include:  • Ensuring that remote  access capabilities   were disabled; and   • Changing device  usernames and  passwords from   the default.  34 35  COMMAND & CONTROL (C&C)  SERVERS AND DISTRIBUTED  DENIAL OF SERVICE (DDOS)  More than 60 C&C servers were  observed within Singapore’s  cyberspace in 2016. The number  of C&C servers was observed to  be growing gradually in the first  eight months of 2016, peaking in  August, before decreasing towards  the end of the year. Such servers  often serve as the launch pad for  cyber-attacks, including DDoS  attacks. Whenever a new C&C  server is detected, SingCERT will  inform the respective Web-hosting  providers to rectify the issue.  In 2016, DDoS attacks globally  crossed the peak attack volume  of 1 Tbps (DDoS attacks commonly  fall in the 10 – 50 Gigabit per  second range). Attacks of this  scale were enabled through new  malware (e.g. Mirai) that exploited  vulnerabilities in unsecured  IoT devices, such as webcams,  routers and printers. The malware  essentially would hijack these  devices, causing them to generate  malicious traffic that can be  directed at specific systems.  2016 also saw the growth  of DDoS extortion threats.  Organisations receive e-mails  from hackers threatening to  launch a DDoS attack against  them unless payment is made,  usually via Bitcoin. A number of  organisations in Singapore have  received such threats.  Misconfigured services on  servers continued to be seen  in Singapore’s cyberspace  throughout 2016. Simple Service  Discovery Protocol (SSDP),  DNS and Network Time Protocol  (NTP) are some of the services  that, if not configured properly,  can be used to facilitate DDoS  attacks. Remediation for these  vulnerabilities can be as simple  as unchecking an option in the  server settings.  Number of Unique C&C Servers observed per month in Singapore  “SSDP, DNS AND  NTP ACCOUNT   FOR 70 PER CENT  OF VULNERABLE   SERVICES IN  SINGAPORE THAT  CAN BE USED IN A   DDOS ATTACK”  Definition:   A C&C server is a machine operated by hackers to  communicate with devices that have been infected with  malware. Instructions are communicated to the group  of infected devices, collectively known as a botnet, to  perform malicious activities such as DDoS attacks. A  DDoS attack occurs when a system is bombarded with  large volumes of data or specially-crafted malicious  traffic sent from a botnet, affecting the system’s ability  to respond to legitimate users in a timely manner.  Motivation:   Conduct malicious activities such as data theft, e-mail  spam campaigns and DDoS attacks. DDoS attacks  create disruptions to victim’s business operations, and/ or distract victim from the “real” cyber-attack such as  a data breach.  Target(s):   Any organisation, although those in the financial  and gaming industries are commonly targeted.  Chapter 2 Cyber Threats in Focus: Common Cyber Threats in Singapore    36 37  CHAPTER 3  KEEPING OUR  CYBERSPACE  SAFE AND  TRUSTWORTHY  TOGETHER  Raising Cyber Awareness Among  Individuals and Businesses  Developing Singapore’s  Cybersecurity Professionals  Facilitating Exchanges with Regional   and International Partners  Cybersecurity  for a Smart Nation  While digital connectivity exposes everyone  to cyber threats, it also continues to open  up opportunities for all. Through cyberspace,  we keep in touch with one another, do our work,  and run enterprises. Given the heavy reliance  on cyberspace, it is therefore important that  our cyberspace is kept safe and trustworthy,  for everyone to continue benefitting from it.   The ways to doing so include:   raising cyber awareness and capabilities  among individuals and businesses,   developing cybersecurity professionals  in Singapore,   facilitating exchanges with regional and  international partners, and   investing in Research and Development  (R&D) for a secure Smart Nation.   a)  b)  c)  d)  Chapter 3   |   Keeping Our Cyberspace Safe and Trustworthy Together    38 39  RAISING  CYBER  AWARENESS  AMONG   INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES  CSA conducted a Public  Awareness Survey in August 2016  with 2,000 respondents on their  cybersecurity awareness and  cyber hygiene. While seven in 10  respondents agreed that everyone  has a role to play in cybersecurity,  many of them were also found  to be not taking safety measures  when going online. For example,  one in three respondents do not  manage their passwords carefully.  These findings, among others,  reveal that there is room for  improvement when it comes to  individual cyber hygiene practices.  To educate and reach out to the  public on cybersecurity, CSA  manages the GoSafeOnline and  SingCERT websites and social  media platforms that provide  cybersecurity news and resources  to individuals and businesses.  Members of the Cyber Security  Awareness Alliance, which CSA  co-chairs, have also been giving  media interviews, talks to schools,  the public, and businesses to raise  cybersecurity awareness.   Advisories issued by SingCERT  in 2016 covered topics like  ransomware, DDoS attacks, and  compromised remote servers,   which were timely given the  increasing number of incidents  stemming from ransomware  infections and exploitations of  weak system configurations.   To bring the message to an even  wider audience, two episodes  of CrimeWatch, a long-running  television programme, were  produced on cyber-related topics.  These were aired on free-to-air  television channels in Singapore.  CSA worked with the SPF and  National Crime Prevention Council  (NCPC) to produce these episodes  covering cybercrimes involving  banking malware, ransomware,  and unauthorised access to data in  computer networks and systems.   Together with the Personal Data  Protection Commission (PDPC),  CSA produced a series of activity  books to educate primary school  students on cyber safety. Two  issues were produced in 2016  and distributed to all Primary 5  students in Singapore with copies  made available online.  To expand the outreach to SMEs,  CSA worked with the Singapore  Business Federation (SBF) and  the National Security Coordination   Cyber Safety Activity Book  DEVELOPING  SINGAPORE’S  CYBERSECURITY  PROFESSIONALS  While Singapore works towards increasing cyber- savviness among her people, it requires competent  cybersecurity professionals, capable of protecting  both the infrastructure and the individuals who use  the infrastructure. Singapore’s efforts to groom its  pool of cybersecurity professionals include:  A way to build a common identity  and increase the recognition of  the cybersecurity profession is  to foster strong Communities  of Practice (COPs). Professional  bodies are instrumental to driving  the development of COPs to tackle  cyber threats and career pathways  for professionals. Such bodies are  also integral to enhancing talent  retention in the profession. CSA  has engaged four key professional  bodies – Association of Information  Security Professionals; Singapore  Computer Society; International  Information System Security  Certification Consortium also  known as (ISC)2; and Information  System Audit and Control  Association (ISACA) – to build  stronger communities. CSA will  also work with IMDA and Workforce  Singapore (WSG) on delivering  better training and career  opportunities for cybersecurity  professionals.   Complementing these efforts is  the development of Singapore’s  cybersecurity industry to spur  the growth of high value jobs in  Singapore that will in turn sustain  efforts at developing the nation’s  manpower. The availability of  sophisticated and high value jobs,  provided by a vibrant cybersecurity  industry, provides for the  professional growth and career  progression of professionals, all  of which are critical to countering  cyber threats effectively.   Enhancing and  augmenting the  professional pipeline  The Cyber Security  Associates and  Technologists (CSAT)  programme, a joint  initiative by CSA and  IMDA, aims to boost  the pipeline of  cybersecurity  professionals. CSAT  trains and upskills  new and existing  ICT and Engineering  professionals for  cybersecurity roles.  Deepening the technical  depth of professionals.   CSA has been engaging  the Institutes of Higher  Learning (IHL) to shape  cybersecurity into their  curriculum. CSA will  promote industry-IHL  collaborations for more  structured internships  and leading edge  cybersecurity training  facilities.  Young participants at  the WhiteHacks@SG  cybersecurity workshop  and competition  held from 12-13 Mar  2016. The event was  organised by SMU  Whitehat Society  in partnership with  ThinkSecure and CSA.  Close to 40 students and young professional  participated in the ‘The Future For You: Be a Cyber  Security Champion’ engagement session organised  by CSA on 23 Feb 2016  Chapter 3 Keeping Our Cyberspace Safe and Trustworthy Together  Secretariat (NSCS) on the  National Security Conference  in November 2016 to raise  cybersecurity awareness among  businesses. The conference  attracted more than 500  attendees from SMEs.  To help SMEs build their digital  capabilities to seize opportunities  for growth in the digital economy,  CSA is working with IMDA on the  cybersecurity aspects of the  SMEs Go Digital programme.  For example, the new SME Digital  Tech Hub (slated to be opened  in the third quarter of 2017) will  provide specialist technology  advice to assist SMEs on their  cybersecurity needs.   https://www.csa.gov.sg/news/press-releases/csa-releases-key-findings-from-first-cybersecurity-public-awareness-survey https://www.csa.gov.sg/news/press-releases/csa-releases-key-findings-from-first-cybersecurity-public-awareness-survey https://www.csa.gov.sg/gosafeonline/resources/activity-book https://www.csa.gov.sg/programmes/csat https://www.csa.gov.sg/programmes/csat https://www.csa.gov.sg/programmes/csat https://www.facebook.com/pg/CSAsingapore/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1703452646577728   40 41  FACILITATING  EXCHANGES  WITH REGIONAL AND  INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS  In 2016, CSA signed Memoranda  of Understanding (MoUs) with the  Netherlands and the USA. The  MoUs cover cooperation in areas  such as operational exchange  of cyber threat and attack- related information; sharing  of best practices on national  cybersecurity approaches,  strategies and procedures and  CII protection; certification of  cybersecurity products and  services; and training.  Singapore has also initiated  discussions on cyber norms  with its ASEAN partners,  including at the ASEAN  Ministerial Conference on  Cybersecurity (AMCC). The  AMCC was organised during  the Singapore International  Cyber Week (SICW) in October  2016 for ASEAN Ministers  and senior officials from the   telecommunications and other  relevant sectors to discuss  regional cybersecurity issues.  It also saw ASEAN Member  States agreeing on the value  of developing a set of practical  cybersecurity norms of behaviour  in ASEAN, and calling for closer  cooperation and stronger  coordination on regional  capacity-building initiatives.   Such new initiatives will add to  existing efforts which have been  ongoing for many years. These  include a capacity-building  workshop jointly organised by  Singapore and the USA for ASEAN  countries in August 2016, and  the annual ASEAN CERT Incident  Drill (referred to as “ACID” by  its participants), which has been  testing the incident-handling  procedures of ASEAN CERTS  over the last 10 years.  CYBERGREEN  Initiated by the Japan  Computer Emergency  Response Team in 2014,  the CyberGreen project  aims to provide a cyber- health check of countries  by highlighting the levels  of infections seen in  each country. In 2016,  Singapore became one of  the founding sponsors of  the global initiative. CSA  will work with IMDA and  telcos to clean up the  infections in cyberspace  to improve Singapore’s  overall cyber hygiene.   International collaboration is pivotal to global  cybersecurity. Singapore has been actively involved  in various international platforms on cybersecurity,  from multilateral discussions on international cyber  norms to bilateral cooperation.  Cyber Norms discussion at the International Cyber Leaders’  Symposium held at the inaugural Singapore International  Cyber Week on 10 Oct 2016  Ministers and Senior Officials from ASEAN Member States at the  inaugural ASEAN Ministerial Conference on Cybersecurity held  on 11 Oct 2016  Chapter 3 Keeping Our Cyberspace Safe and Trustworthy Together  http://www.cybergreen.net/ http://www.cybergreen.net/ https://www.csa.gov.sg/news/press-releases/asean-member-states-call-for-tighter-cybersecurity-coordination-in-asean https://www.csa.gov.sg/news/press-releases/asean-member-states-call-for-tighter-cybersecurity-coordination-in-asean   42 43  CYBERSECURITY FOR A SMART NATION  CSA strongly advocates the security-by- design approach, which means designing  and building in security from the outset,  and throughout every phase of the software  and hardware development lifecycle.  This approach involves a rigorous process  that includes (i) threat-risk assessments,  (ii) optimising system design by balancing  the trade-offs among security, usability  and cost, and (iii) penetration testing.  This approach will also underpin the  design and development of Singapore’s  Smart Nation. While a Smart Nation  creates new opportunities for work and  leisure, it inadvertently expands the attack  surface as well with the greater connectivity  between devices, and among us. The cyber- attack in the United States in October 2016,  carried out through compromised IoT  devices, exemplifies such a threat.  The Singapore Cyber Landscape 2016 has given an initial  glimpse of the nation’s cyber health. We believe it is but the tip  of the iceberg. We hope it will spur greater involvement of all  stakeholders – Government agencies, Singapore’s cyber industry,  professionals and students, academia and researchers, and  providers of essential services – to come up with new ways to  better defend ourselves against ever-evolving cyber threats.  Cybersecurity is a team effort. Everyone has a part to play, and  everyone has to play their part. At the national level, CSA will  continue to spearhead initiatives and engage stakeholders to  enhance Singapore’s cybersecurity posture. At the organisational  and individual levels, efforts must be made too to raise awareness,  capabilities and resilience to counter the cyber threats that  Singapore will continue to face. If we work together as a team,  we can make Singapore a safe and trustworthy Smart Nation.  In April 2016, the CREST Singapore Chapter  was established by CSA in collaboration  with the Association of Information Security  Professionals (AISP), IMDA, GovTech, the  Association of Banks in Singapore and the  Monetary Authority of Singapore. This is also  the first CREST Chapter in Asia. CSA has  directed that from June 2017, all penetration  testing professionals and service providers  who provide penetration testing services for  CII need to be certified and accredited through  CREST or equivalent certifying bodies.  R&D work in cybersecurity will also be  another critical front to push in the Smart  Nation journey. Together with the National  Research Foundation (NRF) and the other  stakeholder agencies, CSA is driving  Singapore’s cybersecurity R&D effort  through the S$190m National Cybersecurity  R&D programme, which aims at improving  the trustworthiness of cyber infrastructure,  raising the barrier for attackers, and  developing threat-based solutions.

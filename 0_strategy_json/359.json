The 2017 Action Plan builds on the experience gained in 2014-2015 under the previous Italian Cybersecurity Action Plan (2013) and its review, which led to the adoption —on February 17th 2017— of a new Prime Minister Decree currently regulating the Italian cybersecurity architecture. The Plan is also in agreement with the principles behind the reviewing process of Prime Minister Decree January 24th 2013. The process led to the mended National cybersecurity framework as regulated by Prime Minister Decree February 17th 2017. The above mentioned review —jointly conducted by the Administrations that are part of the National cybersecurity framework— greatly benefited from both the lessons learned from the first steps undertaken to build a national cybersecurity system and the experiences and choices adopted by relevant partners and Allies. The outcome of such exercise allowed to identify the changes needed to overcome some difficulties of the past and to envisage a system intended to make it easier for pub- lic and private stakeholders to contribute to the implementation of the new Action Plan. 6 The Italian Cybersecurity Action Plan INTRODUCTION The 2017 Italian Cybersecurity Action Plan is intended to outline the actions required to meet the guidelines set forth by the National Strategic Framework for Cyberspace Security. While updating the 2013 Action Plan, the current document aims at realizing a major step toward the full implementa- tion of the Italian cybersecurity system. The Plan outlines eleven action items, together with their associated objectives and implementing lines of effort, as re- quired by article 3.1c of Prime Minister Decree February 17th 2017 on “guide- lines for cyberspace protection and IT national security”. The Plan provides priority mea- sures for the correct deployment of the National Strategic Framework for Cyberspace Security, involving all cyber- security relevant stakeholders on a pro- active and iterative basis. The Plan was reviewed by CISR Ministries (Foreign Affairs, Interior/ Homeland Security, Defense, Justice, Economy and Finance, Economic Development) as well as cyber dele- gates from the Agency for Digital Italy and from the National Cybersecurity Management Board (established within the Prime Minister’s Military Advisor Office until February 2017). 1. Strengthening national Critical Infrastruc- tures and other strategic players’ defense capabilities. 2. Improving cyber actors’ technological, operational, and analytic capabilities. 3. Encouraging public-private cooperation. 4. Fostering cybersecurity culture. 5. Supporting international cooperation on cybersecurity. 6. Reinforcing counter-action capabilities against online criminal activities. NATIONAL STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR CYBERSPACE SECURITY Strategic guidelineS 7 The review focused in particular on the following: • AI 5 (Incident prevention, response and remediation) which includes provisions to strengthen the existing CERTs, to create the structures re- quired by the NIS Directive (CSIRT, national single point of contact, National Authorities) and to estab- lish efficient coordination proce- dures among all current and future cybersecurity framework’s stake- holders (CERT, CSIRT, intelligence, law enforcement, defense, Agency for Digital Italy, etc.). • AI 1 (Reinforcing intelligence, law enforcement, and defense capabili- ties) which, once updated according to the experience gained during the previous two years, aims at boost- ing national cybersecurity response capability. In order to ease a quick improvement of the national cybersecurity framework, a series of core tasks to be pursued with priority was identified (see box below). Tasks were chosen according with the review of the previous strategy and tak- ing into account developments occurred both at national and international level. action itemS (ai) AI 1.

ITALIAN ACTION PLAN CORE TASKS • Review governance and responsibilities of the National Cybersecurity Management Board. • Simplify decision making procedure for cyber crises’ management. • Reduce complexity within the national cybersecurity framework through organizations’ suppression/merger. • CERTs’ gradual unification. • Creation of a national cybersecurity evaluation and certification center. • Creation of a venture capital fund or foundation. • Creation of a National Cybersecurity R&D Center. • Creation of a National Cryptographic Center. The Italian Cybersecurity Action Plan 9 ITALIAN CYBERSECURITY CORE TASKS The Action Plan details the initiatives needed to achieve a step change in in- creasing national information system and network security levels, as required by Prime Minister Decree February 17th 2017. In spite of 2014-2015 efforts, the ef- ficacy of measures adopted to protect networks and systems showed a patchy picture, with discrepancies persisting both horizontally —between public and private stakeholders— and vertically, within the same domain. National security sensitive informa- tion is not just a government business. Private entities operating in strategic sectors must be considered as key assets and included into a holistic approach to national cybersecurity that provides for the implementation of minimum se- curity requirements for Country-critical systems. On these premises, the core tasks were selected for their systemic relevance due to the fact that they: • Leverage the competences and re- sponsibilities of all relevant stake- holders (public sector, private sec- tor, research and academia). • Refer to the most relevant activities aimed at consolidating the national cyber defense system including: as- sets’ common protection (CERT); SW/HW certification; identification of critical functions; info-sharing re- quirements in case of relevant cyber events; etc. Pending the transposition of the “EU Directive 2016/1148 concerning mea- sures for a high common level of securi- ty of networks and information systems across the Union” into national legis- lation, the 2013 Italian cybersecurity framework has been revised and opti- mized through: • The simplification of both ordinary and emergency management proce- dures (see AIs 1, 2, 5). • The reorganization of the National cybersecurity framework (suppres- 10 The Italian Cybersecurity Action Plan sion of the cyber NISP, new role for the National Cybersecurity Management Board/NSC, etc.) (see. AI 1). • The simplification of the decision making for cyber crises’, aimed at facilitating prompt and efficient re- sponse and remediation (see AI 5). Of particular relevance are the mea- sures intended to: • Assign to the Director General of the Security Intelligence Department a central role among the entities com- posing the National cybersecurity ecosystem. • Suppress the cyber NISP and re- locate the National Cybersecurity Management Board within the Security Intelligence Department. The board will be responsible for cyberse- curity crises’ management and will be supervised by a Security Intelligence Department Deputy Director. • Promote close interaction between the National CERT and the Public Administration CERT in order to fa- cilitate their operational coordination and guarantee a single detection ca- pacity, alert, and first cyber incidents’ assessment (see AIs 5, 6, 7). • Establish a national evaluation and certification center, within the Min- istry of Economic Development, re- sponsible for security and reliability check of ICT components for Critical Infrastructures (see AI 7). • Enlarge and better define the number of actors operating in security rel- evant sectors (Operators of Essential Services and Digital Service Provid- ers) required to notify serious cyber incidents or else to pay effective, pro- portionate, and dissuasive penalties (see AIs 2, 5, 6).

For this reason, the Plan aims at engaging relevant private companies, academia and research cen- ters (see AI 8). As far as the research sector is con- cerned, specific initiatives —possibly backed by a legal entity (eg. founda- tion)— aim to (see AIs 2, 6, 7): • Support start-ups or other relevant entrepreneurial activities (through venture capital funds). • Create a National Cybersecurity R&D Center responsible —among other things— for developing malware analysis, security governance, Critical Infrastructures’ protection, threat analysis, etc. • Create a National Cryptographic Center responsible for codes/algo- rithms and blockchain development and security assessments. Regarding the public sector, key institu- tions are called upon to take part in a sys- temic, coherent, and detailed intervention to improve national cybersecurity. In particular, the new National Cy- bersecurity Management Board, at the center of the Italian cybersecurity frame- work, aims at facilitating governance simplification by cutting decision-making processes short and rationalizing both ordinary and emergency procedures. The Ministry of Interior (in particu- lar, the National Anti-crime Computer Centre for the Protection of Critical In- frastructure CNAIPIC) plays a key role in protecting IT Critical Infrastructures thanks to its investigative and forensic capabilities. UPDATED CYBERSECURITY CRISIS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM Italian Cybersecurity Core Tasks 12 The Italian Cybersecurity Action Plan The Agency for Digital Italy’s responsi- bilities are equally relevant. The Agency is in charge of defining IT security guidelines and technical rules, setting standards, monitoring quality of public networks’ security and Public Administration’s ICT programs. The Ministry of Defense (MoD) devel- oped specific cyber capabilities —to pro- tect its networks at both national and in- ternational/operational level— which are also a significant asset for the National Cybersecurity Management Board’s im- provement process. The Action Plan also aims at support- ing the MoD on the following initiatives: • Creation of a Joint Command for Cyber Operations in charge for MoD networks and systems protection, and cyber operations. • Establishment of a virtual cyber range —to be located in Chiavari (Genova area) within the Armed Forces’ TLC School facility. Intelligence Community and MoD agreed on a specific protocol to align their strategies and tactics on cybersecu- rity in order to facilitate the consolida- tion of the perspective Joint Command for Cyber Operations in compliance with NATO recent posture. The Action Plan aims to secure na- tional assets according to the following priorities: • Level 1 — National security [Intel- ligence Community, Ministry of De- fense, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Economy and Finance, Ministry of Economic Development]. • Level 2 — National Critical Infrastruc- tures [TLC, utilities, financial Sector, transports] and other relevant Pub- lic Administrations (eg. Ministry of Health). • Level 3 — National production sys- tem and population. 13 ACTION ITEM 1 REINFORCING INTELLIGENCE, LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND DEFENSE CAPABILITIES 1.1 Threat and vulnerability analysis a. Assess and evaluate cyber threats and vulnerabilities on a regular basis. b.

National security sensitive informa- tion is not just a government business.  Private entities operating in strategic  sectors must be considered as key assets  and included into a holistic approach  to national cybersecurity that provides  for the implementation of minimum se- curity requirements for Country-critical  systems.  On these premises, the core tasks were  selected for their systemic relevance due  to the fact that they:  •  Leverage the competences and re- sponsibilities of all relevant stake- holders (public sector, private sec- tor, research and academia).  •  Refer  to  the most  relevant activities  aimed at consolidating the national  cyber defense system including: as- sets’ common protection (CERT);  SW/HW certification; identification  of critical functions; info-sharing re- quirements in case of relevant cyber  events; etc.  Pending the transposition of the “EU  Directive 2016/1148 concerning mea- sures for a high common level of securi- ty of networks and information systems  across the Union” into national legis- lation, the 2013 Italian cybersecurity  framework has been revised and opti- mized through:  •  The  simplification  of  both  ordinary  and emergency management proce- dures (see AIs 1, 2, 5).  •  The  reorganization  of  the  National  cybersecurity framework (suppres-    10  The Italian Cybersecurity Action Plan  sion of the cyber NISP, new role  for the National Cybersecurity  Management Board/NSC, etc.) (see.  AI 1).  •  The  simplification  of  the  decision  making for cyber crises’, aimed at  facilitating prompt and efficient re-  sponse and remediation (see AI 5). Of particular relevance are the mea-  sures intended to: •  Assign to the Director General of the   Security Intelligence Department a  central role among the entities com- posing the National cybersecurity   ecosystem.  •  Suppress the cyber NISP and re- locate the National Cybersecurity  Management Board within the  Security Intelligence Department. The  board will be responsible for cyberse- curity crises’ management and will be  supervised by a Security Intelligence  Department Deputy Director.  •  Promote  close  interaction  between  the National CERT and the Public  Administration CERT in order to fa- cilitate their operational coordination  and guarantee a single detection ca- pacity, alert, and first cyber incidents’   assessment (see AIs 5, 6, 7).  •  Establish  a  national  evaluation  and  certification center, within the Min- istry of Economic Development, re- sponsible for security and reliability  check of ICT components for Critical  Infrastructures (see AI 7).  •  Enlarge and better define the number  of actors operating in security rel- evant sectors (Operators of Essential  Services and Digital Service Provid- ers) required to notify serious cyber  incidents or else to pay effective, pro- portionate, and dissuasive penalties  (see AIs 2, 5, 6).

For this reason, the  Plan aims at engaging relevant private  companies, academia and research cen- ters (see AI 8).  As far as the research sector is con- cerned, specific initiatives —possibly  backed by a legal entity (eg. founda- tion)— aim to (see AIs 2, 6, 7): •  Support  start-ups  or  other  relevant   entrepreneurial activities (through  venture capital funds).  •  Create a National Cybersecurity R&D  Center responsible —among other  things— for developing malware  analysis, security governance, Critical  Infrastructures’ protection, threat  analysis, etc.  •  Create  a  National  Cryptographic  Center responsible for codes/algo- rithms and blockchain development  and security assessments.  Regarding the public sector, key institu- tions are called upon to take part in a sys- temic, coherent, and detailed intervention  to improve national cybersecurity.  In particular, the new National Cy- bersecurity Management Board, at the  center of the Italian cybersecurity frame- work, aims at facilitating governance  simplification by cutting decision-making  processes short and rationalizing both  ordinary and emergency procedures.  The Ministry of Interior (in particu- lar, the National Anti-crime Computer  Centre for the Protection of Critical In- frastructure CNAIPIC) plays a key role  in protecting IT Critical Infrastructures  thanks to its investigative and forensic  capabilities.  UPDATED CYBERSECURITY CRISIS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  Italian Cybersecurity Core Tasks    12  The Italian Cybersecurity Action Plan  The Agency for Digital Italy’s responsi- bilities are equally relevant. The Agency is  in charge of defining IT security guidelines  and technical rules, setting standards,  monitoring quality of public networks’  security and Public Administration’s ICT  programs.  The Ministry of Defense (MoD) devel- oped specific cyber capabilities —to pro- tect its networks at both national and in- ternational/operational level— which are  also a significant asset for the National  Cybersecurity Management Board’s im- provement process.  The Action Plan also aims at support- ing the MoD on the following initiatives:  •  Creation  of  a  Joint  Command  for  Cyber Operations in charge for MoD  networks and systems protection,  and cyber operations.  •  Establishment of a virtual cyber range  —to be located in Chiavari (Genova  area) within the Armed Forces’ TLC  School facility.  Intelligence Community and MoD  agreed on a specific protocol to align  their strategies and tactics on cybersecu- rity in order to facilitate the consolida- tion of the perspective Joint Command  for Cyber Operations in compliance with  NATO recent posture.  The Action Plan aims to secure na- tional assets according to the following  priorities:  •  Level  1  — National security [Intel- ligence Community, Ministry of De- fense, Ministry of Interior, Ministry  of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice,  Ministry of Economy and Finance,  Ministry of Economic Development].  •  Level 2 — National Critical Infrastruc- tures [TLC, utilities, financial Sector,  transports] and other relevant Pub- lic Administrations (eg. Ministry of  Health).  •  Level  3 — National production sys- tem and population.    13  ACTION ITEM 1 REINFORCING INTELLIGENCE, LAW  ENFORCEMENT, AND DEFENSE CAPABILITIES  1.1 Threat and vulnerability  analysis  a.

Develop coordination capacity on  situational awareness in order to in- crease communication efficiency, to  facilitate response and remediation  activities, to assess when dissemina- tion to the public is needed, and to  identify appropriate communication  channels.  Communication of an occurred cyber-event and about its consequences has a strategic value.  Public and private stakeholder –when public awareness is needed– have to share precise, correct,  and transparent information without generating unnecessary alarms nor increasing economic and  social impacts.  The Italian Cybersecurity Action Plan    29  ACTION ITEM 10 RESOURCES  Analysis of costs related to cyber events is a useful baseline for financial planning and alloca- tion of resources, since risk relevance is proportional to event probability and impact. Adequate  costs’ evaluation can also support intervention activities over specific vulnerabilities and redirect  investments within both the public and the private sector.  10.1 Financial planning a. Identify priorities and budget related  to Critical Infrastructures’ cybersecu- rity and cyberdefense as well as costs  related to development of fundamen- tal capacity both in terms of physical  resources and human capital.  10.2 Evaluation of cyber-events  relevant costs  a. Identify relevant metrics for the evalua- tion of cyber-events’ economic impact  (detection, remediation, reputational  damage, loss of clients and competi- tiveness, etc.).  b. Analyze Critical Infrastructures’ inter- dependencies in order to improve the  evaluation of cyber-events’ economic  impact in case of a “domino effect”.   c. Map incidents and potential scenarios  from an economic point of view.  10.3 Promoting efficient  spending  a. Implement efficient cyberdefence  spending measures at national (pub- lic, public-private) and international  (through cooperation programs) level.  10.4 Human capital a.

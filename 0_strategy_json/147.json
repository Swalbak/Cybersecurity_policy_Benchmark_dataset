Many societies are now dependent on digital technologies which has led these technologies to be considered as a fundamental social infrastructure. Along with their numerous benefits digital technologies also bring with them numerous cyber threats. The global number of cyber security incidents recorded in 2015 was 59.06 million’. A study estimates that the total annual cost of all data breaches by 2019 will be $2.1 trillion which is almost four times the estimated cost of breaches in 2015’. In Sri Lanka, The Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team| Coordination Centre (Sri Lanka CERT|CC) received 3907 cyber security related incidents in 2017, which is a significant increase from 2010. In this context, we, the government of Sri Lanka, seeks to show our commitment to keep the nation safe, secure and prosperous, by introducing Sri Lanka's first Information and Cyber Security Strategy which will be implemented over a period of five years from 2019 to 2023. Our strategy aims to create a resilient and trusted cyber security ecosystem that will enable Sri Lankan citizens to realize the benefits of digital technology, and facilitate growth, prosperity and a better future for all Sri Lankans. Our strategy is underpinned by six pillars: 1. Establishment of a governance framework to implement the National Information and Cyber Security Strategy 2. Enactment and formulation of legislation, policies, and standards to create a regulatory environment to protect individuals and organizations in the cyber space 3. Development of a skilled and competent workforce to detect, defend and respond to cyber attacks 4. Collaboration with public sector authorities to ensure that the digital government systems implemented and operated by them have the appropriate level of cyber security and resilience 5. Raising awareness and empowering citizens to defend themselves against cybercrimes 6. Development of public-private, local-international partnerships to create a robust cyber-security ecosystem WaT ARS NNO INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF SRI LANKA LT Analysis of the Present Status focuses on the status of telecommunication infrastructure, Internet facilities, and Internet usage, and (c) 0.7363 human capital index (HCI) which focus on adult literacy and level of schooling’.

Sri Lanka CERT was established under the Information and Communication Technology eerie Agency (ICTA) of Sri Lanka, and now it is operating ; : RCNA Ne) : . _ orencis ee National directly under the purview of the Ministry of eee amy Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Research Operating Foreign Employment. Se eK: As the complexity of the cyber security ecosystem increases, the government of Sri Lanka recognizes National the necessity of introducing a National Information ant rane and Cyber Security Strategy to cope with emerging etn Nel threats. It is a high-level top-down approach to information and cyber security that establishes a range of national objectives and priorities that should be achieved in a specific timeframe. In line with the strategy, a Digital Infrastructure Protection Agency will be established. The Agency will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the cyber security strategy, setting national polices, facilitating the protection of critical national infrastructure, educating citizens, building a pioneering technology competent woe ce workforce, and promoting industry development. Our Initiatives 1.1. Establishment of the Digital Infrastructure Protection Agency (DIPA) of Sri Lanka DIPA will be established as the apex institution for all cyber security related affairs in Sri Lanka. The Agency mandate shall be to oversee the implementation of the National Information and Cyber Security Strategy. Our strategy is to establish a powerful agency which oversees the overall implementation of the Information and Cyber Security Strategy of Sri Lanka, and to establish specialized subordinate agencies for effectively battling emerging cyber threats INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF SRI LANKA The agency shall, 1.1.1 1.1.2. 1.1.3. 1.14. 1.1.5. 1.1.6. Function as the command and control body to promote this strategy and play a leading role in implementing cyber security initiatives set forth in this strategy.

Act as a certification body issuing licenses for firms providing information security related services. 1.2. Institutions Under the DIPA 1.2.1. 1.2.2. Sri Lanka CERT|CC will continue to operate as the National CERT to protect users in the public and private sector organizations and the general public by providing up-to- date information on potential threats and vulnerabilities, and by undertaking computer emergency 13 response handling services. DIPA will establish a 24 X 7 Cyber Security Call Centre with a focus on assisting citizens, government organizations, and private firms to respond to cyber security incidents. 1.2.3. DIPA will establish a National Cyber Alert System with the involvement of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Telcos to deliver targeted, timely, and actionable information to Sri Lankans and to educate citizens on how to secure their computer systems. DIPA will establish a Digital Forensic Lab to conduct digital forensic investigations and examinations in the areas of computer forensics, mobile forensics, audio forensics, video forensics and so forth. DIPA will establish the National Cyber Security Operating Centre (NCSOC) for monitoring threats to digital government applications, critical information infrastructure, and critical systems of private firms. DIPA will establish the National Certification Authority (NCA) to address the limitations of the Certification Service Providers (CSPs). DIPA will establish a Research Unit for developing, coordinating and stimulating continuous research activities in the fields of Strategic Policy Research, Information Security Research, Cyber Security and Technology related research. 1.2.4. 1.2.5. 1.2.6. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Framework A comprehensive results based M&E framework will be developed to assess and measure the performance of the outcomes and outputs as a result of the implementation of the strategy. INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF SRI LANKA Thrust # 2: Legislation, Polices, and Standards Our Strategy The number of reported incidents involving cybercrimes against individuals and organization in Sri Lanka is increasing day by day. These include cybercrimes against individuals such as credit card fraud, revenge porn, crimes again property such as worm attacks, hacking, and intellectual property theft, and crimes against governmental and other organizations such as cyber terrorism, hacking of websites, processing of unauthorized information, and hacking into sensitive financial data. To battle cybercrimes against individuals and organizations effectively, it is necessary to enact and formulate appropriate legislation, policies, and standards for ensuring protection of sensitive data, digital transactions, electronic communications, privacy, and freedom of expression in the cyber space. The government of Sri Lanka has taken a number of steps in this regard such as the introduction of the government security policy (2009) based on ISO 27000, and data sharing policy, and the enactment of relevant legislation such as the Electronic Transactions Act No. 19 of 2006, Payment Devices Frauds Act No 30 of 2006, the Intellectual Property Rights Acts, and Computer Crimes Act No 24 of 2007. Sri Lanka ratified the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime in 2015 and became the first country in South Asia to join this convention. Moreover, a Computer Crimes Division was established in the Criminal Investigation Department of Sri Lanka Police in line with the enactment of Computer Crimes Act. To further strengthen our regulatory framework to effectively battle emerging cybercrimes, gaps in the existing policies and laws will be identified, and new legislation, policies, and standards will be drafted and implemented to create a secure cyberspace for individuals and organizations.

Introduce a New Cyber Security Act 2.1.1. The government will introduce a new Cybersecurity Act for the establishment of the DIPA and for equipping the agency with the necessary powers to effectively address increasingly sophisticated threats to the nation 2.1.2. The new Act will establish a comprehensive framework for the prevention and management of Cyber Security threats and incidents effectively, and protection of critical information infrastructure. INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF SRI LANKA 2.2. Data Protection and Privacy Laws 2.2.1. Currently, the number of cases on stealing customer data is on the rise. However, Sri Lanka lacks appropriate laws to protect customer data. We will, therefore, introduce a data privacy and protection law which governs the collection, use, and disclosure of citizens’ personal data by government and private sector organizations. Through this act, we will ensure that all government organizations and private sector firms which maintain citizens’ data have adequate security controls in place and make them liable for privacy violations. 2.2.2. 2.3. Data Sharing Policy 2.3.1. We will also introduce a data sharing policy for government organizations 2.4. Baseline Security Standards We will facilitate the Sri Lanka Standards Institute to develop baseline information and cyber security standards for information systems, hardware, and software applications. 2.5. Critical Infrastructure Protection Policy We will introduce Critical Infrastructure Protection Policy which will identify and declare infrastructure as critical infrastructure and provide measures necessary for protecting, safeguarding and increasing resilience of critical infrastructure. 2.6. Information Security Policy We will facilitate organizations to develop security policies based on the maturity of their information systems. The information security policy of each organization shall be developed aligning with international standards. Thrust # 3: Development of a Competent Workforce Our Strategy Cyber-attacks and the disruptions to information systems caused by these attacks are increasing exponentially. In this context, it is necessary to ensure the availability of a cadre of knowledgeable and highly skilled professionals in the field of information and cyber security domain to protect, detect, defend and respond to these cyber-attacks. In 2016, skills gap analysis from ISACA estimated a global shortage of 2 million cybersecurity professionals by 2019®. As per the GCI, Sri Lanka requires to expend much effort on building overall human resource capacity to combat emerging cyber threats. In Sri Lanka, to date, there is a distinct lack of initiatives to address the domestic shortage of cybersecurity experts. We will, therefore, aim to implement appropriate strategies to facilitate our workforce to gain and maintain the knowledge, skills, experience and technological capabilities needed to effectively work in the cyber environment. Our strategy is to create a virtuous circle of supply and demand of information and cyber security experts through continuous assessment of the gap between the supply and demand of cyber professionals, increasing learning opportunities to capitalize on cyber security knowledge, and educating youth for building a pool of future cybersecurity professionals INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF SRI LANKA Specialized skilling Oppotuniti eis Supply and Demand Gap Sollee are Trainings 9 Framework Competent Workforce Expanding Tertiary and Vocational Education Training Infrastructu ote (0) li GelU nas e-Learning Modules Our Initiatives 3.1. 3.2. Assess Supply and Demand of Professionals We will conduct a national level survey to understand the gap between the supply of information and cybersecurity professionals and demand from the industry for such professionals in Sri Lanka. Such an analysis is important for DIPA to formulate appropriate strategies and policies to fill the supply and demand gap. Competency Framework 3.2.1. We will develop a National Information and Cyber Security Competency Framework which outlines the core competencies that both the government and private sector should possess to effectively work in the cyber environment. In developing the framework, carder structure of the public service and private sector would be taken into account. 3.3. 3.2.2. We will work with Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission to develop National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) standards for various disciplines in the Information and Cyber Security domain. The proposed National Information and Cyber Security Competency Framework shall comply with the NVQ Standards and Professional Qualification Standards as defined by International Standardization bodies. Up-Skilling and Re-Skilling Opportunities for Public Sector Staff A minimum NVQ standard will be introduced as a qualification requirement for each layer of staff in the Information Technology service, and in other services who are involved with ICT initiatives. We will also facilitate the organizing of special training courses (based on NVQ Standards) for the staff of agencies maintaining critical infrastructure, agencies dealing with most vulnerable communities in our society, law enforcement authorities, Tri-forces and the Intelligence Services. As per Information and Cyber Security Competency Framework, we will roll out information and cyber security training program for staff at grass root level organizations in the public service across the country. We will offer scholarships for public sector staff to undertake specialized postgraduate degrees and to take up professional courses in this domain. We will include information and cyber security for Confidence and Efficiency Bar exams in public service. 3.3.1. 3.3.2. 3.3.3. 3.3.4. INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF SRI LANKA LT 3.4. 3.5. 3.6. 3.7. Expanding Tertiary and Vocational Education 3.4.1. We will facilitate local universities, vocational training institutes, and private educational service providers to introduce industry oriented diplomas, undergraduate and post graduate programs to provide learning opportunities to students to develop a solid foundation in both theory and practice of information security to advance their practical 3.8. cybersecurity skills. We will facilitate private professional entities/accreditation institutes to award professional qualifications in this domain. 3.4.2. Training Infrastructure across the Country 3.5.1. We will facilitate private firms to develop information and cyber security training infrastructure across the country by way of public private partnership arrangements. We will empower government training institutes (e.g. Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration, Sri Lanka Institute of Local Governance) to conduct information and cyber security training for government staff. 3.5.2. e-Learning Modules We will encourage the Distance Learning Centre to design e-learning modules on Cyber Security which government staff can take up upon their convenience. Opportunities for Government Staff to Attend International Conferences Continuous participation and contribution to international conferences on information security is essential to state our position and deepen communications with various actors around the world. We recognize that participation at such conferences would not only help to capitalize on cybersecurity expertise knowledge but also to build networks with cyber security professionals from around the globe. Through our international partnerships and the External Resource Department of Sri Lanka, we will seek such opportunities for Chief Innovation Officers (CIOs) and Chief Information Security Officers of the public service. Future Career Paths 3.8.1. We will advocate for inclusion of information and cyber security into the school curriculum with the aim of creating a talented pool of cyber security professionals in future. We will facilitate career guidance workshops at schools across the country to raise awareness of the emerging career opportunities in this domain. Students who are completing GCE A/L shall be the target group. Women are globally underrepresented in the cybersecurity profession. Globally it is at 11%, much lower than the representation of women in the overall global workforce Special attention will be given to creating an interest in cybersecurity among female school students as there is inadequate women participation in this domain. 3.8.2. 3.8.3. Women in Cybersecurity Workforce (Asia Pacific Region)*° Women 90% INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF SRI LANKA Thrust # 4: Resilient Digital Government Systems and Infrastructure Our Strategy Sri Lanka has advanced rapidly over the past decade in developing various digital government initiatives. Multimillion investments made on various digital government initiatives have helped Sri Lanka to advance from 101 (2008) to 79\" position (2016) in the e-Government Development Index’. To date there are about 500 government websites and more than 50 e-services facilitating citizens to obtain services through the Internet. e-Administrative applications have been developed by public organizations that maintain critical infrastructure with the aim of increasing the organizational efficiency thereby providing better services for citizens. Lanka Government Network, and Lanka Government Cloud provide the necessary digital infrastructure for e-services and e-administrative services. Although digital government initiatives promise tremendous benefits for citizens and government, they also bring threats of various cyberattacks such as malware attacks, unauthorized access, and denial of service attacks. Cyber-attacks on digital government services can cause significant disruptions to the public service delivery, and thereby destroy public confidence. Our citizens will not embrace digital government if their information cannot be securely kept in the government systems. It is, therefore, essential to adopt appropriate strategies to ensure security of digital government systems and critical information infrastructure. Our strategy is to ensure that our digital systems and digital infrastructure are resilient to cyber threats, through implementing risk management processes, implementing appropriate security policies and strategies at the organizational level, increasing awareness and building the capacity of public sector staff at all levels Sycreu sia] Risk Assessment Governmen Security mes.

This unit will be responsible for detecting and analyzing cyber threats and vulnerabilities, disseminating cyber threat alerts, and coordinating incident response activities. 4.3.2. We will coordinate multi-sector cybersecurity exercises with the involvement of this unit. Through these exercises, we aim to identify vulnerabilities arising from cross- sector interdependencies and stress- test coordination and communication across sectors. 44.1. It is widely believed that the awareness of Sri Lankan public officers on information and cyber security should be improved. We will, therefore, first conduct information and cyber security readiness surveys on public sector employees periodically to assess their readiness to work in a digital government environment. 44.2. In line with the Competency Framework, CIOs and Technical staff working in digital government environment will be empowered with appropriate skills and knowledge on information and cyber security. INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF SRI LANKA 4.4.3. As per the Information and Cyber Security Competency Framework (Thrust Area 3), we will, conduct information and cyber security awareness activities across all levels of government staff. 4.5. Chief Information Security Officer and Information Security Officers 45.1. We will work with the Department of Management Service to establish a “Chief Information Security Officer” position in the public service, which will be the highest level position in the information and cyber security domain in the public service. Depending on the usage of ICT systems at public organizations, we will appoint Information Security Officers for government organizations and develop their capacity through comprehensive knowledge building exercises. 45.2. 4.6. Security-by-Design in Digital Government Systems Development 4.6.1. Security-by-Design is a best practice which can be adopted to secure digital government upfront and throughout its life cycle. By integrating risk assessment into the system development life cycle, trade- offs between security, cost and functionalities can be balanced. We will encourage solution developers to incorporate security-by-design principles when developing digital government systems and digital infrastructure. We will work with the National Procurement Commission of Sri Lanka to incorporate such conditions to standard government bidding documents. 4.6.2. Thrust # 5: Raising Awareness and Empowerment of Citizens Our Strategy The Internet has become important for all aspects of daily life including education, work, and participation in society. A considerable segment of society is becoming more and more dependent on the Internet thereby becoming more vulnerable to cybercrime. A major reason for such vulnerabilities to cybercrime is lack of awareness among citizens about possible cyber threats and their consequences. Theft of identity, stealing of credit card numbers, and privacy violation and unauthorized access on social media for example are commonly caused due to the lack of awareness of citizens. It is, therefore, essential to raise citizens’ awareness about emerging cyber threats and empower them with the knowledge and skills necessary to defend themselves against evolving cyber threats.

Our Initiatives National Information and Cyber Security Readiness Survey In collaboration with the Department of Census and Statistics, we will conduct a National Baseline Survey to assess Sri Lankan citizens’ awareness, attitudes and behaviors on cyber security related activities. Public’s Awareness of Social Media and Cyber Security 5.2.1. We will extend the services of CERT website to provide a comprehensive collection of materials and activities relating to cybersecurity, and incorporate a comprehensive complaints reporting system to assist victims. We will increase information and cyber security awareness among the public through hosting awareness campaigns, organizing public conferences, street dramas, and so forth. We will pay special attention to most vulnerable communities in the society including youth, women and elderly people. We will use printed and electronic media to reach a broader population. Content shall be in trilingual format. We will also use social media as a tool for increasing the information security awareness of citizens. We will also enhance the content of well-known government web sites (e.g. defence.gov.lk) with 5.2.2. 5.2.3. 5.24. 5.2.5. SScToU gia Awareness for School Children Lifelong Learning information and cyber security related materials (e.g. presentations, and webinars). The Government Call Centre (1919) will be also enhanced to provide basic information on cyber security related matters. INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF SRI LANKA 5.3. Introduction of Information and Cyber Security into Curriculums 5.3.1. We will facilitate the Ministry of Education and the National Institute of Education to include information and cyber security as an essential part of the informatics curriculum at schools. We will facilitate the Ministry of Education to increase school children’s awareness on cyber security. We will also continue to publish the Cyber Guardian (newsletter on cybersecurity) and circulate among school and university students to increase their awareness on latest cyber threats. 5.3.2. 5.4. Lifelong Learning Opportunities With the involvement of Open University of Sri Lanka and Vocational Training Institutes we will design basic information and cyber security learning modules for adults. We aim to deliver these courses through the Open University’s distance learning centres, Nenasala Centres, vocational training institutes and accredited training institutes scattered around country. 5.5. Security Ratings for ICT Equipment and Create Awareness Among Citizens We will facilitate the Sri Lanka Standards Institute to develop Security Ratings for ICT products which will enable citizens to have a clear idea of the level of security that a product offers. We will also work with ICT product suppliers’ associations to supply products into the market by enabling security settings by default. Through effective communication channels we will make citizens aware of security ratings and security features of ICT products. Thrust # 6: Development of Public-Private, Local- International Partnerships Our Strategy Sri Lankan cyber community as a part of the global Internet community faces many vulnerabilities. Social engineered Trojans attacks, malware attacks, phishing attacks, advanced persistent threats, botnets, ransomware, financial frauds for example are increasingly posing many threats to the Sri Lankan Internet community. The government of Sri Lanka acknowledges that the government alone cannot effectively combat these threats. Collective efforts of end users, academics, private sector hardware and software vendors, Telcos and ISPs, private sector critical infrastructure owners, are essential in battling against these cyber threats. Moreover, cybersecurity cannot be achieved by any one nation alone, and greater levels of international cooperation is needed to confront those actors who seek to disrupt or exploit our networks. Our strategy is to develop a mechanism for cooperation extending beyond government agencies to public-private collaboration, and local- international collaboration in developing a cybersecurity ecosystem INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF SRI LANKA 6.2.

Partner with Telecommunication and ISPs to Protect Internet Users 6.1.1. ISPs in Sri Lanka occupy a unique position as the gateway to Sri Lanka's cyberspace. We will, therefore, set up a Telco-CERT with the involvement of Telcos and ISPs to effectively handle emerging cyber threats. Telco-CERT would be involved in tackling phishing attacks, blocking malicious domains and IP addresses, and deploying other measures to disrupt malware attacks 6.4. including measures to secure the telecommunications and Internet routing infrastructure. 6.1.2. We will encourage ISPs to increase their customers’ awareness on cyber security risks, and best practices for avoiding cyber threats. IP Reputational Service We will work with Telecommunication Regulatory Authority of Sri Lanka (TRC) and ISPs to determine the possibility of maintaining an Internet Protocol Reputation Service. This will facilitate online service providers to obtain information about an IP address to which they are connecting. Through this service, spreading of harmful content shall be minimized. Partner with Firms Operating Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) to Create Resilience Our systems depend on the critical infrastructure information systems that are owned by non-government actors. There are many private companies which provide critical services to the general public in the domains of finance, power and energy, transport, aviation, health and so forth. Although the government is not responsible for securing the critical information infrastructure owned by private firms, it is essential to support these private firms to protect their information infrastructure where a damage to the information infrastructure would interrupt the day-to- day lives of citizens. We will therefore, work closely with Critical Infrastructure owners and operators to expand initiatives to secure the CII ecosystem, preserve the benefits of cyberspace, and avoid unnecessary impediments to technological evolution. Empower Sectoral Ministries Maintaining Digital Government Systems The primary responsibility of safeguarding security in each sector's digital government systems and infrastructure, and of ensuring adequate preventive measures against cyber threats lies with the sectoral ministries. This means that each sectoral ministry has a responsibility of identifying critical infrastructure in their sector, and ensuring INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF SRI LANKA 6.5. 6.6. adequate security by assessing, determining 6.7. and implementing preventive measures in their sector. Work with Military Establishments to Establish a Joint Military Security Operation Centre/Defence CERT Sri Lankan Militaries, Police, and Intelligence Services all work separately in confronting malicious cyber actors. However, there is a lack of coordination among these organizations to share valuable information on cyber threats. In this context, with the involvement of relevant authorities, we will establish a joint Cyber Security Operations Centre/Defence CERT with a focus on strengthening our cyber defences and ensuring that our defence forces are able to continue to operate securely. The creation of a single unified military security operations centre would provide better capabilities to speedily overcome challenges presented by operating in cyberspace. Promote Cooperation with Industry Sectors 6.8. 6.6.1. We will encourage industry sectors to work together in order to jointly improve detection, prevention, response and recovery capabilities. We will develop a channel to share real-time sensitive information on cyber threats and potential consequences with industry sectors. We will also develop a mechanism to share information on cyber threats and vulnerabilities with medium size businesses, which are currently increasingly being victimized by malicious actors in the cyber space. Tailored alerts and advice will be generated for them. 6.6.2. Strengthening International Partnerships Through effective operational links between countries and across the region, we will engage with the international community to build a system of cyberspace stability. We will sign agreements with international organizations such as International Telecommunication Union (ITU), The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT), Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), Forum for Incident Response Security Teams (FIRST), United Nations Internet Governance Forum (UNIGF), Internet Society (ISOC), International Watch and Warning Network (IWWN), and the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) for exchanging technical information on threats and vulnerabilities, obtaining latest software and hardware products, conducting joint cyber drills, and building the capacity of the Staff. Budapest Convention On 1st September 2015, Sri Lanka ratified the Council of Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention) and became the first country in South Asia to become a party to the Convention. The Budapest Convention is the only international legally binding treaty on Cybercrime in the world today and seeks to harmonize national laws, adopt improved investigative powers based on international standards, enhance criminal justice cooperation among State Parties in order to effectively combat the threat against cybercrime °. We will take initiatives to implement and comply with the Budapest Convention requirements and will continuously work with member countries to build a secure cyber space. INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF SRI LANKA 6.9. 6.10. 6.11. 6.12. Increase our Presence at International Level We will enhance our presence at the international level through participation in international forums and conferences on cyber security and through playing an active role in knowledge gaining and sharing exercises. Partner with Businesses to Promote Security in Products and Services We will work with suppliers to bring products and services to the market with a high level of security to ensure the privacy and security of customer information. Partner with Universities to build a Cyber Security Research Culture 6.11.1. We will work with Universities in Sri Lanka to promote a cybersecurity research culture in Sri Lanka. 6.11.2. In partnership with donors and universities, we will introduce research grant schemes for students undertaking research on cyber security. 6.11.3. With the partnership of all stakeholders in this domain we will continue to host an annual national cybersecurity week followed by a national cyber security conference. Support of Government Organizations, Social Groups and NGOs 6.12.1. With the involvement of government stakeholders including the Ministry of Social Empowerment and Welfare, Ministry of Women and Child Affairs, the Child Protection Authority, and Ministry of Law and Order we will increase the awareness of rural communities, and most vulnerable communities in our society on cyber security. 6.13. 6.12.2. With the involvement of groups in the civil society (e.g. SMART Social Circles, Nenasala Centres, Community Centres), and NGOs, we will increase rural and semi urban citizens’ awareness on cyber security, and help and guide citizens towards safe, enjoyable experiences online. Nurture Start-ups We aim to support entrepreneurs to establish cyber security startups. We will nurture start-ups to boost the development of niche solutions and grow local champions to sustain strategic areas of interest. In partnerships with Sri Lanka Software Exporters Association, we will develop market opportunities to bring made-in-Sri Lanka solutions into the global market.

Many   societies are now dependent on digital technologies   which has led these technologies to be considered as   a fundamental social infrastructure.   Along with their numerous benefits digital   technologies also bring with them numerous cyber   threats. The global number of cyber security incidents   recorded in 2015 was 59.06 million’. A study estimates  that the total annual cost of all data breaches by 2019   will be $2.1 trillion which is almost four times the   estimated cost of breaches in 2015’. In Sri Lanka, The   Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team|   Coordination Centre (Sri Lanka CERT|CC) received   3907 cyber security related incidents in 2017, which is   a significant increase from 2010.   In this context, we, the government of Sri Lanka, seeks   to show our commitment to keep the nation safe,  secure and prosperous, by introducing Sri Lanka's first      Information and Cyber Security Strategy which will be  implemented over a period of five years from 2019 to   2023. Our strategy aims to create a resilient and   trusted cyber security ecosystem that will enable Sri   Lankan citizens to realize the benefits of digital   technology, and facilitate growth, prosperity and a   better future for all Sri Lankans.   Our strategy is underpinned by six pillars:       1. Establishment of a governance framework to implement   the National Information and Cyber Security Strategy   2. Enactment and formulation of legislation, policies, and   standards to create a regulatory environment to protect   individuals and organizations in the cyber space   3. Development of a skilled and competent workforce to   detect, defend and respond to cyber attacks   4. Collaboration with public sector authorities to ensure   that the digital government systems implemented and   operated by them have the appropriate level of cyber   security and resilience   5. Raising awareness and empowering citizens to defend   themselves against cybercrimes   6. Development of public-private, local-international   partnerships to create a robust cyber-security ecosystem       WaT ARS NNO    INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF SRI LANKA  LT  Analysis of the Present Status focuses on the status of telecommunication   infrastructure, Internet facilities, and Internet usage,   and (c) 0.7363 human capital index (HCI) which focus   on adult literacy and level of schooling’.

Se eK:   As the complexity of the cyber security ecosystem   increases, the government of Sri Lanka recognizes National   the necessity of introducing a National Information ant rane   and Cyber Security Strategy to cope with emerging etn Nel   threats. It is a high-level top-down approach to   information and cyber security that establishes a   range of national objectives and priorities that   should be achieved in a specific timeframe.   In line with the strategy, a Digital Infrastructure   Protection Agency will be established. The   Agency will be responsible for overseeing the   implementation of the cyber security strategy,   setting national polices, facilitating the protection of   critical national infrastructure, educating citizens,   building a pioneering technology competent woe ce   workforce, and promoting industry development. Our Initiatives   1.1.

DIPA will establish a 24 X 7 Cyber   Security Call Centre with a focus on   assisting citizens, government   organizations, and private firms to   respond to cyber security incidents.   1.2.3. DIPA will establish a National   Cyber Alert System with the   involvement of Internet Service   Providers (ISPs) and Telcos to   deliver targeted, timely, and   actionable information to Sri   Lankans and to educate citizens on   how to secure their computer   systems.   DIPA will establish a Digital   Forensic Lab to conduct digital   forensic investigations and   examinations in the areas of   computer forensics, mobile   forensics, audio forensics, video   forensics and so forth.   DIPA will establish the National   Cyber Security Operating Centre   (NCSOC) for monitoring threats to   digital government applications,   critical information infrastructure,   and critical systems of private firms.   DIPA will establish the National   Certification Authority (NCA) to   address the limitations of the   Certification Service Providers   (CSPs).   DIPA will establish a Research Unit   for developing, coordinating and   stimulating continuous research   activities in the fields of Strategic   Policy Research, Information   Security Research, Cyber Security   and Technology related research.   1.2.4.   1.2.5.   1.2.6.   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)   Framework   A comprehensive results based M&E   framework will be developed to assess and   measure the performance of the outcomes   and outputs as a result of the   implementation of the strategy.    INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF SRI LANKA   Thrust # 2: Legislation, Polices,   and Standards   Our Strategy   The number of reported incidents involving   cybercrimes against individuals and organization in   Sri Lanka is increasing day by day. These include   cybercrimes against individuals such as credit card   fraud, revenge porn, crimes again property such as   worm attacks, hacking, and intellectual property   theft, and crimes against governmental and other   organizations such as cyber terrorism, hacking of   websites, processing of unauthorized information,   and hacking into sensitive financial data. To battle   cybercrimes against individuals and organizations   effectively, it is necessary to enact and formulate   appropriate legislation, policies, and standards for   ensuring protection of sensitive data, digital   transactions, electronic communications, privacy,   and freedom of expression in the cyber space.   The government of Sri Lanka has taken a number of   steps in this regard such as the introduction of the   government security policy (2009) based on ISO   27000, and data sharing policy, and the enactment   of relevant legislation such as the Electronic   Transactions Act No. 19 of 2006, Payment Devices   Frauds Act No 30 of 2006, the Intellectual Property   Rights Acts, and Computer Crimes Act No 24 of   2007. Sri Lanka ratified the Budapest Convention on   Cybercrime in 2015 and became the first country in   South Asia to join this convention. Moreover, a   Computer Crimes Division was established in the   Criminal Investigation Department of Sri Lanka   Police in line with the enactment of Computer   Crimes Act.   To further strengthen our regulatory framework to   effectively battle emerging cybercrimes, gaps in the   existing policies and laws will be identified, and new   legislation, policies, and standards will be drafted   and implemented to create a secure cyberspace for   individuals and organizations.

Introduce a New Cyber Security Act   2.1.1. The government will introduce a new   Cybersecurity Act for the   establishment of the DIPA and for   equipping the agency with the   necessary powers to effectively   address increasingly sophisticated   threats to the nation   2.1.2. The new Act will establish a   comprehensive framework for the   prevention and management of   Cyber Security threats and incidents   effectively, and protection of critical   information infrastructure.    INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF SRI LANKA   2.2. Data Protection and Privacy Laws   2.2.1. Currently, the number of cases on   stealing customer data is on the rise.   However, Sri Lanka lacks appropriate   laws to protect customer data. We   will, therefore, introduce a data   privacy and protection law which   governs the collection, use, and   disclosure of citizens’ personal data   by government and private sector   organizations.   Through this act, we will ensure that   all government organizations and   private sector firms which maintain   citizens’ data have adequate security   controls in place and make them   liable for privacy violations.   2.2.2.   2.3. Data Sharing Policy   2.3.1. We will also introduce a data sharing  policy for government organizations   2.4. Baseline Security Standards   We will facilitate the Sri Lanka Standards   Institute to develop baseline information   and cyber security standards for information   systems, hardware, and software   applications.   2.5. Critical Infrastructure Protection Policy   We will introduce Critical Infrastructure   Protection Policy which will identify and   declare infrastructure as critical   infrastructure and provide measures   necessary for protecting, safeguarding and   increasing resilience of critical infrastructure.   2.6. Information Security Policy   We will facilitate organizations to develop   security policies based on the maturity of   their information systems. The information   security policy of each organization shall be   developed aligning with international   standards.   Thrust # 3: Development of a   Competent Workforce   Our Strategy   Cyber-attacks and the disruptions to information   systems caused by these attacks are increasing   exponentially. In this context, it is necessary to   ensure the availability of a cadre of knowledgeable   and highly skilled professionals in the field of   information and cyber security domain to protect,   detect, defend and respond to these cyber-attacks.   In 2016, skills gap analysis from ISACA estimated a   global shortage of 2 million cybersecurity   professionals by 2019®. As per the GCI, Sri Lanka   requires to expend much effort on building overall   human resource capacity to combat emerging cyber   threats. In Sri Lanka, to date, there is a distinct lack   of initiatives to address the domestic shortage of   cybersecurity experts. We will, therefore, aim to   implement appropriate strategies to facilitate our   workforce to gain and maintain the knowledge,   skills, experience and technological capabilities   needed to effectively work in the cyber   environment.       Our strategy is to create a virtuous circle of   supply and demand of information and cyber   security experts through continuous   assessment of the gap between the supply and   demand of cyber professionals, increasing   learning opportunities to capitalize on cyber   security knowledge, and educating youth for   building a pool of future cybersecurity   professionals        INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF SRI LANKA   Specialized   skilling  Oppotuniti   eis       Supply and  Demand   Gap   Sollee are   Trainings  9 Framework   Competent  Workforce Expanding   Tertiary and  Vocational  Education   Training  Infrastructu  ote (0)   li GelU nas   e-Learning  Modules   Our Initiatives   3.1.   3.2.   Assess Supply and Demand of   Professionals   We will conduct a national level survey to   understand the gap between the supply of   information and cybersecurity professionals   and demand from the industry for such   professionals in Sri Lanka. Such an analysis is   important for DIPA to formulate   appropriate strategies and policies to fill the   supply and demand gap.   Competency Framework   3.2.1. We will develop a National   Information and Cyber Security   Competency Framework which   outlines the core competencies that   both the government and private   sector should possess to effectively   work in the cyber environment. In   developing the framework, carder   structure of the public service and   private sector would be taken into   account.   3.3.   3.2.2. We will work with Tertiary and   Vocational Education Commission to   develop National Vocational   Qualification (NVQ) standards for   various disciplines in the Information   and Cyber Security domain. The   proposed National Information and   Cyber Security Competency   Framework shall comply with the   NVQ Standards and Professional   Qualification Standards as defined by   International Standardization bodies.   Up-Skilling and Re-Skilling Opportunities   for Public Sector Staff   A minimum NVQ standard will be   introduced as a qualification   requirement for each layer of staff in   the Information Technology service,   and in other services who are   involved with ICT initiatives.   We will also facilitate the organizing   of special training courses (based on   NVQ Standards) for the staff of   agencies maintaining critical   infrastructure, agencies dealing with   most vulnerable communities in our   society, law enforcement authorities,   Tri-forces and the Intelligence   Services.   As per Information and Cyber   Security Competency Framework, we   will roll out information and cyber   security training program for staff at   grass root level organizations in the   public service across the country.   We will offer scholarships for public   sector staff to undertake specialized   postgraduate degrees and to take up   professional courses in this domain.   We will include information and   cyber security for Confidence and   Efficiency Bar exams in public service.   3.3.1.   3.3.2.   3.3.3.   3.3.4.    INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF SRI LANKA  LT   3.4.   3.5.   3.6.   3.7.   Expanding Tertiary and Vocational   Education   3.4.1. We will facilitate local universities,   vocational training institutes, and   private educational service providers   to introduce industry oriented   diplomas, undergraduate and post   graduate programs to provide   learning opportunities to students to   develop a solid foundation in both   theory and practice of information   security to advance their practical 3.8.  cybersecurity skills.   We will facilitate private professional   entities/accreditation institutes to   award professional qualifications in   this domain.   3.4.2.   Training Infrastructure across the Country   3.5.1. We will facilitate private firms to   develop information and cyber   security training infrastructure across   the country by way of public private   partnership arrangements.   We will empower government   training institutes (e.g. Sri Lanka   Institute of Development   Administration, Sri Lanka Institute of   Local Governance) to conduct   information and cyber security   training for government staff.   3.5.2.   e-Learning Modules   We will encourage the Distance Learning   Centre to design e-learning modules on   Cyber Security which government staff can   take up upon their convenience.   Opportunities for Government Staff to   Attend International Conferences   Continuous participation and contribution to   international conferences on information   security is essential to state our position and   deepen communications with various actors   around the world. We recognize that   participation at such conferences would not   only help to capitalize on cybersecurity   expertise knowledge but also to build   networks with cyber security professionals   from around the globe. Through our   international partnerships and the External   Resource Department of Sri Lanka, we will   seek such opportunities for Chief Innovation   Officers (CIOs) and Chief Information   Security Officers of the public service.   Future Career Paths   3.8.1. We will advocate for inclusion of   information and cyber security into   the school curriculum with the aim of   creating a talented pool of cyber   security professionals in future.   We will facilitate career guidance   workshops at schools across the   country to raise awareness of the   emerging career opportunities in this   domain. Students who are   completing GCE A/L shall be the   target group.   Women are globally   underrepresented in the   cybersecurity profession. Globally it   is at 11%, much lower than the   representation of women in the   overall global workforce Special   attention will be given to creating an   interest in cybersecurity among   female school students as there is   inadequate women participation in   this domain.   3.8.2.   3.8.3.   Women in Cybersecurity Workforce (Asia Pacific   Region)*°       Women           90%    INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF SRI LANKA   Thrust # 4: Resilient Digital   Government Systems and   Infrastructure   Our Strategy   Sri Lanka has advanced rapidly over the past decade   in developing various digital government initiatives.   Multimillion investments made on various digital   government initiatives have helped Sri Lanka to   advance from 101 (2008) to 79\" position (2016) in   the e-Government Development Index’. To date   there are about 500 government websites and more   than 50 e-services facilitating citizens to obtain   services through the Internet. e-Administrative   applications have been developed by public   organizations that maintain critical infrastructure   with the aim of increasing the organizational   efficiency thereby providing better services for   citizens. Lanka Government Network, and Lanka   Government Cloud provide the necessary digital   infrastructure for e-services and e-administrative   services.   Although digital government initiatives promise   tremendous benefits for citizens and government,   they also bring threats of various cyberattacks such   as malware attacks, unauthorized access, and denial   of service attacks. Cyber-attacks on digital   government services can cause significant   disruptions to the public service delivery, and   thereby destroy public confidence. Our citizens will   not embrace digital government if their information   cannot be securely kept in the government systems.   It is, therefore, essential to adopt appropriate   strategies to ensure security of digital government   systems and critical information infrastructure.       Our strategy is to ensure that our digital   systems and digital infrastructure are resilient   to cyber threats, through implementing risk   management processes, implementing   appropriate security policies and strategies at   the organizational level, increasing awareness   and building the capacity of public sector staff   at all levels           Sycreu sia]  Risk   Assessment   Governmen Security  mes.

We will coordinate multi-sector   cybersecurity exercises with the   involvement of this unit. Through   these exercises, we aim to identify   vulnerabilities arising from cross-   sector interdependencies and stress-   test coordination and   communication across sectors.            44.1. It is widely believed that the   awareness of Sri Lankan public   officers on information and cyber   security should be improved. We will,   therefore, first conduct information   and cyber security readiness surveys   on public sector employees   periodically to assess their readiness   to work in a digital government   environment.   44.2. In line with the Competency   Framework, CIOs and Technical staff   working in digital government   environment will be empowered with   appropriate skills and knowledge on   information and cyber security.    INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF SRI LANKA   4.4.3. As per the Information and Cyber   Security Competency Framework   (Thrust Area 3), we will, conduct   information and cyber security   awareness activities across all levels   of government staff.   4.5. Chief Information Security Officer and   Information Security Officers   45.1. We will work with the Department of   Management Service to establish a   “Chief Information Security Officer”   position in the public service, which   will be the highest level position in   the information and cyber security   domain in the public service.   Depending on the usage of ICT   systems at public organizations, we   will appoint Information Security   Officers for government   organizations and develop their   capacity through comprehensive   knowledge building exercises.   45.2.   4.6. Security-by-Design in Digital Government   Systems Development   4.6.1. Security-by-Design is a best practice   which can be adopted to secure   digital government upfront and   throughout its life cycle. By   integrating risk assessment into the   system development life cycle, trade-   offs between security, cost and   functionalities can be balanced. We   will encourage solution developers   to incorporate security-by-design   principles when developing digital   government systems and digital   infrastructure.   We will work with the National   Procurement Commission of Sri   Lanka to incorporate such conditions   to standard government bidding   documents.   4.6.2.   Thrust # 5: Raising Awareness   and Empowerment of Citizens   Our Strategy   The Internet has become important for all aspects   of daily life including education, work, and   participation in society. A considerable segment of   society is becoming more and more dependent on   the Internet thereby becoming more vulnerable to   cybercrime. A major reason for such vulnerabilities   to cybercrime is lack of awareness among citizens   about possible cyber threats and their   consequences. Theft of identity, stealing of credit   card numbers, and privacy violation and   unauthorized access on social media for example   are commonly caused due to the lack of awareness   of citizens. It is, therefore, essential to raise citizens’   awareness about emerging cyber threats and   empower them with the knowledge and skills   necessary to defend themselves against evolving   cyber threats.

Public’s Awareness of Social Media and   Cyber Security   5.2.1. We will extend the services of CERT   website to provide a comprehensive   collection of materials and activities   relating to cybersecurity, and   incorporate a comprehensive   complaints reporting system to assist   victims.   We will increase information and   cyber security awareness among the   public through hosting awareness   campaigns, organizing public   conferences, street dramas, and so   forth.   We will pay special attention to most   vulnerable communities in the   society including youth, women and   elderly people.   We will use printed and electronic   media to reach a broader population.   Content shall be in trilingual format.   We will also use social media as a   tool for increasing the information   security awareness of citizens.   We will also enhance the content of   well-known government web sites   (e.g. www.gov.|k,www.news.gov.|k,   www. defence.gov.lk) with   5.2.2.   5.2.3.   5.24.   5.2.5.

Introduction of Information and Cyber   Security into Curriculums   5.3.1. We will facilitate the Ministry of   Education and the National Institute   of Education to include information   and cyber security as an essential   part of the informatics curriculum at   schools.   We will facilitate the Ministry of   Education to increase school   children’s awareness on cyber   security. We will also continue to   publish the Cyber Guardian   (newsletter on cybersecurity) and   circulate among school and   university students to increase their   awareness on latest cyber threats.   5.3.2.   5.4. Lifelong Learning Opportunities   With the involvement of Open University of   Sri Lanka and Vocational Training Institutes   we will design basic information and cyber   security learning modules for adults. We aim   to deliver these courses through the Open   University’s distance learning centres,   Nenasala Centres, vocational training   institutes and accredited training institutes   scattered around country.   5.5. Security Ratings for ICT Equipment and   Create Awareness Among Citizens   We will facilitate the Sri Lanka Standards   Institute to develop Security Ratings for ICT   products which will enable citizens to have a   clear idea of the level of security that a   product offers. We will also work with ICT   product suppliers’ associations to supply   products into the market by enabling   security settings by default. Through   effective communication channels we will   make citizens aware of security ratings and   security features of ICT products.   Thrust # 6: Development of   Public-Private, Local-   International Partnerships   Our Strategy   Sri Lankan cyber community as a part of the global   Internet community faces many vulnerabilities.   Social engineered Trojans attacks, malware attacks,  phishing attacks, advanced persistent threats,   botnets, ransomware, financial frauds for example   are increasingly posing many threats to the Sri   Lankan Internet community.   The government of Sri Lanka acknowledges that the   government alone cannot effectively combat these   threats. Collective efforts of end users, academics,   private sector hardware and software vendors,   Telcos and ISPs, private sector critical infrastructure   owners, are essential in battling against these cyber   threats. Moreover, cybersecurity cannot be achieved   by any one nation alone, and greater levels of   international cooperation is needed to confront   those actors who seek to disrupt or exploit our   networks.       Our strategy is to develop a mechanism for   cooperation extending beyond government   agencies to public-private collaboration, and   local- international collaboration in   developing a cybersecurity ecosystem        INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF SRI LANKA       6.2.

Partner with Telecommunication and ISPs   to Protect Internet Users   6.1.1. ISPs in Sri Lanka occupy a unique   position as the gateway to Sri   Lanka's cyberspace. We will,   therefore, set up a Telco-CERT with   the involvement of Telcos and ISPs   to effectively handle emerging cyber   threats. Telco-CERT would be   involved in tackling phishing attacks,   blocking malicious domains and IP   addresses, and deploying other   measures to disrupt malware attacks 6.4.   including measures to secure the   telecommunications and Internet   routing infrastructure.   6.1.2. We will encourage ISPs to increase   their customers’ awareness on cyber   security risks, and best practices for   avoiding cyber threats.   IP Reputational Service   We will work with Telecommunication   Regulatory Authority of Sri Lanka (TRC) and   ISPs to determine the possibility of   maintaining an Internet Protocol Reputation   Service. This will facilitate online service   providers to obtain information about an IP   address to which they are connecting.   Through this service, spreading of harmful   content shall be minimized.   Partner with Firms Operating Critical   Information Infrastructure (CII) to Create   Resilience   Our systems depend on the critical   infrastructure information systems that are   owned by non-government actors. There are   many private companies which provide   critical services to the general public in the   domains of finance, power and energy,   transport, aviation, health and so forth.   Although the government is not responsible   for securing the critical information   infrastructure owned by private firms, it is   essential to support these private firms to   protect their information infrastructure   where a damage to the information   infrastructure would interrupt the day-to-   day lives of citizens. We will therefore, work   closely with Critical Infrastructure owners   and operators to expand initiatives to secure   the CII ecosystem, preserve the benefits of   cyberspace, and avoid unnecessary   impediments to technological evolution.   Empower Sectoral Ministries Maintaining   Digital Government Systems   The primary responsibility of safeguarding   security in each sector's digital government   systems and infrastructure, and of ensuring   adequate preventive measures against cyber   threats lies with the sectoral ministries. This   means that each sectoral ministry has a   responsibility of identifying critical   infrastructure in their sector, and ensuring    INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY OF SRI LANKA   6.5.   6.6.   adequate security by assessing, determining 6.7.   and implementing preventive measures in   their sector.   Work with Military Establishments to   Establish a Joint Military Security   Operation Centre/Defence CERT   Sri Lankan Militaries, Police, and Intelligence   Services all work separately in confronting   malicious cyber actors. However, there is a   lack of coordination among these   organizations to share valuable information   on cyber threats. In this context, with the   involvement of relevant authorities, we will   establish a joint Cyber Security Operations   Centre/Defence CERT with a focus on   strengthening our cyber defences and   ensuring that our defence forces are able to   continue to operate securely. The creation of   a single unified military security operations   centre would provide better capabilities to   speedily overcome challenges presented by   operating in cyberspace.   Promote Cooperation with Industry   Sectors 6.8.   6.6.1. We will encourage industry sectors   to work together in order to jointly   improve detection, prevention,   response and recovery capabilities.   We will develop a channel to share   real-time sensitive information on   cyber threats and potential   consequences with industry sectors.   We will also develop a mechanism to   share information on cyber threats   and vulnerabilities with medium size   businesses, which are currently   increasingly being victimized by   malicious actors in the cyber space.

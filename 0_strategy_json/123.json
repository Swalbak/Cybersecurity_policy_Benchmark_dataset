The objective of this review is to enable the government of Iceland to reassess its cybersecurity capacity in order to prioritise strategic investment in national cybersecurity. Over the period 21–23 June 2017, stakeholders from the following sectors participated in a series of consultations with GCSCC staff: government departments and ministries, legislators and policy owners, criminal justice, law enforcement, academia, as well as the private and financial sectors. The consultations were premised on the Capacity Centre’s Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM)1, which defines five dimensions of cybersecurity capacity: • Policy and strategy • Culture and society • Education, training and skills • Legal and regulatory frameworks • Standards, organisations and technologies Each dimension comprises a number of factors which, taken together, explain what it means to possess cybersecurity capacity. Factors are further subdivided into aspects and for each aspect there are indicators, setting out those conditions that define the level of maturity achieved in any given aspect. There are five stages of maturity, ranging from the start-up to the dynamic. The start-up stage implies an ad-hoc approach to capacity, whereas the dynamic stage is indicative of a strategic approach and the ability to adapt or change in response to environmental considerations. The five stages of the CMM are defined as follows: - Start-up: At this stage either no cybersecurity maturity exists, or it is very embryonic in nature. There might be initial discussions about cybersecurity capacity building, but no concrete actions have been taken. There is an absence of observable evidence of cybersecurity capacity at this stage. - Formative: Some aspects have begun to grow and be formulated, but may be ad-hoc, disorganized, poorly defined – or simply new. However, evidence of this aspect can be clearly demonstrated. - Established: The indicators of the aspect are in place, and functioning. However, there is not well thought-out consideration of the relative allocation of resources. Little trade-off decision-making has been made concerning the relative investment in this aspect. But the aspect is functional and defined. 1 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM), Revised Edition, available at 5 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 - Strategic: At this stage choices have been made about which indicators of this aspect are important, and which are less important for the particular organisation or state. The strategic stage reflects the fact that these choices have been made, conditional upon the state’s or organisation's particular circumstances. - Dynamic: At this stage, there are clear mechanisms in place to alter strategy depending on the prevailing circumstances such as the technological sophistication of the threat environment, global conflict or a significant change in one area of concern (e.g. cybercrime or privacy). Dynamic organisations have developed methods for changing strategies in stride. Rapid decision-making, reallocation of resources, and constant attention to the changing environment are features of this stage. Figure 1 below provides an overall representation of cybersecurity capacity in the Republic of Iceland and illustrates the maturity estimates in each dimension. Each dimension represents one fifth of the graphic, with the five stages of maturity for each factor extending outwards from the centre of the graphic; ‘start-up’ is closest to the centre of the graphic and ‘dynamic’ is placed at the perimeter. Figure 1: Overall representation of the cybersecurity capacity in the Republic of Iceland 6 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 Policy and Strategy The policy and strategy dimension of cybersecurity capacity for Iceland was gauged to range from start-up to established stages of maturity. The Republic of Iceland is at an established stage of maturity regarding the National Cybersecurity Strategy factor. Iceland has published the Icelandic National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2015-2026, approved by the Minister of the Interior in April 2015 together with a three year Plan of Action. The Ministry of the Interior (MoI) was divided into two new Ministries on 1 May 2017, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and the Ministry of Transport and Local Government (MoTLG). Since then MoTLG has been the designated coordinating body with a mandate to work towards the revision and the implementation of the National Cyber Security Strategy and the Action Plan and has started consulting across public and private sectors, and with civil society. The NCSS called for the appointment of a special Cyber Security Council (CSC) for government and public sector representatives and a Cyber Security Forum with representatives from private sectors in addition to the representatives in the CSC, in order to address collaboration on cybersecurity topics related to the implementation of the NCSS in Iceland. Iceland’s incident response capacity is at a formative to established stage of maturity. CERT- IS – Iceland’s national CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team) – has been established with specified roles and responsibilities with emphasis on the electronic communications market. In particular CERT-IS has the role of national point-of-contact, but does not at this time handle the Government CERT role. However, negotiations regarding this role are underway. CERT-IS has developed incident response processes, but these are and will not be publicly available. However, an incident response plan for Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) incidents has been published and distributed to members of the telecommunications sector. An overall central registry of national-level cybersecurity incidents is not yet operational. CERT-IS records incidents of all levels of severity that are reported to the group, but handling is prioritized by constituency, severity and impact. The registry of incidents is, however, not as of yet publicly accessible in any way. The National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police (NCIP) and CERT-IS aim to cooperate on creating a classification of national level incidents. The members of CERT-IS receive training in an ad-hoc manner. Moreover, CERT-IS collaborates with Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) through the Nordic National CERT Collaboration (NCC). A Nordic cybersecurity exercise took place in 2015 and assessed the quality of the incident response processes, procedures, interactions, and information-sharing mechanisms that exist under the NCC Agreement. Additionally, CERT-IS has good relations with the financial sector and aims to cooperate with a new collaborative forum, the Nordic Financial CERT. The protection of critical infrastructure (CI) considerations are at a formative stage of maturity. A list of general CI assets has been created. The National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police (NCIP) is responsible for identifying these assets. However, the CI asset audit list is not disseminated to relevant stakeholders. Currently there is informal and ad-hoc threat and vulnerability disclosure among CI owners as well as between CI and the government, but the scope of reporting requirements has not been specified. CI owners have some capacity 7 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 to detect, identify, respond to and recover from cyber threats, but such capabilities are uncoordinated and vary in quality. No official national risk assessment plan has been developed as yet. The Civil Protection Act2 is the official framework for all crisis situations, including cyber-incident or cyberattack. Simulations and training exercises have been conducted in order to better prepare for a cyber-crisis situation, however these exercises are not coordinated at the national level, with the active participation of all relevant stakeholders in all sectors. Iceland’s cyber defence considerations are at a start-up stage of maturity. Iceland’s Cyber defence is mainly being considered in terms of national cyber resilience and the country is prioritising the protection of national CI assets as a priority action of the NCSS. Beyond that it is also part of Iceland’s defence planning. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs is the central authority for defence and in charge of implementation of the Defence Act No 34/2008, due to the absence of a dedicated Ministry of Defence. In accordance with a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Interior - now Ministry of Justice, and due to the lack of a standing army, the Icelandic Coast Guard from July 2014 (ICG) is responsible for operational defence activities related to NATO including NATO Iceland Air Defence System, CRC, Host Nations Support and operation of the Keflavik Air Base. The Iceland Crisis Response Unit (ICRU) has been a separate entity within the MFA since 2001. Its main role is to contribute to multilateral organisations and to provide secondments of civilian experts to the field. Iceland has established contacts with the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (NATO CCDCOE) while material and resources prepared by the Centre, especially the Tallinn Manual, have already been utilised. In 2018, Norway will host NATO's high-visibility exercise Trident Juncture in which Iceland participates, as the defence of Iceland is an integral part of the exercise. In the event of a communications disruption, mechanisms are in place to maintain the operational functionality of the national emergency communications network. Current emergency response assets have been identified. Within both the public and the private sectors, TETRA Systems for Mission Critical Communications are deployed. Furthermore, fibre optic lines and nodes are shared with the public network. The finance sector also conducts crisis response simulations regularly and emergency drills are tested frequently. Culture and Society During consultations, the national capacity regarding cybersecurity culture and society ranges from formative to established stages. The government has recognised the need to prioritise cybersecurity across its institutions, and the risks and threats in cybersecurity have influenced the processes and structures across government institutions but in particular leading agencies. Leading firms within the private sector have begun to place priority on a cybersecurity mind-set by identifying high-risk practices. Among society-at-large, a growing 2 (in Icelandic) (English translation) 8 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 number of users feel it is a priority for them to employ good cybersecurity practices. However, cultural aspects and the general level of trust, which is ingrained in the Icelandic culture, has inhibited users from thinking about privacy online and considering protection of their information online as their own personal responsibility. Overall, the participating stakeholders accepted that most Internet users in Iceland trust in the security of the Internet, but this often approaches a “blind” trust that can place individuals and society at risk. However, strong trust has enabled the establishment of e-government services in Iceland. The Government continues to increase e-service provision and tax declarations are already being submitted electronically. In addition, e-commerce services are fully established by multiple stakeholders in a relatively secure environment. Users and stakeholders within the public and private sectors have general knowledge about how personal information is handled online but (proactive) cybersecurity practices are often not used, either due to perceived inconvenience, or to the way people weigh up the trade- offs in service and protection of their personal information. Act No. 77/2000 on Privacy as regards to the Processing of Personal Data has been in force since 2000 and implements the provisions of Directive 95/46/EC. On grounds of Art. 11 and 12 of the Data Protection Act the Icelandic Data Protection Authority (DPA) has set forth Rules No. 299/2001 on the Security of Personal Data. Iceland is also in the process of implementing the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In Iceland, the public and private sectors provide some channels for reporting child abuse online, but these channels are not coordinated and are used in an ad-hoc manner. A hotline through Barnaheill - Save the Children Iceland - focuses on child abuse. Also, the Icelandic Red Cross runs the 1717 Helpline. Any incident, also cyber-related, can be reported via the police emergency number 112, while incidents such as child abuse are also referred to Europol and Interpol. Participants noted that communication links have not been established between the police and the private sector and CERT-IS lacks the resources to take up this role. Moreover, there is ad-hoc media coverage of cybersecurity, with limited information provided and limited reporting on specific issues that individuals face online, such as cyber-bullying. Also, discussions on social media about cybersecurity are not prominent. Education, Training and Skills Observations made during the consultations show that cybersecurity education, training and skills capacity in Iceland ranges from a formative to an established stage of maturity. Awareness-raising programmes, courses, seminars and online resources are available for target demographics from public, private, academia, and civil society sources. However, no national programme for cybersecurity awareness-raising, led by a designated organisation is currently established. The National Cybersecurity Strategy recognises the enhancement of general awareness of cybersecurity issues and this is one of the measures towards the implementation of the nation’s Strategy. Executives are aware of general cybersecurity issues, but not necessarily aware of how these issues and threats might affect their particular organisation. Executives of some particular sectors, such as finance, telecommunications, Internet providers and cloud operators are aware of cybersecurity risks, and how their 9 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 organisation deals with cybersecurity issues, but not of the broader strategic implications for government and society. However, apart from those in the financial sector there are no mandatory training courses or programmes. In higher education, some courses exist in cybersecurity-related fields, such as information security, network security and cryptography, but cybersecurity-specific courses are not yet offered in Iceland. Some universities offer programmes in computer science and computer engineering at an undergraduate and postgraduate level with cybersecurity often being a module within these curricula. The CSC has now established an informal agreement with the Department of Information Security and Communication Technology at NTNU, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, which is one of the most advanced in the field of information security in the Nordic countries. A part of this plan is to develop closer ties with UoI and RU, e.g. concerning graduate and undergraduate courses and also concerning events that can help to stimulate interest in cybersecurity and provide interesting challenges for students. Research and development is an important consideration in education. The MoESC and the Ministry of Industries and Innovation (MoII) have the main responsibility for running the research and innovation scheme. However, it was not possible to identify whether specific programmes and research funds on cybersecurity or related fields are running currently. At the national level, the need for training professionals in cybersecurity in Iceland has been documented. ICT professional certification with some security modules or components is available. Review participants mentioned that currently the Estonian Technology Fund, a state-run public institution that invests into young and growth-oriented technology companies, is dedicated to the provision of online courses because overall there is not enough expertise among educators to provide training in cybersecurity. Executive training courses for CEOs or chief financial executives are offered on an ad-hoc basis, including topics such as good governance practices related to cybersecurity and risk management. Legal and regulatory frameworks The legal and regulatory frameworks in Iceland range between formative and established stages of maturity. Iceland has implemented provisions relevant to cybersecurity comprehensively in its ICT legislative and regulatory frameworks. The Regulatory Framework of the European Union – through the country’s EEA membership – applies in Iceland and has shaped many regulations and existing legislation to protect the rights of individuals and organisations in the digital environment. The Electronic Communications Act (ECA) No. 81/2003, the Act on the Post and Telecom Administration (APTA) No. 69/2003, and its Amendment No. 62/2012 stipulate certain provisions regarding cybersecurity and critical information infrastructure. Additionally, the Icelandic Media Law requires providers to ensure that the transmission of service via electronic communications networks is secure (Article 45). Act No. 30/2002 on Electronic Commerce and other Electronic Services stipulates the liability of ISPs and establishes a system of takedown notices in certain cases for IP addresses or other 10 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 online content that violates the law, in accordance with the Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament. Data protection legislation in Iceland has been implemented with the adoption of Act No. 77/2000 on the Protection of Privacy as regards the Processing of Personal Data (“Data Protection Act”) which implements Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. It includes general conditions for the collection of personal data and protection from misuse, and it promotes a practice of personal data processing in accordance with fundamental principles and rules regarding data protection and privacy. Icelandic law recognizes fundamental human rights on the Internet, including privacy online, freedom of speech, freedom of information, and freedom of assembly and association. The country has also ratified or acceded to several international agreements, such as the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of the Council of Europe, the Convention No. 108 for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data and those of the International Labour Organization and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Comprehensive legislation on the protection of children has been adopted and enforced according to Iceland’s Child Protection Act, No. 80/2002. Iceland has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and other relevant international conventions. Substantive cybercrime legal provisions are contained in the general criminal law. In 2007 the country ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, also known as the ‘Budapest Convention’, whose recommendations are consistently implemented into domestic law. The General Penal Code No. 19 contains substantive cybercrime legal provision since its amendment in 2014. The government is working towards the implementation of the NIS Directive and the GDPR in 2018, therefore it is expected that existing gaps in legal and regulatory frameworks will be fulfilled. Across the criminal justice system, capacities are at initial stages of development in Iceland. The police, headed by the National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police (NCIP), has only limited digital-forensics capacity and cases are investigated by the digital forensics unit of the Reykjavik Metropolitan Police. Two policemen in the Metropolitan Police are specifically assigned to investigate sexual violence against children on the internet. The country needs more skilled personnel as well as the procedural and technological resources to conduct investigations in a comprehensive way. Training for law-enforcement officers on cybercrime and digital evidence is ad-hoc or not specialised. Formal mechanisms of international cooperation have been established in order to prevent and combat cybercrime. Iceland has established agreements with Interpol and Europol as well as agreements with neighbouring countries on cross-border information sharing. Moreover, informal relationships between government and criminal justice as well as between ISPs and law enforcement exist with clear communication channels resulting in the regular exchange of information on cybercrime cases. Some specialised cybercrime 11 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 prosecutors have the capacity to build cases on electronic evidence, but this capacity is limited as training is largely ad-hoc, not institutionalised and informal. According to participants, Iceland has fully acknowledged the need for formal and informal cooperation and has established mechanisms for international cooperation in order to prevent and combat cybercrime by facilitating its detection, investigation, and prosecution through established communication channels. The country cooperates with Interpol and Europol and other nations (e.g. Norway and the US) regarding cross-border information sharing and has signed Mutual Legal Assistance agreements which are successfully applied. Standards, Organisations and Technologies Iceland’s capacity in cybersecurity standards, organisations and technologies was identified as ranging from start-up to established stages. The government and the private sector have adopted ICT security, procurement and software development standards and good practices, such as ISO. However, compliance to these standards is not mandatory. Iceland achieves leading scores in technological readiness and Internet access and broadband penetration is one of the highest internationally. Internet is used for e-commerce transactions. However, authentication processes are often weak, e.g. many websites only require simple authentication. There are legal requirements for operational security in articles 11-13 of the Data Protection Act and Rules No 299/2001; however, in a very broad sense. According to participants, telecommunication companies and other CNI have their own internal standards. Software quality is a matter of concern. Priority is mostly given to the quality and performance of software. Additionally, monitoring and quality assessment is conducted in an ad-hoc manner only in few private institutions, so there is no evidence of the extent of software quality deficiencies. All sectors in Iceland deploy up-to-date technical security controls, including patching and backups, but to very different levels. Companies have internal policies for updates and automated software updates are becoming more common. Cryptographic controls deployed meet international standards and guidelines exist for each sector accordingly. Although some state-of-the-art tools, such as SSL or TLS, are deployed routinely by web service providers to secure all communications between servers and web browsers, and EU legislation relating to data protection and e-signatures has been implemented (Directive 1999/93/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 1999 on a Community framework for electronic signatures) - or is being implemented respectively (GDPR) - participants pointed out a lack of understanding amongst the general public about the deployment of such controls. The implementation of the GDPR could provide more general understanding to the general public. The domestic market in Iceland is small and only provides some specialised cybersecurity products, which are not demand-driven. Most organisations rely on products from international companies. Local suppliers of software and services such as penetration testing and auditing do consider cybersecurity. Cyber-insurance is offered by a domestic insurer who 12 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 resells international products, but uptake is limited as the terms are often not suitable for local companies. No vulnerability-disclosure framework is in place. Stakeholders mainly share technical details of vulnerabilities informally with other stakeholders, who can distribute the information more broadly; but this is not common. Currently, organisations have established their own processes and mechanisms to receive, disseminate and share information on vulnerabilities, and only some organisations are obliged to report to CERT-IS. Additional Reflections This was the 18th country review supported directly by the Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre at Oxford. It was intended to assist the Government of the Republic of Iceland to gain insights into the breadth and depth of the country’s cybersecurity capacity. Iceland has commenced the process of developing different aspects of cybersecurity capacity across all dimensions, including through revising the National Cybersecurity Strategy and revisiting legal frameworks and regulation. The review suggests a number of specific steps by which Iceland’s cybersecurity capacity might achieve greater levels of maturity. 13 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 INTRODUCTION The Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre (GCSCC, or ‘the Capacity Centre’) has undertaken a review of the maturity of the cybersecurity capacity of the Republic of Iceland, hosted by the Ministry of Transport and Local Government. The objective of this review is to enable the government of Iceland to reassess its cybersecurity capacity in order to prioritise strategic investment in national cybersecurity. Over the period 21–23 June 2017, stakeholders from the following departments of government, organisations and functional sectors participated in a three-day consultation with GCSCC staff to review Iceland’s cybersecurity capacity: • Public Sector Entities: - Ministry of Transport and Local Government - National Cybersecurity and Telecommunications Service under the Ministry of Transport and Local Government - Ministry of Agriculture - Ministry of Communications - Ministry of Education, Science and Culture - Ministry of Energy - Ministry of Environment / National Weather Service - Ministry of Finance - Ministry of Health - Ministry of Justice - Ministry for Foreign Affairs - Ministry of Industries and Innovation - Data Protection Authority • Directorate of Health, Post and Telecommunications Administration • Landspítali - National Hospital of Iceland • Legislators/Policy owners/Public Prosecution • CERT-IS • Icelandic Coast Guard • Finance sector • Academia • Private sector • Internet registries 14 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 DIMENSIONS OF CYBERSECURITY CAPACITY Consultations were premised on the GCSCC Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model3 for Nations (CMM) which is composed of five distinct dimensions of cybersecurity capacity. Each dimension consists of a set of factors, which describe and define what it means to possess cybersecurity capacity therein. Table I below shows the five dimensions with their comprising factors: 3 See Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM), Revised Edition, available at DIMENSIONS FACTORS Dimension 1: Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy D1.1 National Cybersecurity Strategy D1.2 Incident Response D1.3 Critical Infrastructure (CI) Protection D1.4 Crisis Management D1.5 Cyber Defence Consideration D1.6 Communications Redundancy Dimension 2: Cyber Culture and Society D2.1 Cybersecurity Mind-set D2.2 Trust and Confidence on the Internet D2.3 User Understanding of Personal Information Protection Online D2.4 Reporting Mechanisms D2.5 Media and Social Media Dimension 3: Cybersecurity Education, Training and Skills D3.1 Awareness-raising D3.2 Framework for Education D3.3 Framework for Professional Training Dimension 4: Legal and Regulatory Frameworks D4.1 Legal Frameworks D4.2 Criminal Justice System D4.3 Formal and Informal Cooperation Frameworks to Combat Cybercrime Dimension 5: Standards, Organisations and Technologies D5.1 Adherence to Standards D5.2 Internet Infrastructure Resilience D5.3 Software Quality Protection D5.4 Technical Security Controls D5.5 Cryptographic Controls D5.6 Cybersecurity Marketplace D5.7 Responsible Disclosure 15 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 STAGES OF CYBERSECURITY CAPACITY MATURITY Factors are further subdivided into aspects and for each aspect there are indicators, setting out those conditions that define the level of maturity achieved in any given aspect. There are five stages of maturity, discussed below. The maturity scale ranges from the start-up stage, implying an elementary and ad-hoc approach to capacity, to the dynamic stage where a strategic approach has been articulated and where the relevant agencies and organisations have developed the ability to respond and adapt as environmental considerations demand. The five stages are as follows: • Start-up: At this stage either no cybersecurity maturity exists, or it is very embryonic in nature. There might be initial discussions about cybersecurity capacity building, but no concrete actions have been taken. There is an absence of observable evidence of cybersecurity capacity at this stage. • Formative: Some aspects have begun to grow and be formulated, but may be ad-hoc, disorganized, poorly defined – or simply new. However, evidence of this aspect can be clearly demonstrated. • Established: The indicators of the aspect are in place, and functioning. However, there is not well thought-out consideration of the relative allocation of resources. Little trade-off decision-making has been made concerning the relative investment in this aspect. But the aspect is functional and defined. • Strategic: At this stage choices have been made about which indicators of this aspect are important, and which are less important for the particular organisation or state. The strategic stage reflects the fact that these choices have been made, conditional upon the state’s or organisation's particular circumstances. • Dynamic: At this stage, there are clear mechanisms in place to alter strategy depending on the prevailing circumstances such as the technological sophistication of the threat environment, global conflict or a significant change in one area of concern (e.g. cybercrime or privacy). Dynamic organisations have developed methods for changing strategies in stride. Rapid decision-making, reallocation of resources, and constant attention to the changing environment are features of this stage. 16 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 CYBERSECURITY CONTEXT IN ICELAND Iceland has one of the highest take-ups of internet access in the world, with an Internet penetration rate of 98 percent in 20154. This is the highest proportion of Internet users of all European countries; the average household internet penetration rate within the European Union was 81 percent in 20145. With near ubiquitous access, Icelanders are frequent Internet users, with 95 percent of users connecting to the internet daily or almost daily, and 99 percent of users connecting every week in 20146. Iceland also has one of the highest index rates of internet and social media usage (6.8) in the world, according to the World Economic Forum7. Specifically, 84 percent of the population use social networks, 95 percent read news online, 95 percent send or receive emails, 36 percent store electronic content online, and 66 percent use internet commerce8. Iceland is promoting free speech, while Internet and digital media play a vital role in Icelandic society. In 2010, the Icelandic parliament adopted a resolution Nr. 23/138 suggesting that Iceland should take a lead in protection of free speech and freedom of expression9, but it has had limited follow-up. There was no change in the Internet freedom environment in 2016. The annual statistics database on telecommunication use in the Nordic and Baltic countries (2016)10 show that Iceland is the only country where most of the fixed broadband connections are still via DSL technology. Something that will change until 2020 with the closing down of the PSTN network. During the GCSCC review, participants often referred to regulations, laws, activities, processes etc. which are either mandatory or recommended as a consequence of Iceland’s membership of the European Economic Area (EEA), NATO and other organisations such as Interpol. As an EEA member state, Iceland is also part of the Digital Single Market strategy, the goal of which is both to develop the European Data Economy and to promote online platforms, protecting Europe's assets by tackling cybersecurity challenges11. This initiative includes the planned review of the EU Cybersecurity Strategy in September 2017 as well as additional measures addressing cybersecurity standards, certification and labelling to make connected users more cyber secure. These developments may have an impact on the action plan for the Icelandic National Cybersecurity Strategy. 4 Freedom House: Freedom on the Net 2016. 5 International Telecommunication Union, “Percentage of individuals using the internet,” 2015, 2013 & 2008, 6 Statistics Iceland, “Statistical Yearbook of Iceland 2015,” 7 World Economic Forum, The Global Information Technology Report 2015, bit.ly/1yutYRc 8 Statistics Iceland, “Statistical Yearbook of Iceland 2015,” 9 Þingsályktun um að Ísland skapi sér afgerandi lagalega sérstöðu varðandi vernd tjáningar og upplýsingafrelsis. 10 telecommunication-use-in-2016-Fast-increase-in-data-use-over-mobile/ 11 17 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 REVIEW REPORT OVERVIEW This section provides an overall representation of cybersecurity capacity in Iceland. The graphic (Figure 1) shows the maturity estimates made in each dimension. The concentric gridlines radiating from the centre of the graphic correspond to the five-stage maturity scale, with ‘start-up’ the closest to the centre and ‘dynamic’ the furthest. The stages of maturity for each factor extend out from the middle as an individual bar, and each colour-coded dimension covers one fifth of the graphic. Figure 1: Overall representation of the cybersecurity capacity in the Republic of Iceland 18 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 DIMENSION 1 CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY AND POLICY Dimension 1 gauges the Icelandic capacity to develop and deliver cybersecurity policy and strategy and to enhance cybersecurity resilience through improvements in incident response, crisis management, redundancy, and critical infrastructure protection capacity. The Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy dimension also includes consideration of early warning, deterrence, defence and recovery. This dimension assesses the effectiveness of policy in advancing national cyber defence and resilience capacity, while facilitating the access to cyberspace increasingly vital for government, international business and society in general. D1.1 NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY Maturity Stage: Established With the approval of the Ministry of the Interior (MoI), the Republic of Iceland’s National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCSS) 2015-2026 was published in April 201512 together with a three year Plan of Action. A task force on cyber security had been set up in 2013 to provide recommendations and formulate the Strategy. Strategies of other Nordic and European countries were also examined alongside discussions with overseas peers. The task force also discussed the threats and opportunities that have been identified and the experience gained from the plans of action already been put into practice in other Nordic and European countries. 12 2015/Icelandic_National_Cyber_Security_Summary_loka.pdf Cybersecurity strategy is essential to the coordination and direction of the government’s cybersecurity agenda. A cybersecurity strategy makes it possible to prioritise cybersecurity as a critically important policy area, determines responsibilities and mandates of key cybersecurity government and non-governmental actors, and directs necessary and appropriate allocation of resources to emerging and existing cybersecurity issues and priorities. 19 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 Multi-stakeholder consultation processes have been followed and observations fed back to the identified strategy owners. A well-attended consultative meeting with stakeholders was held in 2014 including about representatives of some 60 institutions and enterprises. The NCSS called for the appointment of a special Cyber Security Council (CSC) for government and public sector representatives and a Cyber Security Forum with representatives from private sectors in addition to the representatives in the CSC. The CSC takes responsibility for implementing the strategy while the Cyber Security Forum is charged with coordinating projects involving public and private stakeholders and creating the basis for collaboration on cybersecurity topics. The CSC will coordinate measures, particularly those involving government bodies. It will review the action plan at least once a year and make proposals on the prioritisation and funding of measures taken. The CSC is according to the NCSS to submit a report to the MoI every year on the implementation of the strategy. The MoI was divided into two new ministries on 1 May 2017, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Transport and Local Government (MoTLG)13. Since then the Ministry of Transport and Local Government (MoTLG) has been the designated coordinating body with a mandate to work towards the revision and the implementation of the National Cyber Security Strategy and the Action Plan and has started to consult across public and private sectors, and with civil society. The scope of responsibility of the MoTLG is as follows: air, land, and sea transport; electronic communications; information society issues; local government issues; regional development issues; and matters relating to Registers Iceland. A review process (every 3-4 years) is implemented under the auspices of the Action Plan 2015- 2018 to allow for new or revised measures, including for short periods of time. The content of the NCSS is linked explicitly and directly to national assessments of risks, priorities and objectives, as well as business development. Direct and indirect links exist to many other official strategies and resolutions, e.g. the national strategy on civil protection public security, law enforcement and telecommunications; the strategy on national security; and the Icelandic State and Municipal Policy on the Information Society 2013-2016: “e-Power Expansion: - create, connect, participate“. The NCSS addresses the need to protect critical infrastructure as well as respond to growing cybersecurity threats. It outlines Iceland’s cybersecurity vision out to 2026 and stipulates four main objectives: 1) increased capacity to prevent and respond to cybersecurity threats; 2) increased resilience; 3) improved legislation in line with international commitments; and 4) reliable law enforcement as regards cybersecurity. The strategy covers all use of the Internet and Information Technology. The aims of the strategy are as follows: a) to enhance the security of individuals and groups in society by increasing cyber security; b) to promote the integrated functioning of important elements of the infrastructure of society by increasing the resilience of information systems to cope with hazards; and c) to establish closer collaboration and coordination on cybersecurity between Icelandic and international authorities. 13 20 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 As mentioned above, the strategy is intended to form the basis of collaboration and development in cybersecurity. The strategy itself will not amend the responsibilities and duties of those involved in cybersecurity even though proposals may be made for measures that may involve changes in these areas. D1.2 INCIDENT RESPONSE Maturity Stage: Formative to Established A National CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team), CERT-IS14 has been established with specified roles and responsibilities. CERT-IS has, according to law, the telecommunication sector as its primary constituency which includes certain critical information infrastructure (CII) entities. Other CII entities may sign contracts with CERT-IS. Other entities, outside the primary constituency, are served on best-effort terms. The role of CERT-IS is to analyse cybersecurity threats and to give assistance to its primary constituency members using both proactive and reactive measures to prevent cybersecurity incidents and to minimize their impact. CERT-IS gives advice regarding threats and responses to its primary constituency members and publishes public warnings when needed. According to the participants, each sector is responsible for handling conventional emergencies and preparing accordingly. The approach taken for cybersecurity is similar and an agreement with the national CERT-IS15 has been made that cyber emergencies with national significance will be prioritised. In the event of a cyber crisis the role of CERT-IS is to coordinate responses. As a National CSIRT, CERT-IS is the national point of contact in Iceland. The legal provisions for CERT-IS are stated in the Telecommunication Act no. 81/200316, art. 47a and regulation no. 475/201317 (see also D4.1). No Government CERT exists yet. CERT-IS acts as a national CERT and in particular has the role of national point-of-contact, but does not at this time handle the Government CERT role. However, negotiations regarding this role are underway. 14 15 16 17 This factor addresses the capacity of the government to identify and determine characteristics of national level incidents in a systematic way. It also reviews the government’s capacity to organise, coordinate, and operationalize incident response. 21 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 CERT-IS has developed incident response processes, but these are and will not be publicly available. However, an incident response plan for CI incident has been published and distributed to members of the telecommunications sector. Moreover, some participants referred to the lack of a catalogue of services provided by CERT-IS, but the position of CERT- IS as national CERT is that it should not provide a catalogue of services but a role defined by law. Defining the role of CERT-IS more precisely was a key element in ongoing service contract negotiations during the summer of 2017. Leads for incident response have been designated at the operational level, but national-level coordination has not yet been established. Distinct and formal security roles and responsibilities are not yet allocated across government, critical infrastructure, enterprise, and individual systems. An overall central registry of national-level cybersecurity incidents is not yet operational. CERT-IS records incidents of all levels of severity that are reported to the group, but handling is prioritized by constituency, severity and impact. The registry of incidents is, however, not as of yet publicly accessible in any way. The National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police (NCIP) and CERT-IS are currently discussing an official classification scheme for CI incidents. Participants informed us that through the implementation of the EU NIS Directive, official classification will take place of national level incidents which expose vulnerabilities of national critical assets. The NCIP and CERT-IS aim to cooperate on creating a classification of national level incidents. CERT-IS employees that work on incident handling and analysis receive mostly training in an ad-hoc manner, but baseline training requirements have been established. Budget restraints do limit the availability of training, but CERT-IS does take advantage of lower cost training opportunities that present themselves, for instance trough the Nordic National CERT Collaboration (NCC)18. Review participants indicated that human and financial resources allocated to incident response are not adequate to the cybersecurity threat environment and that incident response is still more reactive than anticipatory. CERT-IS is not a member of FIRST yet, but preparation for FIRST and Trusted Introducer memberships is on the roadmap for 2018. Currently the service of CERT-IS is limited to the telecommunications sector but service contracts are being negotiated with the energy sector and planned with other sectors. In particular, CERT-IS has good relations with the financial sector and aims to cooperate with the planned Nordic Financial CERT. Representatives from the finance sector indicated that an information-sharing platform (currently functioning by email) already exists for incidents-events experienced by banks. There was general agreement among different sector participants that the involvement of CERT-IS in this process would advance its capacity. CERT-IS notes that all opportunities for cooperation and information sharing are welcomed and one project in cooperation with a financial institution is currently under way. Moreover, CERT-IS collaborates with the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) through the NCC cooperation. This includes technical cooperation and cybersecurity exercises to assess and strengthen cyber preparedness, examine incident response processes and enhance information sharing in the region. A Nordic cybersecurity 18 22 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 exercise took place in 2015 and assessed the quality of the incident response processes, procedures, interactions, and information-sharing mechanisms that exist under the NCC Agreement. The Data Protection Act as it is today does not require reporting of security breaches but the DPA still receives a few informal reports every year. Most knowledge of incidents concerning personal data is gathered through the media and individuals that are affected by such incidents. Under the NCSS, the reporting of cybersecurity incidents is to be made obligatory as it is considered to be crucial for organisations that suffer a cyberattack. Review participants stated that the EU NIS Directive and the GDPR implementation will lead to the formalisation of a mechanism for incident reporting. D1.3 CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE (CI) PROTECTION Maturity Stage: Formative The protection of critical infrastructure from cyber-threats is a priority for the Icelandic authorities. The National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCSS) aims to promote the integrated functioning of important elements of the infrastructure of society by increasing the resilience of cyber systems to cope with hazards. The Parliamentary Resolution on a National Security Policy for Iceland (no. 26/145)19 speaks to Iceland’s independence and sovereignty, territorial integrity, the safety of its citizens, and the protection of its governmental system and social infrastructure. A list of general critical infrastructure (CI) assets has been created20. The National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police (NCIP) is responsible for identifying these assets. In the course of the CMM review it was mentioned that NCIP is currently in the process of developing a list of Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) assets as part of preparing the NIS Directive implementation. 19 ENS.pdf 20 This has e.g. been published in the National Civil Protection Strategy (in Icelandic): oryggismalum2015-2017.pdf This factor studies the government’s capacity to identify Critical Infrastructure (CI) and Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) assets and the risks associated with them, to engage in response planning and critical assets protection, to facilitate quality interaction with CI asset owners, and to enable comprehensive general risk management practice including response planning. 23 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 However, the CI asset audit lists is not disseminated to relevant stakeholders. Consequently, participants observed that formal internal and external CI communication strategies should be defined across sectors, with clear points of contact. The scope of services by CERT-IS has been limited to the telecommunications sector, but it is currently being expanded to include other CI sectors as well. Currently, there is informal and ad hoc threat and vulnerability disclosure among CI owners as well as between CI and the government, but the scope of reporting requirements has not been specified. CERT-IS has not yet had the opportunity to coordinate information sharing between CI owners due to the lack of service contracts that limit the size and scope of its constituency. However, within the finance sector a specific timeframe for disclosure of incidents has been defined (as soon as possible but no later than 24h) (see D5.7). Participants mentioned the Global Influenza Preparedness Plan21 as an example of how the country could prepare for the organisation and coordination of responses to cyber incidents. CI owners have the capacity to detect, identify, respond to and recover from cyber threats, but such capabilities are uncoordinated and vary in quality. Protection of CI assets includes basic level cybersecurity awareness and data security policies, but no protection processes have been agreed. Representatives from the finance sector mentioned that they have their own plans in the case of national level crisis. In addition, the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA)22 aims to safeguard the integrity and sound operation of the financial market and conducts periodic examinations of the operation of the stock exchanges23. The NCIP has developed a general response plan for responding to emergencies and it also has provisions for reacting to cyber-induced national level emergencies. CERT-IS has also developed an emergency plan for the telecommunication sector, which scope is at the present time mostly limited to defining the channels of communications and management process during a cyber crisis. 21 _March.06_.pdf 22 23 24 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 D1.4 CRISIS MANAGEMENT Maturity Stage: Formative A preliminary cybersecurity needs assessment of measures and techniques that require testing has been undertaken. CERT-IS has conducted limited scope exercises for the telecommunications sector and such exercises are planned every other year. Key stakeholders and other subject matter experts, such as think tanks, academics, civil leaders and consultants are included in the planning process. No official national risk assessment plan has been developed as yet. The Civil Protection Act24 is the official framework for all crisis situations, including cyber-incidents and cyberattacks. Simulations and training exercises have been conducted in order to better prepare for a cyber-crisis situation, however these are not nationally coordinated exercises involving relevant stakeholders in all sectors. CERT-IS plans to conduct exercises for each constituency sector every two years and exercises have already been conducted with the telecommunications sector. CERT-IS participates along with the constituency sectors in larger international exercises, such as the ones held by ENISA, and the Norwegian ‘BlackScreen’ exercise with the energy sector. Moreover, telecommunications companies participate in risk assessment exercises conducted by ENISA25. The finance sector also conducts exercises and crisis simulations. However, one of the sectors that is not participating in such simulations and cyber training activities is the health sector. This is expected to change since the Directorate of Health is now a member of the Cyber Security Council and will participate is future exercises. 24 (in Icelandic) (English translation) 25 This factor addresses crisis management planning, the conduct of specialised needs assessments, training exercises, and simulations that produce scalable results for policy development and strategic decision-making. Through qualitative and quantitative techniques, cybersecurity evaluation processes aim to produce structured and measurable results that would solicit recommendations for policymakers and other stakeholders and inform national strategy implementation as well as inform budgetary allocations 25 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 D1.5 CYBER DEFENCE CONSIDERATION Maturity Stage: Start-up Iceland’s Cyber defence is mainly being considered in terms of national cyber resilience (see D1.3) and the country is prioritising the protection of national CI assets as a priority action of the NCSS. Beyond that it is also part of Iceland’s defence planning. Following, we present the country’s structure on defence related issues. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs is the central authority for defence and in charge of implementation of the Defence Act No 34/200826, due to the absence of a dedicated Ministry of Defence. The Minister for Foreign Affairs formulates the defence policy within the framework of this Act and is responsible for the performance of a threat assessment regarding defence. The Minister is also responsible for the formulation and implementation of Iceland's Security and Defence Policy on the international arena and for representing the Government of Iceland in relations and cooperation with foreign states, military authorities and international security and defence organisations, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. The Act does not apply to governmental matters that are civil in nature, such as policing and civil defence. Review participants noted that cybersecurity and defence is already being incorporated in national defence planning. This is now part of the formal agenda of national defence. In accordance with a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Interior, now Ministry of Justice, and due to the lack of a standing army the Icelandic Coast Guard from July 2014 (ICG) is responsible for operational defence activities related to NATO, including NATO Iceland Air Defence System, CRC, Host Nations Support and operation of the Keflavik Air Base. The Iceland Crisis Response Unit (ICRU)27 has been a separate entity within the MFA since 2001. Its main role is to contribute to multilateral organisations and to provide secondments of civilian experts to the field. The Iceland Defence Force (IDF) was a military command of the United States Armed Forces from 1951 to 2006. The IDF, created at the request of NATO, came into existence when the United States signed an agreement to provide for the defence of Iceland. The IDF also included civilian Icelanders and military members of other NATO nations. 26 27 This factor reviews the government’s capacity to design a cyber defence strategy and lead its implementation, including through a designated cyber defence organisation. It also reviews the level of coordination between various public and private sector actors in response to malicious attacks on strategic information systems and critical national infrastructure. 26 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 Iceland has established contacts with the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (NATO CCDCOE)28 while material and resources prepared by the Centre, especially the Tallinn Manual29, have already been utilised. In 2018, Norway will host NATO's high- visibility exercise Trident Juncture30 in which Iceland participates, as the defence of Iceland is an integral part of the exercise. Iceland has excellent HAZMAT response to industrial accidents and has established a well- respected search and rescue (SAR) system, staffed by volunteers nationwide. In October 2016 the Government of Iceland signed the new MoU on cyber defence cooperation with NATO31. D1.6 COMMUNICATIONS REDUNDANCY Maturity Stage: Formative In the event of a communications disruption, mechanisms are in place to maintain the operational functionality of the national emergency communications network. Current emergency response assets have also been identified. Stakeholders convene to identify gaps and overlaps in emergency response asset communications and authority links. Emergency response assets, priorities and standard operating procedures are mapped and identified in the event of a communications disruption at any node in the emergency response network. Within both the public and the private sectors, TETRA Systems for Mission Critical Communications are deployed. In addition, fibre-optic nodes and cables are shared with the public network. An incident occurred involving the TETRA system in the past, which led to hardening the security of the system. The finance sector also conducts crisis response simulations regularly and emergency drills are tested frequently. 28 29 30 31 This factor reviews a government’s capacity to identify redundancy within digital and non- digital data management and communications systems. Digital redundancy implies a cybersecurity framework in which duplication and failure of any component is safeguarded by frequent and effective backup. Most of these backups will use digital networks that are readily available but are also isolated from mainline systems. Redundancy in communications systems can be achieved by supporting a digital communications network with a radio communications network. 27 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 RECOMMENDATIONS The Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre offers the following recommendations for consideration by the Government of the Republic of Iceland. These recommendations provide advice and steps aimed to increase existing cybersecurity capacity as per the considerations of the GCSCC Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model. Recommendations (R1.1 etc.) are grouped according to the respective factor. NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY R1.1 Ensure that the National Cybersecurity Strategy content includes, at a minimum: explicit links to national risks, priorities, objectives, and business development, raising public awareness, mitigating cybercrime, and protecting critical infrastructure from external and internal threats. R1.2 Encourage the promotion and implementation of the National Cybersecurity Strategy by multiple stakeholders across government and other sectors. R1.3 Administer a discrete cybersecurity budget line in order to allocate and manage resources. R1.4 Conduct regular scenario and real-time cyber exercises that provide a concurrent picture of national cyber resilience. R1.5 Collect and evaluate relevant metrics, monitoring processes and data in order to inform decision-making. R1.6 Include in the NCSS provision for the protection of critical infrastructure from insider threats. INCIDENT RESPONSE RR1.7 Develop an operational central registry of national level cybersecurity incidents and implement guidelines of the GDPR and the NIS. 28 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 RR1.8 Improve incident identification and analysis in response and conduct regular, systematic updates to the national level incident registry. R1.9 Ensure that the human and financial resources allocated to incident response are adequate to the cybersecurity threat environment by conducting regular scenario exercises designed to test human, organisational and financial capacities. R1.10 Promote coordinated national incident response between public and private sectors, with lines of communication prepared for times of crisis. R1.11 Develop a culture of risk assessment and management predictive methods to assess risk, its propagation and its aggregation for the national and CI domains. R1.12 Establish mechanisms for regional and international cooperation for incident response between organisations to resolve incidents as they occur. R1.13 Promote a platform for the reporting and sharing of incidents across sectors. CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE (CI) PROTECTION R1.14 Perform detailed audits of CI assets as it relates to cybersecurity on a regular basis and disseminate CI asset audit lists to relevant stakeholders. R1.15 Implement regular audit practices to assess network and system dependencies to inform continuous reassessment of risk portfolio. Identify and establish specific auditing processes. R1.16 Develop a strategy for strengthening formal coordination regarding Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) and information sharing between public and private sector. 29 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 R1.17 Establish a mechanism for regular vulnerability disclosure with defined scope for reporting incidents between CI asset owners and the government. R1.18 Promote strategic engagement between government and CI. R1.19 Define formal internal and external CI communication strategies across sectors, with clear points of contact. R1.20 Optimize the legal framework concerning CNI by amending existing legislation or enacting new regulations as needed to encompass incident prevention, detection and response. R1.21 Continue to invest in capability of Board Members and Senior Leaders of CI organisations to understand cyber-risk intelligence, in both private and public sectors, so that relevant individuals can lead in the face of crisis and take their part in risk management more generally. R1.22 Use CI risk management procedures to create a national response plan including the participation of all vital entities. CRISIS MANAGEMENT R1.23 Prioritise crisis management exercises, especially at a local level, and communicate the value of these exercises to all sectors. R1.24 Conduct compromised communications scenarios and exercises to test emergency response asset interoperability and effective functionality and incorporate the results of the exercises to inform strategic investment in future emergency response assets. R1.25 Plan the exercises by engaging relevant participants, outlining their role in the exercise, and articulating the benefits and incentives for participation. 30 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 CYBER DEFENCE CONSIDERATION R1.26 Review compliance of the National Security Strategy with international law and its consistency with national and international rules of engagement in cyberspace. R1.27 Form a formal Research Cluster comprised by stakeholders from Government, Academia and Intelligence working on national cyber resilience. This Cluster will be working towards resilience on national CI (see D1.3). R1.28 Initiate discussions regarding the membership to NATO CCDCOE and participation to exercises. COMMUNICATIONS REDUNDANCY R1.29 Undertake outreach to, and education of key stakeholders in the need for digital and communications redundancy. R1.30 Test the interoperability and function of emergency response assets under compromised communications scenarios to inform strategic investment in future emergency response assets based on the results of these scenario exercises. R1.31 Allocate resources to hardware integration, technology stress testing, personnel training and crisis simulations drills. 31 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 DIMENSION 2 CYBERSECURITY CULTURE AND SOCIETY Forward-thinking cybersecurity strategies and policies entail a wide array of actors, including Internet users. All actors and Internet users need to understand the role they can play in safeguarding sensitive and personal data as they use digital media and resources. This dimension underscores the centrality of all users in achieving cybersecurity, but seeks to avoid conventional tendencies to blame users for the challenge of cybersecurity. Instead, cybersecurity experts need to build user-friendly operating systems and programs that can be incorporated in everyday practices online. This dimension reviews elements of a responsible cybersecurity culture and society such as the understanding of cyber-related risks by all actors, developing a learned level of trust in Internet services, e-government and e-commerce services, and users’ understanding of how to protect personal information online. This factor also entails the existence of mechanisms for accountability, such as channels for users to report threats to cybersecurity. In addition, this factor reviews the role of mass media and social media in helping to shape cybersecurity values, attitudes and behaviour. D2.1 CYBERSECURITY MIND-SET Maturity Stage: Formative The government has recognised the need to prioritise cybersecurity across its institutions, and the risks and threats have influenced the processes and structures across government institutions but in particular leading agencies. This factor evaluates the degree to which cybersecurity is prioritised and embedded in the values, attitudes, and practices of government, the private sector, and users across society- at-large. A cybersecurity mind-set consists of values, attitudes and practices, including habits, of individual users, experts, and other actors in the cybersecurity ecosystem that increase the resilience of users to threats to their security online. 32 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 According to review participants, increasing awareness-raising efforts concerning risks and threats exist, but there is a general lack of knowledge on the specific actions necessary. Training and education for public services on IT and cybersecurity is available, e.g. through the Information Society Project (see 3.3). However, this training programme is not mandatory for all employees. Another concern noted by participants is the fact that such programmes are neither coordinated nor long term, and therefore it is difficult for employees to retain the knowledge received. Another general concern expressed in interviews was that employees within the public sector do not always follow specific online safety measures such as locking their computer, updating passwords, and not sharing passwords. For example, participants noted that mandatory password update was introduced last year within ministries, and that this has enhanced the understanding and cybersecurity awareness of employees. Moreover, physical penetration testing is now being introduced within some government institutions. Leading firms within the private sector have begun to place priority on a cybersecurity mind- set by identifying high-risk practices. Programmes and materials have been made available to train and improve cybersecurity practices. For example, the finance sector is organising trainings for its employees. Also, the energy sector is participating in exercises with Norway in order to promote the understanding of risks to employees. However, participants noted that the private sector needs to ensure trust in their services by their customers, but that this is difficult when many Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) do not have sufficient resources to allocate more to cybersecurity. Individuals across society-at-large inconsistently adopt a cybersecurity mind-set, but according to stakeholders, there is a shift towards a more proactive approach to cybersecurity. There was a general sense that a growing number of users feel it is a priority for them to employ good cybersecurity practices. However, cultural aspects and a generally high level of trust, which is ingrained in the Icelandic culture, can inhibit users from thinking about protecting their privacy online and making protection of their personal information online their own responsibility. Phishing attacks were an example used to better express this problem. Participants noted that phishing click rates are very high when the attacks are written in Icelandic, due to the fact that users trust these more than a phishing email in English. Users are not aware that they are part of a security chain and they need to share not only the benefits of the Internet but also responsibilities for a safe Internet. 33 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 D2.2 TRUST AND CONFIDENCE ON THE INTERNET Maturity Stage: Formative to Established Overall, the participating stakeholders accepted that a limited proportion of Internet users critically assess what they see or receive online or consider that they have the ability to use the Internet and protect themselves online. Moreover, a limited proportion of users trust in the secure use of the Internet based on indicators of website legitimacy. Operators of Internet infrastructure are developing measures to promote trust in online services but have yet to implement them. As mentioned above Internet users in Iceland trust in the security of the Internet without basing that trust on website legitimacy. Their trust is too often an overly confident “blind” trust. People like the convenience of online services and either do not understand what secure browsing is, for instance, or they do not fully understand the risks that are associated with insecure Internet provision. Users do not necessarily lock their PCs and usually behave online much like they act in their everyday life, which is shaped by a general sense of trust that is characteristic of the Icelandic culture. Participants noted that identity theft is not considered a problem for the majority of users. According to the General Penal Code No. 19/1940 (see D4.1) identify theft is not criminalised unless it is used for unlawful purpose and practises. E-government services have been firmly established in Iceland. The Government continues to increase e-service provision and tax declarations are already being submitted electronically. The government, along with other stakeholders and users, recognise the need for the application of security measures to establish trust in these services. However, participants noted that users trust in e-government services ‘’by default’’ as they do in other government services. The implementation of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the NIS Directive will ensure security and data protection provisions for e-governance services. Thus, user trust in e-services is also expected to be strengthened among users. Electronic certificates for authentication and two-factor authentication for document signing are being promoted and utilized broadly within the public sector. E-commerce services are fully established by multiple stakeholders. Security solutions are updated and reliable payment systems have been made available. A growing proportion of users trust in the secure use of e-commerce services and the private sector promotes use of e-commerce services and trust in these services. Participants claimed that, generally, online- banking and other commercial services from local suppliers are being used; but that foreign services, such as Amazon, are used and trusted more. This factor reviews the level of user trust and confidence in the use of online services in general, and e-government and e-commerce services in particular. 34 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 D2.3 USER UNDERSTANDING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION ONLINE Maturity Stage: Formative Iceland has adopted and enforced data protection legislation such as the Data Protection Act, No. 77/2000 which lays out general conditions for the collection of personal data and protection from misuse, and which promotes a practice of personal data processing in accordance with fundamental principles and rules regarding data protection and privacy. Based on the Act, the DPA has published rules No. 299/2001 on the Security of Personal Data. The rules explicitly ask for measures regarding higher risks to personal data when they are processed on the Internet (Article 4) as well as requiring all controllers to implement security measures in accordance with the risk involved in the processing of personal data along with measures to mitigate the risk. Iceland is also in the process of implementing the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Moreover, the Regulation in the Protection of Information in the Public Communications Networks No 1221/2007 aims “to enhance consumer protection”. Users and stakeholders within the public and private sectors have general knowledge about how personal information is handled online but (proactive) cybersecurity practices are rarely used, either due to perceived inconvenience or due to the way people weigh up the trade- offs in service and protection of their personal information. Participants noted that social security numbers and personal information are widely used for authentication. However, users do yet not perceive that information as private. Once again, the discussion led to the cultural aspect and the everyday practices of the Icelandic society based on ‘implicit trust’. This factor looks at whether Internet users and stakeholders within the public and private sectors recognise and understand the importance of protection of personal information online, and whether they are sensitised to their privacy rights. 35 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 D2.4 REPORTING MECHANISMS Maturity Stage: Formative In Iceland, the public and private sectors provide some channels for reporting, child abuse online, but these channels are not coordinated and are used in an ad-hoc manner. Promotion of the existing reporting channels has not yet begun or is ad-hoc. As regards to channels for reporting identity theft, privacy and security breaches, and other incidents, such channels are almost non-existent. A system for reporting security breaches is being developed (autumn 2017). A hotline through Barnaheill – Save the Children Iceland32 focuses on child abuse. Its website also provides an online form to report illegal content. Barnaheill has operated a Hotline since November 2001. The Hotline has worked very closely with the police and with other Hotlines. The hotline is a member of the international organisation INHOPE, and participates actively in its development33. The National Commissioner of Icelandic Police (NCIP) is in charge of analysing reports and partners with Barnaheill in running the hotline. The police investigate leads and forward them to Barnaheill who uploads data to the IHRMS database – both will cooperate with other INHOPE hotlines. The police will also forward leads to Europol and Interpol. The Icelandic Red Cross also runs the 1717 Helpline for people who need assistance because of grief, anxiety, distress, depression or suicidal thoughts. These can call the Red Cross helpline free of charge 24 hours a day. The phone line also has a crucial function during times of emergency. Any incident, including cyber-related ones, can be reported via the police emergency number 112 or directly to police districts. Also, incidents such as child abuse are referred from the Police to Europol and Interpol. Some participants noted that no formal communication links have been established between the police and CERT-IS on one hand and the private sector on the other hand. However, formal communication channels are present between the communications sector and CERT- IS based on the Electronic Communications Act34. According to CERT-IS it would be the most logical hub of communications in coordinating flow of information about incidents between 32 33 34 (in Icelandic), (English translation) This factor explores the existence of reporting mechanisms functioning as channels for users to report internet related crime such as online fraud, cyber-bullying, child abuse online, identity theft, privacy and security breaches, and other incidents. 36 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 law enforcement and CI owners. However, at present CERT-IS have neither the mandate nor the resources to do so for the entire CI sector. D2.5 MEDIA AND SOCIAL MEDIA Maturity Stage: Formative There is ad-hoc media coverage of cybersecurity, with very limited information provided and reporting on specific issues that individuals face online, such as cyber-bullying. Overall, discussions on social media about cybersecurity are also limited. Social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and international blog-hosting services are freely available and are used by a large part of the population35. The Media Commission36 is an independent administrative committee under the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture (MoESC). According to the Media Law, it carries out a supervisory function [to ensure editorial independence of media] and attends to day-to-day administrative tasks in the fields covered by the law. Review participants noted that due to potential reputational harm, incidents within the private sector are often not disclosed. According to the Crime & Safety Report (2017)37, in 2013 Iceland suffered its first serious cyber-attack when a major telecommunication carrier was hacked, and detailed personal information on hundreds of Icelanders was released on the Internet. In 2015, the servers of several small, private institutions were attacked, and hackers aligned with ISIS targeted the computer network of a private missionary organisation. In November 2015 and in January 2016, in a demonstration against Iceland’s support of commercial whaling, the websites of the Icelandic government were attacked by the hacker collective Anonymous. Traditional media and social media reported about this attack, for example Iceland Review38, Grapevine39, the Hacker News40. These incidents raised the general public awareness. However, participants noted that journalists too do not necessarily understand cybersecurity issues and might misinform the public, and perhaps create fear. 35 36 37 38 39 40 This factor explores whether cybersecurity is a common subject across mainstream media, and an issue for broad discussion on social media. Moreover, this aspect speaks about the role of media in conveying information about cybersecurity to the public, thus shaping their cybersecurity values, attitudes and online behaviour. 37 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 RECOMMENDATIONS Following the information presented during the review of the maturity of Cyber Culture and Society, the Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre has developed the following set of recommendations for consideration by the Republic of Iceland. These recommendations provide advice and steps aimed to increase existing cybersecurity capacity as per the considerations of the Centre’s Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model. The recommendations are provided specifically for each factor. CYBERSECURITY MIND-SET R2.1 Enhance efforts at all levels of government, especially officials, and the private sector to employ cybersecurity good (proactive) practices. Design systems that enable users across society to embed secure practices more easily into their everyday use of the Internet and online services. R2.2 Routinize cross-sectorial cooperation and information sharing among private and public sector organisations on cybersecurity risks and good practice. R2.3 Identify vulnerable groups and high-risk behaviour across the public, in particular young people, to inform targeted, coordinated awareness campaigns, as recommended in R3.1. TRUST AND CONFIDENCE ON THE INTERNET R2.4 Establish ISP programmes to promote trust in their services based on measures of effectiveness of these programmes. R2.5 Promote data protection by default and data protection by design as a tool for transparency in the provision of e-governance services (including e-health and e-police). Implement feedback mechanisms for use to ensure that the e-services are continuously improved and trust is strengthened among users. R2.6 Employ processes for gathering user feedback within government agencies in order to ensure efficient management of online content. 38 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 R2.7 Ensure that the private sector applies security measures to establish trust in e-commerce services, including informing users of the utility of deployed security solutions. USER UNDERSTANDING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION ONLINE R2.8 Promote the understanding of protection of personal information online among users and promote the development of their skills to manage their privacy online. R2.9 Encourage a public debate regarding the protection of personal information and about the balance between security and privacy to inform policy-making. R2.10 Promote the compliance to web standards that protect the anonymity of users. R2.11 Promote data protection by default and by design as a tool for transparency. R2.12 Develop user-consent policies designed to notify practices on the collection, use or disclosure of sensitive personal information. R2.13 Establish reporting mechanisms for reporting online fraud, cyber-bullying, child abuse online, identity theft, privacy and security breaches, and other incidents in accordance with GDPR, NIS directive. R2.14 Encourage different stakeholders (public-private sector, Police, DPA, CERT- IS) to coordinate the reporting mechanisms and their roles and responsibilities, and to collaborate and share good practices to improve the mechanisms. R2.15 Establish awareness programmes to promote the regular use of reporting mechanisms by public and private sectors, and their use as an investment in loss prevention and risk control. R2.16 Establish awareness programmes to promote cyber security and data protection in the public sphere as well as within private entities that 39 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 process a great amount of personal data on a daily basis, i.e. financial institutions, insurance, IT, marketing etc. R2.17 Employ effectiveness metrics for all existing mechanisms and ensure that they contribute to their improvement. MEDIA AND SOCIAL MEDIA R2.18 Encourage media and social media providers to further extend the coverage beyond threat reporting and focus on informing the public about proactive and actionable cybersecurity measures, as well economic and social impacts. R2.19 Encourage a frequent discussion about cybersecurity on social media. R2.20 Ensure that the debate in social and mainstream media and the attitudes expressed inform policymaking. 40 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 DIMENSION 3 CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION, TRAINING AND SKILLS This dimension reviews the availability of cybersecurity awareness-raising programmes for both the public and executives. Moreover, it evaluates the availability, quality, and uptake of educational and training offerings for various groups of government stakeholders, private sector, and the population as a whole. D3.1 AWARENESS RAISING Maturity Stage: Formative Awareness-raising programmes, courses, seminars and online resources are available for target demographics from public, private, academic, and civil society sources, but no coordination or scaling efforts have been conducted. Awareness-raising programmes may be informed by international initiatives, but are not linked to the NCSS. The main Aim No. 1 of the NCSS is Capacity Building, and it recognises that the public, enterprises and government should have the knowledge, skills and equipment needed to cope with cybersecurity threats. The enhancement of general awareness of cybersecurity issues is one of the measures towards the implementation of this aim. Heimili og skóli (Home and School)41, is the National Parent Association in Iceland and has been the National Awareness Node for Internet Safety in Iceland since 2004. The name created for the awareness-raising efforts is “Samfélag, fjölskylda og tækni” (Community, 41 This factor focuses on the prevalence and design of programmes to raise awareness of cybersecurity risks and threats as well as how to address them, both for the general public and for executive management. 41 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 Family and Technology), with the acronym SAFT. The SAFT42 empowers children and parents to enjoy the internet and new media in a safe and positive way. The emphasis is on awareness work on net-ethics, computer-game rating, source criticism, uses of mobile phones and data protection on the internet. The SAFT is co-financed by the European Union’s Connecting Europe Facility. The project aims are to raise awareness about the safe and positive use of the Internet and new media among children, parents, teachers, policy makers, and the ICT industry in Iceland. Heimili og skóli is the overall coordinator for the Safer Internet Centre, coordinator for awareness actions and technical coordinator for awareness, hotline and helpline. Heimili og skóli is independent of government, political parties and religious organisations. Its members are parents’ councils and organisations of all schools (elementary and upper level) and some individual parents43. Network and Information Security is one of the main tasks of the Post and Telecom Administration (PTA) and is an increasing part of its operations. The direct service from the PTA to the public with respect to cybersecurity is first and foremost the provision of information, where the Administration supports increased awareness of network and information security, among other things by maintaining an advisory website netöryggi.is44. Public and smaller companies can find practical information on how to enhance their own security on the Internet. The PTA cooperates with other domestic organisations that work on network and information security. Iceland has established 7 February as Safer Internet Day45, which aims to raise awareness about online safety issues and to promote safer and more responsible use of the internet and smartphones, especially among children and young people; but also to give parents additional knowledge about how to use the internet more safely and to protect children better. On 28 January the European Data Protection Day is being celebrated. The Icelandic DPA has on this occasion organized seminars and published guidelines on the use of social media. The European Consumer Centres-net Iceland has on this occasion put together ‘The Five Commandments for Safer Internet Use’46. This includes advice such as: 1) not posting photos of friends without their consent on Social Networks; 2) monitoring security settings on Facebook; 3) considering the consequences before illegally downloading music or movies; 4) checking the conditions of access and use of personal data before downloading a new app; 5) obtaining parent consent before paying with their credit card. In general, most of the existing efforts focus on protecting children. There are insufficient awareness-raising programmes targeting the general public and SMEs. Because few major incidents have occurred in Iceland, the general public does not perceive cyber risks as being a national level. As seen above, cybersecurity awareness-raising efforts are in place, but no national level coordinated cybersecurity awareness programme covering different target groups has yet been developed. 42 43 44 45 46 42 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 D3.2 FRAMEWORK FOR EDUCATION Maturity Stage: Formative Some educational courses exist in cybersecurity-related fields, such as information security, network security and cryptography, but no cybersecurity-specific courses are yet offered in Iceland. It was noted during the consultations that the demand for cybersecurity education is evidenced through course enrolment and feedback within universities. The need for enhancing cybersecurity education in schools and universities has been identified by leading government, industry, and academic stakeholders. Aim No. 1: Capacity building of the NCSS recognises that the public, enterprises and government should have the knowledge, skills and equipment needed to cope with cybersecurity threats. Some of the measures recognised and planned are to include: 1) cybersecurity education in all computer- related studies at all school levels, and 2) provide students with first degrees from Icelandic universities access to postgraduate studies in cybersecurity. Several universities offer programmes in computer science and computer engineering at an undergraduate and postgraduate level while cybersecurity is often a module within the curriculum of these. However, there are no specialised degrees in cybersecurity. The University of Iceland (UoI)47 offers undergraduate studies in Electrical and Computer Engineering as well as postgraduate studies in these fields. Reykjavík University (RU)48 also offers undergraduate as well as postgraduate programmes in computer science, software engineering and applied computing. At a postgraduate level, students often do projects related to cybersecurity. However, participants mentioned that in general there are not enough incentives for students to continue their studies and specialise in cybersecurity. It was also noted that the MoESC49 needs to examine the fact that the model of three-year undergraduate studies does not allow enough time for specialization. These issues and the lack of promotion of cybersecurity or forensics as an attractive profession create a general lack of specialists in the field. The CSC now has an informal agreement with the Department of Information Security and Communication Technology at NTNU, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, which is one of the most advanced in the field of information security in the Nordic 47 48 49 This factor addresses the importance of high quality cybersecurity education offerings and the existence of qualified educators. Moreover, this factor examines the need for enhancing cybersecurity education at the national and institutional level and the collaboration between government, and industry to ensure that the educational investments meet the needs of the cybersecurity environment across all sectors. 43 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 countries50. Icelandic students can enrol on a similar basis as Norwegian students and take a degree in Master in Information Security, either full-time or part-time (e.g. along with work in Iceland). There are preliminary plans to have representatives from NTNU coming over Jan/Feb to introduce opportunities within cyber security to final year undergraduate students and with the aim of having some students applying by 1 March. A part of this plan is to develop closer ties with UoI and RU, e.g. concerning graduate and undergraduate courses and also concerning events that can help to stimulate interest in cybersecurity and provide interesting challenges for students. No national budget focused on cybersecurity education has yet been established. Qualification programmes for cybersecurity educators are being explored, with a small cadre of existing professional educators. In Iceland there is also a gender inequality in the cybersecurity field. The majority of experts working in computer science related posts and cybersecurity are men. Currently there are efforts to promote more women to join the field. The organisation of women within the School of Computing Science at Reykjavík University, /sys/tur (‘systur’ means sisters in Icelandic) was suggested as a channel for promoting cybersecurity as a profession among women. Research and development is an important consideration in education. The MoESC and the Ministry of Industries and Innovation (MoII) have the main responsibility for running the research and innovation scheme. The MoESC supervises the affairs of the Science and Technology Policy Council (STPC) and the Scientific Committee, and co-ordinates the ministry's various projects in the fields of science, research and innovation and their integration with the formulation and implementation of education policy. The Icelandic Centre for Research (RANNIS)51 supports research, research studies, technical development and innovation in Iceland. RANNIS cooperates closely with the STPC and provides professional assistance regarding the preparation and implementation of science and technology policy in Iceland. However, it was not possible to identify any specific programmes and research funds on cybersecurity or related fields that are currently running. 50 51 44 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 D3.3 FRAMEWORK FOR PROFESSIONAL TRAINING Maturity Stage: Formative The need for training professionals in cybersecurity has been documented at the national level, and training programmes in cybersecurity are offered for public and private sector employees as well as for the general public. ICT professional certification with some security modules or components is available. CISCO and other private companies also offer courses on ethical hacking and other relevant topics. Syndis52 offers intensive hands-on training, teaching developers to spot and to exploit OWASP Top-10 issues by themselves, to develop a rigorous understanding and knowledge of the security issues and to avoid the problems in practice. Moreover, ad-hoc training courses, seminars and online resources are available for cybersecurity professionals from public or private sources. Seminars, tests and written guidelines have been provided to public organisations through the Information Society Project53. Review participants mentioned that currently the Estonian Technology Fund54 is dedicated towards the provision of online courses, because overall there is not enough expertise among educators to provide training in cybersecurity. Metrics evaluating take-up of ad-hoc training courses, seminars, online resources, and certification offerings exist, but are limited in scope. Executive training courses for CEOs or chief financial executives are offered in an ad-hoc manner, including topics such as good governance practice related to cybersecurity and risk management. During the consultations it was identified that overall no established cadre of cybersecurity- certified employees exists in Iceland. Currently, many experts are self-educated or gain their expertise on the job, and knowledge transfer from employees trained in cybersecurity to untrained employees is ad hoc. 52 53 (in Icelandic) 54 The Development Fund is a state-run public institution that invests into young and growth-oriented technology companies together with the private sector. The fund is aimed to invest into knowledge-intensive and high- technology Estonian companies that are in launching stage, offering management-related support to the relevant operators. This factor addresses the availability and provision of cybersecurity training programmes building a cadre of cybersecurity professionals. Moreover, this factor reviews the uptake of cybersecurity training and horizontal and vertical cybersecurity knowledge transfer within organisations and how it translates into continuous skills development. 45 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 RECOMMENDATIONS Following the information presented on the review of the maturity of Cybersecurity Education, Training and Skills, the following set of recommendations are provided to the Republic of Iceland. These recommendations aim to provide advice and steps to be followed for the enhancement of existing cybersecurity capacity, following the considerations of the GCSCC Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model. AWARENESS RAISING R3.1 Develop a national cybersecurity awareness-raising programme with specified target groups, focusing on the most vulnerable users. R3.2 Appoint a designated organisation (from any sector) to lead the cybersecurity awareness-raising programme. R3.3 Engage relevant stakeholders from public and private sectors in the development and delivery of the awareness-raising programme as well as for the creation and utilisation of programmes and materials. R3.4 Create a single online portal linking to appropriate cybersecurity information and disseminate the cybersecurity awareness programme via this platform. R3.5 Enact evaluation measurements to study effectiveness of the awareness programmes at a level where they inform future campaigns taking into account gaps or failures. R3.6 Promote awareness of risks and threats at lower levels of the government. R3.7 Develop a dedicated awareness-raising programme for executive managers within the public and private sectors, particularly those in the financial, transport, health, CI and telecommunications sectors. R3.8 Promote awareness regarding the protection of personal data online. R3.9 Promote awareness raising efforts of cybersecurity crisis management at the executive level. 46 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 R3.10 Develop operational cyber security self-education websites. FRAMEWORK FOR EDUCATION R3.11 Create cybersecurity education programmes for instructors of cybersecurity to ensure that skilled staff is available to teach newly formed cybersecurity courses. R3.12 Create accredited cybersecurity-specific degree courses at the university level, in addition to the other existing cybersecurity-related courses in the various Icelandic universities, in cooperation with other European/international universities. R3.13 Promote efforts by Universities and other bodies to hold seminars/lectures on cybersecurity issues aimed at non-specialists, in cooperation with other European/international universities. R3.14 Allocate additional resources to cybersecurity education for public universities, dedicated to national cybersecurity research and laboratories at universities. R3.15 Establish cooperation agreements with European/International Universities in order students to enrol to programmes abroad. R3.16 Provide more opportunities for individuals (such as students and experts) to gain experience, through internships and apprenticeships, in cooperation with other European/international universities, in order to enhance their expertise by combining education and practical training. R3.17 Inform cybersecurity education priorities through broad consultation across government, private sector, academia and civil society, linked to the National Cybersecurity Strategy. R3.18 Promote competitions and initiatives for students by government and/or industry in order to increase the attractiveness of cybersecurity careers. R3.19 Ensure the sustainability of research programs. 47 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 R3.20 Develop effective metrics to ensure that educational and skill enhancement investments meet the needs of the cybersecurity environment. FRAMEWORK FOR PROFESSIONAL TRAINING R3.21 Establish more structured cybersecurity training programmes to develop skills towards building a cadre of cybersecurity-specific professionals. R3.22 Provide training for experts on various aspects of cybersecurity, such as technical training in data systems, legal training, tools, and models and operation of these tools. R3.23 Train general IT staff on cybersecurity issues so that they can react to incidents as they occur. R3.24 Ensure that affordable security professional certification is offered across sectors within the country. R3.25 Develop a central platform for sharing training information for experts and create a national-level register of cybersecurity experts. R3.26 Establish requirements for joint cybersecurity training for the public and private sector, and develop collaborative training platforms. R3.27 Establish job creation initiatives for cybersecurity within organisations and encourage employers to train staff to become cybersecurity professionals. R3.28 Begin to implement metrics evaluating take-up of ad-hoc training courses, seminars, online resources, and certification offerings. 48 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 DIMENSION 4 LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS This dimension examines the government’s capacity to design and enact national legislation directly and indirectly relating to cybersecurity, with a particular emphasis placed on the topics of ICT security, privacy and data protection issues, and other cybercrime-related issues. The capacity to enforce such laws is examined through law enforcement, prosecution, and court capacities. Moreover, this dimension observes issues such as formal and informal cooperation frameworks to combat cybercrime. D4.1 LEGAL FRAMEWORKS Maturity Stage: Established The Republic of Iceland has implemented provisions relating to cybersecurity comprehensively in its ICT legislative and regulatory frameworks. The Regulatory Framework of the European Union55 – through the EEA membership – applies in the country and has shaped many regulations and existing legislation to protect the rights of individuals and organisations in the digital environment. Relevant actors from private sector and civil-society stakeholders are generally involved in legislative processes and make their voices heard through the media or by contacting politicians directly56. According to review participants, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), for instance, conducted a survey on the existing legislation to receive feedback from 55 agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013%20N O%20CROPS.pdf 56 This factor addresses legislation and regulation frameworks related to cybersecurity, including: ICT security legislative frameworks; privacy; freedom of speech and other human rights online; data protection; child protection; consumer protection; intellectual property; and substantive and procedural cybercrime legislation. 49 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 stakeholders, and is currently preparing a report, in accordance with usual practice during legislative processes.57 The Electronic Communications Act (ECA) No. 81 from March 2003,58 the Act on the Post and Telecom Administration (APTA) No. 69, from March 200359 and its Amendment No. 62/201260 provide the legal basis for the Post and Telecom Administration (PTA), an independent body under the MoTLG responsible for the administration of electronic communications and postal affairs. Both Acts stipulate certain provisions regarding cybersecurity and critical information infrastructure, and allow PTA to implement measures to maintain the integrity and security of public communications networks (ECA, Article 3). According to Article 6, the ECA also ensures the security of public networks from illegal access and the safety of the country’s electronic communications with the outside world. Moreover, it requires those providing electronic communications services to take measures to ensure their security, to consult with operators and to inform subscribers in the case of a breach. Individuals who work in electronic communications are required to keep information confidential even after employment termination. Amendment No. 62 defines the role and responsibilities of CERT-IS (see D1.2) for the protection of critical information infrastructure (Article 8). Law enforcement only receives access to data where provisions of Article 70 of the Criminal Proceedings Act61 apply. The Regulation on protection, functionality, and quality of IP communications services, No. 1223 from 200762 applies to network and information security within the ECA and establishes the role of CERT-IS. It aims “to enhance consumer protection and strengthen the foundations of the information society by making increased requirements concerning the security of the electronic communications systems used by businesses and individuals.” This includes security of IP traffic and email operations, as well as notification of customers, measures to limit the spread of security incidents, reporting mechanisms, and the supply of value-added services regarding security. Art. 42, paragr. 3 of the ECA stipulates that data should be retained for 6 months. This data can only be accessed following a judicial procedure, as per Art. 47, paragr. 7 of the ECA. Additionally, the Icelandic Media Law63 requires providers to ensure that the transmission of service via electronic communications networks are secure (Article 45). Act No. 30/2002 on Electronic Commerce and other Electronic Services retains the liability of ISPs and establishes a system of takedown notices for IP addresses or other online content that violate the law, in accordance with the Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament. According to a similar EU directive, Act No 28/2001 on Electronic Signatures64 and Regulation No. 780/201165 define the legality of electronic signatures and their power to 57 _octobre_2016/a_hrc_wg.6_33_isl_1_e_0.pdf 58 26-March-2003/ 59 Administration-No.-69-24-March-2003/ 60 61 2008-Exerpts/ 62 63 64 on-electronic-signatures/ 65 50 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 make legally binding agreements, and the requirements for certificates, signature-creation devices and certification service providers. The first Data protection legislation in Iceland was adopted in 1981 and has been updated and enforced since then. The Data Protection Act No. 77/200066 includes general conditions for the collection of personal data and protection from misuse and it promotes a practice of personal data processing in accordance with fundamental principles and rules regarding data protection and privacy. It stipulates, inter alia, that data can only be obtained for specific purposes and only processed in a fair apposite and lawful manner. According to Articles 8 (general conditions) and 9 (sensitive data), data may only be processed if one of the criteria listed in the provisions is met, i.e. after the subject has given unambiguous and informed consent. When processing personal data controllers have a duty to inform the data subject, see Article 20 of the Data Protection Act. For example, the controller must provide the name and address of the controller, the purpose of the processing and other information, such as recipients or categories of the data and whether or not he is obliged to provide the data. The Act implements the Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data 67 and safeguards the reliability and integrity of the personal data and its free flow within the EEA. As a member of the EEA Agreement Iceland is obliged to implement the GDPR into Icelandic law. The Ministry of Justice is responsible for the implementation. Most likely, the Minister of Justice will introduce before the parliament a new draft legislative bill, implementing the provisions of the GDPR, in 2018. The Data Protection Authority (DPA)68, is an independent governmental body, which is responsible for monitoring data processing and the application of the Data Protection Act. It has also started to prepare for new duties laid upon it by the GDPR and at the same time offers guidance for businesses and other institutions. Additionally, Rules No. 299/2001 on the Security of Personal Data69 explicitly provide measures regarding higher risks to personal data when it is processed on the Internet (Article 4). Moreover, the Regulation on the Protection of Information in the Public Communications Networks no 1221/200770 aims “to enhance consumer protection and strengthen the foundations of the information society” by defining the measures the PTA needs to undertake in order to guarantee the confidentiality, the availability and the integrity of information, and its lawful access. This includes business continuity plans, measures concerning employees, access controls and organisational and technological measures. Several Icelandic laws recognize fundamental human rights on the Internet, including privacy online, freedom of speech, freedom of information, and freedom of assembly and association. The constitution71 includes thirteen provisions regarding human rights, including the protection of freedom of expression (Article 73), privacy (Article 71), freedom of association (Articles 64 and 74) and assembly (Article 74), and has been updated according to 66 67 68 69 70 71 51 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 the latest international developments.72 Additionally, the Media Act No 38/2011 73 also requires media service providers to ensure human rights, such as freedom of expression and privacy in their activities (Article 26). The country’s previous Information Act No 50/1996 and the current Information Act No. 140/201274 provide a safeguard to the public’s right to access information effectively and ensure the free flow of information. The country has also ratified or acceded to several international agreements, such as the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms of the Council of Europe75, and those of the International Labour Organization and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, such as the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data No 10876. The country is actively involved in the global discourse on human rights by submitting reports to international bodies, while also reviewing and adapting the recommendations to their legislation. The Icelandic Human Rights Centre (ICEHR)77 is the national institution responsible for conducting research regarding human rights issues and for promoting and creating awareness about human rights. Freedom of Speech and Privacy legislations are also reviewed as part of the implementation of the Budapest Convention (see below). Comprehensive legislation on the protection of children has been adopted and enforced according to Iceland’s Child Protection Act, No. 80/2002. This legal and institutional framework is largely in line with the international human rights obligations in this field, e.g. ISPs have to filter out websites containing child abuse online if notified. Iceland has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and other relevant international conventions and is applying them in the country78. However, review participants stated that there is no specific domestic law or provision in the online environment, speaking specifically to the protection of children online, nor directly to relevant criminal procedures. The Act No 62/2005 on the Consumer Agency and Consumer Spokesman79 safeguards consumers from business malpractice online and is enforced by the Consumer Agency (CA), a governmental agency under the auspices of MoII. The Act is complemented by the above- mentioned Acts No. 30/2002 on Electronic Commerce and other Electronic Services and No. 28/2001 on Electronic Signatures.80 The latter fulfils the legal requirements of the European Parliament and Council Directive 1999/93/EB81 to ensure that the certificates issued in Iceland are valid in the EEA. The CA is a founding member of the Forum of European Supervisory Authorities,82 which “support(s) the cooperation, information and assistance among the members and to facilitate the exchange of views and agreement on good practice.” 72 _octobre_2016/a_hrc_wg.6_33_isl_1_e_0.pdf 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 on-electronic-signatures/ 81 82 52 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 Iceland adheres to legislation addressing intellectual property of online products and services as other countries in EEA. Copyright Act No. 126/201183 comprises of provisions regarding intellectual property rights. The Icelandic Patent Office is the agency responsible for issues related to copyright and provides information and advice to individuals, companies and other institutions. The country is a member of major international bodies, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), the European Patent Organisation (EPO) and the Nordic Patent Institute. Moreover, Iceland adheres to key international agreements such as the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement, the Patent Cooperation Treaty, The Geneva Act of the Hague Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Industrial Designs, and the European Patent Convention. Participants confirmed that cases of copyright violations have been prosecuted and sentenced. There is no specific cybercrime law in Iceland. However, in 2007 the country ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, also known as the ‘Budapest Convention’, whose recommendations are consistently implemented into domestic law. For instance, General Penal Code No. 19/194084 (GPC) contains substantive cybercrime legal provision since its amendment in 1998, in addition to latter amendments to the GPC and the Act on Criminal Procedures which are related to the implementation of the Budapest Convention. The code prohibits e.g. unlawfully accessing other persons’ data or its destruction or damage (Articles 257 and 228)85, as well as “unlawfully modifying, adding to of destroying computer software, or data or programs stored in machine-readable form, or taking other measures designed to influence the outcome of computer processing” (Article 249a). However, as participants pointed out there are gaps in existing legislation. For instance, the act of breaking into a computer system may not be illegal in itself; only when damage occurs or the break-in is for financial gain, does it become a crime (see above). However, it should be noted that article 228 in the GPC stipulates that “a person who in an unlawful manner procures access to data or programs of others which are stored in a computerized form” can be fined or sentenced, to up to one year in prison. On the other hand, article 242 in the GPC stipulates that lawsuits on account of offences, against article 228 may only be brought by the injured party alone which limits the tools that the police and prosecutors have for investigation and prosecution in such cases. The penal code also bans the production, distribution, and possession of child pornography (Article 210), and illicit computer-related acts for personal or financial gain, such as fraud and forgery (Article 158). The Act on Collection of Evidence Relating to Alleged Violations of Intellectual Property Rights, No. 53/200686 contains comprehensive provisions for the investigation of cybercrime and evidentiary requirements, e.g. for electronic evidence (Article 4, 12), and cases have been brought to court. The Act on Criminal Procedure No. 88/200887 allows requesting electronic information from ISPs for the purpose of an investigation (Article 70). 83 84 85 86 to-Alleged-Violations-of-Intellectual-Property-Rights-No.-53-2006/ 87 2008-Exerpts/ 53 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 In spite of the shortcomings mentioned earlier, participants perceived the legislation in respect to cybersecurity as sufficient. However, the government still has to fulfil its commitment, expressed in the national ICT Security Policy from 2015, to update its legislation “[to] reflect the international demands and obligations the country undertakes regarding cyber security and the protection of personal data”.88 There are several gaps in existing legislation. Furthermore, the protection of infrastructure is limited to e-communications infrastructure and does not cover other CNI. With the NIS Directive to take effect in May 2018, several participants emphasized the need to address this lack of legislation protecting CNI, and criticized the slow process encountered in preparing its implementation. However, they anticipated its potential contribution towards closing the existing gaps in CNI protection in the very near future. Participants also expressed concerns about the state of preparedness of the private sector and of government institutions to implement the GDPR and the structures and processes it requires in the remaining months before it comes into effect from May 2018 onwards. From their perspective, efforts in the remaining time should focus on preparing the new legislation needed to implement the GDPR and putting it forth, but also foster the implementation across the private and public sectors. D4.2 CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM Maturity Stage: Formative Across the criminal justice system, capacities are at initial stages of development in Iceland. The Police, headed by the National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police (NCIP), have only limited digital forensics capacity and cases are investigated by the digital forensics unit of the Reykjavik Metropolitan Police. Two policemen at the Metropolitan Police are also specifically assigned to investigate cases involving sexual violence against children on the internet. However, the country needs more skilled personnel as well as the procedural and technological resources to conduct investigations in a comprehensive way. Training for law enforcement officers on cybercrime and digital evidence is ad-hoc or not specialized. As a result, for instance, revenge porn is a recurring issue, because the lack of capacity hinders the police being able to tackle all cases. One way to mitigate these threats and resource gaps is regional and bilateral collaboration mechanisms, e.g. with the Norwegian police (see 4.3). Some specialised cybercrime prosecutors have the capacity to build cases on electronic evidence, but this capacity is limited as training is largely ad-hoc, not institutionalised and informal. For instance, some prosecutors have participated in courses offered by the 88 This factor studies the capacity of law enforcement to investigate cybercrime, and the prosecution’s capacity to present cybercrime and electronic evidence cases. Finally, this factor addresses the court capacity to preside over cybercrime cases and those involving electronic evidence. 54 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 International Association of Prosecutors89, but the courses are not mandatory. A similar situation can be observed in courts. If judges receive training on cybercrime, digital evidence, or data protection, it is ad-hoc or not specialized and much of the training available is also not even known, for instance that by the Council of Europe90. On the other hand, a newly established Judicial Administration is preparing an overall analysis on the need for training of judges and other staff in order to build a training program. Both Judges and the Judicial Administration are aware of the importance of strengthening knowledge of digital processes and cybercrime. Furthermore, a provision in the new Act on Courts, going into effect on 1st January 2018, also strengthens the selection process of experts to the bench in order to create a substantial pool of these experts in all the major fields. In addition, it should be noted that risk analysis on data protection for judicial data has also been performed. Participants confirmed that the cooperation with law enforcement is effective, even with the limited capacity as described, as those personnel who have the expertise are known and cases are automatically handed over. While Iceland has not yet seen a large number of cybercrime cases brought before the courts, the limited levels of capacity in handling cybercrime cases could potentially lead to ineffective investigations, prosecutions and convictions, which would allow cybercriminals to remain unpunished and continue their criminal conduct. In addition to strengthening the legal framework, it is therefore important to elevate the capacities of the criminal justice system to successfully combat and prevent cybercrime. D4.3 FORMAL AND INFORMAL COOPERATION FRAMEWORKS TO COMBAT CYBERCRIME Maturity Stage: Established Iceland has fully acknowledged the need for formal and informal cooperation and has established mechanisms of international cooperation in order to prevent and combat cybercrime by facilitating its detection, investigation, and prosecution, with established communication channels. The country cooperates with international organisation such as Interpol91 and Europol,92 and directly with governments, e.g. Norway and the US, regarding cross-border information sharing and has signed l Mutual Legal Assistance agreements which 89 90 91 92 This factor addresses the existence and functioning of formal and informal mechanisms that enable cooperation between domestic actors and across borders to deter and combat cybercrime. 55 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 are successfully applied. The MoJ is the authority responsible for “sending and answering requests for mutual assistance, the execution of such requests, or the transmission of them to the authorities competent for their execution” as well as “making or receipt of a request for extradition or provisional arrest”. The NCIP has the responsibility of being the 24/7 point of contact to provide immediate assistance for the purpose of cybercrime investigations or proceedings.93 These tasks are then usually handed over to the digital forensics unit at the Reykjavik Metropolitan Police (see 4.1). Cooperation between law enforcement and the private sector, in particular ISPs, is informal, as there are no legislative requirements for the exchange of information between domestic public and private sectors. Only telecommunications companies are required to report ‘serious’ incidents, to CERT-IS. However, there is no definition of what constitutes a serious incident. According to the participants, companies have often been hesitant to report incidents, though a shift towards more openness is being observed from companies which have begun to volunteer information. Between government and criminal justice actors, informal relationships have been established successfully, mostly based on personal connections, resulting in the exchange of information on cybercrime issues. RECOMMENDATIONS Following the information presented on the review of the maturity of cybersecurity Legal and Regulatory Frameworks, the following set of recommendations are provided to the Republic of Iceland. These recommendations aim to provide advice and steps to be followed for the enhancement of existing cybersecurity capacity, following the considerations of the GCSCC. LEGAL FRAMEWORKS R4.1 Continue to review existing legal and regulatory mechanisms for ICT security to identify where gaps and overlaps may exist and amend or enact new laws accordingly. Monitor the enforcement of the legislative frameworks and ensure that it informs resources allocation and legal reform. Put mechanisms in place for keeping ICT legal frameworks in harmony with national cybersecurity-related ICT policies, international law, standards and good practices. R4.2 Ensure that international and regional trends and good practices inform the assessment and amendment of domestic legal frameworks protecting human rights online and associated resource planning. In order to meet dynamic changes in the application of technology to human rights, identify procedures to amend and update legal frameworks as needed. 93 /conventions/treaty/185/declarations?p_auth=CZVDo71s&_coeconventions_WAR_coeconventionsportlet_enVi gueur=false&_coeconventions_WAR_coeconventionsportlet_searchBy=state&_coeconventions_WAR_coeconve ntionsportlet_codePays=ICE&_coeconventions_WAR_coeconventionsportlet_codeNature=3 56 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 R4.3 Continue to actively contribute to the global discourse on human rights on the Internet. Foster research on human rights on the Internet and ensure that measures are in place to exceed minimal baselines specified in international agreements. Continue to actively contribute to the global discourse on human rights and move the focus on human rights on the Internet. R4.4 Ensure that the GDPR and the Police Directive94 on the processing of personal data is successfully implemented and legal mechanisms are in place that enable. Identify international and regional trends and good practices to inform the assessment and amendment of data-protection laws and associated resource planning. R4.5 Improve national child protection online legislation to comply with regional and international law and standards. R4.6 In order to meet dynamic changes in the application of technology to consumer protection, develop and implement procedures to amend and update legal frameworks as needed. R4.7 Review the legislation on intellectual property online through consultation with key stakeholders and through public discourse to reflect changes in national priorities and the international ICT landscape. R4.8 Develop and implement measures to exceed minimal baselines for substantive and procedural cybercrime frameworks specified in international treaties where appropriate, which includes procedures to amend those frameworks as needed. R4.9 Ensure that in the case of cross-border investigation, procedural law stipulates what actions need to be conducted under particular case characteristics, in order to successfully investigate cybercrime. CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM R4.10 Invest in advanced investigative capabilities in order to allow the investigation of complex cybercrime cases, supported by regular testing and training of investigators. R4.11 Allocate resources dedicated to fully operational cybercrime units based on strategic decision making in order to support investigations, especially at the local level. 94 Directive 2016/680 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA . 57 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 R4.12 Enhance training and education of prosecutors and judges on cybercrime and data protection. Additional resources should be allocated for this purpose. R4.13 Establish a formal mechanism to enable the exchange of information and good practices between prosecutors and judges to ensure efficient and effective prosecution of cybercrime cases. R4.14 Collect and analyse statistics and trends regularly on cybercrime investigations, on cybercrime prosecutions and on cybercrime convictions. FORMAL AND INFORMAL COOPERATION FRAMEWORKS TO COMBAT CYBERCRIME R4.15 Allocate resources to support the exchange of information between public and private sectors domestically and enhance legislative framework and communication mechanisms. R4.16 Enhance established informal cooperation mechanisms between Internet Service Providers and PTA, DPA and law enforcement with clear communication channels. 58 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 DIMENSION 5 STANDARDS, ORGANISATIONS AND TECHNOLOGIES This dimension addresses effective and widespread use of cybersecurity technology to protect individuals, organisations and national infrastructure. The dimension specifically examines the implementation of cybersecurity standards and good practices, the deployment of processes and controls, and the development of technologies and products in order to reduce cybersecurity risks. D5.1 ADHERENCE TO STANDARDS Maturity Stage: Formative ICT security standards and good practices have been adopted by both the public and private sector and there is evidence of measurable implementation. Telecommunications companies must, according to the ECA, implement cybersecurity measures in their overall risk management; however, the Act does not specify which standards are mandatory across sectors. Many public organisations, including CNI, have introduced international standards such as the ISO 27000 family and are following relevant EU requirements. According to participants, the National Hospital and many of the municipalities have adhered to ISO 27001 for about ten years. Moreover, banks have to comply with the requirements of Fjármálaeftirlitið, the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA)95 and must have certification to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). It was mentioned that it is often the requirement of corporate customers that financial organisations fulfil specific standards 95 This factor reviews government’s capacity to design, adapt and implement cybersecurity standards and good practice, especially those related to procurement procedures and software development. 59 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 which are not a legal of regulatory requirement. This is also an observation regarding the private sector. Furthermore, all controllers processing personal data must adhere to the security provisions of the Data Protection Act, cf. Articles 11-13, and Rules No. 299/2001 on the Security of Personal Data. The rules especially refer to ISO/IEC 27001 as guidelines to follow when setting up an ISMS. A different observation was made for the smaller health care institutions across the country and smaller and medium municipalities and enterprises in Iceland. Most of these organisations do not implement standards or do not seek certification due to limited human resources. It is common that those organisations use trusted domestic and international hosting companies that adhere to standards, wrongly assuming that they are no longer responsible for information security. On the other hand, PTA has observed that the majority of telecommunications companies follow ISO 27001 in order to fulfil compliancy requirements, although many abstain from certification due to its high costs. No measures to monitor compliance or metrics were known by the participants and there is no entity in the country which has the mandate to monitor the implementation of standards. Overall, participants expected significant changes due to the implementation of the GDPR which will both emphasise the responsibility of any organisation to adhere to certain standards and the need for monitoring. These developments will foster the implementation of standards in all sectors and will increase the awareness that adherence to standards is one crucial element to make an organisation cybersecure. Regarding the standards related to procurement of software, similar conclusions can be drawn. There is no evidence for the adoption of and compliance to cybersecurity standards in procurement practices within the public and private sectors, nor measurement and assessments of process effectiveness. Organisations consider critical aspects of procurement such as prices and costs, quality, timescales and other value-added activities but often they are not aware of cybersecurity aspects or do not know which standards to adhere to in this regard. There is no unified process in the country to guide the identification of standards for procurement of software or hardware. Processes follow in general the requirements of the Public Procurement Act, No. 120/201696 which is aligned with the European regulation. Some larger public and private organisations follow ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 32, ISO 2911597, ISO 27001 and the Gartner Standards. However, the extent of the implementation of these depends on the sector and is ad-hoc. The Ríkiskaup, the government’s public procurement office98, for instance, has signed frame contracts with about seven hosting companies, which can be used by every public institution. Some large international companies follow their own procurement processes or base their decision on reputation of the product or supplier rather than actual standard adherence. Focusing on standards in software development, there are no guidelines or protocols in place relating to cybersecurity. Although local companies and the professional communities in Iceland perceive security in software development as important, most participants agreed that it is not a priority, especially in smaller companies or in-house development offices, and 96 procurment-no.-120-2016.pdf 97 98 60 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 may also be sacrificed because of the higher costs. The only exception is the financial sector that has to follow the requirements of the FSA. Participants expect that the implementation of the NIS directive and the GDPR will bring the issue of standard adherence to the attention of the other sectors as well. D5.2 INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE RESILIENCE Maturity Stage: Established Iceland’s Internet services and infrastructure have been established and are reliable. The technology and processes deployed for Internet infrastructure meet international IT guidelines, standards, and good practices. Iceland achieves leading scores in technological readiness99 and Internet access and broadband penetration is one of the highest internationally100. Several submarine cables connect the country with the European and North American continent. Internet is used for e-commerce and electronic business transactions (see D2.2). However, authentication processes are often weak, e.g. many websites only require simple authentication. There are also legal requirements for operational security; but telecommunication companies and other CNI often have their own internal standards or are only obliged that those are fit-for-purpose. Although national infrastructure is formally managed, including documented processes, roles and responsibilities, there is no regular assessment of those processes according to international standards and guidelines. An exception is again the financial sector which is regulated by the FSA. 99 2017_FINAL.pdf 100 This factor addresses the existence of reliable Internet services and infrastructure in the country as well as rigorous security processes across private and public sectors. Also, this aspect reviews the control that the government might have over its Internet infrastructure and the extent to which networks and systems are outsourced. 61 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 D5.3 SOFTWARE QUALITY Maturity Stage: Start-up to Formative Software quality is a matter of concern and functional requirements in public and private sector are identified, but not necessarily in a strategic manner. Priority is mostly given to the quality and performance of software. As there is no inventory of software used in public and private sectors, nor is a catalogue of secure software, software is mostly selected because it is known or recommended. Additionally, monitoring and quality assessment is conducted in an ad-hoc manner only in few private institutions, so no evidence of software quality deficiencies is gathered. Policies and processes on software updates and maintenance are increasingly put in place, but primarily by international companies or enterprises that focus on the Internet or software development. D5.4 TECHNICAL SECURITY CONTROLS Maturity Stage: Formative to Established Up-to-date technical security controls, including patching and backups, are deployed in all sectors in Iceland but to very different levels. Companies have internal policies for updates and automated software updates are becoming more common. However, participants expressed doubts that these controls are tested on a regular basis. As many smaller companies and public sector organisations use hosting services and other suppliers they often are not aware of their remaining responsibility to be cyber secure. Users have general understanding of the importance of, for instance, anti-malware software, but it is questionable whether this is translated into actual behaviour, such as regular updates. ISPs often offer such software and have established policies for technical security control deployment as part of their services. Technical cybersecurity control systems are deployed but not consistently based on established cybersecurity frameworks, such as the This factor examines the quality of software deployment and the functional requirements in public and private sectors. In addition, this factor reviews the existence and improvement of policies on and processes for software updates and maintenance based on risk assessments and the criticality of services. This factor reviews evidence regarding the deployment of technical security controls by users, public and private sectors and whether the technical cybersecurity control set is based on established cybersecurity frameworks. 62 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 SANS Top-20 cybersecurity controls. Physical security controls are increasingly deployed on various levels, for instance in ministries, to prevent unauthorised personnel from entering computing facilities. D5.5 CRYPTOGRAPHIC CONTROLS Maturity Stage: Formative to Established Across stakeholder groups there is a broad understanding of secure communication services, such as encrypted or signed email, and many institutions support these because of increased public pressure and notification through a popular Facebook group101 where experts in Iceland discuss cybersecurity issues. However, international counterparts have pointed out that documents provided by Icelandic partners sometimes do not meet international standards. No guidelines in this regard for each sector exist – except for in financial institutions. Although some state-of-the-art tools, such as SSL or TLS, are routinely deployed by web service providers to secure all communications between servers and web browsers, and all EU laws have been implemented on data protection and e-signatures, participants pointed out a lack of infrastructure to manage encryption, as no such services are offered in Iceland. D5.6 CYBERSECURITY MARKETPLACE Maturity Stage: Start-up to Formative The domestic market in Iceland is very small and only provides a few specialised cybersecurity products, which are not demand-driven. Most organisations rely on products from international companies. Local suppliers of software and services such as penetration testing and auditing do consider cybersecurity, as mentioned above (D5.3) but it is not a priority. 101 This factor reviews the deployment of cryptographic techniques in all sectors and users for protection of data at rest or in transit, and the extent to which these cryptographic controls meet international standards and guidelines and are kept up-to-date. This factor addresses the availability and development of competitive cybersecurity technologies and insurance products. 63 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 Cyber-insurance is offered by a domestic insurer who resells international products, but uptake is limited as the terms are often not suitable for local companies. D5.7 RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE Maturity Stage: Formative Stakeholders mainly share technical details of vulnerabilities informally with other stakeholders, who can distribute the information more broadly; but this is not common and is mostly not done publicly. Currently, organisations have established their own processes and mechanisms to receive, disseminate and share information on vulnerabilities, and the Facebook group mentioned above (D5.5), which discloses incidents on a regular basis, is contributing to a cultural shift in this regard and has encouraged voluntary disclosure. Beyond that, there is no framework in place and only some organisations are obliged to report to CERT-IS. Banks have to report within 24 hours according to the FSA guidance. After the GDPR comes into force companies will have 72 hours to report to the DPA. Additionally, financial institutions and telecommunication companies inform affected customers, usually via email or a publicly available status page. Changes are expected with the implementation of GDPR, NIS and the Police Directive into Icelandic law when incident reporting both towards relevant authorities and data subjects involved (if applicable) will be required for by law. RECOMMENDATIONS Following the information presented on the review of the maturity of cybersecurity Standards, Organisations, and Technologies, the following set of recommendations are provided to the Republic of Iceland. These recommendations aim to provide advice and steps to be followed for the enhancement of existing cybersecurity capacity, following the considerations of the GCSCC Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model. This factor explores the establishment of a responsible-disclosure framework for the receipt and dissemination of vulnerability information across sectors and, if there is sufficient capacity, to continuously review and update this framework. 64 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 ADHERENCE TO STANDARDS R5.1 Adopt a nationally agreed baseline of cybersecurity related standards and good practices across the public and private sectors, including standards in procurement and software development. R5.2 Establish a body within government to assess the level of adoption of standards across public and private sectors. Apply metrics to monitor compliance.

INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE RESILIENCE R5.4 Enhance coordination and collaboration regarding resilience of Internet infrastructure across public and private sectors. R5.5 Conduct regular assessments of processes according to international standards and guidelines together with assessment of national information infrastructure security and critical services that drive investment in new technologies. R5.6 Identify and map points of critical failure across the Internet infrastructure. SOFTWARE QUALITY R5.7 Develop a catalogue for secure software platforms and applications within the public and private sectors and share with all stakeholders. R5.8 Establish software quality and functional requirements in public and private sectors, including policies on software updates. 65 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 R5.9 Promote the use of reliable software applications that adhere to international standards and good practices in the public and private sectors. R5.10 Monitor and assess the quality of software used in public and private sectors. TECHNICAL SECURITY CONTROLS R5.11 Promote user understanding of the importance of anti-malware software and network firewalls. R5.12 Establish policies for technical security control deployment in critical infrastructure and ISPs. R5.13 Keep technical security controls up-to-date within the public and private sector, monitor their effectiveness and review on a regular basis. R5.14 Conduct penetration testing of technical security controls to upstream user and private/public sector protection. CRYTOGRAPHIC CONTROLS R5.15 Encourage the development and dissemination of cryptographic controls across all sectors and users for protection of data at rest and in transit, according to international standards and guidelines. R5.16 Raise public awareness of secure communication services, such as encrypted/signed emails. R5.17 Promote deployment of state-of-the-art tools, such as SSL or TLS, by web service providers, to secure all communications between servers and web browsers. R5.18 Develop encryption and cryptographic control policies within the public and private sectors based on previous assessments, and regularly review the policies for effectiveness. 66 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 CYBERSECURITY MARKETPLACE R5.19 Consider promoting the production of cybersecurity products by domestic providers in accordance with market needs. R5.20 Ensure that cybersecurity technology development abides by secure coding guidelines, good practices and adheres to internationally accepted standards. R5.21 Promote the establishment of a market for cyber-insurance and encourage information-sharing among participants of the market. RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE R5.22 Develop a responsible vulnerability-disclosure framework or policy with all stakeholders involved (product vendors, customers, security vendors and public) and facilitate its adoption in the private sector, including a disclosure deadline, a schedule for resolution and an acknowledgment report. R5.23 Encourage software and service providers to address bug and vulnerability reports. R5.24 Encourage sharing of technical details of vulnerabilities among critical infrastructure organisations and ISPs. R5.25 Publish the analysis of the technical details of vulnerabilities and disseminate advisory information according to different individual roles and responsibilities. 67 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 ADDITIONAL REFLECTIONS Overall, the representation and composition of stakeholder groups was balanced and comprehensive. The MoTLG extended invitations to stakeholders in advance of the review, and while it is difficult to ascertain whether all relevant experts were present, the input gathered over the three days was key to ensuring a successful review. This was the eighteenth country review that GCSCC has supported directly. Iceland has begun the process of developing different aspects of cybersecurity capacity across all dimensions, including through implementing the action plan of the National Cybersecurity Strategy and revisiting legal frameworks and regulation. These efforts will establish the foundations for more advanced capacity in the future. GCSCC hopes that this review will offer useful insights to Iceland and that the review’s recommendations will contribute to continuing work on enhancing cybersecurity capacity across all five dimensions of the CMM. 68 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017 APPENDIX SUMMARY OF REVIEW RESULTS CAPACITY FACTORS STAGE OF MATURITY REFERENCES RECOMMENDATIONS D1.1 National Cybersecurity Strategy Established National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCSS) 2015-2026 is/media/innanrikisradune yti-media/media/frettir- 2015/Icelandic_National_ Cyber_Security_Summary _loka.pdf .is/news/article/2015/07/ 03/National-Cyber- Strategy-for-Iceland- released/ The Ministry of Transport and Local Government (MoTLG) is/news/article/2017/05/0 1/Two-new-ministries- commence-operation/ R1.1 Ensure that the National Cybersecurity Strategy content includes, at a minimum: explicit links to national risks, priorities, objectives, and business development, raising public awareness, mitigating cybercrime, and protecting critical infrastructure from external and internal threats.

SUMMARY   The Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre (GCSCC, or ‘the Capacity Centre’) has undertaken   a review of the maturity of the cybersecurity capacity of the Republic of Iceland, hosted by   Iceland’s Ministry of Transport and Local Government (MoTLG). The objective of this review   is to enable the government of Iceland to reassess its cybersecurity capacity in order to   prioritise strategic investment in national cybersecurity.    Over the period 21–23 June 2017, stakeholders from the following sectors participated in a   series of consultations with GCSCC staff: government departments and ministries, legislators   and policy owners, criminal justice, law enforcement, academia, as well as the private and   financial sectors.    The consultations were premised on the Capacity Centre’s Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity   Model for Nations (CMM)1, which defines five dimensions of cybersecurity capacity:   • Policy and strategy   • Culture and society   • Education, training and skills   • Legal and regulatory frameworks   • Standards, organisations and technologies   Each dimension comprises a number of factors which, taken together, explain what it means   to possess cybersecurity capacity. Factors are further subdivided into aspects and for each   aspect there are indicators, setting out those conditions that define the level of maturity   achieved in any given aspect. There are five stages of maturity, ranging from the start-up to   the dynamic. The start-up stage implies an ad-hoc approach to capacity, whereas the dynamic   stage is indicative of a strategic approach and the ability to adapt or change in response to   environmental considerations. The five stages of the CMM are defined as follows:   - Start-up: At this stage either no cybersecurity maturity exists, or it is very embryonic in   nature. There might be initial discussions about cybersecurity capacity building, but no   concrete actions have been taken. There is an absence of observable evidence of   cybersecurity capacity at this stage.   - Formative: Some aspects have begun to grow and be formulated, but may be ad-hoc,   disorganized, poorly defined – or simply new. However, evidence of this aspect can be   clearly demonstrated.   - Established: The indicators of the aspect are in place, and functioning. However, there   is not well thought-out consideration of the relative allocation of resources. Little   trade-off decision-making has been made concerning the relative investment in this   aspect. But the aspect is functional and defined.                                                               1 Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM), Revised Edition, available at  https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/cybersecurity-capacity/content/cmm-revised-edition    https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/cybersecurity-capacity/content/cmm-revised-edition        5 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     - Strategic: At this stage choices have been made about which indicators of this aspect   are important, and which are less important for the particular organisation or state.   The strategic stage reflects the fact that these choices have been made, conditional   upon the state’s or organisation's particular circumstances.   - Dynamic: At this stage, there are clear mechanisms in place to alter strategy depending   on the prevailing circumstances such as the technological sophistication of the threat   environment, global conflict or a significant change in one area of concern (e.g.   cybercrime or privacy). Dynamic organisations have developed methods for changing   strategies in stride. Rapid decision-making, reallocation of resources, and constant   attention to the changing environment are features of this stage.   Figure 1 below provides an overall representation of cybersecurity capacity in the Republic of   Iceland and illustrates the maturity estimates in each dimension. Each dimension represents   one fifth of the graphic, with the five stages of maturity for each factor extending outwards   from the centre of the graphic; ‘start-up’ is closest to the centre of the graphic and ‘dynamic’   is placed at the perimeter.   Figure 1: Overall representation of the cybersecurity capacity in the Republic of Iceland          6 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     Policy and Strategy   The policy and strategy dimension of cybersecurity capacity for Iceland was gauged to range   from start-up to established stages of maturity.    The Republic of Iceland is at an established stage of maturity regarding the National   Cybersecurity Strategy factor. Iceland has published the Icelandic National Cyber Security   Strategy (NCSS) 2015-2026, approved by the Minister of the Interior in April 2015 together   with a three year Plan of Action. The Ministry of the Interior (MoI) was divided into two new   Ministries on 1 May 2017, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and the Ministry of Transport and   Local Government (MoTLG). Since then MoTLG has been the designated coordinating body   with a mandate to work towards the revision and the implementation of the National Cyber   Security Strategy and the Action Plan and has started consulting across public and private   sectors, and with civil society. The NCSS called for the appointment of a special Cyber Security   Council (CSC) for government and public sector representatives and a Cyber Security Forum   with representatives from private sectors in addition to the representatives in the CSC, in   order to address collaboration on cybersecurity topics related to the implementation of the   NCSS in Iceland.    Iceland’s incident response capacity is at a formative to established stage of maturity. CERT-  IS – Iceland’s national CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team) – has been   established with specified roles and responsibilities with emphasis on the electronic   communications market. In particular CERT-IS has the role of national point-of-contact, but   does not at this time handle the Government CERT role. However, negotiations regarding this   role are underway. CERT-IS has developed incident response processes, but these are and will   not be publicly available. However, an incident response plan for Critical Information   Infrastructure (CII) incidents has been published and distributed to members of the   telecommunications sector. An overall central registry of national-level cybersecurity   incidents is not yet operational. CERT-IS records incidents of all levels of severity that are   reported to the group, but handling is prioritized by constituency, severity and impact. The   registry of incidents is, however, not as of yet publicly accessible in any way. The National   Commissioner of the Icelandic Police (NCIP) and CERT-IS aim to cooperate on creating a   classification of national level incidents.   The members of CERT-IS receive training in an ad-hoc manner. Moreover, CERT-IS   collaborates with Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) through   the Nordic National CERT Collaboration (NCC). A Nordic cybersecurity exercise took place in   2015 and assessed the quality of the incident response processes, procedures, interactions,   and information-sharing mechanisms that exist under the NCC Agreement. Additionally,   CERT-IS has good relations with the financial sector and aims to cooperate with a new   collaborative forum, the Nordic Financial CERT.   The protection of critical infrastructure (CI) considerations are at a formative stage of   maturity. A list of general CI assets has been created. The National Commissioner of the   Icelandic Police (NCIP) is responsible for identifying these assets. However, the CI asset audit   list is not disseminated to relevant stakeholders. Currently there is informal and ad-hoc threat   and vulnerability disclosure among CI owners as well as between CI and the government, but   the scope of reporting requirements has not been specified. CI owners have some capacity          7 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     to detect, identify, respond to and recover from cyber threats, but such capabilities are   uncoordinated and vary in quality.   No official national risk assessment plan has been developed as yet. The Civil Protection Act2   is the official framework for all crisis situations, including cyber-incident or cyberattack.   Simulations and training exercises have been conducted in order to better prepare for a   cyber-crisis situation, however these exercises are not coordinated at the national level, with   the active participation of all relevant stakeholders in all sectors.   Iceland’s cyber defence considerations are at a start-up stage of maturity. Iceland’s Cyber   defence is mainly being considered in terms of national cyber resilience and the country is   prioritising the protection of national CI assets as a priority action of the NCSS. Beyond that it   is also part of Iceland’s defence planning. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs is the central   authority for defence and in charge of implementation of the Defence Act No 34/2008, due   to the absence of a dedicated Ministry of Defence. In accordance with a Memorandum of   Understanding (MoU) between the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Interior -   now Ministry of Justice, and due to the lack of a standing army, the Icelandic Coast Guard   from July 2014 (ICG) is responsible for operational defence activities related to NATO   including NATO Iceland Air Defence System, CRC, Host Nations Support and operation of the   Keflavik Air Base. The Iceland Crisis Response Unit (ICRU) has been a separate entity within   the MFA since 2001. Its main role is to contribute to multilateral organisations and to provide   secondments of civilian experts to the field. Iceland has established contacts with the NATO   Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (NATO CCDCOE) while material and   resources prepared by the Centre, especially the Tallinn Manual, have already been utilised.   In 2018, Norway will host NATO's high-visibility exercise Trident Juncture in which Iceland   participates, as the defence of Iceland is an integral part of the exercise.   In the event of a communications disruption, mechanisms are in place to maintain the   operational functionality of the national emergency communications network. Current   emergency response assets have been identified. Within both the public and the private   sectors, TETRA Systems for Mission Critical Communications are deployed. Furthermore, fibre   optic lines and nodes are shared with the public network. The finance sector also conducts   crisis response simulations regularly and emergency drills are tested frequently.   Culture and Society   During consultations, the national capacity regarding cybersecurity culture and society ranges   from formative to established stages. The government has recognised the need to prioritise   cybersecurity across its institutions, and the risks and threats in cybersecurity have influenced   the processes and structures across government institutions but in particular leading   agencies. Leading firms within the private sector have begun to place priority on a   cybersecurity mind-set by identifying high-risk practices. Among society-at-large, a growing                                                               2 https://www.althingi.is/lagas/nuna/2008082.html (in Icelandic)  https://www.government.is/publications/legislation/lex/2017/12/21/Civil-Protection-Act-No.-82-2008/   (English translation)   https://www.althingi.is/lagas/nuna/2008082.html https://www.government.is/publications/legislation/lex/2017/12/21/Civil-Protection-Act-No.-82-2008/        8 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     number of users feel it is a priority for them to employ good cybersecurity practices. However,   cultural aspects and the general level of trust, which is ingrained in the Icelandic culture, has   inhibited users from thinking about privacy online and considering protection of their   information online as their own personal responsibility.    Overall, the participating stakeholders accepted that most Internet users in Iceland trust in   the security of the Internet, but this often approaches a “blind” trust that can place individuals   and society at risk. However, strong trust has enabled the establishment of e-government   services in Iceland. The Government continues to increase e-service provision and tax   declarations are already being submitted electronically. In addition, e-commerce services are   fully established by multiple stakeholders in a relatively secure environment.    Users and stakeholders within the public and private sectors have general knowledge about   how personal information is handled online but (proactive) cybersecurity practices are often   not used, either due to perceived inconvenience, or to the way people weigh up the trade-  offs in service and protection of their personal information. Act No. 77/2000 on Privacy as   regards to the Processing of Personal Data has been in force since 2000 and implements the   provisions of Directive 95/46/EC. On grounds of Art. 11 and 12 of the Data Protection Act the   Icelandic Data Protection Authority (DPA) has set forth Rules No. 299/2001 on the Security of   Personal Data. Iceland is also in the process of implementing the EU General Data Protection   Regulation (GDPR).    In Iceland, the public and private sectors provide some channels for reporting child abuse   online, but these channels are not coordinated and are used in an ad-hoc manner. A hotline   through Barnaheill - Save the Children Iceland - focuses on child abuse. Also, the Icelandic Red   Cross runs the 1717 Helpline. Any incident, also cyber-related, can be reported via the police   emergency number 112, while incidents such as child abuse are also referred to Europol and   Interpol. Participants noted that communication links have not been established between the   police and the private sector and CERT-IS lacks the resources to take up this role. Moreover,   there is ad-hoc media coverage of cybersecurity, with limited information provided and   limited reporting on specific issues that individuals face online, such as cyber-bullying. Also,   discussions on social media about cybersecurity are not prominent.    Education, Training and Skills   Observations made during the consultations show that cybersecurity education, training and   skills capacity in Iceland ranges from a formative to an established stage of maturity.   Awareness-raising programmes, courses, seminars and online resources are available for   target demographics from public, private, academia, and civil society sources. However, no   national programme for cybersecurity awareness-raising, led by a designated organisation is   currently established. The National Cybersecurity Strategy recognises the enhancement of   general awareness of cybersecurity issues and this is one of the measures towards the   implementation of the nation’s Strategy. Executives are aware of general cybersecurity   issues, but not necessarily aware of how these issues and threats might affect their particular   organisation. Executives of some particular sectors, such as finance, telecommunications,   Internet providers and cloud operators are aware of cybersecurity risks, and how their          9 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     organisation deals with cybersecurity issues, but not of the broader strategic implications for   government and society. However, apart from those in the financial sector there are no   mandatory training courses or programmes.    In higher education, some courses exist in cybersecurity-related fields, such as information   security, network security and cryptography, but cybersecurity-specific courses are not yet   offered in Iceland. Some universities offer programmes in computer science and computer   engineering at an undergraduate and postgraduate level with cybersecurity often being a   module within these curricula.    The CSC has now established an informal agreement with the Department of Information   Security and Communication Technology at NTNU, Norwegian University of Science and   Technology, which is one of the most advanced in the field of information security in the   Nordic countries. A part of this plan is to develop closer ties with UoI and RU, e.g. concerning   graduate and undergraduate courses and also concerning events that can help to stimulate   interest in cybersecurity and provide interesting challenges for students.   Research and development is an important consideration in education. The MoESC and the   Ministry of Industries and Innovation (MoII) have the main responsibility for running the   research and innovation scheme. However, it was not possible to identify whether specific   programmes and research funds on cybersecurity or related fields are running currently.    At the national level, the need for training professionals in cybersecurity in Iceland has been   documented. ICT professional certification with some security modules or components is   available. Review participants mentioned that currently the Estonian Technology Fund, a   state-run public institution that invests into young and growth-oriented technology   companies, is dedicated to the provision of online courses because overall there is not enough   expertise among educators to provide training in cybersecurity. Executive training courses for   CEOs or chief financial executives are offered on an ad-hoc basis, including topics such as   good governance practices related to cybersecurity and risk management.    Legal and regulatory frameworks   The legal and regulatory frameworks in Iceland range between formative and established   stages of maturity. Iceland has implemented provisions relevant to cybersecurity   comprehensively in its ICT legislative and regulatory frameworks. The Regulatory Framework   of the European Union – through the country’s EEA membership – applies in Iceland and has   shaped many regulations and existing legislation to protect the rights of individuals and   organisations in the digital environment. The Electronic Communications Act (ECA) No.   81/2003, the Act on the Post and Telecom Administration (APTA) No. 69/2003, and its   Amendment No. 62/2012 stipulate certain provisions regarding cybersecurity and critical   information infrastructure. Additionally, the Icelandic Media Law requires providers to ensure   that the transmission of service via electronic communications networks is secure (Article 45).   Act No. 30/2002 on Electronic Commerce and other Electronic Services stipulates the liability   of ISPs and establishes a system of takedown notices in certain cases for IP addresses or other          10 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     online content that violates the law, in accordance with the Directive 2000/31/EC of the   European Parliament.    Data protection legislation in Iceland has been implemented with the adoption of Act No.   77/2000 on the Protection of Privacy as regards the Processing of Personal Data (“Data   Protection Act”) which implements Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the   Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of   personal data and on the free movement of such data. It includes general conditions for the   collection of personal data and protection from misuse, and it promotes a practice of personal   data processing in accordance with fundamental principles and rules regarding data   protection and privacy.    Icelandic law recognizes fundamental human rights on the Internet, including privacy online,   freedom of speech, freedom of information, and freedom of assembly and association. The   country has also ratified or acceded to several international agreements, such as the UN   Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights   and Fundamental Freedoms of the Council of Europe, the Convention No. 108 for the   Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data and those of   the International Labour Organization and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in   Europe.    Comprehensive legislation on the protection of children has been adopted and enforced   according to Iceland’s Child Protection Act, No. 80/2002. Iceland has ratified the UN   Convention on the Rights of the Child and other relevant international conventions.    Substantive cybercrime legal provisions are contained in the general criminal law. In 2007 the   country ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, also known as the   ‘Budapest Convention’, whose recommendations are consistently implemented into   domestic law. The General Penal Code No. 19 contains substantive cybercrime legal provision   since its amendment in 2014. The government is working towards the implementation of the   NIS Directive and the GDPR in 2018, therefore it is expected that existing gaps in legal and   regulatory frameworks will be fulfilled.    Across the criminal justice system, capacities are at initial stages of development in Iceland.   The police, headed by the National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police (NCIP), has only   limited digital-forensics capacity and cases are investigated by the digital forensics unit of the   Reykjavik Metropolitan Police. Two policemen in the Metropolitan Police are specifically   assigned to investigate sexual violence against children on the internet. The country needs   more skilled personnel as well as the procedural and technological resources to conduct   investigations in a comprehensive way. Training for law-enforcement officers on cybercrime   and digital evidence is ad-hoc or not specialised.    Formal mechanisms of international cooperation have been established in order to prevent   and combat cybercrime. Iceland has established agreements with Interpol and Europol as   well as agreements with neighbouring countries on cross-border information sharing.   Moreover, informal relationships between government and criminal justice as well as   between ISPs and law enforcement exist with clear communication channels resulting in the   regular exchange of information on cybercrime cases. Some specialised cybercrime          11 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     prosecutors have the capacity to build cases on electronic evidence, but this capacity is   limited as training is largely ad-hoc, not institutionalised and informal.    According to participants, Iceland has fully acknowledged the need for formal and informal   cooperation and has established mechanisms for international cooperation in order to   prevent and combat cybercrime by facilitating its detection, investigation, and prosecution   through established communication channels. The country cooperates with Interpol and   Europol and other nations (e.g. Norway and the US) regarding cross-border information   sharing and has signed Mutual Legal Assistance agreements which are successfully applied.    Standards, Organisations and Technologies   Iceland’s capacity in cybersecurity standards, organisations and technologies was identified   as ranging from start-up to established stages. The government and the private sector have   adopted ICT security, procurement and software development standards and good practices,   such as ISO. However, compliance to these standards is not mandatory. Iceland achieves   leading scores in technological readiness and Internet access and broadband penetration is   one of the highest internationally. Internet is used for e-commerce transactions. However,   authentication processes are often weak, e.g. many websites only require simple   authentication. There are legal requirements for operational security in articles 11-13 of the   Data Protection Act and Rules No 299/2001; however, in a very broad sense. According to   participants, telecommunication companies and other CNI have their own internal standards.    Software quality is a matter of concern. Priority is mostly given to the quality and   performance of software. Additionally, monitoring and quality assessment is conducted in an   ad-hoc manner only in few private institutions, so there is no evidence of the extent of   software quality deficiencies.    All sectors in Iceland deploy up-to-date technical security controls, including patching and   backups, but to very different levels. Companies have internal policies for updates and   automated software updates are becoming more common. Cryptographic controls deployed   meet international standards and guidelines exist for each sector accordingly. Although some   state-of-the-art tools, such as SSL or TLS, are deployed routinely by web service providers to   secure all communications between servers and web browsers, and  EU legislation relating to   data protection and e-signatures has been implemented (Directive 1999/93/EC of the   European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 1999 on a Community framework   for electronic signatures) - or is being implemented respectively (GDPR) - participants pointed   out a lack of understanding amongst the general public about the deployment of such   controls. The implementation of the GDPR could provide more general understanding to the   general public.    The domestic market in Iceland is small and only provides some specialised cybersecurity   products, which are not demand-driven. Most organisations rely on products from   international companies. Local suppliers of software and services such as penetration testing   and auditing do consider cybersecurity. Cyber-insurance is offered by a domestic insurer who          12 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     resells international products, but uptake is limited as the terms are often not suitable for   local companies.    No vulnerability-disclosure framework is in place. Stakeholders mainly share technical details   of vulnerabilities informally with other stakeholders, who can distribute the information   more broadly; but this is not common. Currently, organisations have established their own   processes and mechanisms to receive, disseminate and share information on vulnerabilities,   and only some organisations are obliged to report to CERT-IS.   Additional Reflections   This was the 18th country review supported directly by the Global Cyber Security Capacity   Centre at Oxford. It was intended to assist the Government of the Republic of Iceland to gain   insights into the breadth and depth of the country’s cybersecurity capacity. Iceland has   commenced the process of developing different aspects of cybersecurity capacity across all   dimensions, including through revising the National Cybersecurity Strategy and revisiting   legal frameworks and regulation. The review suggests a number of specific steps by which   Iceland’s cybersecurity capacity might achieve greater levels of maturity.          13 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     INTRODUCTION   The Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre (GCSCC, or ‘the Capacity Centre’) has undertaken   a review of the maturity of the cybersecurity capacity of the Republic of Iceland, hosted by   the Ministry of Transport and Local Government. The objective of this review is to enable the   government of Iceland to reassess its cybersecurity capacity in order to prioritise strategic   investment in national cybersecurity.   Over the period 21–23 June 2017, stakeholders from the following departments of   government, organisations and functional sectors participated in a three-day consultation   with GCSCC staff to review Iceland’s cybersecurity capacity:    • Public Sector Entities:    - Ministry of Transport and Local Government  - National Cybersecurity and Telecommunications Service under the Ministry   of Transport and Local Government  - Ministry of Agriculture  - Ministry of Communications  - Ministry of Education, Science and Culture   - Ministry of Energy  - Ministry of Environment / National Weather Service  - Ministry of Finance  - Ministry of Health  - Ministry of Justice  - Ministry for Foreign Affairs  - Ministry of Industries and Innovation  - Data Protection Authority   • Directorate of Health, Post and Telecommunications Administration  • Landspítali - National Hospital of Iceland   • Legislators/Policy owners/Public Prosecution  • CERT-IS  • Icelandic Coast Guard  • Finance sector  • Academia  • Private sector   • Internet registries              14 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     DIMENSIONS OF CYBERSECURITY CAPACITY   Consultations were premised on the GCSCC Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model3 for   Nations (CMM) which is composed of five distinct dimensions of cybersecurity capacity.  Each   dimension consists of a set of factors, which describe and define what it means to possess   cybersecurity capacity therein. Table I below shows the five dimensions with their comprising   factors:                                                               3 See Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model for Nations (CMM), Revised Edition, available at  https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/cybersecurity-capacity/content/cmm-revised-edition   DIMENSIONS FACTORS   Dimension 1: Cybersecurity   Policy and Strategy   D1.1 National  Cybersecurity Strategy   D1.2 Incident Response   D1.3 Critical Infrastructure (CI) Protection   D1.4 Crisis Management   D1.5 Cyber Defence Consideration   D1.6 Communications Redundancy   Dimension 2: Cyber Culture   and Society   D2.1 Cybersecurity Mind-set   D2.2 Trust and Confidence on the Internet   D2.3 User Understanding of Personal Information Protection Online   D2.4 Reporting Mechanisms   D2.5 Media and Social Media   Dimension 3: Cybersecurity   Education, Training and   Skills   D3.1 Awareness-raising   D3.2 Framework for Education   D3.3 Framework for Professional Training   Dimension 4: Legal and   Regulatory Frameworks   D4.1 Legal Frameworks   D4.2 Criminal Justice System   D4.3 Formal and Informal Cooperation Frameworks to Combat   Cybercrime   Dimension 5: Standards,   Organisations and   Technologies   D5.1 Adherence to Standards   D5.2 Internet Infrastructure Resilience   D5.3 Software Quality Protection   D5.4 Technical Security Controls   D5.5 Cryptographic Controls   D5.6 Cybersecurity Marketplace   D5.7 Responsible Disclosure   https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/cybersecurity-capacity/content/cmm-revised-edition        15 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017        STAGES OF CYBERSECURITY CAPACITY MATURITY   Factors are further subdivided into aspects and for each aspect there are indicators, setting   out those conditions that define the level of maturity achieved in any given aspect. There are   five stages of maturity, discussed below. The maturity scale ranges from the start-up stage,   implying an elementary and ad-hoc approach to capacity, to the dynamic stage where a   strategic approach has been articulated and where the relevant agencies and organisations   have developed the ability to respond and adapt as environmental considerations demand.   The five stages are as follows:   • Start-up: At this stage either no cybersecurity maturity exists, or it is very embryonic   in nature. There might be initial discussions about cybersecurity capacity building,   but no concrete actions have been taken. There is an absence of observable evidence   of cybersecurity capacity at this stage.   • Formative: Some aspects have begun to grow and be formulated, but may be ad-hoc,   disorganized, poorly defined – or simply new. However, evidence of this aspect can   be clearly demonstrated.   • Established: The indicators of the aspect are in place, and functioning. However,   there is not well thought-out consideration of the relative allocation of resources.   Little trade-off decision-making has been made concerning the relative investment in   this aspect. But the aspect is functional and defined.   • Strategic: At this stage choices have been made about which indicators of this aspect   are important, and which are less important for the particular organisation or state.   The strategic stage reflects the fact that these choices have been made, conditional   upon the state’s or organisation's particular circumstances.   • Dynamic: At this stage, there are clear mechanisms in place to alter strategy   depending on the prevailing circumstances such as the technological sophistication   of the threat environment, global conflict or a significant change in one area of   concern (e.g. cybercrime or privacy). Dynamic organisations have developed   methods for changing strategies in stride. Rapid decision-making, reallocation of   resources, and constant attention to the changing environment are features of this   stage.          16 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     CYBERSECURITY CONTEXT  IN ICELAND   Iceland has one of the highest take-ups of internet access in the world, with an Internet   penetration rate of 98 percent in 20154. This is the highest proportion of Internet users of all   European countries; the average household internet penetration rate within the European   Union was 81 percent in 20145. With near ubiquitous access, Icelanders are frequent Internet   users, with 95 percent of users connecting to the internet daily or almost daily, and 99 percent   of users connecting every week in 20146. Iceland also has one of the highest index rates of   internet and social media usage (6.8) in the world, according to the World Economic Forum7.   Specifically, 84 percent of the population use social networks, 95 percent read news online,   95 percent send or receive emails, 36 percent store electronic content online, and 66 percent   use internet commerce8.    Iceland is promoting free speech, while Internet and digital media play a vital role in Icelandic   society. In 2010, the Icelandic parliament adopted a resolution Nr. 23/138 suggesting that   Iceland should take a lead in protection of free speech and freedom of expression9, but it has   had limited follow-up. There was no change in the Internet freedom environment in 2016.   The annual statistics database on telecommunication use in the Nordic and Baltic countries   (2016)10  show that Iceland is the only country where most of the fixed broadband connections   are still via DSL technology. Something that will change until 2020 with the closing down of   the PSTN network. During the GCSCC review, participants often referred to regulations, laws,   activities, processes etc. which are either mandatory or recommended as a consequence of   Iceland’s membership of the European Economic Area (EEA), NATO and other organisations   such as Interpol. As an EEA member state, Iceland is also part of the Digital Single Market   strategy, the goal of which is both to develop the European Data Economy and to promote   online platforms, protecting Europe's assets by tackling cybersecurity challenges11. This   initiative includes the planned review of the EU Cybersecurity Strategy in September 2017 as   well as additional measures addressing cybersecurity standards, certification and labelling to   make connected users more cyber secure. These developments may have an impact on the   action plan for the Icelandic National Cybersecurity Strategy.                                                                4 Freedom House: Freedom on the Net 2016. https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2016/iceland   5 International Telecommunication Union, “Percentage of individuals using the internet,” 2015, 2013 & 2008,  http://bit.ly/1cblxxY   6 Statistics Iceland, “Statistical Yearbook of Iceland 2015,” http://bit.ly/1QUsztW   7 World Economic Forum, The Global Information Technology Report 2015, bit.ly/1yutYRc   8 Statistics Iceland, “Statistical Yearbook of Iceland 2015,” http://bit.ly/1QUsztW   9 Þingsályktun um að Ísland skapi sér afgerandi lagalega sérstöðu varðandi vernd tjáningar og upplýsingafrelsis.  http://www.althingi.is/altext/138/s/1392.html   10 https://www.pfs.is/english/about-pta/news/news/2017/06/22/Nordic-and-Baltic-statistics-on- telecommunication-use-in-2016-Fast-increase-in-data-use-over-mobile/     11 http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1232_en.htm    https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2016/iceland http://bit.ly/1cblxxY http://bit.ly/1QUsztW http://bit.ly/1QUsztW http://www.althingi.is/altext/138/s/1392.html https://www.pfs.is/english/about-pta/news/news/2017/06/22/Nordic-and-Baltic-statistics-on-telecommunication-use-in-2016-Fast-increase-in-data-use-over-mobile/ https://www.pfs.is/english/about-pta/news/news/2017/06/22/Nordic-and-Baltic-statistics-on-telecommunication-use-in-2016-Fast-increase-in-data-use-over-mobile/ http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1232_en.htm        17 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     REVIEW REPORT   OVERVIEW   This section provides an overall representation of cybersecurity capacity in Iceland. The   graphic (Figure 1) shows the maturity estimates made in each dimension. The concentric   gridlines radiating from the centre of the graphic correspond to the five-stage maturity scale,   with ‘start-up’ the closest to the centre and ‘dynamic’ the furthest. The stages of maturity for   each factor extend out from the middle as an individual bar, and each colour-coded   dimension covers one fifth of the graphic.       Figure 1: Overall representation of the cybersecurity capacity in the Republic of Iceland          18 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     DIMENSION 1  CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY  AND POLICY   Dimension 1 gauges the Icelandic capacity to develop and deliver cybersecurity policy and   strategy and to enhance cybersecurity resilience through improvements in incident response,   crisis management, redundancy, and critical infrastructure protection capacity. The   Cybersecurity Policy and Strategy dimension also includes consideration of early warning,   deterrence, defence and recovery. This dimension assesses the effectiveness of policy in   advancing national cyber defence and resilience capacity, while facilitating the access to   cyberspace increasingly vital for government, international business and society in general.   D1.1 NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY   Maturity Stage: Established   With the approval of the Ministry of the Interior (MoI), the Republic of Iceland’s National   Cybersecurity Strategy (NCSS) 2015-2026 was published in April 201512   together with a three   year Plan of Action. A task force on cyber security had been set up in 2013 to provide   recommendations and formulate the Strategy. Strategies of other Nordic and European   countries were also examined alongside discussions with overseas peers.   The task force also discussed the threats and opportunities that have been identified and the   experience gained from the plans of action already been put into practice in other Nordic and   European countries.                                                                12 https://www.government.is/media/innanrikisraduneyti-media/media/frettir- 2015/Icelandic_National_Cyber_Security_Summary_loka.pdf    Cybersecurity strategy is essential to the coordination and direction of the government’s  cybersecurity agenda. A cybersecurity strategy makes it possible to prioritise cybersecurity  as a critically important policy area, determines responsibilities and mandates of key  cybersecurity government and non-governmental actors, and directs necessary and  appropriate allocation of resources to emerging and existing cybersecurity issues and  priorities.      https://www.government.is/media/innanrikisraduneyti-media/media/frettir-2015/Icelandic_National_Cyber_Security_Summary_loka.pdf https://www.government.is/media/innanrikisraduneyti-media/media/frettir-2015/Icelandic_National_Cyber_Security_Summary_loka.pdf        19 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     Multi-stakeholder consultation processes have been followed and observations fed back to   the identified strategy owners. A well-attended consultative meeting with stakeholders was   held in 2014 including about representatives of some 60 institutions and enterprises.    The NCSS called for the appointment of a special Cyber Security Council (CSC) for government   and public sector representatives and a Cyber Security Forum with representatives from   private sectors in addition to the representatives in the CSC. The CSC takes responsibility for   implementing the strategy while the Cyber Security Forum is charged with coordinating   projects involving public and private stakeholders and creating the basis for collaboration on   cybersecurity topics. The CSC will coordinate measures, particularly those involving   government bodies. It will review the action plan at least once a year and make proposals on   the prioritisation and funding of measures taken. The CSC is according to the NCSS to submit   a report to the MoI every year on the implementation of the strategy.    The MoI was divided into two new ministries on 1 May 2017, the Ministry of Justice and the   Ministry of Transport and Local Government (MoTLG)13. Since then the Ministry of Transport   and Local Government (MoTLG) has been the designated coordinating body with a mandate   to work towards the revision and the implementation of the National Cyber Security Strategy   and the Action Plan and has started to consult across public and private sectors, and with civil   society. The scope of responsibility of the MoTLG is as follows: air, land, and sea transport;   electronic communications; information society issues; local government issues; regional   development issues; and matters relating to Registers Iceland.   A review process (every 3-4 years) is implemented under the auspices of the Action Plan 2015-  2018 to allow for new or revised measures, including for short periods of time.    The content of the NCSS is linked explicitly and directly to national assessments of risks,   priorities and objectives, as well as business development. Direct and indirect links exist to   many other official strategies and resolutions, e.g. the national strategy on civil protection   public security, law enforcement and telecommunications; the strategy on national security;   and the Icelandic State and Municipal Policy on the Information Society 2013-2016: “e-Power   Expansion: - create, connect, participate“.    The NCSS addresses the need to protect critical infrastructure as well as respond to growing   cybersecurity threats. It outlines Iceland’s cybersecurity vision out to 2026 and stipulates four   main objectives: 1) increased capacity to prevent and respond to cybersecurity threats; 2)   increased resilience; 3) improved legislation in line with international commitments; and 4)   reliable law enforcement as regards cybersecurity.    The strategy covers all use of the Internet and Information Technology. The aims of the   strategy are as follows: a) to enhance the security of individuals and groups in society by   increasing cyber security; b) to promote the integrated functioning of important elements of   the infrastructure of society by increasing the resilience of information systems to cope with   hazards; and c) to establish closer collaboration and coordination on cybersecurity between   Icelandic and international authorities.                                                                13 https://www.government.is/news/article/2017/05/01/Two-new-ministries-commence-operation/     https://www.government.is/news/article/2017/05/01/Two-new-ministries-commence-operation/        20 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     As mentioned above, the strategy is intended to form the basis of collaboration and   development in cybersecurity. The strategy itself will not amend the responsibilities and   duties of those involved in cybersecurity even though proposals may be made for measures   that may involve changes in these areas.   D1.2 INCIDENT RESPONSE   Maturity Stage: Formative to Established   A National CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team), CERT-IS14 has been   established with specified roles and responsibilities. CERT-IS has, according to law, the   telecommunication sector as its primary constituency which includes certain critical   information infrastructure (CII) entities. Other CII entities may sign contracts with CERT-IS.   Other entities, outside the primary constituency, are served on best-effort terms.   The role of CERT-IS is to analyse cybersecurity threats and to give assistance to its primary   constituency members using both proactive and reactive measures to prevent cybersecurity   incidents and to minimize their impact. CERT-IS gives advice regarding threats and responses   to its primary constituency members and publishes public warnings when needed.   According to the participants, each sector is responsible for handling conventional   emergencies and preparing accordingly. The approach taken for cybersecurity is similar and   an agreement with the national CERT-IS15 has been made that cyber emergencies with   national significance will be prioritised.   In the event of a cyber crisis the role of CERT-IS is to coordinate responses. As a National   CSIRT, CERT-IS is the national point of contact in Iceland. The legal provisions for CERT-IS are   stated in the Telecommunication Act no. 81/200316, art. 47a and regulation no. 475/201317   (see also D4.1).   No Government CERT exists yet. CERT-IS acts as a national CERT and in particular has the role   of national point-of-contact, but does not at this time handle the Government CERT role.   However, negotiations regarding this role are underway.                                                               14 https://www.cert.is/en/node/2.html   15 https://www.cert.is/en/node/2.html   16 http://www.althingi.is/lagas/nuna/2003081.html#G47A     17 https://www.stjornartidindi.is/Advert.aspx?ID=f5282f2a-6827-4d98-9fc2-0afd611243d6    This factor addresses the capacity of the government to identify and determine characteristics   of national level incidents in a systematic way. It also reviews the government’s capacity to   organise, coordinate, and operationalize incident response.   https://www.cert.is/en/node/2.html https://www.cert.is/en/node/2.html http://www.althingi.is/lagas/nuna/2003081.html#G47A https://www.stjornartidindi.is/Advert.aspx?ID=f5282f2a-6827-4d98-9fc2-0afd611243d6        21 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     CERT-IS has developed incident response processes, but these are and will not be publicly   available. However, an incident response plan for CI incident has been published and   distributed to members of the telecommunications sector. Moreover, some participants   referred to the lack of a catalogue of services provided by CERT-IS, but the position of CERT-  IS as national CERT is that it should not provide a catalogue of services but a role defined by   law.  Defining the role of CERT-IS more precisely was a key element in ongoing service   contract negotiations during the summer of 2017. Leads for incident response have been   designated at the operational level, but national-level coordination has not yet been   established. Distinct and formal security roles and responsibilities are not yet allocated across   government, critical infrastructure, enterprise, and individual systems.   An overall central registry of national-level cybersecurity incidents is not yet operational.   CERT-IS records incidents of all levels of severity that are reported to the group, but handling   is prioritized by constituency, severity and impact. The registry of incidents is, however, not   as of yet publicly accessible in any way. The National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police   (NCIP) and CERT-IS are currently discussing an official classification scheme for CI incidents.   Participants informed us that through the implementation of the EU NIS Directive, official   classification will take place of national level incidents which expose vulnerabilities of national   critical assets. The NCIP and CERT-IS aim to cooperate on creating a classification of national   level incidents.   CERT-IS employees that work on incident handling and analysis receive mostly training in an   ad-hoc manner, but baseline training requirements have been established. Budget restraints   do limit the availability of training, but CERT-IS does take advantage of lower cost training   opportunities that present themselves, for instance trough the Nordic National CERT   Collaboration (NCC)18. Review participants indicated that human and financial resources   allocated to incident response are not adequate to the cybersecurity threat environment and   that incident response is still more reactive than anticipatory.   CERT-IS is not a member of FIRST yet, but preparation for FIRST and Trusted Introducer   memberships is on the roadmap for 2018.  Currently the service of CERT-IS is limited to the   telecommunications sector but service contracts are being negotiated with the energy sector   and planned with other sectors. In particular, CERT-IS has good relations with the financial   sector and aims to cooperate with the planned Nordic Financial CERT.   Representatives from the finance sector indicated that an information-sharing platform   (currently functioning by email) already exists for incidents-events experienced by banks.   There was general agreement among different sector participants that the involvement of   CERT-IS in this process would advance its capacity.  CERT-IS notes that all opportunities for   cooperation and information sharing are welcomed and one project in cooperation with a   financial institution is currently under way.   Moreover, CERT-IS collaborates with the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland,   Norway and Sweden) through the NCC cooperation. This includes technical cooperation and   cybersecurity exercises to assess and strengthen cyber preparedness, examine incident   response processes and enhance information sharing in the region. A Nordic cybersecurity                                                               18 https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-d/opb/str/D-STR-GCI.01-2017-R1-PDF-E.pdf    https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-d/opb/str/D-STR-GCI.01-2017-R1-PDF-E.pdf        22 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     exercise took place in 2015 and assessed the quality of the incident response processes,   procedures, interactions, and information-sharing mechanisms that exist under the NCC   Agreement.   The Data Protection Act as it is today does not require reporting of security breaches but the   DPA still receives a few informal reports every year. Most knowledge of incidents concerning   personal data is gathered through the media and individuals that are affected by such   incidents.   Under the NCSS, the reporting of cybersecurity incidents is to be made obligatory as it is   considered to be crucial for organisations that suffer a cyberattack. Review participants   stated that the EU NIS Directive and the GDPR implementation will lead to the formalisation   of a mechanism for incident reporting.   D1.3 CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE (CI) PROTECTION   Maturity Stage: Formative   The protection of critical infrastructure from cyber-threats is a priority for the Icelandic   authorities. The National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCSS) aims to promote the integrated   functioning of important elements of the infrastructure of society by increasing the resilience   of cyber systems to cope with hazards.   The Parliamentary Resolution on a National Security Policy for Iceland (no. 26/145)19 speaks   to Iceland’s independence and sovereignty, territorial integrity, the safety of its citizens, and   the protection of its governmental system and social infrastructure.   A list of general critical infrastructure (CI) assets has been created20. The National   Commissioner of the Icelandic Police (NCIP) is responsible for identifying these assets. In the   course of the CMM review it was mentioned that NCIP is currently in the process of   developing a list of Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) assets as part of preparing the NIS   Directive implementation.                                                               19 https://www.government.is/media/utanrikisraduneyti-media/media/Varnarmal/National-Security-Policy- ENS.pdf   20 This has e.g. been published in the National Civil Protection Strategy (in Icelandic):  https://www.stjornarradid.is/media/forsaetisraduneyti-media/media/frettir2/stefna-i-almannavarna-og- oryggismalum2015-2017.pdf    This factor studies the government’s capacity to identify Critical Infrastructure (CI) and Critical   Information Infrastructure (CII) assets and the risks associated with them, to engage in   response planning and critical assets protection, to facilitate quality interaction with CI asset   owners, and to enable comprehensive general risk management practice including response   planning.   https://www.government.is/media/utanrikisraduneyti-media/media/Varnarmal/National-Security-Policy-ENS.pdf https://www.government.is/media/utanrikisraduneyti-media/media/Varnarmal/National-Security-Policy-ENS.pdf https://www.stjornarradid.is/media/forsaetisraduneyti-media/media/frettir2/stefna-i-almannavarna-og-oryggismalum2015-2017.pdf https://www.stjornarradid.is/media/forsaetisraduneyti-media/media/frettir2/stefna-i-almannavarna-og-oryggismalum2015-2017.pdf        23 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     However, the CI asset audit lists is not disseminated to relevant stakeholders. Consequently,   participants observed that formal internal and external CI communication strategies should   be defined across sectors, with clear points of contact.   The scope of services by CERT-IS has been limited to the telecommunications sector, but it is   currently being expanded to include other CI sectors as well. Currently, there is informal and   ad hoc threat and vulnerability disclosure among CI owners as well as between CI and the   government, but the scope of reporting requirements has not been specified. CERT-IS has not   yet had the opportunity to coordinate information sharing between CI owners due to the lack   of service contracts that limit the size and scope of its constituency. However, within the   finance sector a specific timeframe for disclosure of incidents has been defined (as soon as   possible but no later than 24h) (see D5.7).    Participants mentioned the Global Influenza Preparedness Plan21 as an example of how the   country could prepare for the organisation and coordination of responses to cyber incidents.   CI owners have the capacity to detect, identify, respond to and recover from cyber threats,   but such capabilities are uncoordinated and vary in quality. Protection of CI assets includes   basic level cybersecurity awareness and data security policies, but no protection processes   have been agreed. Representatives from the finance sector mentioned that they have their   own plans in the case of national level crisis. In addition, the Financial Supervisory Authority   (FSA)22 aims to safeguard the integrity and sound operation of the financial market and   conducts periodic examinations of the operation of the stock exchanges23.   The NCIP has developed a general response plan for responding to emergencies and it also   has provisions for reacting to cyber-induced national level emergencies. CERT-IS has also   developed an emergency plan for the telecommunication sector, which scope is at the   present time mostly limited to defining the channels of communications and management   process during a cyber crisis.                                                                21http://www.landlaeknir.is/servlet/file/store93/item19632/Pandemic%20Influenza%20Preparedness%20Plan  _March.06_.pdf    22 https://en.fme.is    23 https://en.fme.is/media/utgefid-efni/FME-arsskyrsla-2016-ENSKA-29072016.pdf    https://en.fme.is/ https://en.fme.is/media/utgefid-efni/FME-arsskyrsla-2016-ENSKA-29072016.pdf        24 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     D1.4 CRISIS MANAGEMENT   Maturity Stage: Formative   A preliminary cybersecurity needs assessment of measures and techniques that require   testing has been undertaken. CERT-IS has conducted limited scope exercises for the   telecommunications sector and such exercises are planned every other year. Key   stakeholders and other subject matter experts, such as think tanks, academics, civil leaders   and consultants are included in the planning process.    No official national risk assessment plan has been developed as yet. The Civil Protection Act24   is the official framework for all crisis situations, including cyber-incidents and cyberattacks.   Simulations and training exercises have been conducted in order to better prepare for a   cyber-crisis situation, however these are not nationally coordinated exercises involving   relevant stakeholders in all sectors.   CERT-IS plans to conduct exercises for each constituency sector every two years and exercises   have already been conducted with the telecommunications sector. CERT-IS participates along   with the constituency sectors in larger international exercises, such as the ones held by ENISA,   and the Norwegian ‘BlackScreen’ exercise with the energy sector. Moreover,   telecommunications companies participate in risk assessment exercises conducted by   ENISA25. The finance sector also conducts exercises and crisis simulations. However, one of   the sectors that is not participating in such simulations and cyber training activities is the   health sector. This is expected to change since the Directorate of Health is now a member of   the Cyber Security Council and will participate is future exercises.                                                                24 https://www.althingi.is/lagas/nuna/2008082.html  (in Icelandic)  https://www.stjornarradid.is/publications/legislation/lex/2017/12/21/Civil-Protection-Act-No.-82-2008/ (English  translation)  25 https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-exercises     This factor addresses crisis management planning, the conduct of specialised needs   assessments, training exercises, and simulations that produce scalable results for policy   development and strategic decision-making. Through qualitative and quantitative   techniques, cybersecurity evaluation processes aim to produce structured and measurable   results that would solicit recommendations for policymakers and other stakeholders and   inform national strategy implementation as well as inform budgetary allocations   https://www.althingi.is/lagas/nuna/2008082.html https://www.government.is/publications/legislation/lex/2017/12/21/Civil-Protection-Act-No.-82-2008/ https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/cyber-exercises        25 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     D1.5 CYBER DEFENCE CONSIDERATION   Maturity Stage: Start-up   Iceland’s Cyber defence is mainly being considered in terms of national cyber resilience (see   D1.3) and the country is prioritising the protection of national CI assets as a priority action of   the NCSS. Beyond that it is also part of Iceland’s defence planning. Following, we present the   country’s structure on defence related issues.   The Ministry for Foreign Affairs is the central authority for defence and in charge of   implementation of the Defence Act No 34/200826, due to the absence of a dedicated Ministry   of Defence. The Minister for Foreign Affairs formulates the defence policy within the   framework of this Act and is responsible for the performance of a threat assessment   regarding defence. The Minister is also responsible for the formulation and implementation   of Iceland's Security and Defence Policy on the international arena and for representing the   Government of Iceland in relations and cooperation with foreign states, military authorities   and international security and defence organisations, including the North Atlantic Treaty   Organisation. The Act does not apply to governmental matters that are civil in nature, such   as policing and civil defence. Review participants noted that cybersecurity and defence is   already being incorporated in national defence planning. This is now part of the formal   agenda of national defence.   In accordance with a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Ministry for   Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Interior, now Ministry of Justice, and due to the lack of a   standing army the Icelandic Coast Guard from July 2014 (ICG) is responsible for operational   defence activities related to NATO, including NATO Iceland Air Defence System, CRC, Host   Nations Support and operation of the Keflavik Air Base.   The Iceland Crisis Response Unit (ICRU)27 has been a separate entity within the MFA since   2001. Its main role is to contribute to multilateral organisations and to provide secondments   of civilian experts to the field.   The Iceland Defence Force (IDF) was a military command of the United States Armed Forces   from 1951 to 2006. The IDF, created at the request of NATO, came into existence when the   United States signed an agreement to provide for the defence of Iceland. The IDF also   included civilian Icelanders and military members of other NATO nations.                                                                26 https://www.government.is/topics/foreign-affairs/national-security/   27 https://www.government.is/topics/foreign-affairs/icru/    This factor reviews the government’s capacity to design a cyber defence strategy and lead its   implementation, including through a designated cyber defence organisation. It also reviews   the level of coordination between various public and private sector actors in response to   malicious attacks on strategic information systems and critical national infrastructure.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland_Defense_Force https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_(military_formation) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO https://www.government.is/topics/foreign-affairs/national-security/ https://www.government.is/topics/foreign-affairs/icru/        26 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     Iceland has established contacts with the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of   Excellence (NATO CCDCOE)28 while material and resources prepared by the Centre, especially   the Tallinn Manual29, have already been utilised. In 2018, Norway will host NATO's high-  visibility exercise Trident Juncture30 in which Iceland participates, as the defence of Iceland is   an integral part of the exercise.   Iceland has excellent HAZMAT response to industrial accidents and has established a well-  respected search and rescue (SAR) system, staffed by volunteers nationwide. In October 2016   the Government of Iceland signed the new MoU on cyber defence cooperation with NATO31.   D1.6 COMMUNICATIONS REDUNDANCY   Maturity Stage: Formative    In the event of a communications disruption, mechanisms are in place to maintain the  operational functionality of the national emergency communications network. Current  emergency response assets have also been identified.   Stakeholders convene to identify gaps and overlaps in emergency response asset  communications and authority links. Emergency response assets, priorities and standard  operating procedures are mapped and identified in the event of a communications disruption  at any node in the emergency response network.   Within both the public and the private sectors, TETRA Systems for Mission Critical  Communications are deployed. In addition, fibre-optic nodes and cables are shared with the  public network. An incident occurred involving the TETRA system in the past, which led to  hardening the security of the system.    The finance sector also conducts crisis response simulations regularly and emergency drills  are tested frequently.                                                               28 https://ccdcoe.org/about-us.html   29 https://ccdcoe.org/tallinn-manual.html   30 https://forsvaret.no/en/exercise-and-operations/exercises/nato-exercise-2018   31 http://www.nicp.nato.int/iceland-signs-new-mou-on-cyber-defence-cooperation/index.html    This factor reviews a government’s capacity to identify redundancy within digital and non-  digital data management and communications systems. Digital redundancy implies a   cybersecurity framework in which duplication and failure of any component is safeguarded   by frequent and effective backup. Most of these backups will use digital networks that are   readily available but are also isolated from mainline systems. Redundancy in communications   systems can be achieved by supporting a digital communications network with a radio   communications network.   https://ccdcoe.org/about-us.html https://ccdcoe.org/tallinn-manual.html https://forsvaret.no/en/exercise-and-operations/exercises/nato-exercise-2018 http://www.nicp.nato.int/iceland-signs-new-mou-on-cyber-defence-cooperation/index.html        27 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     RECOMMENDATIONS   The Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre offers the following recommendations for   consideration by the Government of the Republic of Iceland. These recommendations   provide advice and steps aimed to increase existing cybersecurity capacity as per the   considerations of the GCSCC Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model. Recommendations   (R1.1 etc.) are grouped according to the respective factor.    NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY   R1.1 Ensure that the National Cybersecurity Strategy content includes, at a  minimum: explicit links to national risks, priorities, objectives, and business  development, raising public awareness, mitigating cybercrime, and  protecting critical infrastructure from external and internal threats.   R1.2 Encourage the promotion and implementation of the National Cybersecurity  Strategy by multiple stakeholders across government and other sectors.   R1.3 Administer a discrete cybersecurity budget line in order to allocate and  manage resources.   R1.4 Conduct regular scenario and real-time cyber exercises that provide a  concurrent picture of national cyber resilience.   R1.5 Collect and evaluate relevant metrics, monitoring processes and data in  order to inform decision-making.   R1.6 Include in the NCSS provision for the protection of critical infrastructure from  insider threats.       INCIDENT RESPONSE   RR1.7 Develop an operational central registry of national level cybersecurity  incidents and implement guidelines of the GDPR and the NIS.           28 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     RR1.8 Improve incident identification and analysis in response and conduct regular,  systematic updates to the national level incident registry.   R1.9 Ensure that the human and financial resources allocated to incident  response are adequate to the cybersecurity threat environment by  conducting regular scenario exercises designed to test human, organisational  and financial capacities.   R1.10 Promote coordinated national incident response between public and private  sectors, with lines of communication prepared for times of crisis.   R1.11 Develop a culture of risk assessment and management predictive methods  to assess risk, its propagation and its aggregation for the national and CI  domains.   R1.12 Establish mechanisms for regional and international cooperation for incident  response between organisations to resolve incidents as they occur.     R1.13 Promote a platform for the reporting and sharing of incidents across sectors.       CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE (CI) PROTECTION   R1.14 Perform detailed audits of CI assets as it relates to cybersecurity on a regular  basis and disseminate CI asset audit lists to relevant stakeholders.   R1.15  Implement regular audit practices to assess network and system  dependencies to inform continuous reassessment of risk portfolio. Identify  and establish specific auditing processes.   R1.16  Develop a strategy for strengthening formal coordination regarding Critical  National Infrastructure (CNI) and information sharing between public and  private sector.          29 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     R1.17 Establish a mechanism for regular vulnerability disclosure with defined scope  for reporting incidents between CI asset owners and the government.   R1.18 Promote strategic engagement between government and CI.   R1.19 Define formal internal and external CI communication strategies across  sectors, with clear points of contact.   R1.20  Optimize the legal framework concerning CNI by amending existing  legislation or enacting new regulations as needed to encompass incident  prevention, detection and response.   R1.21 Continue to invest in capability of Board Members and Senior Leaders of CI  organisations to understand cyber-risk intelligence, in both private and  public sectors, so that relevant individuals can lead in the face of crisis and  take their part in risk management more generally.   R1.22 Use CI risk management procedures to create a national response plan  including the participation of all vital entities.       CRISIS MANAGEMENT   R1.23 Prioritise crisis management exercises, especially at a local level, and  communicate the value of these exercises to all sectors.   R1.24 Conduct compromised communications scenarios and exercises to test  emergency response asset interoperability and effective functionality and  incorporate the results of the exercises to inform strategic investment in  future emergency response assets.   R1.25 Plan the exercises by engaging relevant participants, outlining their role in  the exercise, and articulating the benefits and incentives for participation.                30 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017      CYBER DEFENCE CONSIDERATION   R1.26 Review compliance of the National Security Strategy with international law  and its consistency with national and international rules of engagement in  cyberspace.   R1.27 Form a formal Research Cluster comprised by stakeholders from  Government, Academia and Intelligence working on national cyber  resilience. This Cluster will be working towards resilience on national CI (see  D1.3).     R1.28 Initiate discussions regarding the membership to NATO CCDCOE and  participation to exercises.        COMMUNICATIONS REDUNDANCY   R1.29 Undertake outreach to, and education of key stakeholders in the need for  digital and communications redundancy.   R1.30 Test the interoperability and function of emergency response assets under  compromised communications scenarios to inform strategic investment in  future emergency response assets based on the results of these scenario  exercises.   R1.31 Allocate resources to hardware integration, technology stress testing,  personnel training and crisis simulations drills.             31 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     DIMENSION 2  CYBERSECURITY CULTURE  AND SOCIETY   Forward-thinking cybersecurity strategies and policies entail a wide array of actors, including   Internet users. All actors and Internet users need to understand the role they can play in   safeguarding sensitive and personal data as they use digital media and resources. This   dimension underscores the centrality of all users in achieving cybersecurity, but seeks to   avoid conventional tendencies to blame users for the challenge of cybersecurity. Instead,   cybersecurity experts need to build user-friendly operating systems and programs that can   be incorporated in everyday practices online.     This dimension reviews elements of a responsible cybersecurity culture and society such as   the understanding of cyber-related risks by all actors, developing a learned level of trust in   Internet services, e-government and e-commerce services, and users’ understanding of how   to protect personal information online. This factor also entails the existence of mechanisms   for accountability, such as channels for users to report threats to cybersecurity. In addition,   this factor reviews the role of mass media and social media in helping to shape cybersecurity   values, attitudes and behaviour.       D2.1 CYBERSECURITY MIND-SET   Maturity Stage: Formative    The government has recognised the need to prioritise cybersecurity across its institutions,   and the risks and threats have influenced the processes and structures across government   institutions but in particular leading agencies.    This factor evaluates the degree to which cybersecurity is prioritised and embedded in the   values, attitudes, and practices of government, the private sector, and users across society-  at-large. A cybersecurity mind-set consists of values, attitudes and practices, including habits,   of individual users, experts, and other actors in the cybersecurity ecosystem that increase the   resilience of users to threats to their security online.             32 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     According to review participants, increasing awareness-raising efforts concerning risks and   threats exist, but there is a general lack of knowledge on the specific actions necessary.   Training and education for public services on IT and cybersecurity is available, e.g. through   the Information Society Project (see 3.3). However, this training programme is not mandatory   for all employees. Another concern noted by participants is the fact that such programmes   are neither coordinated nor long term, and therefore it is difficult for employees to retain the   knowledge received.    Another general concern expressed in interviews was that employees within the public sector   do not always follow specific online safety measures such as locking their computer, updating   passwords, and not sharing passwords. For example, participants noted that mandatory   password update was introduced last year within ministries, and that this has enhanced the   understanding and cybersecurity awareness of employees. Moreover, physical penetration   testing is now being introduced within some government institutions.   Leading firms within the private sector have begun to place priority on a cybersecurity mind-  set by identifying high-risk practices. Programmes and materials have been made available to   train and improve cybersecurity practices. For example, the finance sector is organising   trainings for its employees. Also, the energy sector is participating in exercises with Norway   in order to promote the understanding of risks to employees. However, participants noted   that the private sector needs to ensure trust in their services by their customers, but that this   is difficult when many Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) do not have sufficient resources   to allocate more to cybersecurity.   Individuals across society-at-large inconsistently adopt a cybersecurity mind-set, but   according to stakeholders, there is a shift towards a more proactive approach to   cybersecurity. There was a general sense that a growing number of users feel it is a priority   for them to employ good cybersecurity practices. However, cultural aspects and a generally   high level of trust, which is ingrained in the Icelandic culture, can inhibit users from thinking   about protecting their privacy online and making protection of their personal information   online their own responsibility. Phishing attacks were an example used to better express this   problem. Participants noted that phishing click rates are very high when the attacks are   written in Icelandic, due to the fact that users trust these more than a phishing email in   English. Users are not aware that they are part of a security chain and they need to share not   only the benefits of the Internet but also responsibilities for a safe Internet.          33 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     D2.2 TRUST AND CONFIDENCE ON THE INTERNET   Maturity Stage: Formative to Established   Overall, the participating stakeholders accepted that a limited proportion of Internet users   critically assess what they see or receive online or consider that they have the ability to use   the Internet and protect themselves online. Moreover, a limited proportion of users trust in   the secure use of the Internet based on indicators of website legitimacy.   Operators of Internet infrastructure are developing measures to promote trust in online   services but have yet to implement them.   As mentioned above Internet users in Iceland trust in the security of the Internet without   basing that trust on website legitimacy. Their trust is too often an overly confident “blind”   trust. People like the convenience of online services and either do not understand what   secure browsing is, for instance, or they do not fully understand the risks that are associated   with insecure Internet provision. Users do not necessarily lock their PCs and usually behave   online much like they act in their everyday life, which is shaped by a general sense of trust   that is characteristic of the Icelandic culture. Participants noted that identity theft is not   considered a problem for the majority of users. According to the General Penal Code No.   19/1940 (see D4.1) identify theft is not criminalised unless it is used for unlawful purpose and   practises.    E-government services have been firmly established in Iceland. The Government continues to   increase e-service provision and tax declarations are already being submitted electronically.   The government, along with other stakeholders and users, recognise the need for the   application of security measures to establish trust in these services. However, participants   noted that users trust in e-government services ‘’by default’’ as they do in other government   services. The implementation of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the   NIS Directive will ensure security and data protection provisions for e-governance services.   Thus, user trust in e-services is also expected to be strengthened among users.   Electronic certificates for authentication and two-factor authentication for document signing   are being promoted and utilized broadly within the public sector.    E-commerce services are fully established by multiple stakeholders. Security solutions are   updated and reliable payment systems have been made available. A growing proportion of   users trust in the secure use of e-commerce services and the private sector promotes use of   e-commerce services and trust in these services. Participants claimed that, generally, online-  banking and other commercial services from local suppliers are being used; but that foreign   services, such as Amazon, are used and trusted more.   This factor reviews the level of user trust and confidence in the use of online services in  general, and e-government and e-commerce services in particular.          34 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     D2.3 USER UNDERSTANDING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION  PROTECTION ONLINE    Maturity Stage: Formative   Iceland has adopted and enforced data protection legislation such as the Data Protection Act,   No. 77/2000 which lays out general conditions for the collection of personal data and   protection from misuse, and which promotes a practice of personal data processing in   accordance with fundamental principles and rules regarding data protection and privacy.   Based on the Act, the DPA has published rules No. 299/2001 on the Security of Personal Data.   The rules explicitly ask for measures regarding higher risks to personal data when they are   processed on the Internet (Article 4) as well as requiring all controllers to implement security   measures in accordance with the risk involved in the processing of personal data along with   measures to mitigate the risk. Iceland is also in the process of implementing the EU General   Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Moreover, the Regulation in the Protection of   Information in the Public Communications Networks No 1221/2007 aims “to enhance   consumer protection”.    Users and stakeholders within the public and private sectors have general knowledge about   how personal information is handled online but (proactive) cybersecurity practices are rarely   used, either due to perceived inconvenience or due to the way people weigh up the trade-  offs in service and protection of their personal information.    Participants noted that social security numbers and personal information are widely used for   authentication. However, users do yet not perceive that information as private. Once again,   the discussion led to the cultural aspect and the everyday practices of the Icelandic society   based on ‘implicit trust’.   This factor looks at whether Internet users and stakeholders within the public and private  sectors recognise and understand the importance of protection of personal information  online, and whether they are sensitised to their privacy rights.          35 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     D2.4 REPORTING MECHANISMS   Maturity Stage: Formative   In Iceland, the public and private sectors provide some channels for reporting, child abuse   online, but these channels are not coordinated and are used in an ad-hoc manner. Promotion   of the existing reporting channels has not yet begun or is ad-hoc. As regards to channels for   reporting identity theft, privacy and security breaches, and other incidents, such channels are   almost non-existent.  A system for reporting security breaches is being developed (autumn   2017).   A hotline through Barnaheill – Save the Children Iceland32 focuses on child abuse. Its website   also provides an online form to report illegal content. Barnaheill has operated a Hotline since   November 2001. The Hotline has worked very closely with the police and with other Hotlines.   The hotline is a member of the international organisation INHOPE, and participates actively   in its development33.   The National Commissioner of Icelandic Police (NCIP) is in charge of analysing reports and   partners with Barnaheill in running the hotline. The police investigate leads and forward them   to Barnaheill who uploads data to the IHRMS database – both will cooperate with other   INHOPE hotlines. The police will also forward leads to Europol and Interpol.   The Icelandic Red Cross also runs the 1717 Helpline for people who need assistance because   of grief, anxiety, distress, depression or suicidal thoughts. These can call the Red Cross   helpline free of charge 24 hours a day. The phone line also has a crucial function during times   of emergency.   Any incident, including cyber-related ones, can be reported via the police emergency number   112 or directly to police districts. Also, incidents such as child abuse are referred from the   Police to Europol and Interpol.    Some participants noted that no formal communication links have been established between   the police and CERT-IS on one hand and the private sector on the other hand. However,   formal communication channels are present between the communications sector and CERT-  IS based on the Electronic Communications Act34. According to CERT-IS it would be the most   logical hub of communications in coordinating flow of information about incidents between                                                               32 www.barnaheill.is   33 http://www.saft.is/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SAFT_2013_annual_report_lowres.pdf   34 http://www.althingi.is/lagas/nuna/2003081.html  (in Icelandic),  https://eng.innanrikisraduneyti.is/laws-and-regulations/english/electronic-communications/  (English  translation)   This factor explores the existence of reporting mechanisms functioning as channels for users  to report internet related crime such as online fraud, cyber-bullying, child abuse online,  identity theft, privacy and security breaches, and other incidents.   http://www.barnaheill.is/ http://www.saft.is/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SAFT_2013_annual_report_lowres.pdf http://www.althingi.is/lagas/nuna/2003081.html https://eng.innanrikisraduneyti.is/laws-and-regulations/english/electronic-communications/        36 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     law enforcement and CI owners. However, at present CERT-IS have neither the mandate nor   the resources to do so for the entire CI sector.    D2.5 MEDIA AND SOCIAL MEDIA    Maturity Stage: Formative   There is ad-hoc media coverage of cybersecurity, with very limited information provided and   reporting on specific issues that individuals face online, such as cyber-bullying. Overall,   discussions on social media about cybersecurity are also limited.    Social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and international blog-hosting   services are freely available and are used by a large part of the population35. The Media   Commission36 is an independent administrative committee under the Ministry of Education,   Science and Culture (MoESC). According to the Media Law, it carries out a supervisory   function [to ensure editorial independence of media] and attends to day-to-day   administrative tasks in the fields covered by the law.   Review participants noted that due to potential reputational harm, incidents within the   private sector are often not disclosed. According to the Crime & Safety Report (2017)37, in   2013 Iceland suffered its first serious cyber-attack when a major telecommunication carrier   was hacked, and detailed personal information on hundreds of Icelanders was released on   the Internet. In 2015, the servers of several small, private institutions were attacked, and   hackers aligned with ISIS targeted the computer network of a private missionary organisation.   In November 2015 and in January 2016, in a demonstration against Iceland’s support of   commercial whaling, the websites of the Icelandic government were attacked by the hacker   collective Anonymous. Traditional media and social media reported about this attack, for   example Iceland Review38, Grapevine39, the Hacker News40. These incidents raised the general   public awareness. However, participants noted that journalists too do not necessarily   understand cybersecurity issues and might misinform the public, and perhaps create fear.                                                               35 https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2016/iceland    36 http://fjolmidlanefnd.is/english/    37 https://www.osac.gov/Pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=21376   38 http://icelandreview.com/news/2015/11/30/increasingly-dangerous-internet-attacks-iceland   39 https://grapevine.is/news/2015/12/09/vodafone-falls-prey-to-cyber-attack/   40 http://thehackernews.com/2013/11/vodafone-iceland-hacked-and-exposed.html    This factor explores whether cybersecurity is a common subject across mainstream media,   and an issue for broad discussion on social media. Moreover, this aspect speaks about the   role of media in conveying information about cybersecurity to the public, thus shaping their   cybersecurity values, attitudes and online behaviour.   https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2016/iceland http://fjolmidlanefnd.is/english/ https://www.osac.gov/Pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=21376 http://icelandreview.com/news/2015/11/30/increasingly-dangerous-internet-attacks-iceland https://grapevine.is/news/2015/12/09/vodafone-falls-prey-to-cyber-attack/ http://thehackernews.com/2013/11/vodafone-iceland-hacked-and-exposed.html        37 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     RECOMMENDATIONS   Following the information presented during the review of the maturity of Cyber Culture and   Society, the Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre has developed the following set of   recommendations for consideration by the Republic of Iceland. These recommendations   provide advice and steps aimed to increase existing cybersecurity capacity as per the   considerations of the Centre’s Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model. The recommendations   are provided specifically for each factor.    CYBERSECURITY MIND-SET   R2.1 Enhance efforts at all levels of government, especially officials, and the  private sector to employ cybersecurity good (proactive) practices. Design  systems that enable users across society to embed secure practices more  easily into their everyday use of the Internet and online services.   R2.2 Routinize cross-sectorial cooperation and information sharing among  private and public sector organisations on cybersecurity risks and good  practice.   R2.3 Identify vulnerable groups and high-risk behaviour across the public, in  particular young people, to inform targeted, coordinated awareness  campaigns, as recommended in R3.1.    TRUST AND CONFIDENCE ON THE INTERNET   R2.4 Establish ISP programmes to promote trust in their services based on  measures of effectiveness of these programmes.   R2.5 Promote data protection by default and data protection by design as a  tool for transparency in the provision of e-governance services (including  e-health and e-police). Implement feedback mechanisms for use to  ensure that the e-services are continuously improved and trust is  strengthened among users.    R2.6 Employ processes for gathering user feedback within government  agencies in order to ensure efficient management of online content.          38 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     R2.7 Ensure that the private sector applies security measures to establish  trust in e-commerce services, including informing users of the utility of  deployed security solutions.        USER UNDERSTANDING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION  ONLINE   R2.8 Promote the understanding of protection of personal information online  among users and promote the development of their skills to manage their  privacy online.   R2.9 Encourage a public debate regarding the protection of personal  information and about the balance between security and privacy to inform  policy-making.   R2.10 Promote the compliance to web standards that protect the anonymity of  users.   R2.11 Promote data protection by default and by design as a tool for  transparency.   R2.12 Develop user-consent policies designed to notify practices on the  collection, use or disclosure of sensitive personal information.   R2.13  Establish reporting mechanisms for reporting online fraud, cyber-bullying,  child abuse online, identity theft, privacy and security breaches, and other  incidents in accordance with GDPR, NIS directive.   R2.14 Encourage different stakeholders (public-private sector, Police, DPA, CERT- IS) to coordinate the reporting mechanisms and their roles and  responsibilities, and to collaborate and share good practices to improve the  mechanisms.   R2.15  Establish awareness programmes to promote the regular use of reporting  mechanisms by public and private sectors, and their use as an investment  in loss prevention and risk control.   R2.16 Establish awareness programmes to promote cyber security and data  protection in the public sphere as well as within private entities that          39 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     process a great amount of personal data on a daily basis, i.e. financial  institutions, insurance, IT, marketing etc.   R2.17 Employ effectiveness metrics for all existing mechanisms and ensure that  they contribute to their improvement.    MEDIA AND SOCIAL MEDIA   R2.18 Encourage media and social media providers to further extend the  coverage beyond threat reporting and focus on informing the public about  proactive and actionable cybersecurity measures, as well economic and  social impacts.    R2.19 Encourage a frequent discussion about cybersecurity on social media.   R2.20 Ensure that the debate in social and mainstream media and the attitudes  expressed inform policymaking.          40 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     DIMENSION 3  CYBERSECURITY  EDUCATION, TRAINING  AND SKILLS   This dimension reviews the availability of cybersecurity awareness-raising programmes for   both the public and executives. Moreover, it evaluates the availability, quality, and uptake of   educational and training offerings for various groups of government stakeholders, private   sector, and the population as a whole.   D3.1 AWARENESS RAISING   Maturity Stage: Formative    Awareness-raising programmes, courses, seminars and online resources are available for   target demographics from public, private, academic, and civil society sources, but no   coordination or scaling efforts have been conducted. Awareness-raising programmes may be   informed by international initiatives, but are not linked to the NCSS.    The main Aim No. 1 of the NCSS is Capacity Building, and it recognises that the public,   enterprises and government should have the knowledge, skills and equipment needed to   cope with cybersecurity threats. The enhancement of general awareness of cybersecurity   issues is one of the measures towards the implementation of this aim.    Heimili og skóli (Home and School)41, is the National Parent Association in Iceland and has   been the National Awareness Node for Internet Safety in Iceland since 2004. The name   created for the awareness-raising efforts is “Samfélag, fjölskylda og tækni” (Community,                                                               41 http://www.heimiliogskoli.is/     This factor focuses on the prevalence and design of programmes to raise awareness of   cybersecurity risks and threats as well as how to address them, both for the general public   and for executive management.   http://www.heimiliogskoli.is/        41 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     Family and Technology), with the acronym SAFT. The SAFT42 empowers children and parents   to enjoy the internet and new media in a safe and positive way. The emphasis is on awareness   work on net-ethics, computer-game rating, source criticism, uses of mobile phones and data   protection on the internet. The SAFT is co-financed by the European Union’s Connecting   Europe Facility. The project aims are to raise awareness about the safe and positive use of   the Internet and new media among children, parents, teachers, policy makers, and the ICT   industry in Iceland. Heimili og skóli is the overall coordinator for the Safer Internet Centre,   coordinator for awareness actions and technical coordinator for awareness, hotline and   helpline. Heimili og skóli is independent of government, political parties and religious   organisations. Its members are parents’ councils and organisations of all schools (elementary   and upper level) and some individual parents43.   Network and Information Security is one of the main tasks of the Post and Telecom   Administration (PTA) and is an increasing part of its operations. The direct service from the   PTA to the public with respect to cybersecurity is first and foremost the provision of   information, where the Administration supports increased awareness of network and   information security, among other things by maintaining an advisory website netöryggi.is44.   Public and smaller companies can find practical information on how to enhance their own   security on the Internet. The PTA cooperates with other domestic organisations that work on   network and information security.    Iceland has established 7 February as Safer Internet Day45, which aims to raise awareness   about online safety issues and to promote safer and more responsible use of the internet and   smartphones, especially among children and young people; but also to give parents additional   knowledge about how to use the internet more safely and to protect children better. On 28   January the European Data Protection Day is being celebrated. The Icelandic DPA has on this   occasion organized seminars and published guidelines on the use of social media.    The European Consumer Centres-net Iceland has on this occasion put together ‘The Five   Commandments for Safer Internet Use’46. This includes advice such as: 1) not posting photos   of friends without their consent on Social Networks; 2) monitoring security settings on   Facebook; 3) considering the consequences before illegally downloading music or movies; 4)   checking the conditions of access and use of personal data before downloading a new app;   5) obtaining parent consent before paying with their credit card. In general, most of the   existing efforts focus on protecting children. There are insufficient awareness-raising   programmes targeting the general public and SMEs.   Because few major incidents have occurred in Iceland, the general public does not perceive   cyber risks as being a national level. As seen above, cybersecurity awareness-raising efforts   are in place, but no national level coordinated cybersecurity awareness programme covering   different target groups has yet been developed.                                                               42 http://www.saft.is/    43 http://www.saft.is/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SAFT_2013_annual_report_lowres.pdf    44 www.netöryggi.is   45 http://www.eccisland.is/en/about-ecc-net/news/safe-internet-day-2017   46 http://www.eccisland.is/sites/default/files/atoms/files/safe_internet_day_2017.pdf    http://www.saft.is/ http://www.saft.is/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/SAFT_2013_annual_report_lowres.pdf http://www.netöryggi.is/ http://www.eccisland.is/en/about-ecc-net/news/safe-internet-day-2017 http://www.eccisland.is/sites/default/files/atoms/files/safe_internet_day_2017.pdf        42 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     D3.2 FRAMEWORK FOR EDUCATION   Maturity Stage: Formative    Some educational courses exist in cybersecurity-related fields, such as information security,   network security and cryptography, but no cybersecurity-specific courses are yet offered in   Iceland. It was noted during the consultations that the demand for cybersecurity education   is evidenced through course enrolment and feedback within universities.    The need for enhancing cybersecurity education in schools and universities has been   identified by leading government, industry, and academic stakeholders. Aim No. 1: Capacity   building of the NCSS recognises that the public, enterprises and government should have the   knowledge, skills and equipment needed to cope with cybersecurity threats. Some of the   measures recognised and planned are to include: 1) cybersecurity education in all computer-  related studies at all school levels, and 2) provide students with first degrees from Icelandic   universities access to postgraduate studies in cybersecurity.   Several universities offer programmes in computer science and computer engineering at an   undergraduate and postgraduate level while cybersecurity is often a module within the   curriculum of these. However, there are no specialised degrees in cybersecurity. The   University of Iceland (UoI)47  offers undergraduate studies in Electrical and Computer   Engineering as well as postgraduate studies in these fields. Reykjavík University (RU)48  also   offers undergraduate as well as postgraduate programmes in computer science, software   engineering and applied computing.    At a postgraduate level, students often do projects related to cybersecurity. However,   participants mentioned that in general there are not enough incentives for students to   continue their studies and specialise in cybersecurity. It was also noted that the MoESC49   needs to examine the fact that the model of three-year undergraduate studies does not allow   enough time for specialization. These issues and the lack of promotion of cybersecurity or   forensics as an attractive profession create a general lack of specialists in the field.    The CSC now has an informal agreement with the Department of Information Security and   Communication Technology at NTNU, Norwegian University of Science and Technology,   which is one of the most advanced in the field of information security in the Nordic                                                               47 http://english.hi.is   48 https://en.ru.is   49 https://www.government.is/ministries/ministry-of-education-science-and-culture/    This factor addresses the importance of high quality cybersecurity education offerings and the   existence of qualified educators. Moreover, this factor examines the need for enhancing   cybersecurity education at the national and institutional level and the collaboration between   government, and industry to ensure that the educational investments meet the needs of the   cybersecurity environment across all sectors.   http://english.hi.is/ https://en.ru.is/ https://www.government.is/ministries/ministry-of-education-science-and-culture/        43 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     countries50. Icelandic students can enrol on a similar basis as Norwegian students and take a   degree in Master in Information Security, either full-time or part-time (e.g. along with work   in Iceland).  There are preliminary plans to have representatives from NTNU coming over   Jan/Feb to introduce opportunities within cyber security to final year undergraduate students   and with the aim of having some students applying by 1 March. A part of this plan is to   develop closer ties with UoI and RU, e.g. concerning graduate and undergraduate courses and   also concerning events that can help to stimulate interest in cybersecurity and provide   interesting challenges for students.   No national budget focused on cybersecurity education has yet been established.   Qualification programmes for cybersecurity educators are being explored, with a small cadre   of existing professional educators.   In Iceland there is also a gender inequality in the cybersecurity field. The majority of experts   working in computer science related posts and cybersecurity are men. Currently there are   efforts to promote more women to join the field. The organisation of women within the   School of Computing Science at Reykjavík University, /sys/tur (‘systur’ means sisters in   Icelandic) was suggested as a channel for promoting cybersecurity as a profession among   women.    Research and development is an important consideration in education. The MoESC and the   Ministry of Industries and Innovation (MoII) have the main responsibility for running the   research and innovation scheme. The MoESC supervises the affairs of the Science and   Technology Policy Council (STPC) and the Scientific Committee, and co-ordinates the   ministry's various projects in the fields of science, research and innovation and their   integration with the formulation and implementation of education policy.    The Icelandic Centre for Research (RANNIS)51 supports research, research studies, technical   development and innovation in Iceland. RANNIS cooperates closely with the STPC and   provides professional assistance regarding the preparation and implementation of science   and technology policy in Iceland. However, it was not possible to identify any specific   programmes and research funds on cybersecurity or related fields that are currently running.                                                                   50 https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/mis   51 https://en.rannis.is/     https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/mis https://en.rannis.is/        44 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     D3.3 FRAMEWORK FOR PROFESSIONAL TRAINING    Maturity Stage: Formative   The need for training professionals in cybersecurity has been documented at the national   level, and training programmes in cybersecurity are offered for public and private sector   employees as well as for the general public.    ICT professional certification with some security modules or components is available. CISCO   and other private companies also offer courses on ethical hacking and other relevant topics.   Syndis52 offers intensive hands-on training, teaching developers to spot and to exploit OWASP   Top-10 issues by themselves, to develop a rigorous understanding and knowledge of the   security issues and to avoid the problems in practice. Moreover, ad-hoc training courses,   seminars and online resources are available for cybersecurity professionals from public or   private sources. Seminars, tests and written guidelines have been provided to public   organisations through the Information Society Project53.   Review participants mentioned that currently the Estonian Technology Fund54 is dedicated   towards the provision of online courses, because overall there is not enough expertise among   educators to provide training in cybersecurity.    Metrics evaluating take-up of ad-hoc training courses, seminars, online resources, and   certification offerings exist, but are limited in scope.   Executive training courses for CEOs or chief financial executives are offered in an ad-hoc   manner, including topics such as good governance practice related to cybersecurity and risk   management.   During the consultations it was identified that overall no established cadre of cybersecurity-  certified employees exists in Iceland. Currently, many experts are self-educated or gain their   expertise on the job, and knowledge transfer from employees trained in cybersecurity to   untrained employees is ad hoc.                                                                52 https://www.syndis.is/owasp-top-10-training    53 https://www.stjornarradid.is/verkefni/upplysingasamfelagid/  (in Icelandic)  54 https://rio.jrc.ec.europa.eu/en/organisations/estonian-development-fund   The Development Fund is a state-run public institution that invests into young and growth-oriented technology  companies together with the private sector. The fund is aimed to invest into knowledge-intensive and high- technology Estonian companies that are in launching stage, offering management-related support to the relevant  operators.      This factor addresses the availability and provision of cybersecurity training programmes   building a cadre of cybersecurity professionals. Moreover, this factor reviews the uptake of   cybersecurity training and horizontal and vertical cybersecurity knowledge transfer within   organisations and how it translates into continuous skills development.   https://www.syndis.is/owasp-top-10-training https://www.stjornarradid.is/verkefni/upplysingasamfelagid/ https://rio.jrc.ec.europa.eu/en/organisations/estonian-development-fund        45 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     RECOMMENDATIONS   Following the information presented on the review of the maturity of Cybersecurity   Education, Training and Skills, the following set of recommendations are provided to the   Republic of Iceland.

R3.27  Establish job creation initiatives for cybersecurity within organisations and  encourage employers to train staff to become cybersecurity professionals.    R3.28 Begin to implement metrics evaluating take-up of ad-hoc training courses,  seminars, online resources, and certification offerings.          48 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     DIMENSION 4  LEGAL AND REGULATORY  FRAMEWORKS   This dimension examines the government’s capacity to design and enact national legislation   directly and indirectly relating to cybersecurity, with a particular emphasis placed on the   topics of ICT security, privacy and data protection issues, and other cybercrime-related issues.   The capacity to enforce such laws is examined through law enforcement, prosecution, and   court capacities. Moreover, this dimension observes issues such as formal and informal   cooperation frameworks to combat cybercrime.   D4.1 LEGAL FRAMEWORKS   Maturity Stage: Established    The Republic of Iceland has implemented provisions relating to cybersecurity   comprehensively in its ICT legislative and regulatory frameworks. The Regulatory Framework   of the European Union55 – through the EEA membership – applies in the country and has   shaped many regulations and existing legislation to protect the rights of individuals and   organisations in the digital environment.   Relevant actors from private sector and civil-society stakeholders are generally involved in   legislative processes and make their voices heard through the media or by contacting   politicians directly56. According to review participants, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), for   instance, conducted a survey on the existing legislation to receive feedback from                                                               55 https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/sites/digital- agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013%20N O%20CROPS.pdf   56 https://www.althingi.is/pdf/Althingi2013_enska.pdf    This factor addresses legislation and regulation frameworks related to cybersecurity,   including: ICT security legislative frameworks; privacy; freedom of speech and other human   rights online; data protection; child protection; consumer protection; intellectual property;   and substantive and procedural cybercrime legislation.    https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/sites/digital-agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013%20NO%20CROPS.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/sites/digital-agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013%20NO%20CROPS.pdf https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/sites/digital-agenda/files/Copy%20of%20Regulatory%20Framework%20for%20Electonic%20Communications%202013%20NO%20CROPS.pdf https://www.althingi.is/pdf/Althingi2013_enska.pdf        49 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     stakeholders, and is currently preparing a report, in accordance with usual practice during   legislative processes.57    The Electronic Communications Act (ECA) No. 81 from March 2003,58 the Act on the Post and   Telecom Administration (APTA) No. 69, from March 200359 and its Amendment No. 62/201260   provide the legal basis for the Post and Telecom Administration (PTA), an independent body   under the MoTLG responsible for the administration of electronic communications and postal   affairs. Both Acts stipulate certain provisions regarding cybersecurity and critical information   infrastructure, and allow PTA to implement measures to maintain the integrity and security   of public communications networks (ECA, Article 3). According to Article 6, the ECA also   ensures the security of public networks from illegal access and the safety of the country’s   electronic communications with the outside world. Moreover, it requires those providing   electronic communications services to take measures to ensure their security, to consult with   operators and to inform subscribers in the case of a breach. Individuals who work in electronic   communications are required to keep information confidential even after employment   termination. Amendment No. 62 defines the role and responsibilities of CERT-IS (see D1.2)   for the protection of critical information infrastructure (Article 8). Law enforcement only   receives access to data where provisions of Article 70 of the Criminal Proceedings Act61 apply.   The Regulation on protection, functionality, and quality of IP communications services, No.   1223 from 200762 applies to network and information security within the ECA and establishes   the role of CERT-IS. It aims “to enhance consumer protection and strengthen the foundations   of the information society by making increased requirements concerning the security of the   electronic communications systems used by businesses and individuals.” This includes   security of IP traffic and email operations, as well as notification of customers, measures to   limit the spread of security incidents, reporting mechanisms, and the supply of value-added   services regarding security. Art. 42, paragr. 3 of the ECA stipulates that data should be   retained for 6 months. This data can only be accessed following a judicial procedure, as per   Art. 47, paragr. 7 of the ECA. Additionally, the Icelandic Media Law63 requires providers to   ensure that the transmission of service via electronic communications networks are secure   (Article 45). Act No. 30/2002 on Electronic Commerce and other Electronic Services retains the   liability of ISPs and establishes a system of takedown notices for IP addresses or other online   content that violate the law, in accordance with the Directive 2000/31/EC of the European   Parliament. According to a similar EU directive, Act No 28/2001 on Electronic Signatures64 and   Regulation No. 780/201165 define the legality of electronic signatures and their power to                                                               57 https://www.upr-info.org/sites/default/files/document/islande/session_26_- _octobre_2016/a_hrc_wg.6_33_isl_1_e_0.pdf   58 https://www.stjornarradid.is/publications/legislation/lex/2018/01/16/Electronic-Communications-Act-No.-81- 26-March-2003/   59 https://www.stjornarradid.is/publications/legislation/lex/2018/01/04/Act-on-the-Post-and-Telecom- Administration-No.-69-24-March-2003/   60 https://www.pfs.is/upload/files/Act%20no.62_2012.pdf   61 https://www.government.is/publications/legislation/lex/2018/01/15/Law-on-Criminal-Procedure-No.-88- 2008-Exerpts/   62 https://www.pfs.is/upload/files/REGULATION_no.1223_IP%20communication.pdf   63 http://fjolmidlanefnd.is/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Log-um-fjolmidla_ensk-thyding_mai2015.pdf   64 https://www.stjornarradid.is/publications/legislation/lex/2018/02/01/Merchants-and-Trade-Act-No-28-2001- on-electronic-signatures/   65 http://www.neytendastofa.is/lisalib/getfile.aspx?itemid=2736    https://www.upr-info.org/sites/default/files/document/islande/session_26_-_octobre_2016/a_hrc_wg.6_33_isl_1_e_0.pdf https://www.upr-info.org/sites/default/files/document/islande/session_26_-_octobre_2016/a_hrc_wg.6_33_isl_1_e_0.pdf https://www.stjornarradid.is/publications/legislation/lex/2018/01/16/Electronic-Communications-Act-No.-81-26-March-2003/ https://www.stjornarradid.is/publications/legislation/lex/2018/01/16/Electronic-Communications-Act-No.-81-26-March-2003/ https://www.stjornarradid.is/publications/legislation/lex/2018/01/04/Act-on-the-Post-and-Telecom-Administration-No.-69-24-March-2003/ https://www.stjornarradid.is/publications/legislation/lex/2018/01/04/Act-on-the-Post-and-Telecom-Administration-No.-69-24-March-2003/ https://www.pfs.is/upload/files/Act%20no.62_2012.pdf https://www.government.is/publications/legislation/lex/2018/01/15/Law-on-Criminal-Procedure-No.-88-2008-Exerpts/ https://www.government.is/publications/legislation/lex/2018/01/15/Law-on-Criminal-Procedure-No.-88-2008-Exerpts/ https://www.pfs.is/upload/files/REGULATION_no.1223_IP%20communication.pdf http://fjolmidlanefnd.is/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Log-um-fjolmidla_ensk-thyding_mai2015.pdf https://www.stjornarradid.is/publications/legislation/lex/2018/02/01/Merchants-and-Trade-Act-No-28-2001-on-electronic-signatures/ https://www.stjornarradid.is/publications/legislation/lex/2018/02/01/Merchants-and-Trade-Act-No-28-2001-on-electronic-signatures/ http://www.neytendastofa.is/lisalib/getfile.aspx?itemid=2736        50 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     make legally binding agreements, and the requirements for certificates, signature-creation   devices and certification service providers.    The first Data protection legislation in Iceland was adopted in 1981 and has been updated   and enforced since then. The Data Protection Act No. 77/200066 includes general conditions   for the collection of personal data and protection from misuse and it promotes a practice of   personal data processing in accordance with fundamental principles and rules regarding data   protection and privacy. It stipulates, inter alia, that data can only be obtained for specific   purposes and only processed in a fair apposite and lawful manner. According to Articles 8   (general conditions) and 9 (sensitive data), data may only be processed if one of the criteria   listed in the provisions is met, i.e. after the subject has given unambiguous and informed   consent. When processing personal data controllers have a duty to inform the data subject,   see Article 20 of the Data Protection Act. For example, the controller must provide the name   and address of the controller, the purpose of the processing and other information, such as   recipients or categories of the data and whether or not he is obliged to provide the data. The   Act implements the Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24   October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data   and on the free movement of such data 67 and safeguards the reliability and integrity of the   personal data and its free flow within the EEA. As a member of the EEA Agreement Iceland is   obliged to implement the GDPR into Icelandic law. The Ministry of Justice is responsible for   the implementation. Most likely, the Minister of Justice will introduce before the parliament   a new draft legislative bill, implementing the provisions of the GDPR, in 2018. The Data   Protection Authority (DPA)68, is an independent governmental body, which is responsible for   monitoring data processing and the application of the Data Protection Act. It has also started   to prepare for new duties laid upon it by the GDPR and at the same time offers guidance for   businesses and other institutions. Additionally, Rules No. 299/2001 on the Security of Personal   Data69 explicitly provide measures regarding higher risks to personal data when it is   processed on the Internet (Article 4). Moreover, the Regulation on the Protection of   Information in the Public Communications Networks no 1221/200770 aims “to enhance   consumer protection and strengthen the foundations of the information society” by defining   the measures the PTA needs to undertake in order to guarantee the confidentiality, the   availability and the integrity of information, and its lawful access. This includes business   continuity plans, measures concerning employees, access controls and organisational and   technological measures.    Several Icelandic laws recognize fundamental human rights on the Internet, including privacy   online, freedom of speech, freedom of information, and freedom of assembly and   association. The constitution71 includes thirteen provisions regarding human rights, including   the protection of freedom of expression (Article 73), privacy (Article 71), freedom of   association (Articles 64 and 74) and assembly (Article 74), and has been updated according to                                                               66 https://www.personuvernd.is/information-in-english/greinar/nr/438   67 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:en:HTML   68 https://www.personuvernd.is/information-in-english/greinar/nr/438   69 https://www.personuvernd.is/information-in-english/greinar/nr/442   70 https://www.pfs.is/library/Skrar/Innflutt/PDF/REGULATION_no.1221_Protection%20of%20information.pdf   71 http://www.government.is/constitution/    https://www.personuvernd.is/information-in-english/greinar/nr/438 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:en:HTML https://www.personuvernd.is/information-in-english/greinar/nr/438 https://www.personuvernd.is/information-in-english/greinar/nr/442 https://www.pfs.is/library/Skrar/Innflutt/PDF/REGULATION_no.1221_Protection%20of%20information.pdf http://www.government.is/constitution/        51 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     the latest international developments.72 Additionally, the Media Act No 38/2011 73 also   requires media service providers to ensure human rights, such as freedom of expression and   privacy in their activities (Article 26). The country’s previous Information Act No 50/1996 and   the current Information Act No. 140/201274 provide a safeguard to the public’s right to access   information effectively and ensure the free flow of information. The country has also ratified   or acceded to several international agreements, such as the UN Universal Declaration of   Human Rights, the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental   Freedoms of the Council of Europe75, and those of the International Labour Organization and   the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, such as the Convention for the   Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data No 10876. The   country is actively involved in the global discourse on human rights by submitting reports to   international bodies, while also reviewing and adapting the recommendations to their   legislation. The Icelandic Human Rights Centre (ICEHR)77 is the national institution responsible   for conducting research regarding human rights issues and for promoting and creating   awareness about human rights. Freedom of Speech and Privacy legislations are also reviewed   as part of the implementation of the Budapest Convention (see below).   Comprehensive legislation on the protection of children has been adopted and enforced   according to Iceland’s Child Protection Act, No. 80/2002. This legal and institutional   framework is largely in line with the international human rights obligations in this field, e.g.   ISPs have to filter out websites containing child abuse online if notified. Iceland has ratified   the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and other relevant international conventions   and is applying them in the country78. However, review participants stated that there is no   specific domestic law or provision in the online environment, speaking specifically to the   protection of children online, nor directly to relevant criminal procedures.    The Act No 62/2005 on the Consumer Agency and Consumer Spokesman79 safeguards   consumers from business malpractice online and is enforced by the Consumer Agency (CA),   a governmental agency under the auspices of MoII. The Act is complemented by the above-  mentioned Acts No. 30/2002 on Electronic Commerce and other Electronic Services and No.   28/2001 on Electronic Signatures.80 The latter fulfils the legal requirements of the European   Parliament and Council Directive 1999/93/EB81 to ensure that the certificates issued in Iceland   are valid in the EEA. The CA is a founding member of the Forum of European Supervisory   Authorities,82 which “support(s) the cooperation, information and assistance among the   members and to facilitate the exchange of views and agreement on good practice.”                                                                72 https://www.upr-info.org/sites/default/files/document/islande/session_26_- _octobre_2016/a_hrc_wg.6_33_isl_1_e_0.pdf   73 http://fjolmidlanefnd.is/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Log-um-fjolmidla_ensk-thyding_mai2015.pdf   74 https://www.government.is/publications/legislation/lex/2018/01/19/The-Information-Act-No.-140-2012/   75 https://treaties.un.org/pages/showDetails.aspx?objid=080000028014a40b   76 https://rm.coe.int/168008c2b8   77 http://www.humanrights.is   78 https://www.government.is/topics/social-welfare-and-families/    79 www.neytendastofa.is/lisalib/getfile.aspx?itemid=1402   80 https://www.stjornarradid.is/publications/legislation/lex/2018/02/01/Merchants-and-Trade-Act-No-28-2001- on-electronic-signatures/    81 https://portal.etsi.org/esi/Documents/e-sign-directive.pdf   82 http://www.fesa.eu/index.html    https://www.upr-info.org/sites/default/files/document/islande/session_26_-_octobre_2016/a_hrc_wg.6_33_isl_1_e_0.pdf https://www.upr-info.org/sites/default/files/document/islande/session_26_-_octobre_2016/a_hrc_wg.6_33_isl_1_e_0.pdf http://fjolmidlanefnd.is/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Log-um-fjolmidla_ensk-thyding_mai2015.pdf https://www.government.is/publications/legislation/lex/2018/01/19/The-Information-Act-No.-140-2012/ https://treaties.un.org/pages/showDetails.aspx?objid=080000028014a40b https://rm.coe.int/168008c2b8 http://www.humanrights.is/ https://www.government.is/topics/social-welfare-and-families/ http://www.neytendastofa.is/lisalib/getfile.aspx?itemid=1402 https://www.stjornarradid.is/publications/legislation/lex/2018/02/01/Merchants-and-Trade-Act-No-28-2001-on-electronic-signatures/ https://www.stjornarradid.is/publications/legislation/lex/2018/02/01/Merchants-and-Trade-Act-No-28-2001-on-electronic-signatures/ https://portal.etsi.org/esi/Documents/e-sign-directive.pdf http://www.fesa.eu/index.html        52 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     Iceland adheres to legislation addressing intellectual property of online products and services   as other countries in EEA. Copyright Act No. 126/201183 comprises of provisions regarding   intellectual property rights. The Icelandic Patent Office is the agency responsible for issues   related to copyright and provides information and advice to individuals, companies and other   institutions. The country is a member of major international bodies, such as the World Trade   Organization (WTO), the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), the European   Patent Organisation (EPO) and the Nordic Patent Institute. Moreover, Iceland adheres to key   international agreements such as the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial   Property, the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement, the Patent Cooperation Treaty, The   Geneva Act of the Hague Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Industrial   Designs, and the European Patent Convention. Participants confirmed that cases of copyright   violations have been prosecuted and sentenced.   There is no specific cybercrime law in Iceland. However, in 2007 the country ratified the   Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, also known as the ‘Budapest Convention’,   whose recommendations are consistently implemented into domestic law. For instance,   General Penal Code No. 19/194084 (GPC) contains substantive cybercrime legal provision since   its amendment in 1998, in addition to latter amendments to the GPC and the Act on Criminal   Procedures which are related to the implementation of the Budapest Convention. The code   prohibits e.g. unlawfully accessing other persons’ data or its destruction or damage (Articles   257 and 228)85, as well as “unlawfully modifying, adding to of destroying computer software,   or data or programs stored in machine-readable form, or taking other measures designed to   influence the outcome of computer processing” (Article 249a). However, as participants   pointed out there are gaps in existing legislation. For instance, the act of breaking into a   computer system may not be illegal in itself; only when damage occurs or the break-in is for   financial gain, does it become a crime (see above). However, it should be noted that article   228 in the GPC stipulates that “a person who in an unlawful manner procures access to data   or programs of others which are stored in a computerized form” can be fined or sentenced,   to up to one year in prison. On the other hand, article 242 in the GPC stipulates that lawsuits   on account of offences, against article 228 may only be brought by the injured party alone   which limits the tools that the police and prosecutors have for investigation and prosecution   in such cases. The penal code also bans the production, distribution, and possession of child   pornography (Article 210), and illicit computer-related acts for personal or financial gain, such   as fraud and forgery (Article 158). The Act on Collection of Evidence Relating to Alleged   Violations of Intellectual Property Rights, No. 53/200686 contains comprehensive provisions   for the investigation of cybercrime and evidentiary requirements, e.g. for electronic evidence   (Article 4, 12), and cases have been brought to court. The Act on Criminal Procedure No.   88/200887 allows requesting electronic information from ISPs for the purpose of an   investigation (Article 70).                                                                83 http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/is/is/is108is.pdf   84 http://www.althingi.is/altext/stjt/2006.074.html  85 http://www.parliament.am/library/Qreakan/islandia.pdf   86 https://www.stjornarradid.is/publications/legislation/lex/2018/01/15/Act-on-Collection-of-Evidence-Relating- to-Alleged-Violations-of-Intellectual-Property-Rights-No.-53-2006/  87 https://www.stjornarradid.is/publications/legislation/lex/2018/01/15/Law-on-Criminal-Procedure-No.-88- 2008-Exerpts/    http://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/is/is/is108is.pdf http://www.althingi.is/altext/stjt/2006.074.html http://www.parliament.am/library/Qreakan/islandia.pdf https://www.government.is/publications/legislation/lex/2018/01/15/Act-on-Collection-of-Evidence-Relating-to-Alleged-Violations-of-Intellectual-Property-Rights-No.-53-2006/ https://www.government.is/publications/legislation/lex/2018/01/15/Act-on-Collection-of-Evidence-Relating-to-Alleged-Violations-of-Intellectual-Property-Rights-No.-53-2006/ https://www.stjornarradid.is/publications/legislation/lex/2018/01/15/Law-on-Criminal-Procedure-No.-88-2008-Exerpts/ https://www.stjornarradid.is/publications/legislation/lex/2018/01/15/Law-on-Criminal-Procedure-No.-88-2008-Exerpts/        53 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     In spite of the shortcomings mentioned earlier, participants perceived the legislation in   respect to cybersecurity as sufficient. However, the government still has to fulfil its   commitment, expressed in the national ICT Security Policy from 2015, to update its legislation   “[to] reflect the international demands and obligations the country undertakes regarding   cyber security and the protection of personal data”.88 There are several gaps in existing   legislation. Furthermore, the protection of infrastructure is limited to e-communications   infrastructure and does not cover other CNI. With the NIS Directive to take effect in May 2018,   several participants emphasized the need to address this lack of legislation protecting CNI,   and criticized the slow process encountered in preparing its implementation. However, they   anticipated its potential contribution towards closing the existing gaps in CNI protection in   the very near future. Participants also expressed concerns about the state of preparedness   of the private sector and of government institutions to implement the GDPR and the   structures and processes it requires in the remaining months before it comes into effect from   May 2018 onwards. From their perspective, efforts in the remaining time should focus on   preparing the new legislation needed to implement the GDPR and putting it forth, but also   foster the implementation across the private and public sectors.   D4.2 CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM   Maturity Stage: Formative   Across the criminal justice system, capacities are at initial stages of development in Iceland.   The Police, headed by the National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police (NCIP), have only   limited digital forensics capacity and cases are investigated by the digital forensics unit of the   Reykjavik Metropolitan Police. Two policemen at the Metropolitan Police are also specifically   assigned to investigate cases involving sexual violence against children on the internet.   However, the country needs more skilled personnel as well as the procedural and   technological resources to conduct investigations in a comprehensive way. Training for law   enforcement officers on cybercrime and digital evidence is ad-hoc or not specialized. As a   result, for instance, revenge porn is a recurring issue, because the lack of capacity hinders the   police being able to tackle all cases. One way to mitigate these threats and resource gaps is   regional and bilateral collaboration mechanisms, e.g. with the Norwegian police (see 4.3).    Some specialised cybercrime prosecutors have the capacity to build cases on electronic   evidence, but this capacity is limited as training is largely ad-hoc, not institutionalised and   informal. For instance, some prosecutors have participated in courses offered by the                                                               88 https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/epractice/news/iceland-boosts-ict-security-measures-shares-policy    This factor studies the capacity of law enforcement to investigate cybercrime, and the  prosecution’s capacity to present cybercrime and electronic evidence cases. Finally, this  factor addresses the court capacity to preside over cybercrime cases and those involving  electronic evidence.   https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/epractice/news/iceland-boosts-ict-security-measures-shares-policy        54 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     International Association of Prosecutors89, but the courses are not mandatory. A similar   situation can be observed in courts. If judges receive training on cybercrime, digital evidence,   or data protection, it is ad-hoc or not specialized and much of the training available is also not   even known, for instance that by the Council of Europe90. On the other hand, a newly   established Judicial Administration is preparing an overall analysis on the need for training of   judges and other staff in order to build a training program. Both Judges and the Judicial   Administration are aware of the importance of strengthening knowledge of digital processes   and cybercrime.  Furthermore, a provision in the new Act on Courts, going into effect on 1st   January 2018, also strengthens the selection process of experts to the bench in order to   create a substantial pool of these experts in all the major fields. In addition, it should be noted   that risk analysis on data protection for judicial data has also been performed.   Participants confirmed that the cooperation with law enforcement is effective, even with the   limited capacity as described, as those personnel who have the expertise are known and cases   are automatically handed over.   While Iceland has not yet seen a large number of cybercrime cases brought before the courts,   the limited levels of capacity in handling cybercrime cases could potentially lead to ineffective   investigations, prosecutions and convictions, which would allow cybercriminals to remain   unpunished and continue their criminal conduct. In addition to strengthening the legal   framework, it is therefore important to elevate the capacities of the criminal justice system   to successfully combat and prevent cybercrime.   D4.3 FORMAL AND INFORMAL COOPERATION FRAMEWORKS TO  COMBAT CYBERCRIME   Maturity Stage: Established    Iceland has fully acknowledged the need for formal and informal cooperation and has   established mechanisms of international cooperation in order to prevent and combat   cybercrime by facilitating its detection, investigation, and prosecution, with established   communication channels. The country cooperates with international organisation such as   Interpol91 and Europol,92 and directly with governments, e.g. Norway and the US, regarding   cross-border information sharing and has signed l Mutual Legal Assistance agreements which                                                               89 http://www.iap-association.org/   90 http://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/trainings        91 https://www.interpol.int/Member-countries/Europe/Iceland   92 https://www.europol.europa.eu/agreements/iceland    This factor addresses the existence and functioning of formal and informal mechanisms that   enable cooperation between domestic actors and across borders to deter and combat   cybercrime.   http://www.iap-association.org/ http://www.coe.int/en/web/cybercrime/trainings https://www.interpol.int/Member-countries/Europe/Iceland https://www.europol.europa.eu/agreements/iceland        55 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     are successfully applied. The MoJ is the authority responsible for “sending and answering   requests for mutual assistance, the execution of such requests, or the transmission of them to   the authorities competent for their execution” as well as “making or receipt of a request for   extradition or provisional arrest”. The NCIP has the responsibility of being the 24/7 point of   contact to provide immediate assistance for the purpose of cybercrime investigations or   proceedings.93 These tasks are then usually handed over to the digital forensics unit at the   Reykjavik Metropolitan Police (see 4.1).   Cooperation between law enforcement and the private sector, in particular ISPs, is informal,   as there are no legislative requirements for the exchange of information between domestic   public and private sectors. Only telecommunications companies are required to report   ‘serious’ incidents, to CERT-IS. However, there is no definition of what constitutes a serious   incident. According to the participants, companies have often been hesitant to report   incidents, though a shift towards more openness is being observed from companies which   have begun to volunteer information. Between government and criminal justice actors,   informal relationships have been established successfully, mostly based on personal   connections, resulting in the exchange of information on cybercrime issues.    RECOMMENDATIONS   Following the information presented on the review of the maturity of cybersecurity Legal and   Regulatory Frameworks, the following set of recommendations are provided to the Republic   of Iceland. These recommendations aim to provide advice and steps to be followed for the   enhancement of existing cybersecurity capacity, following the considerations of the GCSCC.        LEGAL FRAMEWORKS   R4.1  Continue to review existing legal and regulatory mechanisms for ICT security  to identify where gaps and overlaps may exist and amend or enact new laws  accordingly. Monitor the enforcement of the legislative frameworks and  ensure that it informs resources allocation and legal reform. Put mechanisms  in place for keeping ICT legal frameworks in harmony with national  cybersecurity-related ICT policies, international law, standards and good  practices.   R4.2 Ensure that international and regional trends and good practices inform the  assessment and amendment of domestic legal frameworks protecting human  rights online and associated resource planning. In order to meet dynamic  changes in the application of technology to human rights, identify procedures  to amend and update legal frameworks as needed.                                                               93 http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/- /conventions/treaty/185/declarations?p_auth=CZVDo71s&_coeconventions_WAR_coeconventionsportlet_enVi gueur=false&_coeconventions_WAR_coeconventionsportlet_searchBy=state&_coeconventions_WAR_coeconve ntionsportlet_codePays=ICE&_coeconventions_WAR_coeconventionsportlet_codeNature=3    http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/185/declarations?p_auth=CZVDo71s&_coeconventions_WAR_coeconventionsportlet_enVigueur=false&_coeconventions_WAR_coeconventionsportlet_searchBy=state&_coeconventions_WAR_coeconventionsportlet_codePays=ICE&_coeconventions_WAR_coeconventionsportlet_codeNature=3 http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/185/declarations?p_auth=CZVDo71s&_coeconventions_WAR_coeconventionsportlet_enVigueur=false&_coeconventions_WAR_coeconventionsportlet_searchBy=state&_coeconventions_WAR_coeconventionsportlet_codePays=ICE&_coeconventions_WAR_coeconventionsportlet_codeNature=3 http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/185/declarations?p_auth=CZVDo71s&_coeconventions_WAR_coeconventionsportlet_enVigueur=false&_coeconventions_WAR_coeconventionsportlet_searchBy=state&_coeconventions_WAR_coeconventionsportlet_codePays=ICE&_coeconventions_WAR_coeconventionsportlet_codeNature=3 http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/185/declarations?p_auth=CZVDo71s&_coeconventions_WAR_coeconventionsportlet_enVigueur=false&_coeconventions_WAR_coeconventionsportlet_searchBy=state&_coeconventions_WAR_coeconventionsportlet_codePays=ICE&_coeconventions_WAR_coeconventionsportlet_codeNature=3        56 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     R4.3 Continue to actively contribute to the global discourse on human rights on the  Internet. Foster research on human rights on the Internet and ensure that  measures are in place to exceed minimal baselines specified in international  agreements. Continue to actively contribute to the global discourse on human  rights and move the focus on human rights on the Internet.   R4.4 Ensure that the GDPR and the Police Directive94 on the processing of personal  data is successfully implemented and legal mechanisms are in place that  enable. Identify international and regional trends and good practices to  inform the assessment and amendment of data-protection laws and  associated resource planning.   R4.5 Improve national child protection online legislation to comply with regional  and international law and standards.   R4.6  In order to meet dynamic changes in the application of technology to  consumer protection, develop and implement procedures to amend and  update legal frameworks as needed.   R4.7 Review the legislation on intellectual property online through consultation   with key stakeholders and through public discourse to reflect changes in   national priorities and the international ICT landscape.   R4.8 Develop and implement measures to exceed minimal baselines for  substantive and procedural cybercrime frameworks specified in international  treaties where appropriate, which includes procedures to amend those  frameworks as needed.    R4.9 Ensure that in the case of cross-border investigation, procedural law   stipulates what actions need to be conducted under particular case   characteristics, in order to successfully investigate cybercrime.    CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM   R4.10 Invest in advanced investigative capabilities in order to allow the investigation  of complex cybercrime cases, supported by regular testing and training of  investigators.   R4.11 Allocate resources dedicated to fully operational cybercrime units based on  strategic decision making in order to support investigations, especially at the  local level.                                                               94 Directive 2016/680 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by  competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal  offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Council  Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L0680&from=EN .    http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L0680&from=EN        57 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     R4.12  Enhance training and education of prosecutors and judges on cybercrime and  data protection. Additional resources should be allocated for this purpose.   R4.13 Establish a formal mechanism to enable the exchange of information and  good practices between prosecutors and judges to ensure efficient and  effective prosecution of cybercrime cases.   R4.14 Collect and analyse statistics and trends regularly on cybercrime  investigations, on cybercrime prosecutions and on cybercrime convictions.    FORMAL AND INFORMAL COOPERATION FRAMEWORKS TO COMBAT  CYBERCRIME   R4.15 Allocate resources to support the exchange of information between public  and private sectors domestically and enhance legislative framework and  communication mechanisms.   R4.16 Enhance established informal cooperation mechanisms between Internet  Service Providers and PTA, DPA and law enforcement with clear  communication channels.          58 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     DIMENSION 5  STANDARDS,  ORGANISATIONS AND  TECHNOLOGIES   This dimension addresses effective and widespread use of cybersecurity technology to   protect individuals, organisations and national infrastructure. The dimension specifically   examines the implementation of cybersecurity standards and good practices, the deployment   of processes and controls, and the development of technologies and products in order to   reduce cybersecurity risks.   D5.1 ADHERENCE TO STANDARDS   Maturity Stage: Formative    ICT security standards and good practices have been adopted by both the public and private   sector and there is evidence of measurable implementation. Telecommunications companies   must, according to the ECA, implement cybersecurity measures in their overall risk   management; however, the Act does not specify which standards are mandatory across   sectors. Many public organisations, including CNI, have introduced international standards   such as the ISO 27000 family and are following relevant EU requirements. According to   participants, the National Hospital and many of the municipalities have adhered to ISO 27001   for about ten years. Moreover, banks have to comply with the requirements of   Fjármálaeftirlitið, the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA)95 and must have certification to   the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). It was mentioned that it is often   the requirement of corporate customers that financial organisations fulfil specific standards                                                               95 https://en.fme.is/   This factor reviews government’s capacity to design, adapt and implement cybersecurity   standards and good practice, especially those related to procurement procedures and   software development.   https://en.fme.is/        59 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     which are not a legal of regulatory requirement. This is also an observation regarding the   private sector. Furthermore, all controllers processing personal data must adhere to the   security provisions of the Data Protection Act, cf. Articles 11-13, and Rules No. 299/2001 on   the Security of Personal Data. The rules especially refer to ISO/IEC 27001 as guidelines to   follow when setting up an ISMS.    A different observation was made for the smaller health care institutions across the country   and smaller and medium municipalities and enterprises in Iceland. Most of these   organisations do not implement standards or do not seek certification due to limited human   resources. It is common that those organisations use trusted domestic and international   hosting companies that adhere to standards, wrongly assuming that they are no longer   responsible for information security. On the other hand, PTA has observed that the majority   of telecommunications companies follow ISO 27001 in order to fulfil compliancy   requirements, although many abstain from certification due to its high costs. No measures to   monitor compliance or metrics were known by the participants and there is no entity in the   country which has the mandate to monitor the implementation of standards. Overall,   participants expected significant changes due to the implementation of the GDPR which will   both emphasise the responsibility of any organisation to adhere to certain standards and the   need for monitoring. These developments will foster the implementation of standards in all   sectors and will increase the awareness that adherence to standards is one crucial element   to make an organisation cybersecure.   Regarding the standards related to procurement of software, similar conclusions can be   drawn. There is no evidence for the adoption of and compliance to cybersecurity standards   in procurement practices within the public and private sectors, nor measurement and   assessments of process effectiveness. Organisations consider critical aspects of procurement   such as prices and costs, quality, timescales and other value-added activities but often they   are not aware of cybersecurity aspects or do not know which standards to adhere to in this   regard. There is no unified process in the country to guide the identification of standards for   procurement of software or hardware. Processes follow in general the requirements of the   Public Procurement Act, No. 120/201696 which is aligned with the European regulation. Some   larger public and private organisations follow ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 32, ISO 2911597, ISO 27001   and the Gartner Standards. However, the extent of the implementation of these depends on   the sector and is ad-hoc. The Ríkiskaup, the government’s public procurement office98, for   instance, has signed frame contracts with about seven hosting companies, which can be used   by every public institution. Some large international companies follow their own   procurement processes or base their decision on reputation of the product or supplier rather   than actual standard adherence.    Focusing on standards in software development, there are no guidelines or protocols in place   relating to cybersecurity. Although local companies and the professional communities in   Iceland perceive security in software development as important, most participants agreed   that it is not a priority, especially in smaller companies or in-house development offices, and                                                               96 https://www.stjornarradid.is/media/fjarmalaraduneyti-media/media/frettatengt2016/act-on-public- procurment-no.-120-2016.pdf   97 https://www.iso.org/standard/45138.html   98 https://www.rikiskaup.is/    https://www.stjornarradid.is/media/fjarmalaraduneyti-media/media/frettatengt2016/act-on-public-procurment-no.-120-2016.pdf https://www.stjornarradid.is/media/fjarmalaraduneyti-media/media/frettatengt2016/act-on-public-procurment-no.-120-2016.pdf https://www.iso.org/standard/45138.html https://www.rikiskaup.is/        60 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     may also be sacrificed because of the higher costs. The only exception is the financial sector   that has to follow the requirements of the FSA. Participants expect that the implementation   of the NIS directive and the GDPR will bring the issue of standard adherence to the attention   of the other sectors as well.   D5.2 INTERNET INFRASTRUCTURE RESILIENCE   Maturity Stage: Established   Iceland’s Internet services and infrastructure have been established and are reliable. The   technology and processes deployed for Internet infrastructure meet international IT   guidelines, standards, and good practices. Iceland achieves leading scores in technological   readiness99 and Internet access and broadband penetration is one of the highest   internationally100. Several submarine cables connect the country with the European and   North American continent.   Internet is used for e-commerce and electronic business transactions (see D2.2). However,   authentication processes are often weak, e.g. many websites only require simple   authentication. There are also legal requirements for operational security; but   telecommunication companies and other CNI often have their own internal standards or are   only obliged that those are fit-for-purpose. Although national infrastructure is formally   managed, including documented processes, roles and responsibilities, there is no regular   assessment of those processes according to international standards and guidelines. An   exception is again the financial sector which is regulated by the FSA.                                                                99 http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GCR2016-2017/05FullReport/TheGlobalCompetitivenessReport2016- 2017_FINAL.pdf   100 https://data.oecd.org/iceland.htm    This factor addresses the existence of reliable Internet services and infrastructure in the   country as well as rigorous security processes across private and public sectors. Also, this   aspect reviews the control that the government might have over its Internet infrastructure   and the extent to which networks and systems are outsourced.   http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GCR2016-2017/05FullReport/TheGlobalCompetitivenessReport2016-2017_FINAL.pdf http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GCR2016-2017/05FullReport/TheGlobalCompetitivenessReport2016-2017_FINAL.pdf https://data.oecd.org/iceland.htm        61 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     D5.3 SOFTWARE QUALITY    Maturity Stage: Start-up to Formative   Software quality is a matter of concern and functional requirements in public and private   sector are identified, but not necessarily in a strategic manner. Priority is mostly given to the   quality and performance of software. As there is no inventory of software used in public and   private sectors, nor is a catalogue of secure software, software is mostly selected because it   is known or recommended. Additionally, monitoring and quality assessment is conducted in   an ad-hoc manner only in few private institutions, so no evidence of software quality   deficiencies is gathered. Policies and processes on software updates and maintenance are   increasingly put in place, but primarily by international companies or enterprises that focus   on the Internet or software development.    D5.4 TECHNICAL SECURITY CONTROLS   Maturity Stage: Formative to Established   Up-to-date technical security controls, including patching and backups, are deployed in all   sectors in Iceland but to very different levels. Companies have internal policies for updates   and automated software updates are becoming more common. However, participants   expressed doubts that these controls are tested on a regular basis. As many smaller   companies and public sector organisations use hosting services and other suppliers they often   are not aware of their remaining responsibility to be cyber secure.    Users have general understanding of the importance of, for instance, anti-malware software,   but it is questionable whether this is translated into actual behaviour, such as regular   updates. ISPs often offer such software and have established policies for technical security   control deployment as part of their services. Technical cybersecurity control systems are   deployed but not consistently based on established cybersecurity frameworks, such as the   This factor examines the quality of software deployment and the functional requirements in   public and private sectors. In addition, this factor reviews the existence and improvement of   policies on and processes for software updates and maintenance based on risk assessments   and the criticality of services.   This factor reviews evidence regarding the deployment of technical security controls by users,   public and private sectors and whether the technical cybersecurity control set is based on   established cybersecurity frameworks.          62 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     SANS Top-20 cybersecurity controls. Physical security controls are increasingly deployed on   various levels, for instance in ministries, to prevent unauthorised personnel from entering   computing facilities.   D5.5 CRYPTOGRAPHIC CONTROLS   Maturity Stage: Formative to Established   Across stakeholder groups there is a broad understanding of secure communication services,   such as encrypted or signed email, and many institutions support these because of increased   public pressure and notification through a popular Facebook group101 where experts in   Iceland discuss cybersecurity issues. However, international counterparts have pointed out   that documents provided by Icelandic partners sometimes do not meet international   standards. No guidelines in this regard for each sector exist – except for in financial   institutions. Although some state-of-the-art tools, such as SSL or TLS, are routinely deployed   by web service providers to secure all communications between servers and web browsers,   and all EU laws have been implemented on data protection and e-signatures, participants   pointed out a lack of infrastructure to manage encryption, as no such services are offered in   Iceland.   D5.6 CYBERSECURITY MARKETPLACE   Maturity Stage: Start-up to Formative   The domestic market in Iceland is very small and only provides a few specialised cybersecurity   products, which are not demand-driven. Most organisations rely on products from   international companies. Local suppliers of software and services such as penetration testing   and auditing do consider cybersecurity, as mentioned above (D5.3) but it is not a priority.                                                               101 https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=Net%C3%B6ryggi   This factor reviews the deployment of cryptographic techniques in all sectors and users for   protection of data at rest or in transit, and the extent to which these cryptographic controls   meet international standards and guidelines and are kept up-to-date.   This factor addresses the availability and development of competitive cybersecurity   technologies and insurance products.          63 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     Cyber-insurance is offered by a domestic insurer who resells international products, but   uptake is limited as the terms are often not suitable for local companies.   D5.7 RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE   Maturity Stage: Formative   Stakeholders mainly share technical details of vulnerabilities informally with other   stakeholders, who can distribute the information more broadly; but this is not common and   is mostly not done publicly. Currently, organisations have established their own processes   and mechanisms to receive, disseminate and share information on vulnerabilities, and the   Facebook group mentioned above (D5.5), which discloses incidents on a regular basis, is   contributing to a cultural shift in this regard and has encouraged voluntary disclosure. Beyond   that, there is no framework in place and only some organisations are obliged to report to   CERT-IS. Banks have to report within 24 hours according to the FSA guidance. After the GDPR   comes into force companies will have 72 hours to report to the DPA. Additionally, financial   institutions and telecommunication companies inform affected customers, usually via email   or a publicly available status page. Changes are expected with the implementation of GDPR,   NIS and the Police Directive into Icelandic law when incident reporting both towards relevant   authorities and data subjects involved (if applicable) will be required for by law.   RECOMMENDATIONS   Following the information presented on the review of the maturity of cybersecurity   Standards, Organisations, and Technologies, the following set of recommendations are   provided to the Republic of Iceland. These recommendations aim to provide advice and steps   to be followed for the enhancement of existing cybersecurity capacity, following the   considerations of the GCSCC Cybersecurity Capacity Maturity Model.          This factor explores the establishment of a responsible-disclosure framework for the receipt   and dissemination of vulnerability information across sectors and, if there is sufficient   capacity, to continuously review and update this framework.          64 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017      ADHERENCE TO STANDARDS   R5.1 Adopt a nationally agreed baseline of cybersecurity related standards and  good practices across the public and private sectors, including standards in  procurement and software development.

The MoTLG extended invitations to stakeholders in advance of the review,   and while it is difficult to ascertain whether all relevant experts were present, the input   gathered over the three days was key to ensuring a successful review.   This was the eighteenth country review that GCSCC has supported directly. Iceland has begun   the process of developing different aspects of cybersecurity capacity across all dimensions,   including through implementing the action plan of the National Cybersecurity Strategy and   revisiting legal frameworks and regulation.    These efforts will establish the foundations for more advanced capacity in the future. GCSCC   hopes that this review will offer useful insights to Iceland and that the review’s   recommendations will contribute to continuing work on enhancing cybersecurity capacity   across all five dimensions of the CMM.             68 | Cybersecurity Capacity Review Iceland, 2017     APPENDIX   SUMMARY OF REVIEW RESULTS    CAPACITY  FACTORS   STAGE OF MATURITY REFERENCES RECOMMENDATIONS   D1.1   National   Cybersecurity  Strategy   Established National Cybersecurity  Strategy (NCSS) 2015-2026  https://www.government. is/media/innanrikisradune yti-media/media/frettir- 2015/Icelandic_National_ Cyber_Security_Summary _loka.pdf       https://www.stjornarradid .is/news/article/2015/07/ 03/National-Cyber- Strategy-for-Iceland- released/     The Ministry of Transport  and Local Government  (MoTLG)  https://www.government. is/news/article/2017/05/0 1/Two-new-ministries- commence-operation/      R1.1 Ensure that the National  Cybersecurity Strategy content includes, at  a minimum: explicit links to national risks,  priorities, objectives, and business  development, raising public awareness,  mitigating cybercrime, and protecting  critical infrastructure from external and  internal threats.

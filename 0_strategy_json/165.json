Your department plays a crucial role in the government’s efforts to address the challenges brought about by global interconnectivity. | commend the DICT for crafting this Cybersecurity Plan which aims to deal with these challenges and improve our people’s confidence in the ICT sector. May the implementation of this new cybersecurity framework enable you to fulfill your mandate of securing critical ICT infrastructure while ensuring personal data privacy and confidentiality. It is my hope that you will use this framework in realizing your role in nation-building through the creation of a cybersecurity educated society. | wish you all the best in this endeavor. rh RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE President of the Philippines MESSAGE The Philippine government has invested in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) infostructure and applications as the cornerstone for national economic growth. ICT is recognized as key enabler for economic growth and social mobility and is expected to improve the quality of life of people as part of the longterm vision for the Philippines AmbisyonNatin 2040 and the ASEAN Masterplan of 2015. Though there is the promise of acceleration in the nation’s growth via the rapid development of ICT in the Philippines, this technology and their applications have introduced new types of threats such as cybercrime, cyber espionage, cyber terrorism and cyber warfare to mention a few. Cyber threats are on the rise, and are sophisticated and difficult to mitigate; the imminent threat of cyber crimes to National Security necessitates that the necessitates that the government must be prepared and in position to respond and counter adequately these cyber threats. Given the Philippines’ heavy dependence on ICT to support its economic development goals, it is imperative that information infrastructure or “infostructure” among others be resilient, robust, and secure against cyber threats. The National Cybersecurity Plan 2022 was Crafted to establish an environment that will assure trust and confidence in everyone while using ICT facilities, and ensure that the Philippines is self-reliant and able to protect its interests, particularly national security. This plan will guarantee the availability of cyber services and the confidentiality and integrity of information processes, assets, and sensitive information of Individuals, Businesses, and Government itself. Pursuant to RA 10844, the Department of Information and Communications Technology shall ensure the security of critical infostructure including information assets and data of the government, individuals, and businesses. The Department is working in collaboration with key stakeholders in Cybersecurity, especially the Cybercrime Investigation and Coordination Center and the Philippine National Police. As the lead in the formulation of cybersecurity policies, the Department will periodically review their implementation progress to ensure that threats of current and potential cyberattacks are addressed adequately and effectively in a timely and appropriate manner. RODOLFO & NM MA Secretary, \\ and CommunicationaTechnology (DICT) MESSAGE As we become more and more dependent on ICT in our daily lives, an equal responsibility to provide online security should be established. Through the National Cybersecurity Plan, the DICT is providing a roadmap for ICT stakeholders to secure their online environment. It is the government’s strategy to safeguard the ICT environment of the country which will prepare and secure the government infostructure, systematically strengthen critical infostructure (CIl) for resiliency, use security measures among businesses to protect, prevent, respond, and recover from attacks especially within Cll and government supply chains, and raise awareness of cyber risks among users for empowerment in adopting the right norms in Cybersecurity. Accepting the reality that there is no physical or economic security without cybersecurity, the Department of Information and Communications Technology is now Officially enforcing the National Cybersecurity Plan 2022 hereby sending a message that the government is at the forefront of protecting every Filipino in cyberspace. Ky ELISEO M. RIO, J Undersecretary Special Concerns MESSAGE | The constantly changing times and the advent have drastically altered the way we perform our duties and responsibilities. There are certain groups whose ideology is to destroy the order of our nation and are now using advanced and sophisticated technologies to carry out their plans, thus, the need to develop measures in protecting and policing the cyberspace has now become one of the major responsibilities of the DICT to assure the Filipino people of its safe use especially in doing business. The DICT is mandated to establish cybersecurity measures that would guard the country against cyber threats. The department will be in the frontline to protect Philippines’ critical infostructure, government and military networks, businesses and supply chains, and the Filipino people through the crafting of a comprehensive and realistic national cybersecurity plans, policies and programs. DICT will enforce, evaluate, and constantly monitor these cybersecurity policies through regular assessment and compliance activities, conduct of annual cyber drills and exercises, and cybersecurity education and awareness programs. As cyberspace is borderless in nature, international cooperation will be at the highest possible level to curb cyber threats and aid our law enforcement authorities, prosecution services, and cyber defense centers through the establishment of the National Computer Emergency Response Team (NCERT) that would act as the focal entity to achieve a safe and resilient cyber community. Let us be together in the fight against cyber threats as CyberSecurity is not just a whole of government approach but of the whole Filipino nation. ALLAN S BANLONG Assistant\\Sacretary for Cybersecurity and Enabling Technologies, DICT MESSAGE | congratulate the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) for crafting the National Cybersecurity Plan (NCSP) 2022. Online connectivity has been transformed from a luxury and privilege to a necessity for the Filipino people. However, the government has been slow in providing Philippine cyberspace with the proper measures and safeguards that would enable the general public to conduct their businesses and expand their knowledge using online means, without facing security risks. This is why the NSC considers cybersecurity as an important part of EE national security. One particular importance of cybersecurity is connected with how the government should deal with security issues on government issued documents. This is because in our intercon- nected society, the integrity of these documents-which more or less prove our right to be recognized as Filipino citizens-have become terrifyingly vulnerable to malcontents and our identity could be compromised as a result. Cybersecurity comes in by ensuring that the database would be impervious to cyber attacks and pilferage of data. Ensuring that cybersecurity is in place and addressed by the Philippine government also has implications on our economic security. Other governments and busi- nesses would have more confidence in our processes, businesses, and government if we have more robust and responsive cybersecurity. In this regard, | look forward to the eventual implementation of the NCSP 2022, as well as to closer cooperation of the NSC and the DICT on matters of mutual concern. Mabuhay! HERMOGENES C. ESPERON, JR. National Security Adviser and Director-General, NSC MESSAGE Our One Defense Team extends warm felicitations to the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) for having formulated this well-crafted National Cybersecurity Plan 2022. Having set forth the DICT’s policy direction within the National Cybersecurity Strategy Framework, this plan shall serve as a guide on how you can best fulfill your mandate of ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of our citizens’ personal information; and securing critical ICT infrastructure and information assets of the government, individuals and businesses. It shall also improve your provision of oversight functions to agencies governing and regulating the ICT sector, strengthen consumer protection and welfare, ensure data privacy and security, and foster completion and growth of the ICT sector. We cannot overemphasize the urgency of protecting the nation’s critical information structures especially government public and military neworks, to ensure continuous operations even during crises and emergencies. Thus, we are one with you in instituting measures to enhance our ability to respond to cybersecurity threats before, during, and after attacks. Rest assured of our efforts to assist the DICT in informing and educating our people on cybersecurity, not only in the workplace but also in our homes, communities, and other places where we access the Internet. This is the first step toward instilling cybersecurity consciousness in every Filipino so that we can all contribute in building a safe, secure, and cyber-resilient nation. Once more, congratulations to the DICT on the significant accomplishment! Mabuhay ang Pilipinas! Mabuhay tayong lahat! DELFIN N. LORENZANA Secretary, Department of National Defense MESSAGE | extend my warm congratulations to the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) on the crafting and publication of the National Cybersecurity Plan 2022. This Plan is most welcome as it sets the direction in addressing the urgency to protect the nation’s critical infostructure, government networks, business enterprises, corporations and their supply chains, and most of all, every Filipino using the Internet. This publication comes at this most opportune time when information and ‘ ) communications technology is developing and advancing ata rapid pace and playing an increasingly crucial role in the lives of our countrymen. | take this opportunity to assure the DICT of the strong support and cooperation of the Philippine National Police (PNP) in the implementation of cybersecurity measures and policies and in continually improving and strengthening the nation’s response to the increasing threats to peace and security being posed over cyberspace. | lead the men and women of the PNP in forging a stronger partnership with the DICT as we endeavor to keep Philippine cyberspace safe and secure.

There are growing dependencies on these technologies that include critical functions of industries and industry control systems. The newly created Department of Information and Communications Technology, through its attached agency, the Cybercrime Investigation and Coordination Center (CICC), adapts to the new paradigm with the comprehensive National Cybersecurity Strategy Framework. Te rapid changes in information and The development of the Framework shall institutionalize the adoption and implementation of Information Security Governance and Risk Management approaches. These globally recognized standards shall provide the government a systematic and methodical practice of ensuring the protection of our mission critical and non-critical infostructure. The government shall build its capability and capacity for quick response and recovery through the establishment of the National Emergency Response Team (NCERT). Included in the mandates of DICT are to “ensure the rights of individuals to privacy and confidentiality of their personal information; ensure the security of critical ICT infrastructures including information assets of the government, individuals and businesses; and provide oversight over agencies governing and regulating the ICT sector and ensure consumer protection and welfare, data privacy and security, foster competition and the growth of the ICT sector.” One of the priority areas that the Department has to immediately institute is the formulation of the National Cybersecurity Plan to address the urgency to protect the nation’s Critical Infostructures, Government Networks both Public and Military, Small Medium Enterprises to Large Businesses and Corporations and its supply chains, and every Filipino using the Internet. The primary goals of this Plan include: (1) assuring the continuous operation of our nation’s critical infostructure, and public and military networks; (2) implementing cyber resiliency measures to enhance our ability to respond to threats before, during, and after attacks; (3) effective coordination with law enforcement agencies; and (4) a cybersecurity-educated society. 1. Making Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) Trusted and Secure The functions and services of critical infostructure and those of the governmental bodies are vital to the country’s socio- economic activities. Any interruption of these functions and services can cause direct and significant consequences to people’s safety and security; therefore, it is crucial to take precautionary measures to address potential threats. It is necessary to take “mission assurance”-based approaches. Mission owners should analyze risks and should have discussions with asset owners in order to accomplish the functions and services of critical infostructure or the governmental bodies. Mission owners should ask comprehensive decisions of senior executives by providing information on vulnerabilities including resultant risks. ll. Making Government Information Environment Secure To respond to cyberattacks, particularly targeted ones that are apparently aimed at stealing, damaging, or altering information, the agency will take government-wide, multi- layered measures based on the assumption of cyberattacks. This must also include contingency plans for this possibility - a certain entity will be used as a springboard for another entity that is the original target of a cyberattack. In promoting these measures, the Government will ensure that they are based on common internationally accepted standards for the governmental bodies, and will conduct risk analysis on its administrative responsibilities to optimize the processes involved in making government information environment secure. lll. Making Businesses Secure Along with the continuous increased interconnectivity of cyberspace and physical space, the number of cybersecurity incidents closely related to individuals and enterprises - such as illegal money transfers by exploiting Internet banking, stealing information by targeted attacks, and phishing — has drastically grown. TRUSTED RESILIENTICT INFOSTRUCTURE There is also a rise in the number of breaches of personal or confidential information, including a large-scale personal data breach. Thus, such repeated crimes have become serious social concerns. Without avanced cybercrime response and investigative capabilities, it is difficult to capture the reality of malicious cybercrimes; to control cybercrimes appropriately in accordance with laws and statutes; and to be ready to handle new methods of cybercrimes that would likely emerge in the near future. IV. Making Individuals Aware and Secure In the current environment, cyber risks have become more complex and diversified and Internet users with insufficient cybersecurity awareness become victims or end up becoming offenders unknowingly. Therefore, the Internet and the advent of mobile technology have increased utilization of computers, smartphones, and other devices to transact, process, transmit, and store information. The public awareness and knowledge of cybersecurity should reach suf- Making Government Information eee ety ae #CyberToughPH Making Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) Trusted and Secure #CyberResilientPH a ee cN\\ a e NN Q U O U U U U U U U U U O U U 0 0 QO OO OU OU OO UU U0 00 00 Q U O U U U U O U 0 O U U U 0 0 0 .

Data and information can now travel at the speed of light. The world has become interconnected through supercomputers and massive network systems and the Internet superhighways, in a way that is almost unimaginable. This created cyberspace. The internet has introduced many drastic changes in our lives. This is apparent in the way we process and communicate our information to transact, interact, and connect with other people. The digitization of our society has also created new sets of paradigms of dependencies and interdependencies. The government has recognized the importance of information and the vital role of information and communications technology as one of the enablers for nation building. INTRODUCTION The growing dependencies of the government in ICT to deliver its essential services have brought home the hard facts that we must have a robust and resilient infrastructure. Our computer, information, and network systems must be given priority to ensure that the integrity of our cyberspace is not put in jeopardy as we entrust our data and our information into this virtual environment. Although there is an implemented government-wide program on Information Systems Strategic Plan (ISSP) which provides the blueprint for planning, developing, building, and/or acquiring technology such as hardware and software applications for each government agency, the design has never incorporated the security aspect on top priority in facilitating the creation of a digital environment. Therefore, individuals with malicious intent are able to discover the gaps between these ystems and are able to exploit it. Making Critical Information Infrastructure (Cll) trusted and secure Making government information environment more secure Making business more secure Making individuals aware and secure Addressing these gaps will mitigate the risks, threats and vulnerabilities from malicious actors such as criminals, terrorist organizations, individuals or even hostile states. The technological revolution on mobile-based devices and smart systems and the expansion of inter-networking of devices, computing systems, and mechanical and digital machines for connectivity through Internet (also known as Internet of Things or loT) introduced a whole new host of threats into our cyberspace. As we rely heavily on systems (e.g. banking), technologies (e.g. telecommunications), and infrastructure (e.g. Dower grids) to conduct the daily activities of our lives which are connected to the internet, these are potentially vulnerable to interference or disruptions. Recognizing all these issues and challenges that may be a potential threat to our national security and national interest, the National Cybersecurity Plan 2022 has been prepared to address the cyber threats and create innovative measures that will lead to a secure and resilient Philippine cyberspace. In However, the NCSP 2022 shall provide the institutional framework and foundation where policies and initiatives will be developed, formulated, and prepared. Just to name a few, we also have several legal instruments such as the Cybercrime Prevention Act, E-Commerce Law, and the Data Privacy Act that provide the mechanisms for enforcing laws and provision of penalties and regulating through policies and guidelines. Launching on these objectives, the DICT has identified and shall focus its attention on four national targets and make them a national priority. The scale and dynamic nature of cyber threats mean we need to work harder to develop our capabilities and defenses. A comprehensive approach is required to effectively secure our cyberspace. To have this realized, investments on intervention and measures must be prepared through initial assessment of where we are now and what we have. SCOPE The National Cybersecurity Plan 2022 is intended to shape the policy of the government on cybersecurity and the crafting of guidelines that will be adapted down to the smallest unit of the government. The strategy also intends to provide a coherent set of implementation plans, programs, and activities to be shared to the public and the private sector, the civil society, and the academe, including the private individuals. The strategy covers the entire country including all Philippine networks connected through government networks, domestic and international. The strategy also mandates that all government and public systems shall be assessed and must be classified under the National Security System. The nexus of the cybersecurity strategy is anchored on the last three clauses under Section 2 of the Republic Act No. 10844, to wit, “(l) to ensure the rights of individual to privacy and confidentiality of their personal information;(m) to ensure the security of the critical ICT infrastructures including information assets of the government, individuals, and businesses; and (n) to provide oversight over agencies governing and regulating the ICT sector and ensure consumer protection and welfare, data privacy and security, and foster competition and growth of the ICT sector.” Therefore, the context of cybersecurity within this document refers to the protection of information systems (hardware and software including associated and support infrastructure), the data within these systems, and the services that are provided by these systems from any unauthorized access, harm or misuse, whether it includes intentional or accidental, or from natural disasters. The above definition is reflective of the definition of cybersecurity! from the International Standards on Guidelines for Cybersecurity (ISO/IEC 27032:2012), “oreservation of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information in the Cyberspace”, which incidentally was also adopted from the International Standards on Information Security Management System (ISO/IEC 27000:2014). For the purpose of this document, it shall adopt the definition from ISO/IEC 27032:2012. Thus, Information Security, Application Security, Network Security, Internet Security, and Cll Protection are central to the key areas of developing the cybersecurity plan of the government. The objective of this document is set to share the vision of the Government for cybersecurity in 2022 and the key objectives to achieve the goal, including the guiding principles, roles and responsibilities of all key players and the stakeholders. THE CYBER THREAT LANDSCAPE To understand better the threat that we are now facing in the digital age, the black market having a pivotal role in cyber threats is discussed briefly within this section. The criminal underground operating with the use of the web is highly fragmented. Each organized criminal group offers specialized expertise on certain services and each actively offers said services on the deep web. A report from Trend Micro? indicated that there are at least six different cybercriminal ecosystems that are actively operating across Europe, North and South America, Africa, and Asia. Each of these criminal ecosystems offers unique and specialized services in the black market. Stiff competition in the Russian black market pushes up the game. The sellers provide goods in the shortest amount of time, with the most efficiency. The Russian black market is one of the pioneers in the underground economy and provides support to budding counterparts such as Germany. The Japanese underground on the other hand is still relatively new in the cybercrime economy. It prefers to cater more on taboo rather than on the typical illegal trade that occurs in the black market and is only exclusive to specific members. 1 International Organization for Standardization. (2012). Information Technology —- Security Techniques — Guidelines for Cybersecurity,1st Edition. Published in Switzerland. However, as it learns more of the “benefits” anonymity offers, the Japanese underground market now boasts uncommon offerings such as leaked data search engine privacy protection services. The Chinese underground economy sells both software and services similar to its counterparts. The economy has a robust offering of tools and hardware development and acts as a prototype hub for criminals. The North American underground encourages novices to jumpstart a career in the criminal world. This type of criminal ecosystem is not exclusive to members like the Japanese and is unlike the tech-savvy hackers like Russians, Germans, and Chinese. Unlike its US counterpart, the Canadian underground prefers to sell fake or stolen documents and credentials. 2 crime-and-the-deep-web-whitepaper-en.pdf The German underground market functions similar to the Deep Web where it offers various wares and caters to a niche set of customers. Although it is also still relatively new, its Russian counterparts provide them support, such as shared resources and parallel sites as well as cross-market advertising. For any young criminal aspirant, the Brazilian underground market provides the avenue to reach instant superstardom for notoriety. They mostly focus on banking Trojans. Most of these budding cybercriminals are young and bold enough to flaunt and operate on the “Surface Web” by frequenting popular social media sites. However, they mostly work independently from one another. GLOBAL AND REGIONAL THREAT LANDSCAPE This section mentions two most prominent cases in 2015 and 2016 respectively, as an example to emphasize the importance of the Critical Information Infrastructure? (Cll) in our nation. Any attack can erode our trust in the system that we rely heavily on to provide continuous service without disruptions or interruptions. On December 23, 2015, a disruptive’ cyber-attack on the electricity distribution companies Prykarpattya Oblenergo and Kyiv Oblenergo in Western Ukraine® occurred and caused a major power outage. The region experienced a blackout for several hours affecting more than 220,000 consumers. Upon investigtion, six months before the attack, phishing emails were sent to the offices of power utility companies in Ukraine which contains malicious Microsoft Office documents. The malware was able to gather intelligence and managed to obtain credentials that allowed the attackers to gain direct remote control of aspects of the network and open the circuit breakers that subsequently enabled the attacker to trigger the outage. In February 2016°, an attacker was able to access the SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Communication) payment system of the Bangladesh Bank and instructed the New York Federal Reserve Bank to transfer money from an account in Bangladesh Bank to multiple accounts in the 10 Philippines. These fraudulent transactions led to a loss of US$101 million when these were completed and went through the payment and transfer system of the bank. However, the banking system was able to prevent the attempted transactions to defraud an addi- tional US$850 million. After the discovery of the attack, a forensic investigation was launched and the discovery was made that a malware was installed in the bank’s systems and had been used to gather information on the procedures used by the bank for international payment and fund transfers. Further analysis also indicated that the malware linked to the attack showed a sophisticated functionality for interacting with the local SWIFT Alliance Access software running on the Bangladesh Bank infrastructure. It was concluded that the conduct of the criminals are geared towards more sophisticated attacks on network intrusions. The Components of Malicious Cyber Activity In the “Economic Impact of Cyber Crime and Cyber Espionage” report by McAfee, a global computer security software company, the count in estimating losses from cybercrime, cyber espionage, and malicious cyber activity was broken down into six parts * The loss of intellectual property and business confidential information * Cybercrime, which costs the world hundreds of millions of dollars every year ¢ The loss of sensitive business information, including possible stock market manipulation 3. 10175/ 4 faces-BLACKOUTS-cyber-hackers-threaten-energy- supplies * Opportunity costs, including service and employment disruptions, and reduced trust for online activities ¢ The additional cost of securing networks, insurance, and recovery from cyber attacks * Reputational damage to the hacked company Put these together and the cost of cybercrime and cyber espionage to the global economy is probably measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars. To put this in perspective, the World Bank says that global GDP was about $70 trillion in 2011. A $400 billion loss—the high end of the range of probable costs—would be a fraction of a percent of global income. But this begs several important questions about the full benefit to the acquirers and the damage to the victims from the cumulative effect of cybercrime and cyber espionage’. THE PHILIPPINE THREAT LANDSCAPE This section of the document provides a background on the early initiatives that the government has undertaken to start estab- lishing security in our cyberspace as well as citing cases of threats and recent breaches into the government system. The Context of Cybersecurity in the Philippines The dynamic and fluid changes in the cyber environment make the challenges, risks, and threats more complex. The government is 5 symantec/docs/reports/istr-21-2016-en.pdf 6 ber-bank- ing-swift-exclusive-idUSKCNOXM2DI 11 cognizant of these facts and realities of the virtual environment. Information as a critical asset of the government, the pulic and private sector and down to the individuals that reside within our computer sytems, network systems, or application systems must be protected and secured from being compromised or breached. As early as 1965, laws have already been passed to protect people and property and to prosecute individuals or a group of individuals who violate and cause harm to our right to privacy of information or those who seek to compromise our system. To cite a few, we have the Anti-Wire Tapping Act of 1965 and the Electronic Commerce Act of 2000. In 2004, the Arroyo Administration has included in its priority the agenda of establishing a National Cybersecurity Plan. This became one of the main reference documents when the Information Security a Incident Response Manual was crafted in 2013 through the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Office. On September 2015, the Executive Order No. 189 which created the National Cybersecurity Inter-Agency Committee or NCIAC was signed. The creation of the National NCIAC is a necessary undertaking reflective of its vision towards creating a safe Philippine Cyberspace. One of the most important aspects in the creation of the NCIAC is to have one direction in the coordination between government agencies and other relevant sectors. This provides an avenue in building a consensus that requires national attention, and immediate decision and action such as the pre-paration of appropriate and effective measures to strengthen cybersecurity capabilities against existing and future cyber threats.

Center for Strategic and International Studies. McAfee. July 2013 12 To adapt to the fluid state of changes of the information and communications technologies, the Internet and cyberspace, the Philippine Congress passed into law on May 23, 2016 the Republic Act No. 10844 which is The Creation of the DICT. Under R.A. 10844, it paved the way for a National Agency to focus and address ICT- related issues and matters. Incidentally, the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (R.A. 10175) which constituted the creation of the Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center (CICC) and the National Privacy Commission which was created through the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (R.A. 10172). In the creation of the DICT, the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC), the CICC and the NPC were placed under the Department as attached agencies. The Threats On March 2016, the server of the Philippine Voters’ Database was reportedly hacked by Anonymous Philippines in which at least 54 million sensitive data® was leaked into the Internet, including 1.3 million passport numbers of Filipinos working overseas. According to common news articles reported by various newspapers, the breach into the system occurred through the use of SQL injection. The alleged hacker was arrested by the National Bureau of Investigation after the IP address was discovered and tracked down. In 2016, at least 68 government wesites have been subjected? to attacks including attempts 8 Comelec-hack-data-breach.html of hacking, defacement, and Distributed Denial of Service or DDOS. The Philippines is no stranger to being a victim of cyber-espionage. A Finland-based security firm reported”? in 2016, that a malware was found targeting confidential information of government and private organization. The malicious virus called Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is often disguised as an innocent file but once it has been opened, it releases a virus into the victim’s computer and gathers intelligence to be sent back to the attacker. SOURCES OF THREATS Cyber criminals There are two interrelated forms of criminal activity that increase the risks of the potential threat against information assets of government, public, and private sectors and trickles down to ordinary individuals: Cyber-enabled criminals These are traditional crimes that are perpetuated, magnified, and increased in scale or reach through the use of computers, computer networks, and other forms of Information and Communications Technology or ICT (e.g. cyber-enabled fraud and data theft). Cyber-dependent criminals These are crimes that can be committed through the use of ICT devices. These devices become an instrument for both committing the crime and the target of the crime (e.g. hacking to steal data, developing and propaga-ting malware to be used to intrude and breach systems for financial gains, disruptions of network systems, etc.). 13 Most of the organized cybercriminal groups operating in the South East Asia Pacific region are hosted by the criminal market place services in Central Asia, South East Asia, as well as West Africa. It is also difficult for the Philippines and international law enforcement agencies to prosecute them when there is limited jurisdiction or no extradition agreements. Malware that are developed and deployed are increasingly advancing and their impacts are not fully documented in the Philippines as we have yet to establish a National Database for computer incidences. The increasing use of ransomware and threats of distributed denial of service (DDOS) are just examples of how these cybercriminals are becoming increasingly aggressive and confrontational. 9 philstar.comheadlines/2016/07/16/ 1603250/68-govt-websites-attacked Hacktivist Hacktivist groups are motivated by issue and mostly function in decentralized fashion. Some schools of thought are espousing the idea that web defacement and replacing them with political messages is an exercise of their freedom of speech. They select their targets based on their perceived grievances. There is a vigilante qua-lity to their acts, as demonstrated by the hackers who attacked a certain government website. Their methods of attacks are mostly defacement and distributed denial of service (DDoS). However, some hacktivists are able to inflict greater and often lasting damage to some of their victims. 10 South-China-Sea-RAT-cyber-attack-Philippines.html 14 Script kiddies Attention has not been fully given to these so-called script-kiddies, but they are threats nonetheless. They are generally less skilled individuals. However, if they know how to access the black market, there are services and even hacking guides available and can be accessed through the Internet. However, these script kiddies have not been fully assessed in terms of the damage and impact they can effect towards their target organizations. Terrorists Terrorists operate with specific intent and motive and that is to create chaos and terror to the public. Some terrorists use the Internet as an effective recruitment tool for vulnerable target groups or individuals. Although their technical capabilities are generally low, the low sophistication of their disruptive activity (defacement or DDoS) will have an impact even in moderate scale. Furthermore, as they exploit the Internet to recruit talents and even exchange technical skills, the opportunity of being able to enlist an established insider is likely to increase as well. Non-State and State-sponsored threats Countries with technical capabilities to attack other states are increasing. The first world countries are most prone to frequent attacks. However, other countries like the Philippines may be used as launch pads to attack other states either by another state or through state-sponsored attacks. Developed nations continuously improve their capabilities to deflect, defend and deter these attacks ata steady pace. But by the same token, states with technical capability to attack these developed nations, often use basic tools and techniques against vulnerable targets frequently exploiting discovered gaps between the systems of these states because of poor defenses. These attacks are no longer confined within espionage but there are hostile threat actors that have developed and deployed cyberattacks with destructive objectives. Therefore, all states are at risk and can have their national security threatened from potential attacks through the Cll and overriding the industrial control systems. Thus, the Philippine Government through DICT shall mandate that Cll protection and security are prioritized by Cll owners following the minimum guidelines that shall be set by the National Government based on the plan. Insiders Insiders and trusted employees are at the top of the food chain that is frequently exploited by criminal groups, terrorists, hacktivists, or non-state and state-sponsored attackers through social engineering, clicking on phishing email, plugging infected USB into a computer, or ignoring security procedures of the organization. Although some may be unintentional actions, their privileged access to the systems and data can create as much adverse impact and damage to the organization. 15 THE NATIONAL STRATEGIC CONTEXT THE NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY PLAN 2022 This section covers the general details of the strategy, including the implementation plan for NCSP, since this document shall be the blueprint for the protection of the Cll of the government, public and private networks. The strategy is still a work in progress and will be reviewed for improvement ona regular interval concurrent with its implementation. It will follow the PDCA Cycle (Plan — Do > Check — Act). However, the priority program areas will be the starting point in establishing and working towards the goal of reaching a mature cybersecurity state. Results in the implementation of the plan shall be monitored closely and regularly. Data shall be collected from stakeholders and shall be collated into a national database for incidences on cyberattacks, intrusion attempts or disruption of systems, and other sources of threats whether intentional or accidental. Initial metrics that have been prepared and proposed within this strategy shall be agreed upon by the stakeholders to create ownership and involvement among everyone. The following sections describe the general areas that will be prioritized. THE NCSP 2022 VISION The National CyberSecurity Plan 2022 shares its vision to reach the state of having a “Trusted and Resilient Infostructure.” In order to accomplish this state, the following mission objectives have been determined: a. To systematically and methodically harden the Critical Information Infrastructure (Cll) for resiliency; b. To prepare and secure government Infostructure; c. To raise awareness in the business sector on cyber risk and use of security measures among businesses to prevent and protect, respond and recover from attacks; and d. To raise awareness of individuals on cyber risks among users as they are the weakest links, they need to adopt the right norms in Cybersecurity. Metrics shall be developed to monitor the implementation progress of the plan based from the above objectives. There are three guide questions that will aid in jumpstarting the cybersecurity strategy of government agencies. The strategy can be replicated and adopted by agencies as it is rolled out and cascaded to the smallest unit of the government. i. Where are we now? (Conduct of inventory of information assets, information systems, computer systems, network systems, and security systems) ii. What do we want to achieve? (Setting, aligning, and harmonizing cybersecurity targets of each agency with NCSP) iii. How do we get there? (Establishing the roadmap) 11 Department of Justice - Office of Cybercrime. Na- tional Cybercrime Strategy 2016-2022. pp. 3 STRATEGIC INITIATIVES The strategic initiatives of the government focus on the technical, administrative and procedural measures. The strategy shall cover strategic programs for: a. Enhancing security resilience of the Cll and government, public, and military networks to deal with sophisticated attacks; b. Increasing efforts to promote adoption of cybersecurity measures among individuals and businesses; and c. Growing pool of cybersecurity experts. THE NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK In the development of the National Cybersecurity Framework, one has to understand the interrelationship\" between cybersecurity and cybercrime. Cybersecurity and cybercrime can be distinguished in the context of the law. Cybersecurity relates to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer systems, network systems, information systems, and other areas related to the protection of information assets. Therefore, the framework focuses on technical, administrative, and procedural measures that will protect critical infrastructure andincrease resilience of ICT and ICT-enabled environments. Cybercrime relates to the penal law that punishes crimes’? committed with the use of computer systems or in some cases, attacks by the criminals on the system itself. It pertains to the crimes that affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and computer systems. 12 Section 4 (a) of Republic Act No. 10175. (2012). 17 Fe) — { ie | -—— ae {ae ) {alii } a | = Prosecution from cyber incidents Coordinate cyber threat investigations Prosecute Cybercrimes NATIONAL CYBERINTELLIGENCE PLATFORM: SHARED SITUATIONAL AWARENESS SH eS a COORDINATE WITH PUBLIC, PRIVATE, AND INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS The thrust of the cybersecurity framework is to build the trust and confidence on ICT and cyberspace. Cybercrime on the other hand, has its strategy anchored on crime prevention and criminal justice to ensure that the rule of law applies in ICT and cyberspace. In other words, cybercrime focuses on investigation and prosecution (reactive state) while cybersecurity is on security and protection (proactive state). Figure 2 illustrates how the concept was developed. The Framework is composed of three layers where all three key players are interrelated but have distinct functions. Their sets of activities are planned and programmed according to their mandates. However, these activities shall work in synergy with its counterparts through a cooperative, collaborative, and coordinated environment. The driver for the framework is the strategy under NCSP. The apex of the pyramid also illustrates the interrelationship between all key players and its corresponding roles to implement the NCSP. Emphasis is given also on the importance of collaborating with public, private, and international partners. The next layer indicates that sharing of intelligence such as data and information is crucial to identifying potential threats, simulating scenarios, studying threats and incidences, or developing innovative measures through continuous monitoring and evaluation of information shared by stakeholders in a timely manner. The middle layer shall establish an environment for sharing situational awareness. The concept of sharing of information acts as an enabler for integrated operational actions which can be orchestrated simultaneously or in parallel with one another is invaluable to the entire lifecycle of incident resoonse management. The bottom layer is where responses to incidences and events are recorded, monitored, evaluated, and analyzed which will provide input to improvements on processes, policies, guidelines, or procedures. As stated earlier, the country’s cybersecurity capabilities are still at its infancy stage, therefore, the core framework in the protection of the Cll shall adopt the NIST Cybersecurity Framework® asa starting point with the following core functions: Identify — Protect — Detect > Respond — Recover. The activities under these functions can be conducted concurrently and continuously. In developing the policy to implement the strategy using the framework, the government through DICT shall adopt the proactive approach instead of being reactive. We have to think and strategize a couple of steps ahead of the cybercriminals. The government must take necessary measures to be adaptable to the future social changes and potential risks through constant and continuous analysis of information and data that have been gathered. 13 National Institute of Standards and Technology.(2014).Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity Version 1.0. 20 THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES Framing of the vision, its objectives and creating the framework is guided with the principles on the following: The Rule of Law Cyberspace is a vast place with many new and emerging areas still relatively unknown and unexplored. However, the rule of law is as much applied to the cyberspace as it is strongly and strictly observed in the physical world to ensure that there is order in our society. Autonomy and Self-Governance Cyberspace thrives in autonomous systems that are run, managed, and operated by various owners. The Government intends to continue respecting the self-governance that cyberspace has developed. The foundation of cyber governance is the ability of every individual or group to be self-reliant and responsible users of the Internet. Every individual or group observes the established universal values and norms such as freedom, democracy, peace, and stability within cyberspace, as it is used by diverse individuals or groups from all over the world. Collaboration with Multi-Stakeholders and International Cooperation Collaborating with multi-stakeholders and establishing international cooperation enables a community of practice where information is shared among these key stakeholders. Layers of defense can be built through the cooperation of the citizens, the businesses and organization, the education providers, governments, and the whole society in general. Protection and prevention from multi-dimension groups will minimize and manage these cyberattacks to minimum adverse impact. Balance between Free Flow of Information and Privacy Rights of Individuals The rights of every individual to have equal access to the Internet are upheld at all times. However, balance must be made between protecting the privacy of the individual against securing protection of information and data of the users. Risk Based Management Approach is another guiding principle of the strategy. One of its national targets is the protection and security of the Clls. This approach pro- vides a comprehensive preparation in the for- mulation of a Risk Treatment Plan that the government and other relevant sectors will eventually undertake as it evaluates and thor- oughly considers the type of risk appetite of the stakeholders. 21 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES The roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders and key players must be defined so that the functions of each stakeholder will be in synergy with the activities of other stakeholders. The strategy provides clarity in the relationship and interrelationship among the stakeholders. The job of making sure that cyberspace is safe and secure is a collective effort that is shared by each and every one of us. The government is just a single piece in the macrocosm of cyberspace. Individuals have a large role to play since it is the biggest population base in the internet. In the same manner that we put value of securing our personal assets in the physical world, the same consciousness of practice must be observed in cyberspace. The cyber environment is vast and the capacity of the government to patrol the cyber community is limited. However, the individuals who created the cyber community may act as a force multiplier and provide a neighborhood watch against malicious individuals prowling the Internet. The heads of industry organizations are drivers of our economy. Institutions such as banking systems composed of our financial institutions, together with the business sector, create one of the pillars of our country’s economy. Table 1 provides a brief description of the governments functions and mandates and the interrelationship of processes as well as interdependencies of the key players in keeping our information systems, computer systems, and network systems accessible, available, and functioning at all times and free from any interruptions or disruptions, whether intended or unintended. i 22 ¢ Extend immediate assistance for the suppression of real-time commission of cybercrime offenses through a computer emergency response team (CERT) Coordinate the preparation of appropriate and NATIONAL AGENCY Ensure the rights of individuals to privacy and confidentiality of their personal information Ensure the security of critical ICT infrastructure Ensure the security of information assets of the goverments, individuals, and businesses, Provide oversight over agencies governing and regulating ICT sector Ensure consumer protection and welfare, data privacy, and security Formulate a national cybersecurity plan Formulate, recommend, and implement national policies, plans, programs, and activities related to cybersecurity activities Assist and provide technical expertise to government agencies in the development of guidelines in enforcement and administration of laws, standards, rules, and regulations governing cybersecurity Assess the vulnerabilities of cybersecurity Issue updated security protocols to all government employees in the storage, handling, and distribution of all forms (e.g. digital, electronic, snail mail, etc.) of documents and communications.

KEY AREAS FOR CYBERSECURITY There are several layers in security that the strategy shall focus on and shall prioritize for the development and implementation of its policies, plans, programs, and guidelines for security and protection. To put emphasis, ¢ Investigate, attribute, disrupt, and prosecute cybercrime - Lead domestic national security operations * Conduct domestic collection, analysis, and dissemination of cyber threat intelligence ¢ Support the national protection, prevention, mitigation, and Reena acne Pa Ny Although Table 1 has already described in general the roles and the responsibilities of the major key stakeholders, the governance cybersecurity relates to actions that and management structure shall be fleshed stakeholders must take to establish and out during stakeholders’ consultation to bring maintain security in cyberspace.

Roles and Responsibilities of Heads of Agencies It is also noteworthy to mention that the heads of agencies are the first line of defense in the protection of the Cll. The following functions shall also be mandatory to their existing functions and the functions of their agencies: i. Assess the risk and magnitude of the harm that could result from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information or information systems that support operations or assets under their control; ii. Determine the levels of information security appropriate to protect such information and information systems; iii. Implement policies and procedures to cost-effectively reduce risks to an acceptable level; and iv. Conduct periodic testing and evaluation implementing the protection of Cll. Information Security Information security talks about confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity, and nonrepudiation, of information as an asset of the organization. We look at the strategy from a multi-dimensional perspective. As mentioned earlier, the digitization of the world has made everything interconnected and interdependent, from man to machine through ICT enabled- technology, internet, mobile-based devices, or smart devices (the concept of Internet of Things or loT). This is achieved through the application of policy, education, training and awareness, and technology. The government aims to institutionalize information security across all government agencies down to the smallest operating units of the government. The NCSP shall provide the guidelines and the minimum compliance requirements to jumpstart implementation of information security in the government. 14 International Organization for Standardization. (2012). Information Technology — Security Techniques - Guidelines for Cybersecurity,1st Edition (ISO/IEC 27032:2012). Published in Switzerland Application Security Application security is a process performed to apply control and measurements to application systems to manage deployment and use risks. These controls and measurements are applied to the application itself (e.g. processes, components, software, and results), to the data (e.g. configuration data, user data, organization data), and to all technology, processes and stakeholders involved in the application’s life cycle. When we develop the applications, security should be embedded and stressed into every stage of the System Life Cycle Development (SLDC). Security assessment of applications is conducted after it is developed and these issues are fixed. There are malicious actors whose only intention is to break into the computer systems and network systems to damage them, whether for fun or for profit. OOO Ce UOT TUCO COCO Ce Conducting application testing on a regular basis will mitigate and identify system vulnerabilities. Currently, vulnerability assessments for applications developed are not fully implemented and institutionalized across all government agencies, especially those that operate critical systems. Network Security Network security covers design, implementation, and operation of networks to achieve the purpose of information security on networks within the government and public network, between these networks, and between government and public network and the users. Intrusion detection methods and traffic analysis are one of the most basic security measures we can implement to ensure the security of our systems. Auditing and 26 monitoring our networks and perimeter systems require a thorough understanding of our network architecture and how attackers can exploit gaps in between these network systems. Technological advancement and the growing number of available of network hacking tools have increased the threats into our systems. As a way to combat the growing problem, inventory of devices that are connected into our network is recommended. The strategy includes the inventory of the government and public network. Internet Security The objective of internet security is to protect internet-related services and ICT systems and networks as an extension of network security in organizations including in the privacy of homes. It also ensures the reliability and availability of internet services. Everyone uses the internet. The risks that the internet poses such as data and information that flows across the cyberspace through a series of computers and network links are highly likely to happen. Various threats over the internet must be fully understood. One of the vulnerable groups with high exposure in the internet is small business-owners, especially since the use of the e-commerce platform has gained momentum. Raising the awareness will help reduce the risks and the vulnerabilities. 15 Harp, D. , Gregory-Brown, B.

The critical information infrastructure also known as the critical infostructure (CII) plays a vital role in our economy. Adopting the approach of Integrating Information Technology with Operational Technology in protecting critical infrastructure is essential to the objectives. When Operational Technology” (consist of hardware and software systems to monitor and control industrial controls including building control systems, air/land/sea transportation control systems, etc.) is deployed together with Information Technology” (refers to application of computers to transmit, processes and store data the security defense in depth becomes robust. The purpose of converging these two methods will ensure protection of both the front and back ends from intrusion and potential attacks. In 2001, the Government indicated that the list” of “critical infrastructure includes, without limitation, power plants, power transmissions and distribution facilities, oil and gas depots, key public work structures, vital communications installations, public and 16 Harp, D. , Gregory-Brown, B.

The NCSP 2022 expanded this list and adopted the Cll list from the Cybersecurity Strategy of Singapore . The list includes, but not limited to, government and emergency services, business process outsourcing, healthcare, media, banking, financial, bower, water, telecommunications, transport and logistics. This was also classified according to Services, Utilities, and Transport that cuts across all sectors. Our Cll must have the resiliency to operate against information security risk, network security risk, Internet security risk, and cybersecurity risk. Furthermore, government’s commitment to protect itself and public Cll starts with adopting clear policy objectives at the highest level of government. The strategy shall include the steps to enhance the security level components of information system and networks that constitute Cll. Risk assessment shall be conducted based on the analysis of vulnerabilities and threats to the Cll. A periodic review on the national risk management process will help implement the risk management strategy at every level. It is however emphasized, that the owners of Clls will have the primary responsibility to secure and protect these systems. The government can only do so much having very limited resources such as manpower and financial resources. But together with other system and Cll owners, we will be able to create multi-layers of security and defend our cyberspace and protect our Cll. 18 Singapore’s Critical Infrastructure Sectors, Singapore’s Cybersecurity Strategy, pp. 11 CLASSIFICATION OF NATIONAL SECURITY SYSTEM The term national security system means, “any information’? system (including telecommunication system) used or operated by any agency or outsourced to a third party by an agency”: The function, operation, or use of which: The function, operation or use of which: i. Involves intelligence activities; ii. Involves cryptologic activities related to national security; iii. Involves Command and control of military forces; iv. Involves equipment that is integral part of a weapon or weapons system; or v. Critical to the direct fulfillment of military or intelligence missions. Protected at all times by procedures established for information that have been specifically authorized under criteria in an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept classified in the interest of national security or foreign policy. Exclusions from National Security System Clarification There is also the need to have a distinction between a National Security System (NSS) and those that are not covered by the parameters for classifying the NSS. The systems that are not included are systems 19 National Institute of Standards and Technology. (2003). Information Security: Guideline for Identifying an Information System as a National Security System (NIST-SP 800-59). U.S. Department of Commerce. Barker, W.C. 28 that are used for routine administrative and business applications (including but not limited to payroll, finance, logistics, and personnel management applications). RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH The methodologies for Cll protection is through the Risk Management Approach. The government shall manage its risks in the protection of the Cll by identifying, analyzing, and evaluating risks. The management of the risk must be integrated into the overall governance, strategy, planning, implementation, management, reporting processes, policies, values and culture”°. Guidelines for implementing the risk management approach shall be formulated by the government through DICT. Under the guidelines, critical systems and Cll owners Shall formulate their risk man- agement policy based on its mission critical objectives, business processes and opera- tional environment needs. Risk Assessment To implement the risk-based management approach, the government must conduct the three stages of risk assessment: identification, analysis, and evaluation. In the formulation of the risk evaluation criteria, the primary and mandatory consideration shall be on the NSS and Cll. The risk management policy that government agencies shall develop appropriate to their agency’s mandate and mission, must be aligned with NCSP vision and mission objectives. 20 International Organization for Standardization. (2012). Risk Management — Principles and Guidelines (ISO/IEC 31000:2009). Published in Switzerland. 29 STRATEGIC COLLABORATION Establish National Level Committee National Cybersecurity Inter-Agency Committee (NCIAC) The National Cybersecurity Inter-Agency Committee (NCIAC) was created in 2015 though Executive Order No. 189. This initiative of creating a single coordinating NCIAC is geared towards a more efficient and effective strategic planning and implementation of measures with an ultimate goal of strengthening cybersecurity capabilities against existing and future cyber threats and all other challenges with respect to cyberspace. The National CIAC would serve as a centralized hub to harmonize and integrate national efforts relating to cybersecurity. Cybercrime Investigation and Coordination Center (CICC) The Cybercrime Investigation and Coordina- tion Center was created through the Cyber- crime Prevention Act of 2012 (R.A. 10175) function as a coordinating body. The CICC also facilitates collaboration, cooperation, support, and participation from multistake- holders and the international bodies for cy- bersecurity related activities. Public Private Partnership Public Private Partnership Forums The government cannot take on the challenges and threats from cyberspace by itself. However, creating environments such as forums for sharing and exchanging information will provide an avenue for a public-private partnership. The first step to a partnership is to have a good communication relationship with its stakeholders. International Collaboration The strategy shall not only focus its efforts on local and domestic colla-boration with its partner and counterpart agencies for cybersecurity related matters, but shall also forge internatio-nal collaboration. As the government prepares the environment for coordination, partnership, and collaboration across all levels and sectors of the government and society, the concept shall also encou-rage the creation of a Community of Practice. Thereby upholding one of its guiding principles, collaboration with multi-stakeholders shall also help build the cornerstones of a resilient |CT-enabled governance. 30 KEY STRATEGIC INITIATIVES The implementation of the NCSP, as indicated previously, hinges on the national priority targets and the underpinning principles that will also guide the formulation and preparation of its implementation plan. Thus, there are five strategic initiatives that shall be orchestrated under the DICT. KEY PROGRAM AREAS PROTECTION OF Cll As our government works towards digital governance, the support infrastructures that power our virtual environment must be able to sustain operation before, during, or after any cyber incidences or attacks. To fully understand the importance of the critical information infrastructure in the digitization of our government, we look at how this was described”: information components supporting the critical infrastructure, and/or; information infrastructure supporting essential components of government business, and/or; information infrastructure essential to the national economy. For the purpose of this document, we shall define critical information infrastructure as, “critical infostruture whose failure or limited operation due to natural or man-made disasters would surely cause a tremendous impact on the majority of citizens.” However in order to bring everyone on the same page, this document will adopt the elements of infostructure, whether physical or virtual, cited under the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 20127 as follows: computer systems, and/or networks, and/or computer programs, computer data and/or traffic data. H O oO ® 21 Mansfield, N. Organization for Economic Co-Oper- ation and Development. Development of Policies for Protection of Critical Information Infrastructure. 2007. South Korea. Furthermore, it is also emphasized that such infostructure is so vital that interference and/ or destruction of such systems and assets will have debilitating impact on national security, economic security, national public health, public safety and order. To determine and establish the resiliency of our Clls, the government will focus on two major activities that will help establish the baseline for our cybersecurity capability and capacity in the protection of our critical infostructure: Compliance and Assessment and 2) National Drill Exercises. The compliance and assessment shall be composed of three levels:1) Protection As- sessment (inventory level), 2) Security Assessment (readiness) and, 3) Compliance to Cyber Risks to Cll (voluntary). Cybersecurity Assessment and Compliance i. Protection Assessment Project (ICT Systems) ii. Security Assessment Project (Readiness) iii. Certificate of Compliance to Cyber Risks to Cll(Voluntary Program) The strategic initiative of protecting the Cll under levels 1 and 2 shall become a standard practice and will work as complementary to the preparation of the Information Systems Strategic Plan (ISSP) of any government agency. Since the ISSP is the blueprint of the digital environment of a government agency, this is an appropriate vehicle to ensure that compliance and assessment are institutionalized during implementation and 22 R.A. No. 10175, Sec. 3 (j). 32 becomes embedded into the regular programming of a government unit. Level 3 on the other hand is a voluntary program where government agencies may be assessed by a third party institution (Certifying Body or other institutions that promote compliance to standards). This program, although still proposed as a voluntary program, in turn will institutionalize the goal of implementing a resilient ICT environment for the government. However, agencies and organizations classified as Cll shall have mandatory compliance to Level 3 and government agencies and organizations with sytems that have been classified under National Security System shall be compliant with the requirements relevant to standards on Information Security (ISO/IEC 27000). Establish Program for National Cyber Drills and Exercises After establishing the baseline results for assessment and compliance, government units shall participate in National Cyber Drills and Exercises. This shall become a mandatory compliance for all government agencies in order to sustain the development of our cybersecurity towards the desired maturity level of our systems. Figure 3 illustrates the cybersecurity maturity model?? and the agility state we desire to achieve the Resilient Enterprise. We will not be able to defend well if we do not know our strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, in conducting a self-assessment, the level of the agility and speed of response during cyber-attacks must be determined. At Reactive and Manual state, a doctrine and the primary concern is to put out fires as opposed to finding the cause of the fire and preventing the fire from spreading. At the Tools-Based state, tools and technologies are used to assist people in reacting faster. At the Integrated Picture state, the focus is on interoperability where standards are based on data exchange for situational awareness. At the Dynamic Defense state, operation functions are ona predictive and agile level because the events are reviewed and analyzed to help the responders and operators identify, detect, mitigate, and recover from these attacks. At the Resilient Enterprise state, the objective is predictive and mission-focused to isolate and contain damage, secure supply chains, and protect key critical infrastructure to continue operation through cyber-attacks. 4) ® & & 23 Lentz, R.(2011.)[PowerPoint slides]. 33 ADVANCED PERSISTANT THREAT CONVENTIONAL THREAT TH RE AT TY PE S AGILITY / SPEED OF ACTION >» ® B c REACTIVE & MANUAL TOOLS-BASED INTEGRATEDPICTURE DYNAMICDEFENSE RESILIENT ENTERPRISE Figure 3: Cybersecurity Maturity Model The cybersecurity maturity level of the country is still mostly at a Reactive and Manual state. The goal of NCSP is to reach the state of developed resiliency and the ability to sustain Operations during and after cyber-attacks. The NCSP is the roadmap that will enable the government to reach the Resilient Enterprise state. Establish National Database for Monitoring and Reporting Currently, the country has no single authority that manages a national database and monitors threat reports, including intrusion attempts and other computer incidences. The data and information remain in silo with different agencies. To effectively identify and protect our Cll against potential threat attacks, complete information source and availability of data must be accessible at all times to authorized government agencies and personnel. The data and information that are collected can be used for research and development, policy updates and formulation, threat analysis, analysis of emerging trends and patterns, etc. Reporting** of security breaches and intrusion attempts including other computer incidences or events shall be mandatory to all government agencies including agencies and offices that have centralized collection and repository of information. The data and information that have been collected shall become a valuable component for developing and preparing innovative measures in protecting and defending our cyberspace. 24 Data Privacy Act of 2012. R.A No. 10173 Section 20 (c )(4) and (f).(2012) 34 PROTECTION OF GOVERNMENT NETWORKS The government in its national security policy?> has recognized the growing dependence of government, transportation, industries, and economy on all components of cyberspace. The growing dependence increases the level of exposure and vulnerability to cyberattacks. These are cyberattacks that could lead to the paralysis of communication infrastructure, international financial systems, critical government services and defense/military command and control systems. Establishment of a National Computer Emergency Response Program A program for the national computer emergency shall be established and guidelines shall be formulated to aid government agencies in the event of a cyberattack or cyber incidents, including prolonged cyberattacks. A well-prepared emergency response protocol should become part of the operational environment of any government agency down to the local government unit. The program shall include the development and formulation of the Computer Emergency Strategic Communications Plan. This shall form part of the National Drill Exercise which shall be done on a periodic interval. Establishment of CISO Programs in Government Agencies To implement the strategy efficiently, it is recommended that CISO Programs are 25 National Security Council.(2011).National Security Policy 2011-2016: Securing the Gains of Democracy, pp.20. SECURITY-POLICY-2011-2016.pdf established into Government Agencies and the Local Government Units. CISOs have an important role to play in security governance. The general responsibilities® of a CISO includes but not limited to: i. Integrating information security measurement into the process for planning, implementing, evaluating, and documenting remedial actions to address any deficiencies in the information security policies, procedures, and practices of the agency; ii. Obtaining the adequate financial and human resources to support information security measurement program development and implementation iii. Leading the development of any internal guidelines or policy related to information security measures; iv. Using information security measures in support of the agency’s CIO’s annual report to the agency head on the effectiveness of the agency’s information security proggram, including progress of remedial actions; v. Conducting information security measures development and implementation; vi. Ensuring that a standard process is used throughout the agency for information security measures development, creation, analysis, and reporting; and vii. Using information security measures for policy, resource allocation, and budget decisions. 26 National Institute of Standards and Technology. (2008).

Chew, E., Swanson, M., Stine, K., Bartol, N., Brown, A. & Robinson, W. 35 The strategy requires that agencies provide appropriate protection of their resources through implementing a comprehensive information program. The program that each agency implements should be commensurate to the sensitivity of the information being processed, transmitted, and stored within the information systems of the agency. The CISO Program shall be jumpstarted with a series of training and capacity building activities to fully equip personnel who shall be given the assignment to function as a CISO in an agency. Establishment of the Computer Emergency Response Structure The Computer Emergency Response Program shall be composed of the National CERT, Government CERTs and the Sectoral CERTs. The National CERT is the highest body for cybersecurity related activities. All CERTsS, Government CERTS, Sectoral (or Private) CERTS, as well as organizational CERTs shall coordinate and report incidences to the National CERT. Figure 4 illustrates the hierarchy of the Computer Emergency Response structure in the country. However, the CERTs all over the country shall also conduct real-time coordination?’ with CICC as provisioned in the law. i.

Organizational Computer Emergency Response Team (Organization Level CERT) Apart from establishing the hierarchy of CERT in the country, governance structure shall be clearly defined to make the implementation of the NCSP efficient and the monitoring of its progress and milestones more effective to ensure that the plan shall be on target with its objectives until 2022. Basic Computer Emergency Response Program The strategy will include projects that will provide basic computer emergency response awareness to government IT employees. IT personnel, although they have technical understanding, may not be fully aware of how to respond to a computer security incident that may compromise the system. 27 Cybercrime Prevention Act 2012. R.A No. 10175 Section 26 (a ). 2012 36 Pov Figure 4: Hierarchy of Computer Emergency Response in the Country Building the capability of the CERT of government agencies will take time to be developed and considerable investment for training will have to be planned accordingly. Therefore, the first step is to build the awareness and leveling of the understanding of how computer emergency response works, what to do in the event of the attack, who to report to, and how to deal with the impact of the cyber-attacks. This will serve as preparatory stage while the agencies are still in the organizing stage (CERT building). The government will provide training programs, such as Training of Trainers, Basic Computer Emergency Response, etc. The program shall include regular communication drill exercises to synchronize the communication practices and protocols of all CERTs during cyber-attacks. All CERTS must assign focal personnel to attend meetings and coordination that shall be established and scheduled at regular intervals. The objective of the government is to ensure that communications and coordination with CERTs all over the country are firmly estab- lished as we try to prepare and ensure that we work together towards a resilient ICT environment through Cll protection of government and public networks. Capacity Building and Capability Development Program Cultivating existing talents and developing new ones are long term development plans and the investment shall be substantial. The government needs to acquire and strengthen its capabilities to protect against any cyber threat. This means we need to develop and retain talented and qualified cybersecurity professionals. The government shall engage and collaborate with the academe and other educational institutions to support the development of cybersecurity specialists through curriculum development. Much like the need for skilled workforce to support the Outsourcing Industry, the gap between demand and supply for key cybersecurity roles must be addressed now. The lifeblood of any organization is to have a skilled workforce. The lifeblood to secure our cyberspace is to have skilledcybersecurity specialists. 37 Establish Pool of Information Security and Cybersecurity Experts The government shall maintain a list of Information Security and Cybersecurity Experts. This can be accomplished through several activities: i. Establish Cyber Training Facilities and Certification Programs ii. Promote National Cybersecurity Research and Development Program to attract and cultivate cyber experts iii, Establish Training Programs to Develop Cybersecurity Specialist iv. Promote Communities of Practice (COP) Establish Threat Intelligence and Analysis Operations Center One of the long term programs of the strategy is to establish a Threat Intelligence and Analysis Operations Center. The concept is mainly to provide a facility to house Research and Development, Testing Laboratories and Live Test of Threats and Threat Scenario Simulators. The National Database provides a repository of information from all over the country to gather data and intelligence that are analyzed on a regular basis by technically competent Analysts. Data collection and intelligence gathering are two basic methods for developing and building up our defense in depth. Building the competence of our threat intelligence and analyst through studying the various cyber incidences and cyber-attacks will improve our capability and capacity against future cyberattacks. The government through CICC and NCERT shall coordinate and collaborate with other government agencies with existing facilities that function as threat intelligence and analysis operations center. i. DND Cyber Defense Center ii. NSC Threat Operations Center iii, AFP Cyber Command iv. NICA Cyber Intelligence and Attribution Center Protection of Electronic Government Transactions There are enabling laws such as the Electronic Commerce Act of 200078 which provides the basis?° for employing cryptography as a means to protect the integrity and authenticity of the documents that are processed during government transactions. The Plan shall provide recommendations on policies that will have impact on the digitization of government transaction and formulate guidelines that will include the protection of the electronic document in transit, at rest, or during processing using cryptography tools. Update of Licensed Software Software patches, and software (including hardware devices such as servers, network devices, etc.) approaching its end of life cycle support are also potential sources of threats. The NCSP strategy requires that all departments, bureaus, offices, and other agencies of the national government including constitutional commissions, congress, the judiciary, state universities and colleges, government owned or controlled corporation, and the local government units, shall exercise mandatory review of all its existing software licenses, machines and devices to ensure that all necessary components are up to date and are still well within its life cycle period. For protection of Military Networks, there will be a Militaryy Computer Emergency Program. Under which is the DND Defense Situation Monitoring Center for Policy and the AFP Cyber Command for Operations. For intelligence, a Threat Analysis Center will be established under the NSC. The operating arm will be the NICA Cyber Intelligence and Attribution Center. 28 Electronic Commerce Act of 2000. R.A. 8792. 2000. PROTECTION OF SUPPLY CHAIN National Common Criteria Evaluation and Certification Program i. ICT Equipment Security Evaluation and Certification Project ii. Benchmarking Project The challenges in cybersecurity are multi-dimensional. Therefore, the need to approach it from a multi-disciplinary perspective is important. The objectives of Supply Chain Protection are to promote secure and efficient movement of goods and foster a supply chain system that is prepared for and can withstand evolving threats and hazards, and the ability to rapidly recover from disruptions. In order to achieve this, the strategy will work on enhancing the risk management efforts that will include addressing unknown risks to managing the risk in the supply chain. Apart from the strategy of employing the risk management approach, the government will also employ the common criteria to determine compliance of the supplier, as well as establishing the guidelines to conduct benchmarking to ensure that the ICT equipment are compliant with the established standards of the government. 29 Electronic Commerce Act of 2000. R.A. 8792. Sec. 11 (b). 2000 338 PROTECTION OF INDIVIDUALS The protection of every citizen of the country is primary to the functions of the government. Protection is not only confined to the physical environment but also applies to the cyber environment. To protect the individuals, cybersecurity awareness level must be increased. The government will not be able to combat and address every single adverse event that occurs in a cyber environment. However, when we equip the citizens with the right knowledge and their awareness is increased on cybersecurity, half of the battle is already done. Several projects shall be rolled out as a parallel activity for building up our technical capabilities to protect and secure our cyberspace while we raise the community awareness for cybersecurity. Accelerate Learning Skills and Development To implement the strategy for accelerating learning and skills development, there are four (4) objectives that are formulated as bases for developing appropriate programs. a. Stimulate the development of approaches and techniques that can rapidly increase the supply of qualified cybersecurity professionals. i. Integration of subjects on cybersecurity in the higher learning curriculum; ii. Integration of cybersecurity in ladderized programs offered by Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA); 39 iii. Promote advanced programs and specialized courses that reduce the time and cost for obtaining knowledge, skills, and abilities for indemand work roles; iii.i. Promote the use of interactive learning programs such as webinars iv. Encourage the adoption of apprenticeships and cooperative education programs to provide an immediate workforce that can earn a salary while they learn the necessary skills. iv.i. Promote apprenticeships and cooperative programs to relevant institution b. Promote advanced programs and specialized courses that reduce the time and cost for obtaining knowledge, skills, and abilities for in-demand work roles. i. Promote the use of interactive learning programs such as webinars c. Encourage the adoption of apprenticeships and cooperative education programs to provide an immediate workforce that can earn a salary while they learn the necessary skills i. Promote apprenticeships and cooperative programs to relevant institution d. Promote efforts to identify gaps in cybersecurity skills and raise awareness of training that addresses identified workforce needs. Cybersecurity Outreach Project (QUAD Media for multiplier effect) Develop strategic relationships with youth organizations, community- based agencies, and relevant private organizations in the domestic and international scene. a. #PRINT To develop and activate cybersecurity communication platforms thru Print, Radio, Internet and Television: i. Publication/Blogs/Newspaper ii, Radio - Short ad/Jingle/public service announcements (PSA) iii. Build a strong web presence- Website/Social Media Push/Mobile App iv. Television Plugs - Celebrity Ambassador b. Cybersecurity Caravan c. National Cybersecurity Awareness Month d. Government websites to have cybersecurity related content National Cybersecurity Awareness Month Under this strategy, there are five major projects and activities that shall take place until 2022. The goal is to bring the awareness on cybersecurity to a wider audience through these initial project undertaking. Equipping the Government a. Capacity Building for Law Enforcement Agencies i. Judges, Prosecutors b. Training of Trainers Establishment and Creation of Programs for Local and International Cooperation a. Establish cooperation and coordination among CERTs and law enforcement (Cybersecurity and Cybercrime, respectively), academia, and industries; and b. Formulate and prepare capacity building programs for CERTs and law enforcement 40 The NCSP shall also provide the guidelines for establishing and creating programs for local and international cooperation. To create a robust cooperation environment, appropriate communications protocol and methods suitable for communicating with the different stakeholders such as the CERTs and the Law Enforcement Agencies, the academe and the industries must be clearly formulated and established. Furthermore, capacity building programs Shall be implemented back to back with the cooperation program. The cooperation programs also involve policy issues that can be translated and adopted to the country level, together with the appropriate mechanisms. ACTIVE APPROACH Identify The government has to first establish the baseline as well as understand the business context of the organization’s mission critical objectives to ensure that the resources that support the critical functions are provided. There are several of said activities such as Governance, Business Environment, Asset Management, Risk Management Strategy, and Risk Assessment that shall be imple- mented. Protect After identifying and developing organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to the systems, assets, data, industrial controls, and technical capabilities, activities such as Access Control, Data Security, Information Protection Processes and Procedures, Maintenance, Protective Technology, and Awareness and Training shall be prioritized and included into the execution plan to ensure that the NCSP is implemented. Detect The speed and agility of responding to cyberattacks will largely depend on the detection ability and timely discovery of the cybersecurity event. Under this phase, activities such as Anomalies and Events, Security Continuous Monitoring, and Detection Processes are implemented. Respond At this juncture, to respond is to develop and implement the appropriate activities regarding a detected cybersecurity event. Under this phase, activities such as Response Planning, Communications, Analysis, Mitigation and Improvements are implemented. Recover The recovery stage is to develop and implement the appropriate activities to maintain plans for resilience and to restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity event. Under this phase, the activities that will cover the implementation plan shall be Recovery Planning, Improvements, and Communications. PROACTIVE APPROACH Defend In developing our defense mechanism, we have to look at how all kinds of physical ob- jects and people are interconnected by way of the ICTs and the internet. The integration of the physical space and the cyberspace are further magnified through the Internet of Things (loT) phenomenon. Malicious actors in cyberspace are constantly advancing their attack methods. They keep up to date with the latest technological advancement and constantly explore potential gaps within 41 these new offerings that they can exploit. In the implementation of our defense strategy and to build our defense layers, we must engage every citizen, businesses, organizations, academe, and other governments. This will significantly reduce our exposure to cyberattacks, cyber incidents, or cyber threats and will be able to protect our most valuable assets, while allowing the ability to access, operate successfully, and continuously use the internet. The government’s ability to disseminate information must be in a manner and speed appropriate to all types of organization. Timely delivery of information is crucial and important to launch and engage all key stakeholders for a synchronized action to defend our cyberspace and must be simplified. Deter In building up the in-depth defense of any government, organization, or enterprise, the first step is to adopt measures that will deter these cyberattacks. There are several actions that can be adopted to serve as deterrence to an attack. One of which is to raise the level of awareness of cybersecurity. We also need to identify these potential threats and anticipate various scenarios to develop countermeasures and use appropriate measures and tools at our disposal. We need to send the message to these malicious actors that they cannot act with impunity. We need to deny our adversaries the opportunity to compromise our systems and networks by trying to understand their intent and capabilities. The LEAs play a critical role in reducing cybercrime. While we harden our Cll against cyberattacks and reduce vulnerabilities, the LEA will focus efforts through any technical assistance and data sharing from NCERTs in their relentless pursuit of criminals and cybercriminals. Develop The gap between supply and demand for cybersecurity specialists is something that needs to be addressed by the government. In order to address the issue on the supply- demand gap for cybersecurity specialists, an inventory of IT professionals working within the government shall be conducted and specific intervention training programs shall be prepared and developed. Investing into the capacity and capability program should be included in the priority programs. While these short and midterm actions are being implemented, the long term direction shall be on defining and developing the cyber security skills needed across the population. The effort is collaboration among stakeholders from the public sector, academe, and the industry. A review on the Qualification Standards and consultations with the Civil Service Commission, the Department of Budget and Finance and other government agencies shall be conducted to prepare and upgrade the plantilla organization for cybersecurity professionals and specialist who will be recruited for work in the government by making the remuneration package attractive. A Talent Retention Program shall also be planned and prepared for implementation. 42 ME TR IC S C o n t r i b u t i n g to A) o 7 3 n co) } >> n 2) i) v 3) 3 n o 2 ~~ © s ie) fs St ra te gi c O u t c o m e s St ra te gi c O b j e c t i v e s D e f e n s e P r o t e c t «T he g o v e r n m e n t is ab le to es ta bl is h ba se li ne da ta th at pr ov id es de ta il s of th e st at e of cy be rs ec ur it y «I nv en to ry of ph ys ic al de vi ce s an d sy st em s in th e g o v e r n m e n t an d pu bl ic ne tw or ks is c o n d u c t e d « I n v e n t o r y of p l a t f o r m s (s uc h a s s o f t w a r e a n d a p p l i c a t i o n s ) in g o v e r n m e n t a n d pu bl ic n e t w o r k s h a v e b e e n c o n d u c t e d - A s s e t vu ln er ab il it ie s ar e id en ti fi ed a n d d o c u m e n t e d - B a s e l i n e c o n f i g u r a t i o n of i n f o r m a t i o n t e c h n o l o g y / in du st ri al co nt ro l sy st em s is cr ea te d an d ma in ta in ed « A u d i t / l o g r e c o r d s ar e d e t e r m i n e d , d o c u m e n t e d , i m p l e m e n t e d a n d r e v i e w e d b a s e d on th e g u i d e l i n e s ( f o r m u l a t e d u n d e r th e N C S P ) «T he g o v e r n m e n t is ab le to es ta bl is h a na ti on al da ta ba se e. g. cy be r in ci de nc es in cl ud in g, I n f o s t r u c t u r e a t t a c k s a n d in tr us io ns ( s u c c e s s f u l or a t t e m p t s ) , et c. ) « L i n e s of c o m m u n i c a t i o n s b e t w e e n g o v e r n m e n t , pu bl ic , an d pr iv at e se ct or s ar e m a p p e d « R e s o u r c e s (s uc h as h a r d w a r e a n d s o f t w a r e ) ar e pr io ri ti ze d ba se d on th ei r cl as si fi ca ti on : cr it ic al it y an d bu si ne ss va lu e * R e s p o n s e pl an s (I nc id en t R e s p o n s e an d Bu si ne ss Co nt in ui ty ) ar e in pl ac e an d m a n a g e d * R e s p o n s e a n d r e c o v e r y pl an s ar e t e s t e d « V u l n e r a b i l i t y m a n a g e m e n t pl an is d e v e l o p e d a n d i m p l e m e n t e d YO S cou & e & Cex veo i o = @ TOG OH O2c o £€ S £& oO % £z25% oY > * 2c O08 8 mo OY O* r os 05 OS eo °F GU o U0 = VU Ovxz Fe & 05H @ os 9 ESL Fo LS Fn se OO ® ~ wy = — Cc Go To o> os c 2 eo os oeY © 5 Co On ,. o£ > ES°LD = O Y © Ov 5 o 22 8 ~ pop Sf Owe bo Sv LY LOR GR oF EES Sees ° 5 4 9 5=8a4 8 FOL OO | Fors £ ~- £ OF 6 - Oons oo cle Qnrvrree 43 D e t e c t P r o t e c t * C o n d u c t a c a t a l o g u e of e x t e r n a l i n f o r m a t i o n s y s t e m s « Sh ar in g fo ru ms an d so ur ce s ar e es ta bl is he d on th re at an d vu ln er ab il it y in fo rm at io n «E ve nt s ar e re po rt ed an d in fo rm at io n is sh ar ed , wh ic h is co ns is te nt wi th th e re sp on se pl an ¢ V o l u n t a r y i n f o r m a t i o n s h a r i n g o c c u r s wi th e x t e r n a l s t a k e h o l d e r s to a c h i e v e b r o a d e r si tu at io na l a w a r e n e s s « V u l n e r a b l e s e c t o r s in th e s o c i e t y (s uc h as th e y o u t h an d sm al l an d m e d i u m si ze d bu si ne ss ow ne rs ) sh al l be pr io ri ti ze d fo r a w a r e n e s s on c y b e r s e c u r i t y a n a g e m e n t pl an is d e v e l o p e d an d i m p l e m e n t e d > ra . © Dy — 8 O o8 oO w 5 o ov SO y o5 = Oo Ecs S PSone en 28 S2ee eee 2s. a Go GT ONE Y w Ec Oy EQVe 5s 52°26 R 298 BHReeS5SCoVEE DZ gy SeSESESS CESS ZRELZ TEES Gs ve - BEE G2 3 eG SO9F ce GZGEoSvQvs oz GgL52=5 os S822 oae257GF FEHR OBE DG Fae ozeEzszacec HKaAacCaAsSB 0505 8 3G E Yn a) eSoseg os 3 zy ee ~LoFaoPoe 056 YalorD & £ofo5 © fC BQ Le wo cre & oO 0 o WY o MunvMUOVO ES 5 of2uv oe Serodec Anvaxvr=d ow oO 2Zouw ®D Sao 2.0% eoevse %m7YSEE Cec n= GO > > PO YW D oO n ~ oe 58 PV OLR ofr ec O®Ueen 25 o5 £00565 2598 FoezvYormtoges EK 4H O20 0 2600 8 =U eEovoec ~-S D>RBOCDE OL ECE . c TOD S52 RB0GCH CHAS H oof Tasn SSG ECO 44 CONCLUSION CyberSecurity is an evolving field with many international actors at play. As such, it is imperative that a reliable mechanism is in place to address constant updates in the virtual arena, underpinned on the premise of collaboration with allied countries in the fronts of knowledge sharing, coarchitecture of laboratories/training facilities, and mobility exchange. In line with this, to keep abreast with the latest trends, a capacity building program of international standard must be set in place in accordance to the demands of digital forensics, network analytics, and defense conceptualization, among others. Included in the cooperation are detection/mitigation regimes, frameworks for coordination of international originators of attacks, and co-design of stakeholder engagement strategies. Admittedly, the Philippines' state of cybersecurity is still at its infancy stage, even though there have been previous initiatives that have already been undertaken through different agencies, including enabling of the laws that have been promulgated to protect data and information. The NCSP 2022 shall provide the roadmap to make a coherent and cohesive strategy for cybersecurity and act as the enabler for institutionalizing all the initiatives and strategies that have already been started by different government agencies. Furthermore, it will address the issue and challenges of a synchronized defense in the event of an attack because the roles, functions, objectives and goals are clear and well defined. We need to be ready for the disruptive nature that technology brings. This is amplified further by the threats of cyberattacks and disruption of systems (mechanical or human errors), whether accidental or deliberate. We need to work as one in order to combat the challenges that are posed by the dynamic and fluid changes that occur in cyberspace as technology evolves and interconnectivity cuts across all levels of government and society.

Your department plays a crucial role in the   government’s efforts to address the   challenges brought about by global   interconnectivity. | commend the DICT for   crafting this Cybersecurity Plan which aims   to deal with these challenges and improve   our people’s confidence in the ICT sector.   May the implementation of this new   cybersecurity framework enable you to fulfill   your mandate of securing critical ICT infrastructure while ensuring personal data   privacy and confidentiality. It is my hope that you will use this framework in   realizing your role in nation-building through the creation of a cybersecurity   educated society.       | wish you all the best in this endeavor.   rh  RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE   President of the Philippines          MESSAGE  The Philippine government has invested in   Information and Communications Technology (ICT)   infostructure and applications as the cornerstone  for national economic growth. ICT is recognized as   key enabler for economic growth and social   mobility and is expected to improve the quality of  life of people as part of the longterm vision for the   Philippines AmbisyonNatin 2040 and the ASEAN   Masterplan of 2015. Though there is the promise of   acceleration in the nation’s growth via the rapid   development of ICT in the Philippines, this   technology and their applications have introduced   new types of threats such as cybercrime, cyber   espionage, cyber terrorism and cyber warfare to   mention a few. Cyber threats are on the rise, and   are sophisticated and difficult to mitigate; the  imminent threat of cyber crimes to National   Security necessitates that the necessitates that the government must be prepared and in   position to respond and counter adequately these cyber threats.         Given the Philippines’ heavy dependence on ICT to support its economic development   goals, it is imperative that information infrastructure or “infostructure” among others be   resilient, robust, and secure against cyber threats. The National Cybersecurity Plan 2022   was Crafted to establish an environment that will assure trust and confidence in everyone  while using ICT facilities, and ensure that the Philippines is self-reliant and able to protect its   interests, particularly national security. This plan will guarantee the availability of cyber   services and the confidentiality and integrity of information processes, assets, and sensitive  information of Individuals, Businesses, and Government itself.   Pursuant to RA 10844, the Department of Information and Communications Technology   shall ensure the security of critical infostructure including information assets and data of the   government, individuals, and businesses. The Department is working in collaboration with   key stakeholders in Cybersecurity, especially the Cybercrime Investigation and  Coordination Center and the Philippine National Police. As the lead in the formulation of   cybersecurity policies, the Department will periodically review their implementation   progress to ensure that threats of current and potential cyberattacks are addressed   adequately and effectively in a timely and appropriate manner.               RODOLFO & NM MA   Secretary, \\   and CommunicationaTechnology (DICT)         MESSAGE  As we become more and more dependent on   ICT in our daily lives, an equal responsibility to   provide online security should be established.   Through the National Cybersecurity Plan, the   DICT is providing a roadmap for ICT   stakeholders to secure their online   environment. It is the government’s strategy   to safeguard the ICT environment of the   country which will prepare and secure the   government infostructure, systematically   strengthen critical infostructure (CIl) for   resiliency, use security measures among   businesses to protect, prevent, respond, and   recover from attacks especially within Cll and   government supply chains, and raise   awareness of cyber risks among users for empowerment in adopting the right   norms in Cybersecurity.   Accepting the reality that there is no physical or economic security without   cybersecurity, the Department of Information and Communications Technology is   now Officially enforcing the National Cybersecurity Plan 2022 hereby sending a   message that the government is at the forefront of protecting every Filipino in   cyberspace.   Ky  ELISEO M. RIO, J   Undersecretary   Special Concerns            MESSAGE  | The constantly changing times and the advent   have drastically altered the way we perform our   duties and responsibilities. There are certain   groups whose ideology is to destroy the order   of our nation and are now using advanced and   sophisticated technologies to carry out their   plans, thus, the need to develop measures in   protecting and policing the cyberspace has now   become one of the major responsibilities of the   DICT to assure the Filipino people of its safe use   especially in doing business.   The DICT is mandated to establish cybersecurity   measures that would guard the country against   cyber threats. The department will be in the   frontline to protect Philippines’ critical   infostructure, government and military networks, businesses and supply chains, and   the Filipino people through the crafting of a comprehensive and realistic national   cybersecurity plans, policies and programs. DICT will enforce, evaluate, and constantly   monitor these cybersecurity policies through regular assessment and compliance   activities, conduct of annual cyber drills and exercises, and cybersecurity education   and awareness programs.       As cyberspace is borderless in nature, international cooperation will be at the highest   possible level to curb cyber threats and aid our law enforcement authorities,   prosecution services, and cyber defense centers through the establishment of the   National Computer Emergency Response Team (NCERT) that would act as the focal   entity to achieve a safe and resilient cyber community.   Let us be together in the fight against cyber threats as CyberSecurity is not just a   whole of government approach but of the whole Filipino nation.      ALLAN S BANLONG   Assistant\\Sacretary for Cybersecurity   and Enabling Technologies, DICT         MESSAGE  | congratulate the Department of Information and   Communications Technology (DICT) for crafting the   National Cybersecurity Plan (NCSP) 2022.   Online connectivity has been transformed from a   luxury and privilege to a necessity for the Filipino   people. However, the government has been slow in   providing Philippine cyberspace with the proper   measures and safeguards that would enable the   general public to conduct their businesses and   expand their knowledge using online means,   without facing security risks. This is why the NSC   considers cybersecurity as an important part of   EE national security.   One particular importance of cybersecurity is connected with how the government should   deal with security issues on government issued documents. This is because in our intercon-   nected society, the integrity of these documents-which more or less prove our right to be  recognized as Filipino citizens-have become terrifyingly vulnerable to malcontents and our   identity could be compromised as a result.   Cybersecurity comes in by ensuring that the database would be impervious to cyber attacks   and pilferage of data. Ensuring that cybersecurity is in place and addressed by the Philippine   government also has implications on our economic security. Other governments and busi-   nesses would have more confidence in our processes, businesses, and government if we   have more robust and responsive cybersecurity.   In this regard, | look forward to the eventual implementation of the NCSP 2022, as well as to   closer cooperation of the NSC and the DICT on matters of mutual concern.   Mabuhay!   HERMOGENES C. ESPERON, JR.   National Security Adviser and   Director-General, NSC          MESSAGE       Our One Defense Team extends warm felicitations   to the Department of Information and   Communications Technology (DICT) for having   formulated this well-crafted National Cybersecurity   Plan 2022.   Having set forth the DICT’s policy direction within   the National Cybersecurity Strategy Framework,   this plan shall serve as a guide on how you can best   fulfill your mandate of ensuring the privacy and   confidentiality of our citizens’ personal information;   and securing critical ICT infrastructure and   information assets of the government, individuals   and businesses. It shall also improve your provision   of oversight functions to agencies governing and   regulating the ICT sector, strengthen consumer   protection and welfare, ensure data privacy and   security, and foster completion and growth of the ICT sector.   We cannot overemphasize the urgency of protecting the nation’s critical information   structures especially government public and military neworks, to ensure continuous  operations even during crises and emergencies. Thus, we are one with you in instituting   measures to enhance our ability to respond to cybersecurity threats before, during, and   after attacks.   Rest assured of our efforts to assist the DICT in informing and educating our people on   cybersecurity, not only in the workplace but also in our homes, communities, and other   places where we access the Internet. This is the first step toward instilling cybersecurity   consciousness in every Filipino so that we can all contribute in building a safe, secure, and  cyber-resilient nation.   Once more, congratulations to the DICT on the significant accomplishment!   Mabuhay ang Pilipinas! Mabuhay tayong lahat!   DELFIN N.

There   are growing dependencies on these   technologies that include critical functions of   industries and industry control systems. The   newly created Department of Information   and Communications Technology, through its   attached agency, the Cybercrime   Investigation and Coordination Center (CICC),   adapts to the new paradigm with the   comprehensive National Cybersecurity   Strategy Framework.   Te rapid changes in information and   The development of the Framework shall   institutionalize the adoption and   implementation of Information Security   Governance and Risk Management   approaches. These globally recognized   standards shall provide the government a   systematic and methodical practice of   ensuring the protection of our mission critical   and non-critical infostructure. The   government shall build its capability and   capacity for quick response and recovery   through the establishment of the National   Emergency Response Team (NCERT).   Included in the mandates of DICT are to   “ensure the rights of individuals to privacy   and confidentiality of their personal   information; ensure the security of critical ICT   infrastructures including information assets of   the government, individuals and businesses;   and provide oversight over agencies   governing and regulating the ICT sector and   ensure consumer protection and welfare,   data privacy and security, foster competition   and the growth of the ICT sector.”   One of the priority areas that the Department   has to immediately institute is the formulation   of the National Cybersecurity Plan to address   the urgency to protect the nation’s Critical   Infostructures, Government Networks both   Public and Military, Small Medium Enterprises   to Large Businesses and Corporations and its   supply chains, and every Filipino using the   Internet.   The primary goals of this Plan include:   (1) assuring the continuous operation of our   nation’s critical infostructure, and public and   military networks; (2) implementing cyber   resiliency measures to enhance our ability to   respond to threats before, during, and after   attacks; (3) effective coordination with law   enforcement agencies; and (4) a   cybersecurity-educated society.   1. Making Critical Information   Infrastructure (CII) Trusted and Secure   The functions and services of critical   infostructure and those of the governmental   bodies are vital to the country’s socio-   economic activities. Any interruption of these   functions and services can cause direct and   significant consequences to people’s safety   and security; therefore, it is crucial to take   precautionary measures to address potential   threats. It is necessary to take “mission   assurance”-based approaches. Mission   owners should analyze risks and should have   discussions with asset owners in order to   accomplish the functions and services of   critical infostructure or the governmental   bodies. Mission owners should ask   comprehensive decisions of senior executives   by providing information on vulnerabilities   including resultant risks.   ll. Making Government Information   Environment Secure   To respond to cyberattacks, particularly   targeted ones that are apparently aimed at   stealing, damaging, or altering information,   the agency will take government-wide, multi-   layered measures based on the assumption   of cyberattacks. This must also include   contingency plans for this possibility - a   certain entity will be used as a springboard   for another entity that is the original target of   a cyberattack. In promoting these measures,   the Government will ensure that they are   based on common internationally accepted   standards for the governmental bodies, and   will conduct risk analysis on its administrative   responsibilities to optimize the processes   involved in making government information   environment secure.   lll. Making Businesses Secure   Along with the continuous increased   interconnectivity of cyberspace and physical   space, the number of cybersecurity incidents   closely related to individuals and enterprises   - such as illegal money transfers by exploiting   Internet banking, stealing information by   targeted attacks, and phishing — has   drastically grown.              TRUSTED   RESILIENTICT  INFOSTRUCTURE   There is also a rise in the number of breaches   of personal or confidential information,   including a large-scale personal data breach.   Thus, such repeated crimes have become   serious social concerns. Without avanced   cybercrime response and investigative   capabilities, it is difficult to capture the reality   of malicious cybercrimes; to control   cybercrimes appropriately in accordance with   laws and statutes; and to be ready to handle   new methods of cybercrimes that would   likely emerge in the near future.   IV. Making Individuals Aware and Secure   In the current environment, cyber risks have   become more complex and diversified and   Internet users with insufficient cybersecurity   awareness become victims or end up   becoming offenders unknowingly.   Therefore, the Internet and the advent of   mobile technology have increased utilization   of computers, smartphones, and other   devices to transact, process, transmit, and   store information. The public awareness and   knowledge of cybersecurity should reach suf-                                                                Making Government  Information   eee ety ae   #CyberToughPH         Making Critical   Information   Infrastructure (CII)   Trusted and Secure   #CyberResilientPH a ee                    cN\\                                   a   e NN              Q U O U U U U U U U U U O U U 0 0    QO OO  OU OU  OO UU  U0 00  00    Q U O U U U U O U 0 O U U U 0 0 0 .

Data   and information can now travel at the speed   of light. The world has become interconnected   through supercomputers and massive   network systems and the Internet   superhighways, in a way that is almost   unimaginable. This created cyberspace. The   internet has introduced many drastic changes   in our lives. This is apparent in the way we   process and communicate our information to   transact, interact, and connect with other   people.   The digitization of our society has also   created new sets of paradigms of   dependencies and interdependencies. The   government has recognized the importance   of information and the vital role of   information and communications technology   as one of the enablers for nation building.   INTRODUCTION       The growing dependencies of the   government in ICT to deliver its essential   services have brought home the hard facts   that we must have a robust and resilient   infrastructure. Our computer, information,   and network systems must be given priority   to ensure that the integrity of our cyberspace   is not put in jeopardy as we entrust our data   and our information into this virtual   environment.   Although there is an implemented   government-wide program on Information   Systems Strategic Plan (ISSP) which provides   the blueprint for planning, developing,   building, and/or acquiring technology such as   hardware and software applications for each   government agency, the design has never   incorporated the security aspect on top   priority in facilitating the creation of a digital   environment. Therefore, individuals with   malicious intent are able to discover the gaps   between these ystems and are able to   exploit it.   Making Critical Information Infrastructure (Cll) trusted and secure   Making government information environment more secure   Making business more secure   Making individuals aware and secure   Addressing these gaps will mitigate the risks,   threats and vulnerabilities from malicious   actors such as criminals, terrorist   organizations, individuals or even hostile   states.   The technological revolution on mobile-based   devices and smart systems and the   expansion of inter-networking of devices,   computing systems, and mechanical and   digital machines for connectivity through   Internet (also known as Internet of Things or   loT) introduced a whole new host of threats   into our cyberspace. As we rely heavily on   systems (e.g. banking), technologies   (e.g. telecommunications), and infrastructure   (e.g. Dower grids) to conduct the daily   activities of our lives which are connected to   the internet, these are potentially vulnerable   to interference or disruptions.   Recognizing all these issues and challenges   that may be a potential threat to our national   security and national interest, the National   Cybersecurity Plan 2022 has been prepared   to address the cyber threats and create   innovative measures that will lead to a secure   and resilient Philippine cyberspace. In   However, the NCSP 2022 shall provide the   institutional framework and foundation where   policies and initiatives will be developed,   formulated, and prepared.   Just to name a few, we also have several   legal instruments such as the Cybercrime   Prevention Act, E-Commerce Law, and the   Data Privacy Act that provide the   mechanisms for enforcing laws and provision   of penalties and regulating through policies   and guidelines.   Launching on these objectives, the DICT has   identified and shall focus its attention on four   national targets and make them a national   priority.   The scale and dynamic nature of cyber   threats mean we need to work harder to   develop our capabilities and defenses. A   comprehensive approach is required to   effectively secure our cyberspace. To have   this realized, investments on intervention and   measures must be prepared through initial   assessment of where we are now and what   we have.    SCOPE  The National Cybersecurity Plan 2022 is   intended to shape the policy of the   government on cybersecurity and the   crafting of guidelines that will be adapted   down to the smallest unit of the government.   The strategy also intends to provide a   coherent set of implementation plans,   programs, and activities to be shared to the   public and the private sector, the civil   society, and the academe, including the   private individuals.   The strategy covers the entire country   including all Philippine networks connected   through government networks, domestic and   international. The strategy also mandates   that all government and public systems shall   be assessed and must be classified under the   National Security System.   The nexus of the cybersecurity strategy is   anchored on the last three clauses under   Section 2 of the Republic Act No. 10844, to   wit, “(l) to ensure the rights of individual to   privacy and confidentiality of their personal   information;(m) to ensure the security of the   critical ICT infrastructures including   information assets of the government,   individuals, and businesses; and (n) to   provide oversight over agencies governing   and regulating the ICT sector and ensure   consumer protection and welfare, data   privacy and security, and foster competition   and growth of the ICT sector.”   Therefore, the context of cybersecurity   within this document refers to the protection   of information systems (hardware and   software including associated and support   infrastructure), the data within these systems,   and the services that are provided by these   systems from any unauthorized access, harm   or misuse, whether it includes intentional or   accidental, or from natural disasters.   The above definition is reflective of the   definition of cybersecurity! from the   International Standards on Guidelines for   Cybersecurity (ISO/IEC 27032:2012),   “oreservation of confidentiality, integrity, and   availability of information in the Cyberspace”,   which incidentally was also adopted from the   International Standards on Information   Security Management System (ISO/IEC   27000:2014). For the purpose of this   document, it shall adopt the definition from   ISO/IEC 27032:2012.   Thus, Information Security, Application   Security, Network Security, Internet Security,   and Cll Protection are central to the key areas   of developing the cybersecurity plan of the   government. The objective of this document   is set to share the vision of the Government   for cybersecurity in 2022 and the key   objectives to achieve the goal, including the   guiding principles, roles and responsibilities   of all key players and the stakeholders.   THE CYBER THREAT LANDSCAPE  To understand better the threat that we are   now facing in the digital age, the black   market having a pivotal role in cyber threats   is discussed briefly within this section.   The criminal underground operating with the   use of the web is highly fragmented. Each   organized criminal group offers specialized   expertise on certain services and each   actively offers said services on the deep web.     A report from Trend Micro? indicated that   there are at least six different cybercriminal   ecosystems that are actively operating   across Europe, North and South America,   Africa, and Asia.   Each of these criminal ecosystems offers   unique and specialized services in the black   market. Stiff competition in the Russian black   market pushes up the game. The sellers   provide goods in the shortest amount of   time, with the most efficiency. The Russian   black market is one of the pioneers in the   underground economy and provides support   to budding counterparts such as Germany.   The Japanese underground on the other   hand is still relatively new in the cybercrime   economy. It prefers to cater more on taboo   rather than on the typical illegal trade that   occurs in the black market and is only   exclusive to specific members.   1 International Organization for Standardization.   (2012). Information Technology —- Security Techniques   — Guidelines for Cybersecurity,1st Edition. Published in   Switzerland.   However, as it learns more of the “benefits”   anonymity offers, the Japanese underground   market now boasts uncommon offerings such   as leaked data search engine privacy   protection services.   The Chinese underground economy sells   both software and services similar to its   counterparts. The economy has a robust   offering of tools and hardware development   and acts as a prototype hub for criminals.   The North American underground   encourages novices to jumpstart a career in   the criminal world. This type of criminal   ecosystem is not exclusive to members like   the Japanese and is unlike the tech-savvy   hackers like Russians, Germans, and Chinese.   Unlike its US counterpart, the Canadian   underground prefers to sell fake or stolen   documents and credentials.   2 http://www.trendmicro.fr/media/wp/cyber   crime-and-the-deep-web-whitepaper-en.pdf        The German underground market functions   similar to the Deep Web where it offers   various wares and caters to a niche set of   customers. Although it is also still relatively   new, its Russian counterparts provide them   support, such as shared resources and   parallel sites as well as cross-market   advertising.   For any young criminal aspirant, the Brazilian   underground market provides the avenue to   reach instant superstardom for notoriety.   They mostly focus on banking Trojans. Most   of these budding cybercriminals are young   and bold enough to flaunt and operate on the   “Surface Web” by frequenting popular social   media sites. However, they mostly work   independently from one another.   GLOBAL AND REGIONAL  THREAT LANDSCAPE  This section mentions two most prominent   cases in 2015 and 2016 respectively, as an   example to emphasize the importance of the   Critical Information Infrastructure? (Cll) in our   nation. Any attack can erode our trust in the   system that we rely heavily on to provide   continuous service without disruptions or   interruptions.   On December 23, 2015, a disruptive’   cyber-attack on the electricity distribution   companies Prykarpattya Oblenergo and Kyiv   Oblenergo in Western Ukraine® occurred and   caused a major power outage. The   region experienced a blackout for several   hours affecting more than 220,000   consumers. Upon investigtion, six months   before the attack, phishing emails were sent   to the offices of power utility companies in   Ukraine which contains malicious Microsoft   Office documents. The malware was able to   gather intelligence and managed to obtain   credentials that allowed the attackers to gain   direct remote control of aspects of the   network and open the circuit breakers that   subsequently enabled the attacker to trigger   the outage.   In February 2016°, an attacker was able to   access the SWIFT (Society for Worldwide   Interbank Financial Communication) payment   system of the Bangladesh Bank and   instructed the New York Federal Reserve   Bank to transfer money from an account in   Bangladesh Bank to multiple accounts in the   10   Philippines. These fraudulent transactions led   to a loss of US$101 million when these were   completed and went through the payment   and transfer system of the bank. However,   the banking system was able to prevent the   attempted transactions to defraud an addi-   tional US$850 million. After the discovery of   the attack, a forensic investigation was   launched and the discovery was made that a   malware was installed in the bank’s systems   and had been used to gather information on   the procedures used by the bank for   international payment and fund transfers.   Further analysis also indicated that the   malware linked to the attack showed a   sophisticated functionality for interacting with   the local SWIFT Alliance Access software   running on the Bangladesh Bank   infrastructure. It was concluded that the   conduct of the criminals are geared towards   more sophisticated attacks on network   intrusions.   The Components of Malicious  Cyber Activity  In the “Economic Impact of Cyber Crime and   Cyber Espionage” report by McAfee, a global   computer security software company, the   count in estimating losses from cybercrime,   cyber espionage, and malicious cyber activity   was broken down into six parts   * The loss of intellectual property and   business confidential information   * Cybercrime, which costs the world   hundreds of millions of dollars every   year   ¢ The loss of sensitive business   information, including possible stock   market manipulation   3. http://www.gov.ph/2012/09/12/republic-act-no-   10175/   4 http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/731832/UK-   faces-BLACKOUTS-cyber-hackers-threaten-energy-   supplies   * Opportunity costs, including service and   employment disruptions, and reduced   trust for online activities   ¢ The additional cost of securing networks,   insurance, and recovery from cyber   attacks   * Reputational damage to the hacked   company   Put these together and the cost of   cybercrime and cyber espionage to the   global economy is probably measured in the   hundreds of billions of dollars. To put this in   perspective, the World Bank says that global   GDP was about $70 trillion in 2011. A $400   billion loss—the high end of the range of   probable costs—would be a fraction of a   percent of global income. But this begs   several important questions about the full   benefit to the acquirers and the damage to   the victims from the cumulative effect of   cybercrime and cyber espionage’.   THE PHILIPPINE  THREAT LANDSCAPE  This section of the document provides a   background on the early initiatives that the   government has undertaken to start estab-   lishing security in our cyberspace as well as   citing cases of threats and recent breaches   into the government system.   The Context of Cybersecurity  in the Philippines  The dynamic and fluid changes in the cyber   environment make the challenges, risks, and   threats more complex. The government is   5 https://www.symantec.com/content/dam/   symantec/docs/reports/istr-21-2016-en.pdf   6 http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cy ber-bank-   ing-swift-exclusive-idUSKCNOXM2DI   11    cognizant of these facts and realities of the   virtual environment. Information as a critical   asset of the government, the pulic and   private sector and down to the individuals   that reside within our computer sytems,   network systems, or application systems   must be protected and secured from being   compromised or breached. As early as 1965,   laws have already been passed to protect   people and property and to prosecute   individuals or a group of individuals who   violate and cause harm to our right to privacy   of information or those who seek to   compromise our system. To cite a few, we   have the Anti-Wire Tapping Act of 1965 and   the Electronic Commerce Act of 2000.   In 2004, the Arroyo Administration has   included in its priority the agenda of   establishing a National Cybersecurity Plan.   This became one of the main reference   documents when the Information Security   a   Incident Response Manual was crafted in   2013 through the Information and   Communications Technology (ICT) Office.   On September 2015, the Executive Order No.   189 which created the National Cybersecurity   Inter-Agency Committee or NCIAC was   signed. The creation of the National NCIAC is   a necessary undertaking reflective of its   vision towards creating a safe Philippine   Cyberspace. One of the most important   aspects in the creation of the NCIAC is to   have one direction in the coordination   between government agencies and other   relevant sectors. This provides an avenue in   building a consensus that requires national   attention, and immediate decision and action   such as the pre-paration of appropriate and   effective measures to strengthen   cybersecurity capabilities against existing   and future cyber threats.

Center for Strategic and International Studies.   McAfee. July 2013  12   To adapt to the fluid state of changes of the   information and communications   technologies, the Internet and cyberspace,   the Philippine Congress passed into law on   May 23, 2016 the Republic Act No. 10844   which is The Creation of the DICT.   Under R.A. 10844, it paved the way for a   National Agency to focus and address ICT-   related issues and matters. Incidentally, the   Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (R.A.   10175) which constituted the creation of the   Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating   Center (CICC) and the National Privacy   Commission which was created through the   Data Privacy Act of 2012 (R.A. 10172).   In the creation of the DICT, the National   Telecommunications Commission (NTC), the   CICC and the NPC were placed under the   Department as attached agencies.   The Threats   On March 2016, the server of the Philippine   Voters’ Database was reportedly hacked by   Anonymous Philippines in which at least 54   million sensitive data® was leaked into the   Internet, including 1.3 million passport   numbers of Filipinos working overseas.   According to common news articles reported   by various newspapers, the breach into the   system occurred through the use of SQL   injection. The alleged hacker was arrested by   the National Bureau of Investigation after the   IP address was discovered and tracked   down.   In 2016, at least 68 government wesites have   been subjected? to attacks including attempts   8 http://cnphilippines.com/news/2016/06/17/   Comelec-hack-data-breach.html   of hacking, defacement, and Distributed   Denial of Service or DDOS.   The Philippines is no stranger to being a   victim of cyber-espionage. A Finland-based   security firm reported”? in 2016, that a   malware was found targeting confidential   information of government and private   organization. The malicious virus called   Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is often   disguised as an innocent file but once it has   been opened, it releases a virus into the   victim’s computer and gathers intelligence to   be sent back to the attacker.   SOURCES OF THREATS  Cyber criminals  There are two interrelated forms of criminal   activity that increase the risks of the potential   threat against information assets of   government, public, and private sectors and   trickles down to ordinary individuals:   Cyber-enabled criminals  These are traditional crimes that are   perpetuated, magnified, and increased in   scale or reach through the use of computers,   computer networks, and other forms of   Information and Communications Technology   or ICT (e.g. cyber-enabled fraud and data   theft).   Cyber-dependent criminals  These are crimes that can be committed   through the use of ICT devices. These   devices become an instrument for both   committing the crime and the target of the   crime (e.g. hacking to steal data, developing   and propaga-ting malware to be used to   intrude and breach systems for financial   gains, disruptions of network systems, etc.).   13    Most of the organized cybercriminal groups   operating in the South East Asia Pacific   region are hosted by the criminal market   place services in Central Asia, South East   Asia, as well as West Africa. It is also difficult   for the Philippines and international law   enforcement agencies to prosecute them   when there is limited jurisdiction or no   extradition agreements.   Malware that are developed and deployed   are increasingly advancing and their impacts   are not fully documented in the Philippines as   we have yet to establish a National Database   for computer incidences. The increasing use   of ransomware and threats of distributed   denial of service (DDOS) are just examples of   how these cybercriminals are becoming   increasingly aggressive and confrontational.   9 http://www. philstar.comheadlines/2016/07/16/   1603250/68-govt-websites-attacked     Hacktivist  Hacktivist groups are motivated by   issue and mostly function in decentralized   fashion. Some schools of thought are   espousing the idea that web defacement and   replacing them with political messages is an   exercise of their freedom of speech. They   select their targets based on their perceived   grievances. There is a vigilante qua-lity to   their acts, as demonstrated by the hackers   who attacked a certain government website.   Their methods of attacks are mostly   defacement and distributed denial of service   (DDoS). However, some hacktivists are able   to inflict greater and often lasting   damage to some of their victims.   10 http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/08/05/   South-China-Sea-RAT-cyber-attack-Philippines.html   14   Script kiddies  Attention has not been fully given to these   so-called script-kiddies, but they are threats   nonetheless. They are generally less skilled   individuals. However, if they know how to   access the black market, there are services   and even hacking guides available and can   be accessed through the Internet. However,   these script kiddies have not been fully   assessed in terms of the damage and impact   they can effect towards their target   organizations.   Terrorists  Terrorists operate with specific intent and   motive and that is to create chaos and terror   to the public. Some terrorists use the Internet   as an effective recruitment tool for vulnerable   target groups or individuals. Although their   technical capabilities are generally low, the   low sophistication of their disruptive activity   (defacement or DDoS) will have an impact   even in moderate scale. Furthermore, as they   exploit the Internet to recruit talents and   even exchange technical skills, the   opportunity of being able to enlist an   established insider is likely to increase as well.   Non-State and State-sponsored threats   Countries with technical capabilities to attack   other states are increasing. The first world   countries are most prone to frequent attacks.   However, other countries like the Philippines   may be used as launch pads to attack other   states either by another state or through   state-sponsored attacks. Developed nations   continuously improve their capabilities to   deflect, defend and deter these attacks ata   steady pace. But by the same token, states   with technical capability to attack these   developed nations, often use basic tools and   techniques against vulnerable targets   frequently exploiting discovered gaps   between the systems of these states   because of poor defenses. These attacks are   no longer confined within espionage but   there are hostile threat actors that have   developed and deployed cyberattacks with   destructive objectives. Therefore, all states   are at risk and can have their national   security threatened from potential attacks   through the Cll and overriding the industrial   control systems. Thus, the Philippine   Government through DICT shall mandate that   Cll protection and security are prioritized by   Cll owners following the minimum guidelines   that shall be set by the National Government   based on the plan.   Insiders  Insiders and trusted employees are at the top   of the food chain that is frequently exploited   by criminal groups, terrorists, hacktivists, or   non-state and state-sponsored attackers   through social engineering, clicking on   phishing email, plugging infected USB into a   computer, or ignoring security procedures of   the organization. Although some may be   unintentional actions, their privileged access   to the systems and data can create as much   adverse impact and damage to the   organization.   15        THE NATIONAL  STRATEGIC CONTEXT       THE NATIONAL  CYBERSECURITY PLAN 2022   This section covers the general details of the   strategy, including the implementation plan   for NCSP, since this document shall be the   blueprint for the protection of the Cll of the   government, public and private networks.   The strategy is still a work in progress and   will be reviewed for improvement ona   regular interval concurrent with its   implementation. It will follow the PDCA Cycle   (Plan — Do > Check — Act).       However, the priority program areas will be   the starting point in establishing and working   towards the goal of reaching a mature   cybersecurity state. Results in the   implementation of the plan shall be monitored   closely and regularly. Data shall be collected   from stakeholders and shall be collated into a   national database for incidences on   cyberattacks, intrusion attempts or disruption   of systems, and other sources of threats   whether intentional or accidental.   Initial metrics that have been prepared and   proposed within this strategy shall be agreed   upon by the stakeholders to create   ownership and involvement among everyone.   The following sections describe the general   areas that will be prioritized.   THE NCSP 2022 VISION  The National CyberSecurity Plan 2022 shares   its vision to reach the state of having a   “Trusted and Resilient Infostructure.” In order   to accomplish this state, the following mission   objectives have been determined:   a. To systematically and methodically   harden the Critical Information   Infrastructure (Cll) for resiliency;   b. To prepare and secure government   Infostructure;   c. To raise awareness in the business   sector on cyber risk and use of security   measures among businesses to prevent   and protect, respond and recover from   attacks; and   d. To raise awareness of individuals on   cyber risks among users as they are the   weakest links, they need to adopt the   right norms in Cybersecurity.   Metrics shall be developed to monitor the   implementation progress of the plan based   from the above objectives. There are three   guide questions that will aid in jumpstarting   the cybersecurity strategy of government   agencies. The strategy can be replicated and   adopted by agencies as it is rolled out and   cascaded to the smallest unit of the   government.   i. Where are we now? (Conduct of inventory   of information assets, information systems,   computer systems, network systems, and   security systems)   ii. What do we want to achieve? (Setting,   aligning, and harmonizing cybersecurity   targets of each agency with NCSP)   iii. How do we get there? (Establishing the   roadmap)   11 Department of Justice - Office of Cybercrime. Na-   tional Cybercrime Strategy 2016-2022. pp. 3   STRATEGIC INITIATIVES  The strategic initiatives of the government   focus on the technical, administrative and   procedural measures. The strategy shall   cover strategic programs for:   a. Enhancing security resilience of the Cll   and government, public, and military   networks to deal with sophisticated   attacks;   b. Increasing efforts to promote adoption of   cybersecurity measures among   individuals and businesses; and   c. Growing pool of cybersecurity experts.   THE NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY  FRAMEWORK  In the development of the National Cybersecurity   Framework, one has to understand the   interrelationship\" between cybersecurity and   cybercrime. Cybersecurity and cybercrime   can be distinguished in the context of the law.   Cybersecurity relates to the confidentiality,   integrity, and availability of computer   systems, network systems, information   systems, and other areas related to the   protection of information assets. Therefore,   the framework focuses on technical,   administrative, and procedural measures that   will protect critical infrastructure andincrease   resilience of ICT and ICT-enabled   environments. Cybercrime relates to the   penal law that punishes crimes’? committed   with the use of computer systems or in some   cases, attacks by the criminals on the system   itself. It pertains to the crimes that affect the   confidentiality, integrity, and availability of   data and computer systems.   12 Section 4 (a) of Republic Act No. 10175.

Cybercrime on the other hand,   has its strategy anchored on crime prevention   and criminal justice to ensure that the rule of   law applies in ICT and cyberspace. In other   words, cybercrime focuses on investigation   and prosecution (reactive state) while   cybersecurity is on security and protection   (proactive state).   Figure 2 illustrates how the concept was   developed. The Framework is composed of   three layers where all three key players are   interrelated but have distinct functions. Their   sets of activities are planned and   programmed according to their mandates.   However, these activities shall work in   synergy with its counterparts through a   cooperative, collaborative, and coordinated   environment.   The driver for the framework is the strategy   under NCSP. The apex of the pyramid also   illustrates the interrelationship between all   key players and its corresponding roles to   implement the NCSP. Emphasis is given also   on the importance of collaborating with   public, private, and international partners.   The next layer indicates that sharing of   intelligence such as data and information is   crucial to identifying potential threats,   simulating scenarios, studying threats and   incidences, or developing innovative   measures through continuous monitoring and   evaluation of information shared by   stakeholders in a timely manner.   The middle layer shall establish an   environment for sharing situational   awareness. The concept of sharing of   information acts as an enabler for integrated   operational actions which can be   orchestrated simultaneously or in parallel   with one another is invaluable to the entire   lifecycle of incident resoonse management.   The bottom layer is where responses to   incidences and events are recorded,   monitored, evaluated, and analyzed which   will provide input to improvements on   processes, policies, guidelines, or   procedures. As stated earlier, the country’s   cybersecurity capabilities are still at its   infancy stage, therefore, the core framework   in the protection of the Cll shall adopt the   NIST Cybersecurity Framework® asa   starting point with the following core   functions: Identify — Protect — Detect >   Respond — Recover. The activities under   these functions can be conducted   concurrently and continuously.   In developing the policy to implement the   strategy using the framework, the   government through DICT shall adopt the   proactive approach instead of being reactive.   We have to think and strategize a couple of   steps ahead of the cybercriminals. The   government must take necessary measures   to be adaptable to the future social changes   and potential risks through constant and   continuous analysis of information and data   that have been gathered.   13 National Institute of Standards and Technology.(2014).Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity   Version 1.0. https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cyberframework/cybersecurity-framework-021214.pdf   20   THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES  Framing of the vision, its objectives and   creating the framework is guided with the   principles on the following:   The Rule of Law   Cyberspace is a vast place with many new   and emerging areas still relatively unknown   and unexplored. However, the rule of law is   as much applied to the cyberspace as it is   strongly and strictly observed in the physical   world to ensure that there is order in our   society.   Autonomy and Self-Governance  Cyberspace thrives in autonomous systems   that are run, managed, and operated by   various owners. The Government intends to   continue respecting the self-governance that   cyberspace has developed. The foundation   of cyber governance is the ability of every   individual or group to be self-reliant and   responsible users of the Internet. Every   individual or group observes the established   universal values and norms such as freedom,   democracy, peace, and stability within   cyberspace, as it is used by diverse   individuals or groups from all over the world.   Collaboration with Multi-Stakeholders  and International Cooperation  Collaborating with multi-stakeholders and   establishing international cooperation   enables a community of practice where   information is shared among these key   stakeholders. Layers of defense can be built   through the cooperation of the citizens, the   businesses and organization, the education   providers, governments, and the whole     society in general. Protection and prevention   from multi-dimension groups will minimize   and manage these cyberattacks to minimum   adverse impact.   Balance between Free Flow of   Information and Privacy Rights of  Individuals  The rights of every individual to have equal   access to the Internet are upheld at all times.   However, balance must be made between   protecting the privacy of the individual   against securing protection of information   and data of the users.   Risk Based Management Approach   is another guiding principle of the strategy.   One of its national targets is the protection   and security of the Clls. This approach pro-   vides a comprehensive preparation in the for-   mulation of a Risk Treatment Plan that the   government and other relevant sectors will   eventually undertake as it evaluates and thor-   oughly considers the type of risk appetite of   the stakeholders.   21    ROLES AND  RESPONSIBILITIES  The roles and responsibilities of the   stakeholders and key players must be   defined so that the functions of each   stakeholder will be in synergy with the   activities of other stakeholders. The strategy   provides clarity in the relationship and   interrelationship among the stakeholders.   The job of making sure that cyberspace is   safe and secure is a collective effort that is   shared by each and every one of us. The   government is just a single piece in the   macrocosm of cyberspace.       Individuals have a large role to play since it is   the biggest population base in the internet. In   the same manner that we put value of   securing our personal assets in the physical   world, the same consciousness of practice   must be observed in cyberspace. The cyber   environment is vast and the capacity of the   government to patrol the cyber community is   limited. However, the individuals who created   the cyber community may act as a force   multiplier and provide a neighborhood watch   against malicious individuals prowling the   Internet.                                       The heads of industry organizations are   drivers of our economy. Institutions such as   banking systems composed of our financial   institutions, together with the business   sector, create one of the pillars of our   country’s economy.   Table 1 provides a brief description of the   governments functions and mandates and   the interrelationship of processes as well as   interdependencies of the key players in   keeping our information systems, computer   systems, and network systems accessible,   available, and functioning at all times and free   from any interruptions or disruptions,   whether intended or unintended.   i   22   ¢ Extend immediate   assistance for the   suppression of   real-time commission   of cybercrime   offenses through   a computer   emergency   response team   (CERT)   Coordinate the   preparation of   appropriate and   NATIONAL AGENCY   Ensure the rights of individuals to privacy and confidentiality of   their personal information   Ensure the security of critical ICT infrastructure   Ensure the security of information assets of the goverments,   individuals, and businesses,   Provide oversight over agencies governing and regulating ICT   sector   Ensure consumer protection and welfare, data privacy, and security   Formulate a national cybersecurity plan   Formulate, recommend, and implement national policies, plans,   programs, and activities related to cybersecurity activities   Assist and provide technical expertise to government agencies   in the development of guidelines in enforcement and administration   of laws, standards, rules, and regulations governing cybersecurity   Assess the vulnerabilities of cybersecurity   Issue updated security protocols to all government employees   in the storage, handling, and distribution of all forms (e.g. digital,   electronic, snail mail, etc.) of documents and communications.

KEY AREAS FOR  CYBERSECURITY  There are several layers in security that the       strategy shall focus on and shall prioritize for   the development and implementation of its   policies, plans, programs, and guidelines for   security and protection. To put emphasis,   ¢ Investigate, attribute, disrupt, and prosecute cybercrime   - Lead domestic national security operations   * Conduct domestic collection, analysis, and dissemination of   cyber threat intelligence   ¢ Support the national protection, prevention, mitigation, and   Reena acne Pa Ny   Although Table 1 has already described in   general the roles and the responsibilities of   the major key stakeholders, the governance cybersecurity relates to actions that   and management structure shall be fleshed stakeholders must take to establish and   out during stakeholders’ consultation to bring maintain security in cyberspace.

Roles and Responsibilities of  Heads of Agencies  It is also noteworthy to mention that the heads   of agencies are the first line of defense in the   protection of the Cll. The following functions   shall also be mandatory to their existing   functions and the functions of their agencies:   i. Assess the risk and magnitude of the   harm that could result from unauthorized   access, use, disclosure, disruption,   modification, or destruction of information   or information systems that support   operations or assets under their control;   ii. Determine the levels of information   security appropriate to protect such   information and information systems;   iii. Implement policies and procedures to   cost-effectively reduce risks to an   acceptable level; and   iv. Conduct periodic testing and evaluation   implementing the protection of Cll.   Information Security  Information security talks about confidentiality,   integrity, availability, authenticity, and   nonrepudiation, of information as an asset of   the organization. We look at the strategy from   a multi-dimensional perspective. As mentioned   earlier, the digitization of the world has made   everything interconnected and interdependent,   from man to machine through ICT enabled-   technology, internet, mobile-based devices, or   smart devices (the concept of Internet of Things   or loT). This is achieved through the application   of policy, education, training and awareness,   and technology. The government aims to   institutionalize information security across all   government agencies down to the smallest   operating units of the government. The NCSP   shall provide the guidelines and the minimum   compliance requirements to jumpstart   implementation of information security in the   government.   14 International Organization for Standardization.   (2012). Information Technology — Security Techniques   - Guidelines for Cybersecurity,1st Edition (ISO/IEC   27032:2012). Published in Switzerland        Application Security  Application security is a process performed   to apply control and measurements to   application systems to manage deployment   and use risks. These controls and   measurements are applied to the application   itself (e.g. processes, components, software,   and results), to the data (e.g. configuration   data, user data, organization data), and to all   technology, processes and stakeholders   involved in the application’s life cycle.   When we develop the applications, security   should be embedded and stressed into every   stage of the System Life Cycle Development   (SLDC). Security assessment of applications is   conducted after it is developed and these   issues are fixed. There are malicious actors   whose only intention is to break into the   computer systems and network systems to   damage them, whether for fun or for profit.   OOO Ce  UOT  TUCO COCO Ce   Conducting application testing on a regular   basis will mitigate and identify system   vulnerabilities. Currently, vulnerability   assessments for applications developed are   not fully implemented and institutionalized   across all government agencies, especially   those that operate critical systems.   Network Security  Network security covers design,   implementation, and operation of networks   to achieve the purpose of information   security on networks within the government   and public network, between these networks,   and between government and public network   and the users.   Intrusion detection methods and traffic   analysis are one of the most basic security   measures we can implement to ensure the   security of our systems. Auditing and   26   monitoring our networks and perimeter   systems require a thorough understanding of   our network architecture and how attackers   can exploit gaps in between these network   systems. Technological advancement and the   growing number of available of network   hacking tools have increased the threats into   our systems. As a way to combat the   growing problem, inventory of devices that   are connected into our network is   recommended. The strategy includes the   inventory of the government and public   network.   Internet Security  The objective of internet security is to   protect internet-related services and ICT   systems and networks as an extension of   network security in organizations including in   the privacy of homes. It also ensures the   reliability and availability of internet services.   Everyone uses the internet. The risks that the   internet poses such as data and information   that flows across the cyberspace through a   series of computers and network links are   highly likely to happen. Various threats over   the internet must be fully understood. One of   the vulnerable groups with high exposure in   the internet is small business-owners,   especially since the use of the e-commerce   platform has gained momentum. Raising the   awareness will help reduce the risks and the   vulnerabilities.   15 Harp, D. , Gregory-Brown, B.

The critical information infrastructure also   known as the critical infostructure (CII) plays   a vital role in our economy. Adopting the   approach of Integrating Information   Technology with Operational Technology in   protecting critical infrastructure is essential to   the objectives.

The   NCSP 2022 expanded this list and adopted   the Cll list from the Cybersecurity Strategy of   Singapore . The list includes, but not limited   to, government and emergency services,   business process outsourcing, healthcare,   media, banking, financial, bower, water,   telecommunications, transport and logistics.   This was also classified according to   Services, Utilities, and Transport that cuts   across all sectors. Our Cll must have the   resiliency to operate against information   security risk, network security risk, Internet   security risk, and cybersecurity risk.   Furthermore, government’s commitment to   protect itself and public Cll starts with   adopting clear policy objectives at the   highest level of government. The strategy   shall include the steps to enhance the   security level components of information   system and networks that constitute Cll. Risk   assessment shall be conducted based on the   analysis of vulnerabilities and threats to the   Cll. A periodic review on the national risk   management process will help implement the   risk management strategy at every level.   It is however emphasized, that the owners of   Clls will have the primary responsibility to   secure and protect these systems. The   government can only do so much having very   limited resources such as manpower and   financial resources. But together with other   system and Cll owners, we will be able to   create multi-layers of security and defend our   cyberspace and protect our Cll.   18 Singapore’s Critical Infrastructure Sectors,   Singapore’s Cybersecurity Strategy, pp. 11   CLASSIFICATION  OF NATIONAL  SECURITY SYSTEM  The term national security system means,   “any information’? system (including   telecommunication system) used or operated   by any agency or outsourced to a third party   by an agency”:   The function, operation, or use  of which:  The function, operation or use of which:   i. Involves intelligence activities;   ii. Involves cryptologic activities related to   national security;   iii. Involves Command and control of   military forces;   iv.

Protected at all times by procedures   established for information that have been   specifically authorized under criteria in an   Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be   kept classified in the interest of national   security or foreign policy.   Exclusions from National Security  System Clarification  There is also the need to have a distinction   between a National Security System (NSS)   and those that are not covered by the   parameters for classifying the NSS. The   systems that are not included are systems   19 National Institute of Standards and Technology.   (2003).

RISK MANAGEMENT  APPROACH  The methodologies for Cll protection is   through the Risk Management Approach. The   government shall manage its risks in the   protection of the Cll by identifying, analyzing,   and evaluating risks. The management of the   risk must be integrated into the overall   governance, strategy, planning,   implementation, management, reporting   processes, policies, values and culture”°.   Guidelines for implementing the risk   management approach shall be formulated   by the government through   DICT. Under the guidelines, critical systems   and Cll owners Shall formulate their risk man-   agement policy based on its mission critical   objectives, business processes and opera-   tional environment needs.   Risk Assessment  To implement the risk-based management   approach, the government must conduct the   three stages of risk assessment:   identification, analysis, and evaluation. In the   formulation of the risk evaluation criteria, the   primary and mandatory consideration shall   be on the NSS and Cll. The risk management   policy that government agencies shall   develop appropriate to their agency’s   mandate and mission, must be aligned with   NCSP vision and mission objectives.      20 International Organization for Standardization.

This   initiative of creating a single coordinating   NCIAC is geared towards a more efficient   and effective strategic planning and   implementation of measures with an ultimate   goal of strengthening cybersecurity   capabilities against existing and future cyber   threats and all other challenges with respect   to cyberspace. The National CIAC would   serve as a centralized hub to harmonize and   integrate national efforts relating to   cybersecurity.   Cybercrime Investigation and  Coordination Center (CICC)  The Cybercrime Investigation and Coordina-   tion Center was created through the Cyber-   crime Prevention Act of 2012 (R.A. 10175)   function as a coordinating body. The CICC   also facilitates collaboration, cooperation,   support, and participation from multistake-   holders and the international bodies for cy-   bersecurity related activities.     Public Private Partnership   Public Private Partnership Forums  The government cannot take on the   challenges and threats from cyberspace by   itself. However, creating environments such   as forums for sharing and exchanging   information will provide an avenue for a   public-private partnership. The first step to a   partnership is to have a good communication   relationship with its stakeholders.   International Collaboration  The strategy shall not only focus its efforts   on local and domestic colla-boration with its   partner and counterpart agencies for   cybersecurity related matters, but shall also   forge internatio-nal collaboration.   As the government prepares the   environment for coordination, partnership,   and collaboration across all levels and sectors   of the government and society, the concept   shall also encou-rage the creation of a   Community of Practice. Thereby upholding   one of its guiding principles, collaboration   with multi-stakeholders shall also help build   the cornerstones of a resilient |CT-enabled   governance.   30     KEY  STRATEGIC INITIATIVES       The implementation of the NCSP, as indicated previously, hinges on the national priority   targets and the underpinning principles that will also guide the formulation and   preparation of its implementation plan. Thus, there are five strategic initiatives that shall   be orchestrated under the DICT.    KEY PROGRAM AREAS   PROTECTION OF Cll  As our government works towards   digital governance, the support   infrastructures that power our virtual   environment must be able to sustain   operation before, during, or after any   cyber incidences or attacks. To fully   understand the importance of the   critical information infrastructure in the   digitization of our government, we look   at how this was described”: information   components supporting the critical   infrastructure, and/or; information   infrastructure supporting essential   components of government business,   and/or; information infrastructure   essential to the national economy.       For the purpose of this document, we   shall define critical information   infrastructure as, “critical infostruture   whose failure or limited operation due   to natural or man-made disasters   would surely cause a tremendous   impact on the majority of citizens.”   However in order to bring everyone on   the same page, this document will   adopt the elements of infostructure,   whether physical or virtual, cited under   the Cybercrime Prevention Act of   20127 as follows: computer systems,   and/or networks, and/or computer   programs, computer data and/or   traffic data.   H O    oO  ®   21 Mansfield, N. Organization for Economic Co-Oper-   ation and Development. Development of Policies for   Protection of Critical Information Infrastructure. 2007.   South Korea.   Furthermore, it is also emphasized that such   infostructure is so vital that interference and/   or destruction of such systems and assets will   have debilitating impact on national security,   economic security, national public health,   public safety and order.   To determine and establish the resiliency of   our Clls, the government will focus on two   major activities that will help establish the   baseline for our cybersecurity capability and   capacity in the protection of our critical   infostructure: Compliance and Assessment   and 2) National Drill Exercises.   The compliance and assessment shall be   composed of three levels:1) Protection As-   sessment (inventory level), 2) Security   Assessment (readiness) and, 3) Compliance   to Cyber Risks to Cll (voluntary).   Cybersecurity Assessment and  Compliance   i. Protection Assessment Project   (ICT Systems)   ii. Security Assessment Project (Readiness)   iii. Certificate of Compliance to Cyber Risks   to Cll(Voluntary Program)   The strategic initiative of protecting the Cll   under levels 1 and 2 shall become a standard   practice and will work as complementary to   the preparation of the Information Systems   Strategic Plan (ISSP) of any government   agency. Since the ISSP is the blueprint of the   digital environment of a government agency,   this is an appropriate vehicle to ensure that   compliance and assessment are   institutionalized during implementation and   22 R.A. No. 10175, Sec. 3 (j).   32   becomes embedded into the regular   programming of a government unit. Level 3   on the other hand is a voluntary program   where government agencies may be   assessed by a third party institution   (Certifying Body or other institutions that   promote compliance to standards). This   program, although still proposed as a   voluntary program, in turn will institutionalize   the goal of implementing a resilient ICT   environment for the government.   However, agencies and organizations   classified as Cll shall have mandatory   compliance to Level 3 and government   agencies and organizations with sytems that   have been classified under National Security   System shall be compliant with the   requirements relevant to standards on   Information Security (ISO/IEC 27000).   Establish Program for National   Cyber Drills and Exercises  After establishing the baseline results for   assessment and compliance, government   units shall participate in National Cyber Drills   and Exercises. This shall become a   mandatory compliance for all government   agencies in order to sustain the development   of our cybersecurity towards the desired   maturity level of our systems.   Figure 3 illustrates the cybersecurity   maturity model?? and the agility state we   desire to achieve the Resilient Enterprise.   We will not be able to defend well if we do   not know our strengths and weaknesses.   Therefore, in conducting a self-assessment,   the level of the agility and speed of response   during cyber-attacks must be   determined.   At Reactive and Manual state, a   doctrine and the primary concern   is to put out fires as opposed to   finding the cause of the fire and   preventing the fire from   spreading.       At the Tools-Based state, tools   and technologies are used to   assist people in reacting faster.   At the Integrated Picture state,   the focus is on interoperability   where standards are based on   data exchange for situational   awareness.   At the Dynamic Defense state,   operation functions are ona   predictive and agile level because   the events are reviewed and   analyzed to help the responders   and operators identify, detect,   mitigate, and recover from these   attacks.   At the Resilient Enterprise state,   the objective is predictive and   mission-focused to isolate and   contain damage, secure supply   chains, and protect key critical   infrastructure to continue   operation through cyber-attacks.   4)   ® & &    23 Lentz, R.(2011.)[PowerPoint slides]. http://www.dintel.org/Documentos/2011/Foros/ses2Mcafee/lentz.pdf   33                        ADVANCED  PERSISTANT   THREAT            CONVENTIONAL  THREAT         TH RE AT   TY  PE S       AGILITY / SPEED OF ACTION   >» ® B c  REACTIVE & MANUAL TOOLS-BASED INTEGRATEDPICTURE DYNAMICDEFENSE RESILIENT ENTERPRISE   Figure 3: Cybersecurity Maturity Model   The cybersecurity maturity level of the   country is still mostly at a Reactive and   Manual state. The goal of NCSP is to reach   the state of developed resiliency and the   ability to sustain Operations during and after   cyber-attacks. The NCSP is the roadmap that   will enable the government to reach the   Resilient Enterprise state.   Establish National Database for  Monitoring and Reporting  Currently, the country has no single authority   that manages a national database and   monitors threat reports, including intrusion   attempts and other computer incidences.   The data and information remain in silo with   different agencies. To effectively identify and   protect our Cll against potential threat   attacks, complete information source and   availability of data must be accessible at all   times to authorized government agencies   and personnel. The data and information that   are collected can be used for research and   development, policy updates and   formulation, threat analysis, analysis of   emerging trends and patterns, etc.   Reporting** of security breaches and   intrusion attempts including other computer   incidences or events shall be mandatory to all   government agencies including agencies and   offices that have centralized collection and   repository of information. The data and   information that have been collected shall   become a valuable component for   developing and preparing innovative   measures in protecting and defending our   cyberspace.   24 Data Privacy Act of 2012. R.A No. 10173 Section 20 (c )(4) and (f).(2012)   34   PROTECTION OF  GOVERNMENT NETWORKS  The government in its national security   policy?> has recognized the growing   dependence of government, transportation,   industries, and economy on all components   of cyberspace. The growing dependence   increases the level of exposure and   vulnerability to cyberattacks. These are   cyberattacks that could lead to the paralysis   of communication infrastructure,   international financial systems, critical   government services and defense/military   command and control systems.   Establishment of a National  Computer Emergency Response   Program   A program for the national computer   emergency shall be established and   guidelines shall be formulated to aid   government agencies in the event of a   cyberattack or cyber incidents, including   prolonged cyberattacks. A well-prepared   emergency response protocol should   become part of the operational environment   of any government agency down to the local   government unit. The program shall   include the development and formulation of   the Computer Emergency Strategic   Communications Plan. This shall form part of   the National Drill Exercise which shall be   done on a periodic interval.   Establishment of CISO Programs in  Government Agencies  To implement the strategy efficiently, it is   recommended that CISO Programs are   25 National Security Council.(2011).National Security Policy   2011-2016: Securing the Gains of Democracy, pp.20.   http://www.gov.ph/downloads/2011/08aug/NATIONAL-   SECURITY-POLICY-2011-2016.pdf   established into Government Agencies and   the Local Government Units. CISOs have an   important role to play in security governance.   The general responsibilities® of a CISO   includes but not limited to:   i. Integrating information security   measurement into the process for   planning, implementing, evaluating, and   documenting remedial actions to address   any deficiencies in the information   security policies, procedures, and   practices of the agency;   ii. Obtaining the adequate financial and   human resources to support information   security measurement program   development and implementation   iii. Leading the development of any internal   guidelines or policy related to information   security measures;   iv. Using information security measures in   support of the agency’s CIO’s annual   report to the agency head on the   effectiveness of the agency’s information   security proggram, including progress of   remedial actions;   v. Conducting information security   measures development and   implementation;   vi. Ensuring that a standard process is used   throughout the agency for information   security measures development, creation,   analysis, and reporting; and   vii. Using information security measures for   policy, resource allocation, and budget   decisions.   26 National Institute of Standards and Technology. (2008).

Chew, E., Swanson, M., Stine, K., Bartol, N.,   Brown, A. & Robinson, W.  35                         The strategy requires that agencies provide   appropriate protection of their resources   through implementing a comprehensive   information program. The program that each   agency implements should be   commensurate to the sensitivity of the   information being processed, transmitted,   and stored within the information systems of   the agency.   The CISO Program shall be jumpstarted with   a series of training and capacity building   activities to fully equip personnel who shall   be given the assignment to function as a   CISO in an agency.   Establishment of the Computer   Emergency Response Structure   The Computer Emergency Response   Program shall be composed of the National   CERT, Government CERTs and the Sectoral   CERTs. The National CERT is the highest   body for cybersecurity related activities. All   CERTsS, Government CERTS, Sectoral (or   Private) CERTS, as well as organizational   CERTs shall coordinate and report incidences   to the National CERT. Figure 4 illustrates the   hierarchy of the Computer Emergency   Response structure in the country.   However, the CERTs all over the country   shall also conduct real-time coordination?’       with CICC as provisioned in the law.   i.

Organizational Computer Emergency   Response Team (Organization Level   CERT)   Apart from establishing the hierarchy of   CERT in the country, governance   structure shall be clearly defined to make the   implementation of the NCSP efficient and the   monitoring of its progress and milestones   more effective to ensure that the plan shall   be on target with its objectives until 2022.   Basic Computer Emergency   Response Program   The strategy will include projects that will   provide basic computer emergency   response awareness to government IT   employees. IT personnel, although they have   technical understanding, may not be fully   aware of how to respond to a computer   security incident that may compromise the   system.   27 Cybercrime Prevention Act 2012. R.A No. 10175 Section 26 (a ). 2012   36          Pov                Figure 4: Hierarchy of Computer Emergency Response in the Country   Building the capability of the CERT of   government agencies will take time to be   developed and considerable investment for   training will have to be planned accordingly.   Therefore, the first step is to build the   awareness and leveling of the understanding   of how computer emergency response   works, what to do in the event of the attack,   who to report to, and how to deal with the   impact of the cyber-attacks. This will serve as   preparatory stage while the agencies are still   in the organizing stage (CERT building). The   government will provide training programs,   such as Training of Trainers, Basic Computer   Emergency Response, etc.   The program shall include regular   communication drill exercises to synchronize   the communication practices and protocols   of all CERTs during cyber-attacks. All CERTS   must assign focal personnel to attend   meetings and coordination that shall be   established and scheduled at regular intervals.   The objective of the government is to ensure   that communications and coordination with   CERTs all over the country are firmly estab-   lished as we try to prepare and ensure that   we work together towards a resilient ICT   environment through Cll protection of   government and public networks.   Capacity Building and Capability   Development Program   Cultivating existing talents and developing   new ones are long term development plans   and the investment shall be substantial. The   government needs to acquire and strengthen   its capabilities to protect against any cyber   threat. This means we need to develop and   retain talented and qualified cybersecurity   professionals. The government shall engage   and collaborate with the academe and other   educational institutions to support the   development of cybersecurity specialists   through curriculum development. Much like   the need for skilled workforce to support   the Outsourcing Industry, the gap between   demand and supply for key cybersecurity   roles must be addressed now. The lifeblood   of any organization is to have a skilled   workforce. The lifeblood to secure our   cyberspace is to have skilledcybersecurity   specialists.   37    Establish Pool of Information  Security and Cybersecurity Experts  The government shall maintain a list of   Information Security and Cybersecurity   Experts. This can be accomplished through   several activities:   i. Establish Cyber Training Facilities and   Certification Programs   ii. Promote National Cybersecurity   Research and Development Program to   attract and cultivate cyber experts   iii, Establish Training Programs to Develop   Cybersecurity Specialist   iv. Promote Communities of Practice (COP)   Establish Threat Intelligence and  Analysis Operations Center  One of the long term programs of the strategy   is to establish a Threat Intelligence and   Analysis Operations Center. The concept is   mainly to provide a facility to house Research   and Development, Testing Laboratories and   Live Test of Threats and Threat Scenario   Simulators. The National Database provides a   repository of information from all over the   country to gather data and intelligence that   are analyzed on a regular basis by technically   competent Analysts. Data collection and   intelligence gathering are two basic methods   for developing and building up our defense in   depth. Building the competence of our threat   intelligence and analyst through studying the   various cyber incidences and cyber-attacks   will improve our capability and capacity   against future cyberattacks. The government   through CICC and NCERT shall coordinate and   collaborate with other government agencies   with existing facilities that function as threat   intelligence and analysis operations center.   i. DND Cyber Defense Center   ii. NSC Threat Operations Center   iii, AFP Cyber Command   iv. NICA Cyber Intelligence and Attribution   Center   Protection of Electronic  Government Transactions  There are enabling laws such as the Electronic   Commerce Act of 200078 which provides the   basis?° for employing cryptography as a   means to protect the integrity and authenticity   of the documents that are processed during   government transactions. The Plan shall   provide recommendations on policies that   will have impact on the digitization of   government transaction and formulate   guidelines that will include the protection of   the electronic document in transit, at rest, or   during processing using cryptography tools.   Update of Licensed Software  Software patches, and software (including   hardware devices such as servers, network   devices, etc.) approaching its end of life cycle   support are also potential sources of threats.   The NCSP strategy requires that all   departments, bureaus, offices, and other   agencies of the national government including   constitutional commissions, congress, the   judiciary, state universities and colleges,   government owned or controlled corporation,   and the local government units, shall exercise   mandatory review of all its existing software   licenses, machines and devices to ensure that   all necessary components are up to date and   are still well within its life cycle period.   For protection of Military Networks, there will   be a Militaryy Computer Emergency   Program. Under which is the DND Defense   Situation Monitoring Center for Policy and the   AFP Cyber Command for Operations.   For intelligence, a Threat Analysis Center will   be established under the NSC. The operating   arm will be the NICA Cyber Intelligence and   Attribution Center.   28 Electronic Commerce Act of 2000. R.A. 8792. 2000.   PROTECTION OF  SUPPLY CHAIN  National Common Criteria Evaluation  and Certification Program   i. ICT Equipment Security Evaluation and   Certification Project   ii. Benchmarking Project   The challenges in cybersecurity are   multi-dimensional. Therefore, the need to   approach it from a multi-disciplinary   perspective is important. The objectives of   Supply Chain Protection are to promote   secure and efficient movement of goods and   foster a supply chain system that is prepared   for and can withstand evolving threats and   hazards, and the ability to rapidly recover   from disruptions. In order to achieve this, the   strategy will work on enhancing the risk   management efforts that will include   addressing unknown risks to managing the   risk in the supply chain.   Apart from the strategy of employing the   risk management approach, the government   will also employ the common criteria to   determine compliance of the supplier, as well   as establishing the guidelines to conduct   benchmarking to ensure that the ICT   equipment are compliant with the   established standards of the government.   29 Electronic Commerce Act of 2000. R.A. 8792. Sec. 11 (b). 2000   338   PROTECTION OF  INDIVIDUALS  The protection of every citizen of the   country is primary to the functions of the   government. Protection is not only confined   to the physical environment but also applies   to the cyber environment. To protect the   individuals, cybersecurity awareness level   must be increased. The government will not   be able to combat and address every single   adverse event that occurs in a cyber   environment. However, when we equip the   citizens with the right knowledge and their   awareness is increased on cybersecurity, half   of the battle is already done. Several   projects shall be rolled out as a parallel   activity for building up our technical   capabilities to protect and secure our   cyberspace while we raise the community   awareness for cybersecurity.   Accelerate Learning Skills and  Development   To implement the strategy for accelerating   learning and skills development, there are   four (4) objectives that are formulated as   bases for developing appropriate programs.   a. Stimulate the development of approaches   and techniques that can rapidly increase   the supply of qualified cybersecurity   professionals.   i. Integration of subjects on   cybersecurity in the higher learning   curriculum;   ii. Integration of cybersecurity in   ladderized programs offered by   Technical Education and Skills   Development Authority (TESDA);   39    iii. Promote advanced programs and   specialized courses that reduce the time   and cost for obtaining knowledge, skills,   and abilities for indemand work roles;   iii.i. Promote the use of interactive   learning programs such as   webinars   iv. Encourage the adoption of   apprenticeships and cooperative   education programs to provide an   immediate workforce that can earn a   salary while they learn the necessary   skills.   iv.i. Promote apprenticeships and   cooperative programs to relevant   institution   b. Promote advanced programs and   specialized courses that reduce the time   and cost for obtaining knowledge, skills,   and abilities for in-demand work roles.   i. Promote the use of interactive   learning programs such as webinars   c. Encourage the adoption of   apprenticeships and cooperative   education programs to provide an   immediate workforce that can earn a   salary while they learn the necessary   skills   i. Promote apprenticeships and   cooperative programs to relevant   institution   d. Promote efforts to identify gaps in   cybersecurity skills and raise awareness   of training that addresses identified   workforce needs.

Government websites to have   cybersecurity related content   National Cybersecurity  Awareness Month   Under this strategy, there are five major   projects and activities that shall take place   until 2022. The goal is to bring the   awareness on cybersecurity to a wider   audience through these initial project   undertaking.   Equipping the Government  a. Capacity Building for Law Enforcement   Agencies   i. Judges, Prosecutors   b. Training of Trainers   Establishment and Creation of  Programs for Local and   International Cooperation   a. Establish cooperation and coordination   among CERTs and law enforcement   (Cybersecurity and Cybercrime,   respectively), academia, and industries;   and   b. Formulate and prepare capacity building   programs for CERTs and law   enforcement   40   The NCSP shall also provide the guidelines for   establishing and creating programs for local   and international cooperation. To create a   robust cooperation environment, appropriate   communications protocol and methods   suitable for communicating with the different   stakeholders such as the CERTs and the Law   Enforcement Agencies, the academe and the   industries must be clearly formulated and   established. Furthermore, capacity building   programs Shall be implemented back to back   with the cooperation program. The   cooperation programs also involve policy   issues that can be translated and adopted to   the country level, together with the   appropriate mechanisms.   ACTIVE APPROACH  Identify  The government has to first establish the   baseline as well as understand the business   context of the organization’s mission critical   objectives to ensure that the resources that   support the critical functions are provided.   There are several of said activities such as   Governance, Business Environment, Asset   Management, Risk Management Strategy,   and Risk Assessment that shall be imple-   mented.   Protect   After identifying and developing organizational   understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to   the systems, assets, data, industrial controls,   and technical capabilities, activities such as   Access Control, Data Security, Information   Protection Processes and Procedures,   Maintenance, Protective Technology, and   Awareness and Training shall be prioritized   and included into the execution plan to   ensure that the NCSP is implemented.   Detect   The speed and agility of responding to   cyberattacks will largely depend on the   detection ability and timely discovery of the   cybersecurity event. Under this phase,   activities such as Anomalies and Events,   Security Continuous Monitoring, and   Detection Processes are implemented.   Respond   At this juncture, to respond is to develop and   implement the appropriate activities   regarding a detected cybersecurity event.   Under this phase, activities such as Response   Planning, Communications, Analysis, Mitigation   and Improvements are implemented.   Recover   The recovery stage is to develop and   implement the appropriate activities to   maintain plans for resilience and to restore   any capabilities or services that were   impaired due to a cybersecurity event.   Under this phase, the activities that will cover   the implementation plan shall be Recovery   Planning, Improvements, and   Communications.   PROACTIVE APPROACH  Defend   In developing our defense mechanism, we   have to look at how all kinds of physical ob-   jects and people are interconnected by way   of the ICTs and the internet. The integration   of the physical space and the cyberspace   are further magnified through the Internet of   Things (loT) phenomenon. Malicious actors in   cyberspace are constantly advancing their   attack methods. They keep up to date with   the latest technological advancement and   constantly explore potential gaps within   41    these new offerings that they can exploit. In the   implementation of our defense strategy and to   build our defense layers, we must engage   every citizen, businesses, organizations,   academe, and other governments. This will   significantly reduce our exposure to   cyberattacks, cyber incidents, or cyber threats   and will be able to protect our most valuable   assets, while allowing the ability to access,   operate successfully, and continuously use the   internet. The government’s ability to   disseminate information must be in a manner   and speed appropriate to all types of   organization. Timely delivery of information is   crucial and important to launch and engage all   key stakeholders for a synchronized action to   defend our cyberspace and must be simplified.   Deter   In building up the in-depth defense of any   government, organization, or enterprise, the   first step is to adopt measures that will deter   these cyberattacks. There are several   actions that can be adopted to serve as   deterrence to an attack. One of which is to   raise the level of awareness of cybersecurity.   We also need to identify these potential   threats and anticipate various scenarios to   develop countermeasures and use   appropriate measures and tools at our   disposal. We need to send the message to   these malicious actors that they cannot act   with impunity. We need to deny our   adversaries the opportunity to compromise   our systems and networks by trying to   understand their intent and capabilities. The   LEAs play a critical role in reducing   cybercrime. While we harden our Cll against   cyberattacks and reduce vulnerabilities, the   LEA will focus efforts through any technical   assistance and data sharing from NCERTs in   their relentless pursuit of criminals and   cybercriminals.   Develop   The gap between supply and demand for   cybersecurity specialists is something that   needs to be addressed by the government.   In order to address the issue on the supply-   demand gap for cybersecurity specialists, an   inventory of IT professionals working within   the government shall be conducted and   specific intervention training programs shall   be prepared and developed. Investing into   the capacity and capability program should   be included in the priority programs. While   these short and midterm actions are being   implemented, the long term direction shall be   on defining and developing the cyber   security skills needed across the population.   The effort is collaboration among   stakeholders from the public sector,   academe, and the industry. A review on the   Qualification Standards and consultations   with the Civil Service Commission, the   Department of Budget and Finance and   other government agencies shall be   conducted to prepare and upgrade the   plantilla organization for cybersecurity   professionals and specialist who will be   recruited for work in the government by   making the remuneration package attractive.   A Talent Retention Program shall also be   planned and prepared for implementation.   42   ME TR IC S   C o n t r i b u t i n g    to    A)  o   7   3  n  co)  }  >>  n  2)  i)  v  3)  3  n  o  2  ~~   ©  s  ie)  fs   St ra  te gi  c  O u t c o m e s    St ra  te gi  c  O b j e c t i v e s          D e f e n s e    P r o t e c t        «T he   g o v e r n m e n t    is  ab  le    to   es  ta bl  is h   ba se li ne    da ta    th  at    pr ov  id es    de ta il s   of   th  e  st at e   of   cy  be rs  ec ur  it y   «I nv  en to  ry    of   ph ys ic al   de vi ce s   an d   sy st em s   in  th  e   g o v e r n m e n t    an d   pu bl  ic   ne  tw or  ks    is  c o n d u c t e d    « I n v e n t o r y    of   p l a t f o r m s    (s uc h   a s s o f t w a r e   a n d    a p p l i c a t i o n s )    in   g o v e r n m e n t    a n d    pu bl ic   n e t w o r k s    h a v e    b e e n   c o n d u c t e d    -  A s s e t    vu ln  er ab  il it  ie s   ar e   id en  ti fi  ed   a n d   d o c u m e n t e d    -  B a s e l i n e   c o n f i g u r a t i o n    of   i n f o r m a t i o n   t e c h n o l o g y /    in du st ri al    co nt ro l   sy st em s   is  cr ea te d   an d   ma in  ta in  ed    «  A u d i t / l o g    r e c o r d s    ar e   d e t e r m i n e d ,   d o c u m e n t e d ,    i m p l e m e n t e d    a n d   r e v i e w e d   b a s e d    on   th e   g u i d e l i n e s    ( f o r m u l a t e d   u n d e r    th e   N C S P )    «T he   g o v e r n m e n t    is  ab  le    to   es  ta bl  is h   a  na ti on al    da ta  ba se    e.  g.   cy be r   in ci  de nc  es    in cl  ud in  g,    I n f o s t r u c t u r e   a t t a c k s   a n d    in tr us io ns   ( s u c c e s s f u l    or    a t t e m p t s ) ,    et c. )   « L i n e s    of   c o m m u n i c a t i o n s   b e t w e e n   g o v e r n m e n t ,    pu bl ic ,   an d   pr iv  at e   se ct  or s   ar e   m a p p e d    « R e s o u r c e s    (s uc h   as   h a r d w a r e    a n d   s o f t w a r e )    ar e   pr io ri ti ze d   ba se d   on    th ei  r  cl as si fi ca ti on :   cr it ic al it y   an d   bu si ne ss   va lu e   *  R e s p o n s e    pl an  s  (I  nc id  en t   R e s p o n s e    an d   Bu si  ne ss     Co nt  in ui  ty )   ar e   in  pl  ac e   an d   m a n a g e d    *  R e s p o n s e    a n d   r e c o v e r y    pl an  s  ar e   t e s t e d    «  V u l n e r a b i l i t y   m a n a g e m e n t    pl an    is  d e v e l o p e d    a n d    i m p l e m e n t e d             YO S cou   & e & Cex  veo i   o = @ TOG OH  O2c o £€ S £&  oO % £z25%  oY > * 2c O08 8   mo OY O* r os   05 OS eo °F GU  o U0 = VU Ovxz Fe &   05H @ os 9 ESL  Fo LS Fn se OO ®   ~ wy   = — Cc  Go To  o> os c 2 eo   os oeY © 5  Co On ,. o£ >  ES°LD = O Y  © Ov 5 o 22 8  ~ pop Sf Owe  bo Sv LY LOR GR   oF EES Sees  ° 5 4 9 5=8a4 8  FOL OO | Fors £   ~- £ OF 6 - Oons  oo cle Qnrvrree       43        D e t e c t    P r o t e c t        *  C o n d u c t    a  c a t a l o g u e    of   e x t e r n a l   i n f o r m a t i o n   s y s t e m s    «  Sh  ar in  g  fo  ru ms    an  d  so  ur ce  s  ar  e  es ta bl is he d   on   th  re at     an d   vu ln er ab il it y   in fo  rm at  io n   «E ve  nt s   ar e   re po  rt ed    an  d  in  fo rm  at io  n  is   sh ar  ed ,   wh ic  h  is   co ns is te nt    wi th    th  e  re  sp on  se    pl an    ¢  V o l u n t a r y   i n f o r m a t i o n    s h a r i n g   o c c u r s    wi th    e x t e r n a l    s t a k e h o l d e r s    to   a c h i e v e   b r o a d e r    si tu  at io  na l   a w a r e n e s s    « V u l n e r a b l e   s e c t o r s    in   th  e  s o c i e t y    (s uc h   as   th  e  y o u t h    an d   sm al l   an d   m e d i u m    si ze d   bu si  ne ss    ow ne rs )   sh al l   be    pr io  ri ti  ze d   fo r  a w a r e n e s s    on   c y b e r s e c u r i t y a n a g e m e n t    pl an    is   d e v e l o p e d    an d   i m p l e m e n t e d               > ra . © Dy —   8 O o8 oO w < & of g@  c x O C €c Y > 5 o  ov SO y o5 = Oo Ecs S   PSone en 28 S2ee eee 2s. a  Go GT ONE Y w Ec Oy EQVe 5s   52°26 R 298 BHReeS5SCoVEE DZ gy  SeSESESS CESS ZRELZ TEES Gs ve -  BEE G2 3 eG SO9F ce GZGEoSvQvs  oz GgL52=5 os S822 oae257GF  FEHR OBE DG Fae ozeEzszacec HKaAacCaAsSB   0505 8 3G E Yn a) eSoseg os 3 zy ee   ~LoFaoPoe 056 YalorD &  £ofo5 © fC BQ Le wo cre & oO 0 o WY o MunvMUOVO ES 5   of2uv oe Serodec Anvaxvr=d ow oO  2Zouw ®D Sao 2.0% eoevse %m7YSEE  Cec n= GO > > PO YW D oO n  ~ oe 58 PV OLR ofr ec O®Ueen 25  o5 £00565 2598 FoezvYormtoges   EK 4H O20 0 2600 8 =U eEovoec  ~-S D>RBOCDE OL ECE . <> c TOD   S52 RB0GCH CHAS H oof Tasn SSG ECO        44     CONCLUSION   CyberSecurity is an evolving field with many international actors at play. As such, it is   imperative that a reliable mechanism is in place to address constant updates in the virtual   arena, underpinned on the premise of collaboration with allied countries in the fronts of   knowledge sharing, coarchitecture of laboratories/training facilities, and mobility exchange.   In line with this, to keep abreast with the latest trends, a capacity building program of   international standard must be set in place in accordance to the demands of digital   forensics, network analytics, and defense conceptualization, among others. Included in   the cooperation are detection/mitigation regimes, frameworks for coordination of   international originators of attacks, and co-design of stakeholder engagement strategies.   Admittedly, the Philippines' state of cybersecurity is still at its infancy stage, even though   there have been previous initiatives that have already been undertaken through different   agencies, including enabling of the laws that have been promulgated to protect data and   information. The NCSP 2022 shall provide the roadmap to make a coherent and cohesive   strategy for cybersecurity and act as the enabler for institutionalizing all the initiatives and   strategies that have already been started by different government agencies. Furthermore,   it will address the issue and challenges of a synchronized defense in the event of an   attack because the roles, functions, objectives and goals are clear and well defined. We   need to be ready for the disruptive nature that technology brings. This is amplified further   by the threats of cyberattacks and disruption of systems (mechanical or human errors),   whether accidental or deliberate. We need to work as one in order to combat the   challenges that are posed by the dynamic and fluid changes that occur in cyberspace as   technology evolves and interconnectivity cuts across all levels of government   and society.    GLOSSARY       Access refers to the instruction, communication with, storing data in, retrieving data from, or   otherwise making use of any resources of a computer system or communication network.

The use of information and communication systems in our country have become widespread in the public and private sectors, as well as among citizens and notably in critical infrastructure sectors such as energy, water resources, health, transportation communication and financial services. Information and communication technologies, and Internet use in particular, interconnect all components in cyber space which bring with it cyber security risks and uncertainties. As our institutions and organizations increasingly use information and communication systems in providing services, ensuring security on such information and communication systems has become an important aspect of both our national security and our economy. Security weaknesses in information and communication systems may cause such systems to become out of service or to be exploited or may lead to eventual loss of life, large scale economic loss, disturbance of public order and/or compromises to national security. Financial losses arising from cyber-attacks have reached extraordinary levels. Reports from organizations such as the World Economic Forum and various security companies clearly indicate this fact. 2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy 4/26 It is a fact that cyber space provides advantages such as anonymity and deniability for the attacks made to information systems and information/data. It is difficult to detect the financers and organizers of persistent and advanced cyber-attacks targeting information systems and data. This situation and characteristics reveal asymmetric character of risks and threats in cyber space and make it difficult to fight with these threats. Ensuring absolute cyber security is no longer achievable in such an environment. So instead, the aim is to keep cyber security risks at manageable and acceptable levels. It is acknowledged that being in an open and connected environment such as the Internet present certain risks with increased accessibility. The objective must be being prepared for cyber incidents by managing risks with a holistic approach that includes all stakeholders and assuring continuity by mitigating these incidents with minimum loss. 1.1 National Cyber Security Strategy and 2013-2014 Action Plan In light of this information, the Ministry of Transportation, Maritime and Communication has been given the duty of preparing the policy, strategy and action plans for providing national cyber security and ensuring coordination, pursuant to “The Council of Ministers’ Decision on the Execution, Management and Coordination of National Cyber Security Activities” that was published in 2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy 5/26 the Official Gazette Number 28447 on October 20th, 2012, and The Electronic Communication Law Number 5809. All public institutions and organizations, as well as natural and legal persons are expected to perform assigned tasks within the framework of the policies, strategies and action plans determined by the Cyber Security Board (Annex-A) and to follow determined methods, principles and standards. Drafted to address these issues, the National Cyber Security Strategy and 2013- 2014 Action Plan was published in the Official Gazette Nr. 28683 on June 20th, 2013 and enacted. In addition to practices scheduled for the 2013-2014 period, the paper covers periodical activities that go beyond this period, such as training and awareness raising initiatives. 1.2 The Preparation Process of the 2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy and Action Plan It has become imperative for the Ministry of Transportation, Maritime and Communication to update the national cyber security strategy and to determine actions that cover the 2016-2019 period in line with developing information and communication technologies, increasing security demands and gained experiences. In this context, seven evaluation meetings were held between March 10th and April 7th, 2015 with institutions considered responsible or associated in the previous action plan. Prospective assessments and actions to be realized in scope of cyber security were identified and recorded 2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy 6/26 comprehensively during the meetings, in addition to the extent of achievement of activities stated in the previous action plan and challenges. After the meetings, a Common Mind Platform was held with the participation of 126 specialists from 73 institutions and organizations representing public institutions, critical infrastructure operators, the IT sector, universities and non- governmental organizations. The platform studies that lasted two days determined strategic objectives and actions by focusing on Turkey’s cyber security strengths and weaknesses. Cyber Security issues have been included in the agendas of all developed countries besides international organizations such as the EU (European Union), the OECD (Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development), NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), especially after 2008. The preparation of the 2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy and Action Plan covered several stages in addition to the works carried out with stakeholders. A background literature review investigated cyber security strategies from many countries in America, Europe and the Far East, and suggested solutions in areas like scope, objectives, priorities, organization structure, resource allocation, R&D (Research and Development) coordination, public-private cooperation and training. 2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy 7/26 The \"2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy and 2016-2019 National Cyber Security Action Plan\" was prepared as a result of accumulating, reviewing and assessing information generated within scope of such efforts. 1.3 Definitions The terms used in this document refer to the following: Threat: The potential cause of an incident that may cause damage to an institution or system, Risk: The potential risk of causing damage by using vulnerabilities in one or more information entities, Information systems: Systems included in the provision of any service, transaction and information/data through information and communication technologies, Industrial Control Systems: Information systems in the SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) and Distributed Control Systems groups, which are used for industrial operations such as production, product processing and distribution controls via programmable logical controllers other than conventional information technologies, Cyber space: The numeric environment composed of information systems spread over the entire world and space, the networks interconnecting these systems or independent information systems, 2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy 8/26 Public information systems: Information systems owned and/or operated by institutions and organizations of the Republic of Turkey, Information systems owned by natural and legal persons: Information systems owned and/or operated by natural and legal persons who are subject to the laws of the Republic of Turkey, National cyber space: The environment that is composed of public information systems and information systems operated/used by natural and public persons, Confidentiality: The characteristic of preventing the use or disclosure of information to unauthorized persons, entities or processes, Integrity: The characteristic of maintaining the accuracy and consistency of entities, Accessibility: The characteristic of being accessible and useable when demanded by an authorized entity, Critical Service: Services, which may cause;

First, for all stakeholders to acknowledge the understanding that cyber security is an integral part of national security. Second, acquiring the competency that will allow taking administrative and technological precautions for maintaining the absolute security of all systems and stakeholders in national cyber space. In order to achieve this main objective, it is among the purposes of this document to determine targets and sub actions, while ensuring and supervising their implementation. In line with these objectives: • Ensuring the security, confidentiality and privacy of all services, transactions and information/data provided through information technologies as well as systems used for the provision of such, provided that they cover cyber space entirely, • Determining cyber security actions to minimise the effects of cyber security incidents, recovering systems to normal functions as quickly as possible after incidents and ensuring higher efficiency in the exploration 2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy 12/26 and investigation of emerging crime by judicial authorities and law enforcement forces, • Locally developing critical technologies and products for ensuring cyber security, confidentiality and privacy, or otherwise, taking measures to ensure that technology and products procured from abroad shall be solely and safely used for this purpose, are addressed in this plan. 1.7 Scope The 2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy and Action Plan covers all components of national cyber space on a national scale, including small and medium scaled industry, all natural and legal persons in addition to public information systems and information systems of critical infrastructures operated by public or private sector. 1.8 Update The National Cyber Security Strategy shall be updated with national level coordination with respect to demands received from the public and privet sector, and with consideration to developing technology, changing conditions and requirements. Actions included in this plan which cannot be accomplished by the end of 2019 will be carried on to the next action plan. 2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy 13/26 1.9 Cyber Security Strategies and Action Plans in the World This section presents important and points from Cyber Security Strategy documents published by other countries. Similar to the 2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy and Action Plan, potential cyber security risks and principles for implementing risks mitigating actions are mentioned in strategy documents of other countries and it was observed that the risks and principles did not vary significantly among countries. Significant principles within this context are as follows: a. Fulfilment of all legal and social responsibilities by individuals, institutions, society and state in providing cyber security, b. Coordination, joint participation, collaboration and information sharing between the public sector, private sector, universities and non- governmental organizations, c. Advanced cyber incident management cooperation between International Cyber Security Operation Centres. Significant risks in the reviewed documents include: 1. Social network addiction of society, 2. Positions of critical institutions and organizations in cyber space, 3. Various cyber spying efforts and targeted attacks, 4. Lack personnel and competency, 2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy 14/26 5. Lack of coordination between institutions, 6. Economic concerns concerning sectors of varying scales operating in cyber space. National cyber security principles, risks, strategic cyber security objectives and action plans have been determined with regard to these principles and risks. 2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy 15/26 2 Principles The principles to be considered in ensuring national cyber security are as follows: 1. Cyber security is ensured by means of methods based on efficient and continuous assessment and improvement based on risk assessment. It is aimed that risk management methods to be created will address threats and vulnerabilities and determine new risks and to offer methods for reducing these risks to an acceptable level. 2. In order to provide cyber security, all stakeholders must know about cyber security risks and be aware that their approaches towards the management of these risks will affect not only them but also others. In order to achieve this level of awareness and competency, all stakeholders must acquire necessary trainings and experience. In addition to the technical dimension, an integrated approach including legal, administrative, economic, political and social dimensions is adopted. 3. Risk management involves rapid removal of technical vulnerabilities, preventing and responding to attacks and threats, and minimizing potential damages. Having and implementing a preparedness and continuity plan against cyber incidents is important in minimising losses. 2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy 16/26 4. Besides cooperation among all stakeholders including public, private sector, universities, non-governmental organization and individuals, achieving and sustaining cyber space security demands international cooperation and information exchange and building trust. 5. All stakeholders must pay regard to the rule of law, freedom of expression, fundamental human rights and freedoms as well as principles of protection of privacy in their efforts to ensure cyber security. 6. Stakeholders observe transparency, accountability and ethical values while performing their responsibilities in management of risks in cyber space. 7. Implemented cyber security measures must be proportional to relevant risks, positive and negative impacts must be assessed and balanced. 8. The use of national products and services is encouraged in meeting cyber security requirements; research and development projects are endorsed for developing such products and services, and innovation is regarded as essential. 2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy 17/26 3 Cyber Security Risks Cyber security risks were assessed realistically in order to define strategic objectives within the scope of cyber security. The determined risks have been listed below: 1. Interruption of energy, transportation etc. critical services as the result of denial of service attacks and similar targeted attacks on information systems used by critical infrastructures. 2. Stealing, disclosure, modification or destruction of personal information and confidential publicly owned information by attackers as a consequence of targeted attacks towards information systems used by public and critical infrastructures. 3. Stealing, disclosure, modification or destruction of sensitive or commercially valuable data by attackers as the result of targeted attacks focused on acquiring trade secrets and know-how of institutions and organizations (private companies, research institutions and defence industry) engaging in research, development and production. 4. Harm the reputation of various institutions and organizations or the disclosure, modification or destruction of sensitive information/data as a consequence of hacker (hacktivism) attacks for propaganda purposes. 2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy 18/26 5. Material damage as a consequence of service failure due to denial of service and similar attacks on e-commerce companies, e-mail and social media service providers, creation of fake operation records; attackers acquiring, disclosing, modifying or destructing confidential information. 6. Loss of reputation by companies engaged in e-commerce, finance sector or other corporations offering online payment or money transfer services as a consequence of attackers stealing sensitive customer information, social distrust towards online transactions and material loss incurred by customers using such services. 7. Discontinuity of small and medium sized industry operations, commerce and service sector companies due to a lack of security measures in their IT systems or human error, resulting in attackers stealing, disclosing, modifying or destructing sensitive or commercial information. 8. Exposure to malware and phishing attacks, fraud and identity theft, attackers stealing, modifying or destructing personal information and devices and performing fake transactions due to reasons such as social addiction to internet and social networks, insufficient knowledge and awareness about cyber security, and failing to take personal security measures in mobile and stationary information systems. 2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy 19/26 9. Fraud at any institution and organization as the result of bulk mail, malware and similar attacks. 10. Interruption of services and operations provided via information systems at any institution and organization as the consequence of human errors or natural disasters. 2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy 20/26 4 Strategic Cyber Security Objectives and Actions For the 2016-2019 period, strategic objectives aiming to minimise current risks in light of the determined principles are as follows: 1.

First, for all stakeholders to acknowledge the understanding that   cyber security is an integral part of national security. Second, acquiring the   competency that will allow taking administrative and technological precautions   for maintaining the absolute security of all systems and stakeholders in national   cyber space. In order to achieve this main objective, it is among the purposes of   this document to determine targets and sub actions, while ensuring and   supervising their implementation.   In line with these objectives:   • Ensuring the security, confidentiality and privacy of all services,   transactions and information/data provided through information   technologies as well as systems used for the provision of such, provided   that they cover cyber space entirely,   • Determining cyber security actions to minimise the effects of cyber   security incidents, recovering systems to normal functions as quickly as   possible after incidents and ensuring higher efficiency in the exploration     2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy 12/26      and investigation of emerging crime by judicial authorities and law   enforcement forces,   • Locally developing critical technologies and products for ensuring cyber   security, confidentiality and privacy, or otherwise, taking measures to   ensure that technology and products procured from abroad shall be solely   and safely used for this purpose,    are addressed in this plan.   1.7 Scope   The 2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy and Action Plan covers all   components of national cyber space on a national scale, including small and   medium scaled industry, all natural and legal persons in addition to public   information systems and information systems of critical infrastructures operated   by public or private sector.    1.8 Update   The National Cyber Security Strategy shall be updated with national level   coordination with respect to demands received from the public and privet sector,   and with consideration to developing technology, changing conditions and   requirements.   Actions included in this plan which cannot be accomplished by the end of 2019   will be carried on to the next action plan.     2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy 13/26      1.9 Cyber Security Strategies and Action Plans in the World    This section presents important and points from Cyber Security Strategy   documents published by other countries.    Similar to the 2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy and Action Plan,   potential cyber security risks and principles for implementing risks mitigating   actions are mentioned in strategy documents of other countries and it was   observed that the risks and principles did not vary significantly among countries.   Significant principles within this context are as follows:   a. Fulfilment of all legal and social responsibilities by individuals,   institutions, society and state in providing cyber security,    b. Coordination, joint participation, collaboration and information sharing   between the public sector, private sector, universities and non-  governmental organizations,    c. Advanced cyber incident management cooperation between International   Cyber Security Operation Centres.   Significant risks in the reviewed documents include:   1. Social network addiction of society,   2. Positions of critical institutions and organizations in cyber space,   3. Various cyber spying efforts and targeted attacks,   4. Lack personnel and competency,      2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy 14/26      5. Lack of coordination between institutions,   6. Economic concerns concerning sectors of varying scales operating in   cyber space.   National cyber security principles, risks, strategic cyber security objectives   and action plans have been determined with regard to these principles and risks.     2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy 15/26      2 Principles   The principles to be considered in ensuring national cyber security are as   follows:    1. Cyber security is ensured by means of methods based on efficient and   continuous assessment and improvement based on risk assessment. It is   aimed that risk management methods to be created will address threats   and vulnerabilities and determine new risks and to offer methods for   reducing these risks to an acceptable level.   2. In order to provide cyber security, all stakeholders must know about cyber   security risks and be aware that their approaches towards the management   of these risks will affect not only them but also others. In order to achieve   this level of awareness and competency, all stakeholders must acquire   necessary trainings and experience. In addition to the technical dimension,   an integrated approach including legal, administrative, economic, political   and social dimensions is adopted.   3. Risk management involves rapid removal of technical vulnerabilities,   preventing and responding to attacks and threats, and minimizing   potential damages. Having and implementing a preparedness and   continuity plan against cyber incidents is important in minimising losses.     2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy 16/26      4. Besides cooperation among all stakeholders including public, private   sector, universities, non-governmental organization and individuals,   achieving and sustaining cyber space security demands international   cooperation and information exchange and building trust.    5. All stakeholders must pay regard to the rule of law, freedom of   expression, fundamental human rights and freedoms as well as principles   of protection of privacy in their efforts to ensure cyber security.    6. Stakeholders observe transparency, accountability and ethical values   while performing their responsibilities in management of risks in cyber   space.   7. Implemented cyber security measures must be proportional to relevant   risks, positive and negative impacts must be assessed and balanced.   8. The use of national products and services is encouraged in meeting cyber   security requirements; research and development projects are endorsed for   developing such products and services, and innovation is regarded as   essential.     2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy 17/26      3 Cyber Security Risks   Cyber security risks were assessed realistically in order to define strategic   objectives within the scope of cyber security. The determined risks have been   listed below:    1. Interruption of energy, transportation etc. critical services as the result of   denial of service attacks and similar targeted attacks on information   systems used by critical infrastructures.   2. Stealing, disclosure, modification or destruction of personal information   and confidential publicly owned information by attackers as a   consequence of targeted attacks towards information systems used by   public and critical infrastructures.    3. Stealing, disclosure, modification or destruction of sensitive or   commercially valuable data by attackers as the result of targeted attacks   focused on acquiring trade secrets and know-how of institutions and   organizations (private companies, research institutions and defence   industry) engaging in research, development and production.   4. Harm the reputation of various institutions and organizations or the   disclosure, modification or destruction of sensitive information/data as a   consequence of hacker (hacktivism) attacks for propaganda purposes.      2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy 18/26      5. Material damage as a consequence of service failure due to denial of   service and similar attacks on e-commerce companies, e-mail and social   media service providers, creation of fake operation records; attackers   acquiring, disclosing, modifying or destructing confidential information.   6. Loss of reputation by companies engaged in e-commerce, finance sector   or other corporations offering online payment or money transfer services   as a consequence of attackers stealing sensitive customer information,   social distrust towards online transactions and material loss incurred by   customers using such services.   7. Discontinuity of small and medium sized industry operations, commerce   and service sector companies due to a lack of security measures in their IT   systems or human error, resulting in attackers stealing, disclosing,   modifying or destructing sensitive or commercial information.    8. Exposure to malware and phishing attacks, fraud and identity theft,   attackers stealing, modifying or destructing personal information and   devices and performing fake transactions due to reasons such as social   addiction to internet and social networks, insufficient knowledge and   awareness about cyber security, and failing to take personal security   measures in mobile and stationary information systems.     2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy 19/26      9. Fraud at any institution and organization as the result of bulk mail,   malware and similar attacks.   10. Interruption of services and operations provided via information systems   at any institution and organization as the consequence of human errors or   natural disasters.      2016-2019 National Cyber Security Strategy 20/26      4 Strategic Cyber Security Objectives and Actions   For the 2016-2019 period, strategic objectives aiming to minimise current risks   in light of the determined principles are as follows:   1.

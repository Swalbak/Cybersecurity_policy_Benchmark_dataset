All rights reserved. His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai 2 Challenges have never prevented us from pursuing our ambitions, and they never will. We are determined to transform challenges into opportunities for creativity and innovation, and explore new ideas and initiatives that can help us achieve our aspirations. The Dubai Cyber Security Strategy, which adds to the government’s numerous achievements, gives further impetus to our journey of excellence in cyber space. On the occasion of the launch of this Strategy, I would like to thank all those who contributed to its development and call on them to recommit to the highest excellence and leadership and forge ahead with our goals so that we can create even more happiness and prosperity for our people. We have great confidence in the ability of the government and private sectors in the UAE to successfully implement the Dubai Cyber Security Strategy. Let us double our efforts and work diligently to make the UAE one of world’s digitally safest countries. — His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum 3 His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of the Executive Council 4 “A new history of Dubai is being created and signed by Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.” — His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum 5 Thanks to the technological leadership, which constitutes one of the major pillars of the city, Dubai is now a leading international hub and an attractive investment destination for national, regional and international institutions. Also, the huge technological advancements happening across the region have contributed in attracting the countries attention around the world to Dubai. The goals of technological development will never be met in the absence of supportive frameworks that promote the security and safety of information systems. Therefore, establishing a reliable and safe cyber space is essential to continuing the development march and facing future challenges. In line with the vision of Vice President and Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum to place Dubai among the most secure cities electronically in the world, we have launched the Dubai Cyber Security Strategy, which defines Dubai’s vision and objectives in this regard. The plan provides rules protecting the data and electronic services from threats and attacks, as well as protects companies, individual users or any information technology-related activities. The path to become a smart city is full of challenges, however, this will not prevent us from achieving our goals. We will continue the hard work with the determination and perseverance we have learned from our role models and leaders in the UAE in order to make Dubai one of the most secure cities electronically worldwide ― just as His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum envisions. Raising the awareness of cyber security is a key element of promoting the success of the strategy. The goal is to build a more secure information society that is perfectly aware of cyber security risks. One of the key objectives of this strategy is to address any risks, threats or attacks, as well as allowing user access to various aspects of information technology so as to promote the success of the strategy in the future. Achieving these objectives depends upon the participation and cooperation of all the governmental and non-governmental sectors in the city. Let us all work as one team, as per the directives of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, in order to lay a solid basis for a free and secure cyber world that fosters scientific research and innovation. — H.E. Yousuf Al Shaibani DESC Executive Director FOREWORD 7 The growth of the internet and cyber space has had a tremendous impact on all parts of society, ranging from the public and private sectors to the individual. Our daily lives, social interactions and economies depend on information and communication technologies working reliably, seamlessly and securely. An open and free cyber space provides value by reducing barriers to trade, as well as barriers between countries, communities and citizens, and allowing information sharing across the globe. It is important to protect this value against the risks of malicious activities and disruptions — only a secure cyber space can provide trust and confidence for the individuals, businesses and the public sector. Dubai is a major target for malicious actors using the cyber space for their attacks. This can affect Dubai’s public and private sectors, as well as individuals in many different ways. Statistics show that these problems are rapidly increasing, and the methods employed in malicious attacks are becoming even more sophisticated. The Dubai Plan 2021 describes the future of Dubai through holistic and complementary perspectives, starting with the people and the society. The plan addresses the urban environment including both natural and built assets. It looks at the living experience of the people of Dubai and its visitors as a result of their interaction with this environment and the economic and social services provided. Several goals of the Dubai Plan 2021 are supported by this strategy, particularly the following statement: “The Most Secure Place: A feeling among residents and workers living in Dubai and tourists visiting Dubai, that the city is a safe and secure place and that any personal security concerns are dealt with efficiently and transparently by law enforcement authorities.” 1 INTRODUCTION See Dubai Plan 2021, “The Experience”, Aim 3 9 The Dubai Electronic Security Center (DESC) was founded pursuant to Law No. 11 in 2014 with the aim to develop and implement information security practices and set good-practice criteria for cyber security, across the Emirate. DESC’s strategic plan includes initiatives to combat threats, cyber attacks, and cyber crime. DESC has created this strategy to help protect Dubai from cyber security risks with the aim of supporting the growth and innovation of Dubai and its economy. This strategy describes the actions required to reduce risks and secure the benefits of a trusted cyber space for organizations and individuals in Dubai. It details what organizations and individuals can do to contribute to a safe and secure cyber space, thereby supporting Dubai’s future success. The timeline for the implementation of this strategy is five years. The following picture illustrates how the different elements of this strategy relate to each other. VISION OUTCOMES BENEFITS STRATEGY measured by on success yields achieved by GUIDING PRINCIPLES (Section 3) guided by DOMAINS AND OBJECTIVES (Section 4) consists of 10 2 WHY THIS STRATEGY? This section describes the opportunities for growth and innovation existing in the cyber space and the associated cyber security risks in more detail. 2.1 GLOBAL CONNECTIONS In December 2016, more than 91% of the UAE population used the internet. The internet-based economy continues to grow at a fast rate. New developments such as cloud, internet of things and smart cities all make use of the interconnectivity provided by the cyber space. Therefore, the UAE population’s exposure to cyber space is likely to increase. Public and private sectors are also benefiting from improved online and mobile technologies, for example by the creation of products and services tailored and delivered according to individual needs. Along with the increased connectivity, physical objects and people in real world become interconnected without physical constraints. This leads to an “interconnected information society” where physical space and cyber space are more integrated through the free flow of information and communications. This will enable Dubai and its citizens to create innovative products and services, thereby generating new value exponentially. However, such value may only be realized if the use of the cyber space is secure. People need to be confident that the networks which support private and business activities, and economic prosperity are safe and resilient. DESC has created this cyber security strategy to protect Dubai’s public and private sectors and individuals from these cyber crimes and other cyber risks. As such, the implementation of this strategy is one of its highest priorities. 11 2.2 THREATS AND RISKS OF CYBER SPACE The cyber space attacks lead to a variety of threats, such as: FRAUD ESPIONAGE TERRORISM VIOLATION OF PRIVACY DEFAMATION These threats already affect the public and private sectors, and the individuals in Dubai using the cyber space. The UAE is a large target for attackers; in 2016, 5.14 billion dirhams were lost through cyber crime. Published figures show the continuous rise of cyber crime in the UAE. According to Dubai Police, around one in five residents in the UAE were victims of cyber crime in 2015, and reports of cyber crime increased by 23% in 2015 alone. It is expected that these rates will grow even faster at least until the year 2020. The Dubai Electronic Security Center in Dubai has been set up according to the law of its establishment to protect against cyber crime and hacking and develop both technical and non-technical solutions to keep up with this situation. cybercrime-cost-uae-dh5-14b-this-year-1.1933736 rises-23-percent--621167.html security-centre-established-in-dubai-1.1346144 12 3 GUIDING PRINCIPLES There are some underlying guiding principles that need consideration to achieve the objective of this strategy: 3.1 FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION Everyone should have the ability and right to access the cyber space in terms of skills, technology and opportunity. The cyber space needs to remain open to innovation and free flow of ideas, information, and expression. This requires security and reliability of the information used. Information should not be altered without any legitimate reason, and shall be delivered to intended recipients. There is a need to respect individual rights of privacy and provide proper protection to intellectual property. In this sense, due consideration should be made to maintain the proper balance between open technology and the individual rights of privacy. Overall, the cyber space should be a competitive environment which ensures a fair return on investment in infrastructure, services and content. In Dubai, the free flow of information across the public and private sectors, investors, residents and visitors is supported by the Dubai Data Manual, led by the Dubai Data Establishment. “Our aim is not to have the most data, but to unleash the greatest value from data, creating new opportunities and improved experiences for all.” — His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum The Dubai Data Manual sets out the guidance to be followed by Dubai Government entities to manage their data, in alignment with the Dubai Government’s commitment to agile development of user-centric and data-driven services. 13 14 Dubai’s vision is contingent upon the free flow of information where the public sector has embarked upon a programme to transform Dubai into the smartest, happiest city in the world. Data and information will be the “new currency” by which the public and private sectors, citizens and residents will exchange value and develop new, innovative ways to live, learn and do business in a culture of secure data sharing. 3.2 CONSIDERATION OF RISK It is important for individuals using the cyber space to understand that absolute security cannot be achieved. Public and private sector organizations, as well as individuals using the cyber space should be fully aware of the risks they could be facing. This all-pervasive awareness contributes more to cyber security than any single organization can. The proactive risk assessment is a core component of Dubai’s Information Security Regulations (ISR). The implementation of the ISR is already mandatory for Dubai’s public sector, and it is highly recommended for the private sector to also apply ISR, or similar standards (based on their business requirements), such as ISO/IEC 27001 or the National Electronic Security Authority (NESA) Information Assurance Standard (IAS). It is important to note that all the above standards place similar emphasis on undertaking information security risk assessments. Additionally, their approach to risk assessments are compatible, and can be used in combination with each other. Although individual citizens will not perform a risk assessment, the Cyber Security Strategy will address the risks faced through its Cyber Smart Society domain. 3.3 COLLABORATION The cyber space interconnects in multiple dimensions and cannot be addressed by Dubai’s public sector alone, nor managed by just one country or city. Dubai’s public sector needs to work hand in hand with the private sector and individuals. All cyber space stakeholders, including the Critical Information Infrastructure (CII), should share a common vision of cyber security and fulfill their responsibilities for cyber security and cyber resilience. It is important that all organizations and individuals understand their responsibilities in achieving a secure cyber space (this is also further addressed in National and International Collaboration domain later in the document). Similarly, the risks of the cyber space is transnational. Therefore, Dubai needs to seek partnerships with other regional and international cities, countries, initiatives; the risks cannot be managed through Dubai’s defense alone. Countries can protect against threats through better cooperation between Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) and concerted efforts at international diplomacy. Such interaction can be supported by the use of international standards, such as ISO/ IEC 27001, which interface well with Dubai’s Information Security Regulations. International collaboration should also seek harmonization in the legal field. “I believe that if the vision is clear then the objectives can be easily achieved.” — His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum 15 3.4 COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS All applicable laws and regulations should be applied to the cyber space in order to achieve cyber security and enhance awareness of all society about the importance of compliance with legislation. Legislation taken into consideration when developing this strategy includes: • Federal Law No. (7) of 2002 on Intellectual Property • Federal Law No. (1) of 2006 on Electronic Commerce and Transactions • Federal Law No. (5) of 2012 on Cyber crime Prevention • Law No. (4) of 2016 on Dubai Economic Security Center • The Executive Council of Dubai Government Resolution No. (13) of 2012 for Information Security Regulation in Dubai Government It is required to establish international rules and norms in conformity with universal values as cyber space is not restricted to Dubai. 3.5 CYBER SECURITY ARCHITECTURE Different stakeholders need to work together to implement the cyber security strategy and provide Dubai’s public and private sectors, and individuals with a safer cyber space. The cyber security architecture depicted below illustrates the different responsibilities in the overall cyber security programme: STAKEHOLDERS PUBLIC SECTOR PRIVATE SECTOR LAWS AND REGULATIONS, POLICIES, STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES set by INDIVIDUALS implemented by N ATIO N AL C O LLABO RATIO N IN TERN ATIO N AL C O LLABO RATIO N 16 4 STRATEGY DOMAINS AND OBJECTIVES CYBER SMART SOCIETY Achieving awareness, skills and capabilities to manage cyber security risks for Dubai’s public and private sectors, and individuals INNOVATION Promoting research and development for cyber security, and establishing a free, fair and secure cyber space in Dubai CYBER SECURITY Putting controls in place to protect confidentiality, integrity and availability, as well as data privacy for Dubai’s public and private sectors, and individuals CYBER RESILIENCE Ensuring the continuity of IT systems and their availability in the cyber space NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION Establishing national and international collaboration to manage cyber risks The Cyber Security Strategy has a set of main domains, which, together with the guiding principles listed in Section 3, will be established and implemented to achieve cyber security. The Cyber Security Strategy is implemented by different stakeholders, that all need to achieve their objectives and work together to create a secure cyber Dubai. These objectives are outlined in the sections later in the document. 19 Organizations (public and private sectors) should be encouraged to build a well educated workforce with sufficient cyber security knowledge, as required for their roles and responsibilities. It is important to have such workforce in place to be able to manage incidents and protect the organization, as well as to be proactive (not reactive) to cyber security threats. Building such workforce should be supported by trainings, conferences and workshops. The results should be continuously monitored and measured. Organizations (public and private sectors) should provide awareness of cyber security threats, risks, and the required protection measures taken to their employees. This should include the employees’ responsibilities for information security, why their support is needed, and what happens if cyber security policies and procedures are violated. Organizations should implement a holistic and continuously developing awareness programme, addressing the different target groups of employees, including newcomers. 1 Availability of knowledgeable, experienced and trained personnel specialized in cyber security for public and private sector organizations 2 Cyber security awareness should be provided to public and private sectors’ employees CYBER SMART SOCIETY The aim of the Cyber Smart Society domain is to ensure that all people in Dubai have sufficient knowledge, understanding and awareness of cyber security, and their related responsibilities. This includes training for employees of the public and private sectors in Dubai, as well as awareness programmes for children, students and other individuals. Another objective of this domain is to establish programmes for students, professionals and experts to increase their knowledge on cyber security. “The future belongs to those who can imagine it, design it, and execute it.” — His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum 20 More people have been subject to cyber attacks in the last years, and this number is rapidly increasing. This trend is expected to continue rising especially with new technologies that will take more part in our lives. Schools, universities and other entities need to develop awareness campaigns and provide awareness to individuals about cyber security, and the possibilities of threats and risks in the cyberspace. The campaigns should be oriented to target groups using different forms of delivery to raise the awareness for cyber security. The campaigns should also use the offers made by DESC and other entities to learn more about cyber security. Dubai public sector, schools and universities should work together to increase the number of cyber security experts. This development needs strategic planning, and schools and universities should include cyber security in their curricula, by adding study subjects covering cyber specific topics. Universities and industry should work together to establish a plan for cyber security to raise the number of security experts, and motivate people towards this subject. There should also be training programmes for individuals to increase their cyber security knowledge, e.g. people working in organizations with a job that includes cyber security responsibilities. A certification scheme for cyber security professional might also be developed, e.g. using ISO/IEC 27021. Collaboration with other institutions should also be sought to develop security products and services that will be included in educational activities within the schools and/or universities, for example as guest lecturers. 3 Provision of cyber security awareness to individuals 4 Raising the skills of cyber security experts 21 INNOVATION The aim of the Innovation domain is to support research and development (R&D) activities, develop new technologies, and innovate new certification schemes for products or people to support the inclusion of cyber security in relevant innovations. “Innovation is continuous and does not stop at any limits or borders.” — His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum The threats and risks in the cyber space will become more sophisticated as technology develops. Therefore, research and development (R&D) is needed to protect successfully against the cyberattacks to come. Dubai‘s public and private sectors need to promote productive R&D. This should include the following initiatives: • Adoption of laws and regulations, where necessary • Inclusion of security in products and services in the design stage • Promotion of interdisciplinary research • More advanced monitoring and detection measures • Using new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), to increase the defense capabilities • Using national and international collaboration (refer also to National and International Collaboration domain) New technologies, such as the internet of things (IoT) or smart cities provide huge opportunities for Dubai, but can also pose risks as attackers might use these technologies to their advantage. It is therefore important to create secure systems and include security as an inherent part of their design, for the production of IoT devices as well as when designing smart cities. This should be supported by an incentive scheme that rewards organizations addressing cyber security in their products. 1 Promotion of research and development activities that support a secure cyber space 2 Adoption of cyber security in new technologies 22 CYBER SECURITY The aim of the Cyber Security domain is to ensure that organizations in the public and private sectors, particularly all those involved in the CII, implement information security management system standards. It is crucial that senior executives of organizations understand the importance of information security. In addition, a set of baseline security controls for individuals will be developed and the support will be provided for their implementation. Information and cyber security standards and guidelines will also be developed to further support the implementation of cyber security. “A new history of Dubai is being created and signed by Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.” — His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Senior executive management of an organization needs to understand that cyber security is an important asset, which allows organizations to grow and achieve their business objectives and promote cyber security controls as an “investment” for more progressive management. 1 Senior executive management needs to understand the importance of cyber security Dubai’s public sector should introduce new certification schemes that address security in new technologies (more granular schemes might be required for different technologies) and consider technology requirements for secure devices, as well as the use of sector-specific management system certification, e.g. for cloud service providers. The standard(s) for this scheme and the associated certifications need to be developed and should be based on international best practices. 3 Introduction of new certification schemes for cyber security 23 There are different standards that organizations in Dubai can benefit from. These standards will help achieve a common baseline for protection across the different organizations of Dubai. The Information Security Regulations (ISR) is mandatory for Dubai’s public and semi-public sectors. The private sector should also consider implementing ISR, or other applicable standards, such as ISO/IEC 27001 and/ or NESA UAE IAS for their information security management system. This is particularly important for organizations that are part of the CII. Other standards that can be considered are ISO/IEC 27035 (for incident management), ISO/IEC 27031 (ICT readiness for business continuity), or ISO 22301 and/or NCEMA 7000 (both for business continuity). The implementation of such standards has a number of important cornerstones: Responsibilities for cyber security need to be assigned. In addition to the necessary knowledge, expertise and training that people responsible for cyber security should have, it is a fundamental prerogative for the success of this role that there is access to senior executive management. This is particularly needed for proper decision making. Each organization needs to understand their exposure to cyber security risks. A method should be defined to carry out a risk assessment (refer also to the guiding principle “Consideration of Risk”) and the appropriate level of detail that provides enough information to decide on solutions. Based on the understanding of their individual risks, organizations need to develop and implement appropriate solutions. This can be done using either internationally or locally accepted standards as listed above. This solution design should take into account any existing security controls and set ownership, responsibilities or timelines for actions. 2 Implementation of an information security management system (ISMS) standard 24 A lot of cyber attacks are successfully exploiting vulnerabilities of the systems targeted. Whilst attacks on specific aims (banks, public sector, etc.) become increasingly sophisticated, the attacks at individuals are still often simple (e.g. phishing attacks or password cracking). Raising the bar of protection of individual systems can therefore help to counter the attacks. A set of baseline controls should be established, maintained and supported by Dubai individuals in their implementation. Such protection may include: • Protection against malicious software • Good password selection and management (including for IoT devices) • Use of appropriate firewall and network security tools • Applying system updates in a timely manner • Careful use of social media • Maintaining physical security of computers and devices in public • Responsible public Wi-Fi use, and securing your own Wi-Fi network Encouragement to apply and maintain such protections should be supported by the aforementioned rewards programme and by the provision of tools to check parts of the security status of a system. DESC has developed the Information Security Regulations (ISR), which is mandatory for Dubai’s public and semi-public sectors. DESC also provides an auditing function to verify that the standard has been implemented correctly. DESC has also developed this Cyber Security Strategy and is specialized to develop further standards and guidelines, including future service providers. DESC will also collaborate with competent authorities to set further standards, guidelines and tools that can help Dubai’s public sector, private sector and individuals to increase their cyber security capabilities. 3 Establishment of a set of baseline controls for cyber security, and support of their implementation 4 Continuous development of information and cyber security services standards and guidelines 25 CYBER RESILIENCE The aim of the Cyber Resilience domain is to ensure that organizations of Dubai’s public and private sectors, particularly organizations in the CII are resilient to cyber attacks and can continue their important business operations even in cases of problems. A key element to delivering such resilience is the establishment of a facility that provides support for the management of cyber security incidents, threat intelligence and a platform for information sharing. To achieve sufficient cyber resilience, it is necessary that organizations in the public and private sectors, particularly all those involved in the CII, implement standards to support IT system continuity, disaster recovery and wider business continuity. “We offer the world a new and unique model of developing cities which is always in need of different ideas and innovative creations.” — His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Organizations should share information about cyber security risks and incidents, and use the centralized infrastructure for incident management, which helps to: • Prevent incident spread • Allow for reporting of incidents • Set an overall scheme for reporting, analyzing and projecting the future As the service providers are at the forefront of cyber security attacks, incidents and events, their collaboration and reporting is particularly important to allow for the well-functioning of cyber security services. 1 Incidents should be reported, and information about cyber security risks should be shared 26 The cyber space includes telecom, internet service providers, organizations developing software, digital devices, etc., and organizations that provide services over the internet. All organizations playing an important role in Dubai’s cyber space should follow a set of rules to ensure that the cyber space is sufficiently secure. This is particularly the case for those organizations forming part of Dubai’s CII. It is important that these organizations establish a framework that supports effective maintenance and continuous improvement of their cyber security capabilities, e.g. through the implementation of ISR. DESC will provide the following functionalities for Dubai’s public and semi-public entities: • Incident monitoring, management and handling • Information about trends, issues, and new threats in the cyber space • Threat intelligence by linking different sources and using the information and technical capabilities available in DESC to form an integrated picture • A platform for information sharing in relation to cyber Dubai, its possibilities, strength and risks Provisions should be made to ensure continuation of all functions that are critical to the cyber space. Standards related to business continuity and ICT readiness (ISO/IEC 27031 (ICT readiness for business continuity), ISO 22301 and/or NCEMA 7000 (business continuity)) can be helpful to achieve this. Service providers, both present and future, operating within Dubai (e.g. cloud service providers), or internet communication services (such as communication as a platform) should be required to comply with a set of rules defined by DESC to ensure they are not compromising the security of the cyber space in Dubai. Organizations in the private sector, particularly those in the CII, should also consider to implement such standards. 2 Establishment, maintenance and improvement of defined cyber security and cyber resilience capabilities 3 Provision of support for incident management, threat intelligence, and a platform for information sharing 4 Compliance with cyber resilience standards 27 NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION The aim of this domain is to facilitate all national and international collaboration necessary to make Dubai’s cyber space secure and resilient. The national collaboration addresses the identification of organizations forming the CII of Dubai, and the establishment of a scheme that allows for secure information exchange, communication and collaboration and motivates private organizations not in the CII to join collaborative efforts. The international collaboration focuses on common regulations and global threats. Where necessary, new legislation or regulations should be established to facilitate cyber Dubai. “We have a clear goal; we want Dubai to be the smartest city in the world.” — His Higness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Cyber space is a shared space where communications and information exchange take place on the global level. Therefore, international collaboration is necessary to address the global issues related to cyber security. International collaboration will be established to: • Combat cyber threats and risks • Develop legislation, regulations and standards • Identify particular nations for collaboration/research 1 Establishment of international collaboration 28 DESC and other law enforcement agencies are currently building many international collaborations to combat cyber crimes and secure the cyber space within Dubai. Dubai public sector needs to build a national initiative for the collaboration organizations forming part of Dubai’s CII and make them work together to establish Cyber Dubai. This collaboration includes several activities: • Establishment of a scheme to exchange information between CII organizations • Collaboration and communication between CII organizations (this can benefit from the requirements and guidance provided in ISO/IEC 27010) • Provision of support from Dubai’s public sector • Establishment of an incentive scheme to encourage the private sector (not part of the CII) to participate in cyber security In addition, Dubai’s public sector needs to collaborate with federal organizations addressing cyber security in the UAE and its CII. Cyber crime can take many different forms, ranging from harmful digital communications of a criminal nature (cyberbullying), to violation of intellectual property given the broad scope of cyber crime and the range of organizations threatened, this particular area needs more detailed legal action to address cyber crime. Establishment of cyber security legislation and regulations requires the involvement from both the public and private sectors in Dubai, and in particular, agreements need to be established across borders to manage cyber crimes. 2 Collaboration between organizations forming part of the CII and establishment of partnerships with public and private sectors 3 Establishment of cyber security legislation and regulations 29 In 2016, DESC decided to develop a Cyber Security Strategy to protect Dubai from cyber security risks with the aim of supporting the growth and innovation of Dubai and its economy. The Cyber Security Strategy will impact all different sectors in Dubai, including the public and private sector, as well as the individuals. Therefore, the strategy was developed in cooperation with different stakeholders representing these different sectors. The development of the Cyber Security Strategy started by a benchmarking exercise, in which cyber security strategies from about 15 different countries had been compared and analyzed. This was followed by a number of workshops and meetings with different stakeholders in Dubai to collect comments and identify synergies. This was used to further improve the strategy, and set the road for its implementation. These stakeholders are the main drivers for the successful implementation of the strategy, and their collaboration is of utmost importance. The launch of the Cyber Security Strategy is the beginning of our journey, in which we are developing an operational Plan together with the stakeholders. This operational Plan is in the process of implementation with the engagement of a large number of different stakeholders. The overall time frame for the implementation of this Cyber Security Strategy is five years.

We are determined to  transform challenges into opportunities for creativity  and innovation, and explore new ideas and initiatives   that can help us achieve our aspirations.  The Dubai Cyber Security Strategy, which adds to the  government’s numerous achievements, gives further  impetus to our journey of excellence in cyber space.   On the occasion of the launch of this Strategy,  I would like to thank all those who contributed to its   development and call on them to recommit to the  highest excellence and leadership and forge ahead with   our goals so that we can create even more happiness  and prosperity for our people.  We have great confidence in the ability of  the government and private sectors in the UAE to  successfully implement the Dubai Cyber Security   Strategy. Let us double our efforts and work  diligently to make the UAE one of world’s digitally   safest countries. — His Highness Sheikh Mohammed   bin Rashid Al Maktoum   3    His Highness Sheikh Hamdan  bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum  Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman  of the Executive Council  4    “A new history of Dubai is being  created and signed by Mohammed   bin Rashid Al Maktoum.”  — His Highness Sheikh Hamdan  bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum  5      Thanks to the technological leadership,  which constitutes one of the major  pillars of the city, Dubai is now a leading  international hub and an attractive  investment destination for national,  regional and international institutions.  Also, the huge technological advancements  happening across the region have  contributed in attracting the countries  attention around the world to Dubai.  The goals of technological development  will never be met in the absence of  supportive frameworks that promote  the security and safety of information  systems. Therefore, establishing a reliable  and safe cyber space is essential to  continuing the development march and  facing future challenges.   In line with the vision of Vice President  and Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai,  His Highness Sheikh Mohammed  bin Rashid Al Maktoum to place  Dubai among the most secure cities  electronically in the world, we have  launched the Dubai Cyber Security  Strategy, which defines Dubai’s vision  and objectives in this regard. The plan  provides rules protecting the data and  electronic services from threats and  attacks, as well as protects companies,  individual users or any information  technology-related activities.  The path to become a smart city is full  of challenges, however, this will not  prevent us from achieving our goals.  We will continue the hard work with  the determination and perseverance  we have learned from our role models  and leaders in the UAE in order to  make Dubai one of the most secure  cities electronically worldwide ― just  as His Highness Sheikh Mohammed  bin Rashid Al Maktoum envisions.  Raising the awareness of cyber security is  a key element of promoting the success  of the strategy. The goal is to build a more  secure information society that is perfectly  aware of cyber security risks. One of the  key objectives of this strategy is to address  any risks, threats or attacks, as well as  allowing user access to various aspects of  information technology so as to promote  the success of the strategy in the future.  Achieving these objectives depends upon  the participation and cooperation of all  the governmental and non-governmental  sectors in the city. Let us all work as one  team, as per the directives of His Highness  Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, in order  to lay a solid basis for a free and secure  cyber world that fosters scientific research  and innovation.  — H.E. Yousuf Al Shaibani  DESC Executive Director  FOREWORD  7      The growth of the internet and cyber  space has had a tremendous impact on all  parts of society, ranging from the public  and private sectors to the individual.  Our daily lives, social interactions and  economies depend on information and  communication technologies working  reliably, seamlessly and securely. An open  and free cyber space provides value by  reducing barriers to trade, as well as  barriers between countries, communities  and citizens, and allowing information  sharing across the globe. It is important  to protect this value against the risks of  malicious activities and disruptions — only  a secure cyber space can provide trust and  confidence for the individuals, businesses  and the public sector.  Dubai is a major target for malicious  actors using the cyber space for their  attacks. This can affect Dubai’s public and  private sectors, as well as individuals in  many different ways. Statistics show that  these problems are rapidly increasing,  and the methods employed in malicious  attacks are becoming even more  sophisticated.  The Dubai Plan 2021 describes the  future of Dubai through holistic and  complementary perspectives, starting  with the people and the society. The  plan addresses the urban environment  including both natural and built assets.  It looks at the living experience of the  people of Dubai and its visitors as a result  of their interaction with this environment  and the economic and social services  provided. Several goals of the Dubai  Plan 2021 are supported by this strategy,  particularly the following statement:  “The Most Secure Place:  A feeling among residents  and workers living in Dubai  and tourists visiting Dubai,  that the city is a safe and  secure place and that any  personal security concerns  are dealt with efficiently  and transparently by law  enforcement authorities.”   1 INTRODUCTION   See Dubai Plan 2021, “The Experience”, Aim 3  9    The Dubai Electronic Security Center  (DESC) was founded pursuant to Law  No. 11 in 2014 with the aim to develop  and implement information security  practices and set good-practice criteria  for cyber security, across the Emirate.  DESC’s strategic plan includes initiatives  to combat threats, cyber attacks, and  cyber crime.   DESC has created this strategy to help  protect Dubai from cyber security  risks with the aim of supporting the  growth and innovation of Dubai and its   economy. This strategy describes the  actions required to reduce risks and  secure the benefits of a trusted cyber  space for organizations and individuals  in Dubai. It details what organizations  and individuals can do to contribute to  a safe and secure cyber space, thereby  supporting Dubai’s future success. The  timeline for the implementation of this  strategy is five years.  The following picture illustrates how  the different elements of this strategy  relate to each other.  VISION  OUTCOMES BENEFITS  STRATEGY  measured by on success yields  achieved by  GUIDING PRINCIPLES (Section 3)  guided by  DOMAINS AND OBJECTIVES (Section 4)  consists of  10    2 WHY THIS  STRATEGY?  This section describes the opportunities  for growth and innovation existing in  the cyber space and the associated  cyber security risks in more detail.  2.1 GLOBAL  CONNECTIONS In December 2016, more than 91% of  the UAE population used the internet.  The internet-based economy continues  to grow at a fast rate. New developments  such as cloud, internet of things  and smart cities all make use of the  interconnectivity provided by the cyber  space. Therefore, the UAE population’s  exposure to cyber space is likely to  increase. Public and private sectors are  also benefiting from improved online  and mobile technologies, for example  by the creation of products and services  tailored and delivered according to  individual needs.  Along with the increased connectivity,  physical objects and people in real  world become interconnected without  physical constraints. This leads to an  “interconnected information society”  where physical space and cyber space  are more integrated through the free  flow of information and communications.  This will enable Dubai and its citizens  to create innovative products and  services, thereby generating new value  exponentially.  However, such value may only be  realized if the use of the cyber space  is secure. People need to be confident  that the networks which support private  and business activities, and economic  prosperity are safe and resilient. DESC  has created this cyber security strategy  to protect Dubai’s public and private  sectors and individuals from these cyber  crimes and other cyber risks. As such,  the implementation of this strategy is  one of its highest priorities.   http://www.internetworldstats.com/me/ae.htm  11    2.2 THREATS AND RISKS  OF CYBER SPACE The cyber space attacks lead to a variety  of threats, such as:  FRAUD ESPIONAGE TERRORISM  VIOLATION  OF PRIVACY DEFAMATION  These threats already affect the public  and private sectors, and the individuals in  Dubai using the cyber space. The UAE is  a large target for attackers; in 2016, 5.14  billion dirhams were lost through cyber  crime.  Published figures show the continuous rise  of cyber crime in the UAE. According to  Dubai Police, around one in five residents  in the UAE were victims of cyber  crime in 2015, and reports of cyber  crime increased by 23% in 2015 alone.  It is expected that these rates will grow  even faster at least until the year 2020.  The Dubai Electronic Security Center  in Dubai has been set up according to  the law of its establishment to protect  against cyber crime and hacking and  develop both technical and non-technical  solutions to keep up with this situation.  http://gulfnews.com/business/sectors/technology/ cybercrime-cost-uae-dh5-14b-this-year-1.1933736  http://www.arabianbusiness.com/dubai-cybercrime- rises-23-percent--621167.html   http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/government/cyber- security-centre-established-in-dubai-1.1346144  12    3 GUIDING  PRINCIPLES  There are some underlying guiding  principles that need consideration to  achieve the objective of this strategy:  3.1 FREE FLOW  OF INFORMATION Everyone should have the ability and  right to access the cyber space in terms  of skills, technology and opportunity.  The cyber space needs to remain open  to innovation and free flow of ideas,  information, and expression. This requires  security and reliability of the information  used. Information should not be altered  without any legitimate reason, and shall be  delivered to intended recipients.   There is a need to respect individual rights  of privacy and provide proper protection  to intellectual property. In this sense,  due consideration should be made to  maintain the proper balance between  open technology and the individual  rights of privacy. Overall, the cyber space  should be a competitive environment  which ensures a fair return on investment  in infrastructure, services and content.  In Dubai, the free flow of information  across the public and private sectors,  investors, residents and visitors is  supported by the Dubai Data Manual,  led by the Dubai Data Establishment.  “Our aim is not to have  the most data, but to  unleash the greatest value  from data, creating  new opportunities  and improved  experiences for all.” — His Highness Sheikh Mohammed  bin Rashid Al Maktoum  The Dubai Data Manual sets out the  guidance to be followed by Dubai  Government entities to manage their data,  in alignment with the Dubai Government’s  commitment to agile development of  user-centric and data-driven services.  13    14     Dubai’s vision is contingent upon the  free flow of information where the public  sector has embarked upon a programme  to transform Dubai into the smartest,  happiest city in the world. Data and  information will be the “new currency”  by which the public and private sectors,  citizens and residents will exchange value  and develop new, innovative ways to live,  learn and do business in a culture of  secure data sharing.  3.2 CONSIDERATION OF RISK It is important for individuals using the  cyber space to understand that absolute  security cannot be achieved. Public and  private sector organizations, as well as  individuals using the cyber space should  be fully aware of the risks they could  be facing. This all-pervasive awareness  contributes more to cyber security than  any single organization can.  The proactive risk assessment is a core  component of Dubai’s Information  Security Regulations (ISR). The  implementation of the ISR is already  mandatory for Dubai’s public sector,  and it is highly recommended for the  private sector to also apply ISR, or similar  standards (based on their business  requirements), such as ISO/IEC 27001 or  the National Electronic Security Authority  (NESA) Information Assurance Standard  (IAS). It is important to note that all the  above standards place similar emphasis  on undertaking information security risk  assessments. Additionally, their approach  to risk assessments are compatible,  and can be used in combination with  each other. Although individual citizens  will not perform a risk assessment, the  Cyber Security Strategy will address  the risks faced through its Cyber Smart  Society domain.  3.3 COLLABORATION  The cyber space interconnects in multiple  dimensions and cannot be addressed by  Dubai’s public sector alone, nor managed  by just one country or city. Dubai’s public  sector needs to work hand in hand with  the private sector and individuals. All  cyber space stakeholders, including the  Critical Information Infrastructure (CII),  should share a common vision of cyber  security and fulfill their responsibilities  for cyber security and cyber resilience.  It is important that all organizations  and individuals understand their  responsibilities in achieving a secure cyber  space (this is also further addressed in  National and International Collaboration  domain later in the document).  Similarly, the risks of the cyber space is  transnational. Therefore, Dubai needs to  seek partnerships with other regional and  international cities, countries, initiatives;  the risks cannot be managed through  Dubai’s defense alone.   Countries can protect against threats  through better cooperation between  Computer Emergency Response  Teams (CERTs) and concerted efforts  at international diplomacy. Such  interaction can be supported by the use  of international standards, such as ISO/ IEC 27001, which interface well with  Dubai’s Information Security Regulations.  International collaboration should also  seek harmonization in the legal field.  “I believe that if the  vision is clear then  the objectives can be  easily achieved.” — His Highness Sheikh Mohammed  bin Rashid Al Maktoum  15    3.4 COMPLIANCE  WITH REGULATIONS All applicable laws and regulations should  be applied to the cyber space in order  to achieve cyber security and enhance  awareness of all society about the  importance of compliance with legislation.  Legislation taken into consideration when  developing this strategy includes:  • Federal Law No. (7) of 2002  on Intellectual Property  • Federal Law No. (1) of 2006  on Electronic Commerce and  Transactions  • Federal Law No. (5) of 2012  on Cyber crime Prevention   • Law No. (4) of 2016 on Dubai  Economic Security Center  • The Executive Council of Dubai  Government Resolution No. (13) of 2012  for Information Security Regulation in  Dubai Government  It is required to establish international  rules and norms in conformity with  universal values as cyber space is not  restricted to Dubai.  3.5 CYBER SECURITY  ARCHITECTURE Different stakeholders need to work  together to implement the cyber security  strategy and provide Dubai’s public and  private sectors, and individuals with  a safer cyber space. The cyber security  architecture depicted below illustrates  the different responsibilities in the overall  cyber security programme:  STAKEHOLDERS  PUBLIC SECTOR  PRIVATE SECTOR  LAWS AND REGULATIONS, POLICIES, STANDARDS  AND GUIDELINES set by  INDIVIDUALS  implemented by  N ATIO  N AL  C O LLABO  RATIO N  IN TERN  ATIO N AL  C O LLABO  RATIO N  16    4 STRATEGY  DOMAINS AND  OBJECTIVES      CYBER SMART SOCIETY   Achieving awareness, skills and capabilities  to manage cyber security risks for Dubai’s public  and private sectors, and individuals  INNOVATION Promoting research and development for cyber  security, and establishing a free, fair and secure  cyber space in Dubai  CYBER SECURITY Putting controls in place to protect confidentiality,  integrity and availability, as well as data  privacy for Dubai’s public and private sectors,  and individuals  CYBER RESILIENCE Ensuring the continuity of IT systems and  their availability in the cyber space  NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL  COLLABORATION  Establishing national and international  collaboration to manage cyber risks  The Cyber Security Strategy has a set of main domains,  which, together with the guiding principles listed  in Section 3, will be established and implemented  to achieve cyber security.  The Cyber Security Strategy is implemented by  different stakeholders, that all need to achieve their  objectives and work together to create a secure cyber  Dubai. These objectives are outlined in the sections  later in the document.  19    Organizations (public and private sectors) should be  encouraged to build a well educated workforce with  sufficient cyber security knowledge, as required for  their roles and responsibilities. It is important to have  such workforce in place to be able to manage incidents  and protect the organization, as well as to be proactive  (not reactive) to cyber security threats. Building such  workforce should be supported by trainings, conferences  and workshops. The results should be continuously  monitored and measured.  Organizations (public and private sectors) should  provide awareness of cyber security threats, risks, and the  required protection measures taken to their employees.  This should include the employees’ responsibilities  for information security, why their support is needed,  and what happens if cyber security policies and  procedures are violated.  Organizations should implement a holistic and  continuously developing awareness programme,  addressing the different target groups of employees,  including newcomers.  1 Availability of  knowledgeable,  experienced and  trained personnel  specialized in cyber  security for public  and private sector  organizations  2 Cyber security  awareness should be  provided to public  and private sectors’  employees  CYBER SMART  SOCIETY The aim of the Cyber Smart Society domain is to ensure that  all people in Dubai have sufficient knowledge, understanding  and awareness of cyber security, and their related  responsibilities. This includes training for employees of the  public and private sectors in Dubai, as well as awareness  programmes for children, students and other individuals.  Another objective of this domain is to establish programmes  for students, professionals and experts to increase their  knowledge on cyber security.  “The future belongs to those who can  imagine it, design it, and execute it.”  — His Highness Sheikh Mohammed  bin Rashid Al Maktoum  20    More people have been subject to cyber attacks  in the last years, and this number is rapidly  increasing. This trend is expected to continue rising  especially with new technologies that will take more  part in our lives.  Schools, universities and other entities need  to develop awareness campaigns and provide  awareness to individuals about cyber security, and  the possibilities of threats and risks in the cyberspace.  The campaigns should be oriented to target groups  using different forms of delivery to raise the  awareness for cyber security.  The campaigns should  also use the offers made by DESC and other entities  to learn more about cyber security.  Dubai public sector, schools and universities should  work together to increase the number of cyber  security experts. This development needs strategic  planning, and schools and universities should include  cyber security in their curricula, by adding study  subjects covering cyber specific topics.  Universities and industry should work together  to establish a plan for cyber security to raise the  number of security experts, and motivate people  towards this subject.  There should also be training programmes for  individuals to increase their cyber security knowledge,  e.g. people working in organizations with a job that  includes cyber security responsibilities. A certification  scheme for cyber security professional might also be  developed, e.g. using ISO/IEC 27021.  Collaboration with other institutions should also  be sought to develop security products and services  that will be included in educational activities within  the schools and/or universities, for example as  guest lecturers.  3 Provision of cyber  security awareness  to individuals  4 Raising the skills  of cyber security  experts  21    INNOVATION The aim of the Innovation domain is to support research and  development (R&D) activities, develop new technologies, and  innovate new certification schemes for products or people to  support the inclusion of cyber security in relevant innovations.  “Innovation is continuous and does  not stop at any limits or borders.” — His Highness Sheikh Mohammed  bin Rashid Al Maktoum  The threats and risks in the cyber space will become more  sophisticated as technology develops. Therefore, research  and development (R&D) is needed to protect successfully  against the cyberattacks to come.   Dubai‘s public and private sectors need to promote  productive R&D. This should include the following initiatives:  • Adoption of laws and regulations, where necessary  • Inclusion of security in products and services in the  design stage  • Promotion of interdisciplinary research   • More advanced monitoring and detection measures   • Using new technologies, such as artificial intelligence  (AI), to increase the defense capabilities  • Using national and international collaboration (refer  also to National and International Collaboration domain)  New technologies, such as the internet of things (IoT) or  smart cities provide huge opportunities for Dubai, but can  also pose risks as attackers might use these technologies to  their advantage.   It is therefore important to create secure systems and  include security as an inherent part of their design, for  the production of IoT devices as well as when designing  smart cities.  This should be supported by an incentive scheme  that rewards organizations addressing cyber security  in their products.  1 Promotion  of research and  development  activities that  support a secure  cyber space  2 Adoption  of cyber security  in new technologies   22    CYBER SECURITY The aim of the Cyber Security domain is to ensure  that organizations in the public and private sectors,  particularly all those involved in the CII, implement  information security management system standards.  It is crucial that senior executives of organizations  understand the importance of information security.  In addition, a set of baseline security controls for  individuals will be developed and the support will be  provided for their implementation. Information and cyber  security standards and guidelines will also be developed  to further support the implementation of cyber security.  “A new history of Dubai is being  created and signed by Mohammed  bin Rashid Al Maktoum.” — His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed  bin Rashid Al Maktoum  Senior executive management of an organization needs  to understand that cyber security is an important asset,  which allows organizations to grow and achieve their  business objectives and promote cyber security controls  as an “investment” for more progressive management.  1 Senior executive  management needs  to understand the  importance of cyber  security  Dubai’s public sector should introduce new certification  schemes that address security in new technologies  (more granular schemes might be required for different  technologies) and consider technology requirements  for secure devices, as well as the use of sector-specific  management system certification, e.g. for cloud service  providers. The standard(s) for this scheme and the  associated certifications need to be developed and  should be based on international best practices.  3 Introduction of new  certification schemes  for cyber security  23    There are different standards that organizations  in Dubai can benefit from. These standards will help  achieve a common baseline for protection across  the different organizations of Dubai. The Information  Security Regulations (ISR) is mandatory for Dubai’s  public and semi-public sectors. The private sector  should also consider implementing ISR, or other  applicable standards, such as ISO/IEC 27001 and/ or NESA UAE IAS for their information security  management system. This is particularly important for  organizations that are part of the CII. Other standards  that can be considered are ISO/IEC 27035 (for incident  management), ISO/IEC 27031 (ICT readiness for business  continuity), or ISO 22301 and/or NCEMA 7000 (both  for business continuity). The implementation of such  standards has a number of important cornerstones:  Responsibilities for cyber security need to be assigned.  In addition to the necessary knowledge, expertise and  training that people responsible for cyber security  should have, it is a fundamental prerogative for the  success of this role that there is access to senior  executive management. This is particularly needed for  proper decision making.  Each organization needs to understand their exposure  to cyber security risks. A method should be defined to  carry out a risk assessment (refer also to the guiding  principle “Consideration of Risk”) and the appropriate  level of detail that provides enough information to  decide on solutions.  Based on the understanding of their individual  risks, organizations need to develop and implement  appropriate solutions. This can be done using either  internationally or locally accepted standards as listed  above. This solution design should take into account  any existing security controls and set ownership,  responsibilities or timelines for actions.  2 Implementation  of an information  security management  system (ISMS)  standard  24    A lot of cyber attacks are successfully exploiting  vulnerabilities of the systems targeted. Whilst attacks  on specific aims (banks, public sector, etc.) become  increasingly sophisticated, the attacks at individuals  are still often simple (e.g. phishing attacks or password  cracking). Raising the bar of protection of individual  systems can therefore help to counter the attacks.   A set of baseline controls should be established,  maintained and supported by Dubai individuals in their  implementation. Such protection may include:  • Protection against malicious software  • Good password selection and management  (including for IoT devices)  • Use of appropriate firewall and network  security tools  • Applying system updates in a timely manner  • Careful use of social media  • Maintaining physical security of computers and  devices in public  • Responsible public Wi-Fi use, and securing your  own Wi-Fi network  Encouragement to apply and maintain such protections  should be supported by the aforementioned rewards  programme and by the provision of tools to check parts  of the security status of a system.  DESC has developed the Information Security  Regulations (ISR), which is mandatory for Dubai’s  public and semi-public sectors. DESC also provides an  auditing function to verify that the standard has been  implemented correctly.  DESC has also developed this Cyber Security Strategy  and is specialized to develop further standards and  guidelines, including future service providers.  DESC will also collaborate with competent authorities  to set further standards, guidelines and tools that can  help Dubai’s public sector, private sector and individuals  to increase their cyber security capabilities.  3 Establishment  of a set of baseline  controls for  cyber security,  and support of their  implementation  4 Continuous  development of  information and  cyber security  services standards  and guidelines  25    CYBER RESILIENCE The aim of the Cyber Resilience domain is to ensure  that organizations of Dubai’s public and private sectors,  particularly organizations in the CII are resilient to  cyber attacks and can continue their important business  operations even in cases of problems.  A key element to delivering such resilience is the  establishment of a facility that provides support for the  management of cyber security incidents, threat intelligence  and a platform for information sharing.   To achieve sufficient cyber resilience, it is necessary that  organizations in the public and private sectors, particularly  all those involved in the CII, implement standards to support  IT system continuity, disaster recovery and wider business  continuity.  “We offer the world a new and unique  model of developing cities which is  always in need of different ideas and  innovative creations.” — His Highness Sheikh Mohammed  bin Rashid Al Maktoum  Organizations should share information about cyber  security risks and incidents, and use the centralized  infrastructure for incident management, which helps to:  • Prevent incident spread  • Allow for reporting of incidents   • Set an overall scheme for reporting, analyzing  and projecting the future  As the service providers are at the forefront of cyber  security attacks, incidents and events, their collaboration  and reporting is particularly important to allow for  the well-functioning of cyber security services.  1 Incidents should  be reported, and  information about  cyber security risks  should be shared  26    The cyber space includes telecom, internet service  providers, organizations developing software, digital  devices, etc., and organizations that provide services over  the internet. All organizations playing an important role  in Dubai’s cyber space should follow a set of rules to  ensure that the cyber space is sufficiently secure. This is  particularly the case for those organizations forming part  of Dubai’s CII.  It is important that these organizations establish  a framework that supports effective maintenance  and continuous improvement of their cyber security  capabilities, e.g. through the implementation of ISR.  DESC will provide the following functionalities for  Dubai’s public and semi-public entities:  • Incident monitoring, management and handling  • Information about trends, issues, and new threats  in the cyber space  • Threat intelligence by linking different sources  and using the information and technical capabilities  available in DESC to form an integrated picture  • A platform for information sharing in relation  to cyber Dubai, its possibilities, strength and risks  Provisions should be made to ensure continuation  of all functions that are critical to the cyber space.  Standards related to business continuity and ICT  readiness (ISO/IEC 27031 (ICT readiness for business  continuity), ISO 22301 and/or NCEMA 7000 (business  continuity)) can be helpful to achieve this.  Service providers, both present and future, operating  within Dubai (e.g. cloud service providers), or internet  communication services (such as communication  as a platform) should be required to comply with  a set of rules defined by DESC to ensure they are not  compromising the security of the cyber space in Dubai.  Organizations in the private sector, particularly  those in the CII, should also consider to implement  such standards.  2  Establishment,  maintenance and  improvement of  defined cyber security  and cyber resilience  capabilities  3 Provision of  support for incident  management,  threat intelligence,  and a platform for  information sharing  4 Compliance with  cyber resilience  standards  27    NATIONAL AND  INTERNATIONAL  COLLABORATION  The aim of this domain is to facilitate all national and  international collaboration necessary to make Dubai’s  cyber space secure and resilient.   The national collaboration addresses the identification  of organizations forming the CII of Dubai, and the  establishment of a scheme that allows for secure  information exchange, communication and collaboration  and motivates private organizations not in the CII to join  collaborative efforts. The international collaboration  focuses on common regulations and global threats.  Where necessary, new legislation or regulations should  be established to facilitate cyber Dubai.  “We have a clear goal; we want Dubai  to be the smartest city in the world.” — His Higness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed  bin Rashid Al Maktoum  Cyber space is a shared space where communications  and information exchange take place on the global  level. Therefore, international collaboration is necessary  to address the global issues related to cyber security.  International collaboration will be established to:  • Combat cyber threats and risks  • Develop legislation, regulations  and standards  • Identify particular nations  for collaboration/research      1 Establishment  of international  collaboration  28    DESC and other law enforcement agencies are  currently building many international collaborations  to combat cyber crimes and secure the cyber space  within Dubai.   Dubai public sector needs to build a national initiative  for the collaboration organizations forming part of  Dubai’s CII and make them work together to establish  Cyber Dubai. This collaboration includes several  activities:  • Establishment of a scheme to exchange  information between CII organizations   • Collaboration and communication between CII  organizations (this can benefit from the requirements  and guidance provided in ISO/IEC 27010)  • Provision of support from Dubai’s public sector   • Establishment of an incentive scheme to encourage  the private sector (not part of the CII) to participate  in cyber security  In addition, Dubai’s public sector needs to collaborate  with federal organizations addressing cyber security in  the UAE and its CII.  Cyber crime can take many different forms, ranging  from harmful digital communications of a criminal  nature (cyberbullying), to violation of intellectual  property given the broad scope of cyber crime and the  range of organizations threatened, this particular area  needs more detailed legal action to address cyber crime.   Establishment of cyber security legislation and  regulations requires the involvement from both the  public and private sectors in Dubai, and in particular,  agreements need to be established across borders to  manage cyber crimes.  2 Collaboration  between organizations  forming part of the  CII and establishment  of partnerships with  public and private  sectors  3 Establishment  of cyber security  legislation and  regulations  29    In 2016, DESC decided to develop a Cyber Security  Strategy to protect Dubai from cyber security  risks with the aim of supporting the growth and  innovation of Dubai and its economy. The Cyber  Security Strategy will impact all different sectors in  Dubai, including the public and private sector, as  well as the individuals. Therefore, the strategy was  developed in cooperation with different stakeholders  representing these different sectors.   The development of the Cyber Security Strategy  started by a benchmarking exercise, in which  cyber security strategies from about 15 different  countries had been compared and analyzed. This  was followed by a number of workshops and  meetings with different stakeholders in Dubai to  collect comments and identify synergies. This was  used to further improve the strategy, and set the  road for its implementation. These stakeholders are  the main drivers for the successful implementation  of the strategy, and their collaboration is of utmost  importance.   The launch of the Cyber Security Strategy is  the beginning of our journey, in which we are  developing an operational Plan together with the  stakeholders. This operational Plan is in the process  of implementation with the engagement of a large  number of different stakeholders. The overall time  frame for the implementation of this Cyber Security  Strategy is five years.

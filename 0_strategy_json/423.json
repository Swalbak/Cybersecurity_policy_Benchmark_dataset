Howard Quayle MHK Chief Minister The world is seeing continued threats to cyber security by means of phishing, malware, ransomware and other devious malpractice. In this respect the Island is no different from any other nation. The Isle of Man is an internationally respected and trusted Crown Dependency, with a long history of providing a stable, reliable and secure platform that enables economic prosperity. We must ensure that it remains so. Our reputation for security has become even more significant in this new, digital age. Our Island has an important role to play in the rapidly changing global economy and we have always stepped up and adapted accordingly. As a Government, we are here to support the prosperity of our Island. Our main business sectors operate in the digital world and we must ensure that we stay highly connected and provide an environment where e-commerce is able to operate with minimal constraints, interruptions and insecurities. Private individuals too must feel confident that all necessary steps are being taken to keep their information and digital lives as secure and protected as possible. My Government fully supports this strategy as it takes us forward. As Chief Minister, in endorsing this strategy, I am determined to see it brought to life for the benefit of the residents of the Island and all those businesses which operate here. 005 Will Greenhow Chief Secretary One of my roles, as head of the Isle of Man Government’s Civil Service, is to ensure that the public service continues to transform its services into more efficient, digital ways of working. This was a primary aim of our digital strategy, launched in 2016. We are increasingly dependent on technology in all aspects of our lives and we must ensure that while providing digital services to business and the public they are as safe, secure and reliable as possible. Our focus is now on the provision and application of cyber security, and this strategy starts us on that vital journey. It requires the Government to ensure that the data it holds is secure and is held in accordance with legislation; it requires that our national infrastructure is protected and resilient; and, in the unfortunate event of an incident, it ensures that we have the appropriate plans and processes in place to rapidly restore operations with minimal disruption. That’s why I fully support this strategy and look forward to seeing it in action. 006 National Cyber Security Strategy - 2018-2022 - Excutive Summary The Isle of Man has an excellent digital infrastructure. We are able to exploit the benefits that a good network and a well-developed internet service can bring for commerce, for public services and for citizens as individuals. However, these benefits could be put at risk if we do not protect ourselves effectively against cyber-attack. We are already plugged into international efforts to combat cybercrime, including the UK’s cyber resilience initiatives. But we cannot always rely on others to defend the Island’s commercial resources or protect the personal and financial data of our citizens. This National Cyber Security Strategy explains what we must do for ourselves. The Government has made it clear that cyber security is one of its top priorities. There will be an initial financial outlay to strengthen our defences and this will be money well spent. The benefits will be enhanced protection for all our residents and the development of new businesses. The first section of this strategy document explains the nature of the challenges we face. To date the Isle of Man has been fortunate to have faced few cyber-attacks and to have had sufficient resource to defend our systems. However, we are aware of threats, vulnerabilities and risks, which are set out here in detail. A key aspect of our cyber defences must be to maintain the Island’s Critical National Infrastructure. It includes our ports and harbours, our Internet Service Providers, water and sewerage, electricity, gas and oil supplies. The Government will actively support the protection of these systems and capacity for recovery in the event of a cyber-attack. Emergency Planning and Business Continuity exercises will be adapted to encompass cyber security incidents on a larger scale. The government is also undertaking a detailed analysis of the relevant global legislation and standards for cyberspace, data management and information assurance. It is committed to compliance with international standards that enable our businesses to operate in foreign markets, whilst ensuring that data is secure and protected here on the Island. That will include adopting the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation into Manx law by the end of May 2018. In a statement of strategic intent, this paper declares there can be no excuses for failing to take cyber security seriously. Across the developed world, businesses that did not secure their customers’ personal details against theft by hackers have suffered massive reputational damage. The Isle of Man is fortunate to be afforded fundamental levels of protection by the United Kingdom in a number of areas. However, due to the Island’s independence and separation from the UK, it falls to us to defend our own digital space. Executive Summary 007 Attached to each of these four principles are a series of strategic goals and detailed policy objectives. This builds up into a programme of 27 objectives that will be turned into an action plan over the next three months. Tracking progress, defining success and tackling the obstacles to delivery will be essential. There will be routine quarterly reporting to the Council of Ministers and Government’s Chief Officers’ Group to ensure that strategic oversight is maintained and leadership is provided. An annual review will be undertaken by the Chief Secretary to ensure the strategy, in its entirety, remains relevant and delivering the outputs required at the pace needed. The document concludes with suggestions for measuring how well the strategy is succeeding and a description of the three aspects of effective cyber security. The watchwords for the Isle of Man will be: Aware, Secure and Resilient. The strategy sets out four principles for action between 2018 and 2022. Committed leadership by Government to achieve resilience Through the leadership of the Chief Minister and the Chief Secretary, the Government will ensure the strategy is fully implemented, working together with key partners to provide a solution which meets our national needs. 1 Support for Critical National Infrastructure In protecting the Island’s way of life, its commercial productivity and its economic prosperity, the Government will work across both public and private Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) providers to ensure that services are maintained, are as resilient as is practicable and are able to recover quickly following a cyber-incident.2 Strong collaboration with business to achieve prosperity In delivering a cyber-resilient Island, it is essential that Government works alongside businesses and the public mutually and respectfully. The Government will deliver the services and support required whilst ensuring that the rights and values of all are respected. All activities will be undertaken as transparently as possible to ensure all solutions are fully understood. 3 Everyone playing a part in a progressive society Cyber security and resilience is a shared responsibility. By working together we can ensure that businesses and residents are informed, supported, educated and have the appropriate measures to protect against attacks and have the support to call upon if an incident occurs. By sharing these responsibilities we help to create a society which is well-equipped to deal with the challenges of the future.4 Our society is fully digitally integrated, primarily through the internet and mobile devices. We are fortunate here on the Island to have a network and internet service that is highly developed in comparison with many other locations. Nevertheless, as an independent nation we need to ensure that we apply the right levels of protection and security to the way we operate in the digital environment. We are all aware that cyber-attacks pose a significant risk to the Island’s security and safety. There are risks to our infrastructure and to Government data holdings; there are risks to our residents’ personal and financial data; and there are risks to our economic stability and prosperity. These threats are always evolving and adapting and we must do our utmost to remain up to date and ready to counter them. The Government’s systems and processes are being reviewed continuously to enhance detection and provide better protection, but they need to be constantly adapted, refreshed and renewed to make sure they are giving all of us the protection we need. This strategy has been developed to address the risks faced by businesses, those in the voluntary sectors, the public sector and residents. We need the implementation to be resilient in maintaining productivity and sustaining the Island’s way of life, whilst making the Island the location of choice for business. Its development will be continuous and implementation of the national cyber security programme will take place carefully, step by step. The strategy team have been working hard to develop new structures both inside and outside Government to ensure a collaborative approach to a common threat. These committees and working groups have been designed to find solutions to near-term issues as well as look in to the future to understand what challenges may lie ahead. This is a long-term programme of major change that needs resources, budget, focused political will and national-level leadership. The Government’s competing economic constraints are evident. However, the benefits and opportunities that this strategy can deliver far outweigh the costs. This strategy comprises a number of strands that take account of these external factors and offers levels of protection in line with the evolution of risks and threats. There are opportunities that will arise for the Island as a whole as the strategy delivers, including cost savings, efficiencies and service improvements. Ultimately, the Island will afford a level of protection for all its residents and support the attraction of new businesses. But there will be an initial outlay to improve, certify and install solutions and services. The Government has made it clear that cyber security is one of its top priorities and that it is to be delivered and implemented as swiftly and efficiently as possible. We are committed to working in partnership with other nations and with our own industry and businesses. We have an interesting and busy time ahead. This strategy will be of huge benefit to the Island and to everyone who lives and works here. Richard Wild Executive Director, Government Technology Services (GTS), Government – Senior Information Risk Owner Introduction 008 National Cyber Security Strategy - 2018-2022 - Introduction 009National Cyber Security Strategy - 2018-2022 - The challenge we face The impact of cybercrime, cyber-attacks and wider cyber-incidents on the Island could be disastrous and have long lasting ramifications. We are all reliant on digital communications with the vast majority of activity underpinning our everyday lives and the way our businesses operate. This is evident as digital business operating from and on the Island grows year on year. Residents are using the internet more and more in support of their lifestyle and consumption of products and services. The risks are variable and the impact can range from minor inconvenience to major disruption. They can’t all be removed, but with appropriate measures, systems, processes and technology they can be managed and reduced in probability and impact. Why do we need a National Cyber-Security Strategy? The challenge we face Information and data are essential and highly valuable commodities. We need to ensure they are safely, securely and appropriately managed and handled. The digital world impacts all of us in so many ways: how we shop, how power is delivered to our homes and how businesses operate. New technologies are released daily, with items and components that utilise the Internet of Things (IoT). So there is a requirement for Government to do its utmost to make secure the spaces in which we all live and operate. The Island is interconnected globally across the digital space. This has removed the traditional barriers of physical space and time; it has transcended the legal boundaries of nations; and now digital transactions are almost instantaneous to any part of the world. To date, the Isle of Man has been fortunate to have faced few cyber-attacks, and to have had sufficient resource to defend our systems. However, with the Government’s aspiration to further the Island’s economic prosperity and its reach across global markets, we must now review our position on cyber security. We must develop a co-ordinated and tailored approach to those risks and threats that the Island may encounter, and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. The Island does have well-established Unique Selling Points (USPs), but they remain at risk of loss or erosion in a potentially fickle digital business market. In order to maintain these advantages and meet the ever-growing levels of global data transactions, we must ensure the island is safe, secure, and resilient in cyberspace. The Government sees its priorities as protecting relevant data, sustaining investment and ensuring the continued reliable functioning of information and communication technologies. What is Cyberspace? Cyberspace is the digital world in which we operate. It is made up of interconnected networks that enable information to flow globally. It comprises our Information and Communications Technology (ICT) networks, our communications systems and those systems that support our infrastructure. It is essentially the virtual environment that enables interactions between people and machines, including computer networks. What is Cyber Security? In delivering Cyber Resilience we need to implement a range of cyber security measures. Some of the most important cyber security measures involve education and awareness. By ensuring that all concerned understand how to mitigate and manage those risks and are aware of the wider issues, we will bring our digital security one step closer. What is Cyber Resilience? Cyber Resilience is the ability to protect against and recover from attacks or accidental events that impact our digital world. When ensuring resilience, Government, businesses and residents need to act together. It is not purely about ICT or technical solutions. The human aspects of cyber resilience need consideration and measures should be put in place to ensure everyone understands the risks. Individuals are best placed to protect themselves and others with whom they interact. What are the associated threats, vulnerabilities and risks? 1. The Threats The Isle of Man is not impervious to cyber-attack or the threats that are prevalent around the globe. These cyber threats can be delivered by a range of attackers from any location, in any time zone. Their intent may be to disrupt, destroy, deny services and/or extort money. They may, for example, be seeking to obtain commercial proprietary information, commit financial fraud or extort from a chief executive. These attackers have different objectives. For example: • Cyber Criminals seek financial gain through extortion and ransom, as well as by selling any information they may have acquired on the black market. They target governments, businesses and the public at large using both direct and indirect indiscriminate methods. • Hacktivists seek to cause damage and disruption to an organisation or body with which they have an issue. Their goal may be to cause extensive reputational and financial harm. • Nation states (government agencies or their contractors) focus on collecting strategic information for political or economic gain or disrupting industrial facilities in competitive or hostile countries. • ‘Script Kiddies’ are the individuals who seek out vulnerabilities and flaws in systems and services. Notionally they are less skilled and not as well-resourced as the more organised criminal actors. However, they have been able to cause significant impact to organisations and public bodies in other nations. • Cyber Espionage is undertaken by one organisation or person against another to obtain intellectual property illicitly. This could be new technology, accounts data etc. The goal is to obtain competitive advantage or significantly harm the competitor. 0010 National Cyber Security Strategy - 2018-2022 - The challenge we face 0011 2. The vulnerabilities • Systems Maintenance – IT systems across the public, private and business sectors should be updated and checked regularly and effectively. IT is an expensive commodity and, at times, it may not be financially viable for a company, or family, to replace its IT. However, it is essential that these systems, both new and legacy, are fully updated and all appropriate fixes are applied. The Government, through the Office of Cyber Security and Information Assurance (OCSIA), will provide a focal point for advice and guidance on this area that is accessible and approachable for all. • Training and Skills - Like the rest of the world, the Isle of Man has a shortage of cyber security resources and skilled operators. This strategy is looking to assess and remedy this as far as is practicably possible. It is our belief that all residents and employees need to have a fundamental awareness of cyber security and, to support this, Government will develop a nationwide cyber awareness campaign to help the Island’s residents to understand the fundamentals of staying safe online. Furthermore, it will help business and other sectors to introduce a programme of cyber awareness across their organisations, adopting a methodology of cyber security baselining, similar to that used in the United Kingdom’s Cyber Essentials . • Insider Threat - The human factor is one of the greatest risks to a company and its network. Basic education and training can mitigate most of this potential risk. The insider threat may not be malicious or intended; it may be simply an employee inadvertently plugging in an infected USB stick or sending a misdirected email. In England, the NHS National Data Guardian has warned that staff members tend to ignore precautions that make it harder for them to do their job. Such workarounds are dangerous. Helping staff understand the reasons for the precautions as well as designing worker- friendly solutions will go some way to preventing such dangerous behaviour. • High Tech Crime - Cyber Crime is a fast moving area of activity that can affect us all. The Government and Isle of Man Constabulary (IOMC) are working together to develop the skills, capabilities and technologies to deliver law enforcement in regard to cybercrime, including online fraud. The IOMC is currently reviewing its capacity and capabilities to counter criminality and illicit activity across the digital domain. As part of this, the Government will undertake a review of associated legislation and guidelines pertinent to the Isle of Man. • Online Fraud - Currently the City of London Police operates the UK’s Online Fraud Portal. This portal serves the whole of the UK and does offer support to Island residents; however it provides limited options for local analysis. IOMC supported by IOM Government is therefore intent on creating an Island-based comparable system that will feed into the City of London Police, but will be primarily focused on Island-based incidents to enable local measures to be applied where applicable. The solution is yet to be determined, but will enable reporting by a variety of means. 3. The risks The risks to Government are actively managed across all of its operations and in delivery of its services. Cyber risk management is a fundamental part of broader risk management and is integral to the Island’s wider resilience capabilities. The Government is looking to manage, reduce and/or mitigate the relevant cyber risks in cooperation with its partners and relevant stakeholders. The main objective is to ensure that Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability (CIA) across the Island’s networks are assured and can be quickly restored following an incident, with minimum disruption. The threats across cyberspace are prevalent and ever changing. So the Government’s response must be agile and kept under regular assessment. This requires application of the appropriate controls and adherence to the defined policies, procedures and protocols. By this means we are striving to reduce and manage the extent and ramifications of known and perceived risks. What are the areas of potential impact? Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) The Island’s national infrastructure, both publicly and privately owned and/or supplied, is the backbone of our way of life. It includes the ports and harbours, the Internet Service Providers (ISPs), water and sewerage, our electricity supply, domestic gas and oil provision, to name but a few. As a distinct island there is a necessity to protect the full CNI within our shores from cyber- attacks and incidents, maintaining the provision of the services they offer to all. The backbone of the Island’s CNI is made up of large and complex Industrial Control Systems (ICS). They are, for example, embedded within the Island’s traffic controls, water filtration, hospital systems, transport network, sewerage, etc. The ICSs enable delivery of essential services through a distributed network, with a number of sub-systems that ensure the processes operate correctly and in a timely manner. These systems are often separated from office-based systems, but can be just as vulnerable. The Government will actively support the protection of these areas and its systems by ensuring cyber risks and issues are mitigated as far as is practicable, contingencies are catered for, and appropriate recovery and remedial activity is developed as part of our national resilience strand of work. We will work with the non-government entities to ensure the most appropriate and applicable standards and systems are adopted where possible to sustain services and enable expedient recovery following an incident. Business As the e-business market, inclusive of e-commerce, develops on the Island, so does the potential for a cyber-attack. The Government is committed to reducing the number of harmful attacks and their impact on the economic and digital sectors. Businesses on the Island need to feel assured that the Government and the Island’s Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have done everything possible to secure the networks and services they use in their business activities. The Government is revising and developing its plans to support businesses if they are unfortunate enough to have been a victim of a cyber-attack. Recovery from an attack can be expensive in terms of direct and indirect costs to the business. Unfortunately, awareness of an attack may come sometime after it has started or even finished and the impact may potentially be far worse than initially imagined. Small businesses are just as vulnerable as larger organisations. The Government is determined to provide the same support for Small-to-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) as it does for larger businesses. In line with the Government’s commitment, the Digital Inclusion strategy is helping more people to get online. It will help residents to access training and jobs, social and leisure activities and internet shopping. Being online can also help to address wider social issues and support economic growth. The Government is aligning both the Digital Inclusion and the National Cyber-Security Strategy to ensure that they are complementary. Reputation The Isle of Man has a strong business reputation and wishes to maintain and strengthen its reputation as one of the safest places in the world . By ensuring that the Island has a strong cyber-security strategy the Government has committed to ensuring that the Island is a location of choice for companies and the public are secure and aware. 0012 National Cyber Security Strategy - 2018-2022 - The challenge we face National Cyber Security Strategy - 2018-2022 - Acronyms 0013 What is Government doing about it? Business Continuity and Resilience Exercises The Government has a set of well-developed and established Business Continuity plans. However, as the National Cyber Security Strategy comes into operation, the current plans will need to be adapted to incorporate cyber resilience. The Isle of Man Government routinely undertakes Emergency Planning and Business Continuity exercises. These exercises will continue in the future. However, they will be adapted to encompass cyber security incidents on a larger scale. Through these exercises, all relevant Government departments and partners will be tested to assess the national response, with Learning from Experience (LfE) protocol adopted whenever necessary. The aim of such exercises is ultimately to maintain states of readiness for key departments and partners,determine any new weaknesses and validate current plans. Legislation and Standards In developing the Island’s resilience, capacity and capabilities the Government is undertaking a detailed analysis of the relevant global legislation and standards for cyberspace, data management and information assurance. It is committed to meeting the requirements of those regulations and legislative frameworks that enable businesses to operate in foreign markets whilst ensuring data is secure and protected here on the Island. Underpinning the national strategy are a number of forthcoming EU regulations and directives. The ongoing Brexit negotiations have also been factored into the planning process. The Government has deployed sufficient resource for developing our systems and processes to meet these upcoming events. By the end of May 2018 the Isle of Man Government will honour its commitment, announced by the Chief Minister, to adopt the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) into Manx Law. There will be a review of the GDPR’s requirements along with an investigation into whether its associated Directives are applicable, namely Network and Information Systems Directive (NISD), Policing and Criminal Justice (PCJ) and the Health and Social Care (H&SC) Directives. Partnering and unity of approach The Office of Cyber Security and Information Assurance (OCSIA), as part of the Cabinet Office, will on behalf of Government have responsibility to deliver and manage this strategy with oversight being provided directly by the Chief Secretary and the delegated Member for Cyber. The Isle of Man national capacity and capabilities are to be developed on a long-term basis. However, accepting that not all things can be achieved independently, the government is ensuring that from the outset and where required, development work will be done in partnership with the United Kingdom’s agencies, bodies and organisations to reinforce our own national systems, practices and processes. IOM data and information will remain IOM-owned and managed through properly structured agreements. The Island will benefit further through sharing best practices as a scaled national cyber security solution is delivered. Digital Government The Isle of Man Government is currently delivering both its Digital Strategy and Digital Inclusion Strategy, and is keen to develop further the services available over the digital networks. The Digital Strategy has been developed to enable public services to be delivered more expeditiously and more cost effectively. Although the provision of digital services started some time ago, the extent and breadth of online services will develop alongside the advances of the Digital Strategy. Aim of the Strategy There can be no excuses for failing to take cyber-security seriously. Across the developed world, businesses that did not secure their customers’ personal details against theft by hackers have suffered massive reputational damage and commercial losses. Individuals know there may be a heavy financial price to pay for divulging passwords and account details. And the scale of the threat is increasing. In May 2017 the WannaCry ransomware attack, which targeted computers running the Microsoft Windows programme, infected more than 230,000 computers in more than 150 countries. It caused disruption in railway systems in Russia and Germany, the phone network in Spain and the NHS in England. 0014 National Cyber Security Strategy - 2018-2022 - Our Strategic Intent Our Strategic Intent The Isle of Man is small and distinct, but an important player in global economic markets. It is fortunate to be afforded fundamental levels of protection by the United Kingdom in a number of areas, such as defence. However, due to the Island’s independence and separation from the United Kingdom, it falls to us on the Island to defend our own digital space. That is why we need the National Cyber-Security Strategy set out in this document. It has been developed for all residents, all businesses, the third sector and Government. It is a crucial underpinning of our society that will: • Protect our networks • Secure the data we hold and use • Support our economic development • Counter criminality and illicit activity in the digital environment • Foster enduring relationships with partners. The Government is working towards formalising its partnerships with other Crown Dependencies, nations, organisations and academic institutions. For example, the UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has agreed to work with us on matters of cyber security, and the Isle of Man Government is working towards formalising that arrangement. However, there will still be a requirement for us to maintain a high level of independence to protect our fiscal integrity and economic prosperity. We must develop our own cyber security protection and resilience to minimise the need for external support from partner nations. The strategy has a clear vision and a strong mission statement, which is explained in greater detail in the rest of this document. Mission The Office of Cyber-Security and Information Assurance (OCSIA) will contribute to securing the Isle of Man’s information networks by providing advice and guidance, raising awareness and actively contributing to the cyber resilience and information security for the benefit of citizens, consumers, enterprises and public sector organisations established on the Island Vision To be secure and resilient to cyber threats whilst remaining progressive and prosperous 0017National Cyber Security Strategy - 2018-2022 - Principles, Goals and Objectives The Isle of Man Government’s focus is on providing the Island’s residents, its public services and businesses with a safe, secure, resilient and prosperous place to live and operate from. It will do this through the provision of the appropriate systems, processes and measures. Principles, Goals and Objectives To achieve success we need: • Committed leadership by Government • Strong collaboration with business • Effective action to educate and train everyone in society so that we can all play our part in strengthening cyber security at work and in the home. This chapter looks at each of these three requirements in turn, setting out the principles we will follow, the strategic goals we have set and the precise objectives that we intend to achieve. 0018 National Cyber Security Strategy - 2018-2022 - Principles, Goals and Objectives Committed leadership by Government to achieve resilience Principle: The Government sees the Island’s cyber security and resilience as a top priority. It is a complex area, requiring focussed resources and capabilities. Through strong leadership and governance, the Government will drive progress in support of all on the Island.

Support for Critical National Infrastructure Principle: In protecting the Island’s way of life, its commercial productivity and its economic prosperity, the Government will work with providers of Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) in both the public and private sectors to ensure that services are maintained, are as resilient as is practicable and are able to recover swiftly following a cyber-incident. Strategic goals: • The Island’s CNI is secure and protected • All appropriate legislation, standards, and policies are implemented and enforced across national infrastructure components, with new versions drafted for consultation if required • Enduring multilateral and bilateral relationships enabling collaboration and interaction are established specifically related to CNI. Objectives: • Ensure the Island’s CNI is robust, resilient and able to respond/recover accordingly; develop and formalise partnering with UK, other Crown Dependencies and key International Partners on cyber security and digital domain aspects 0019 • Implement a national capability to detect and defeat high-end threats, whilst utilising partnering agreements /Memorandum(s) of Understanding (MOUs) to reinforce a national capability and capacity across the critical infrastructure on the Island • Strengthen, promote and formalise collaboration with the UK and other international partners • Bolster and refresh Government contingency planning capacity and skills to expedite recovery from a cyber-incident across the CNI network, both public and private. Strong collaboration with business to achieve prosperity Principle: In delivering a cyber-resilient Island, it is essential that Government works alongside the business sector. The Government will deliver the services and support required whilst ensuring that the rights and values of all are respected. Furthermore, it will ensure adherence to human rights law, the relevant data protection regulations and other applicable legislation, regulations and standards. Additionally, all activities will be undertaken as transparently as possible to ensure all solutions are fully understood. Strategic goals: • The Government, private sector and academia work collaboratively to ensure businesses are secure • Emerging technologies and the changing digital environment are appraised and changes adopted accordingly. Objectives: • Support and develop cyber security research, business and education across the Island • Promote economic stability through the provision of world class facilities and an environment with freedom to flourish • Support the protection of national interests and reputation • Promote investment, research and development in the ICT sector and Island-based cyber capabilities • Reinforce the wider Digital Strategy and support the Digital Island concept • Support the Island’s development of new markets and technology offers – e.g. Data Businesses, Data Farms, etc • Reinforce the requirement for Information and Data Assurance across all sectors on the Island • Support the Island’s business community in its ability to tackle financial crime-related activity – money laundering, terrorist financing, etc • Support the Island based banking community to detect, deter and defend its networks • Provide a secure cyberspace for business and with business through guidelines, regulation and enforcement • Strengthen the economic stability, impact and reach of the Isle of Man • Protect the Island’s public and private digital networks in conjunction with the local Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Everyone playing a part in a progressive society Principle: Cyber security and resilience is a shared responsibility, deliverable by all. We are all responsible for our actions and activities online and in the digital space. By working together we can ensure that businesses and residents are informed, supported, educated and have the appropriate measures to protect against attacks and have the support to call upon if an incident occurs. By sharing these responsibilities we help to create a more progressive society. Strategic goals: • Plans for the development of national capabilities, capacity and self-reliance in the realm of cyber security through education, training and mentoring are in place • Support is available to all the residents of the Island, of all ages, through education and outreach, allowing all to be safe and secure online with the appropriate resources if an incident or issue occurs. Objectives: • Develop a national programme that encompasses all aspects of cyber security, demystify the area, and instil improved cyber awareness across all sectors and among the public as a whole • Promote public awareness so people are better able to protect themselves online • Develop a programme of inclusion on the Island, such as the Cyber Challenge, to enhance digital skills across all generations through community outreach and other programmes • Develop national cyber skills, knowledge and capability that are able to sustain and meet the market demands. Government will issue the National Cyber-Security Strategy Action Plan within three months. This Plan will provide more detail on the implementation and progress reporting of the strategy. 0020 National Cyber Security Strategy - 2018-2022 - Conclusion It is essential that the Isle of Man Government protects its citizens, businesses and the broader interests of the Isle of Man. This cyber security strategy intends to deliver on the promises made in the Programme for Government and further develop the Island’s economic prospects, potential and performance. Indicators of Progress Tracking progress, defining success and tackling the obstacles to delivery will be essential. The Office of Cyber Security and Information Assurance (OCSIA) will work, on behalf of the Government, with our partners to align our strategy with theirs. We will also work collaboratively with the Island’s business sectors to deliver an efficient and effective strategy. There will be routine reporting, at least quarterly, to the Council of Ministers and Chief Officers Group to ensure that strategic oversight is maintained and leadership is provided. An annual review will be undertaken by the Chief Secretary to ensure the strategy, in its entirety, remains relevant and delivering the outputs required at the pace needed. Measures of Success Knowing if the strategy is delivering successfully is essential to progress and a necessity for both businesses and residents. Through routine review, consultation and surveys, the Government will measure progress and delivery against defined milestones, changing requirements and actions in order to meet any emerging threats and the development of new technologies and ways of working. We will be successful in delivering the strategy when: • The Island’s businesses are able to operate in a resilient and secure environment, managing their own risks and having sufficient processes in place to deal with them • The residents of the Isle of Man are informed and aware of the risks of using digital technologies, and are able to report incidents, such as online fraud, and be confident in the support being provided in dealing with them • E-Government and all public services are managed and delivered in a secure resolute manner by a Government that is cyber aware, cyber-resilient and has the appropriate trained personnel and systems in place • Businesses and academia prosper on the Island in their research, innovation and collaboration • E-business continues to grow and operate from the Island, based on a global reputation for cyber-resilience • Law Enforcement is able to deliver the support and services required in dealing with cybercrime to all on the Island • The Island’s Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) is resilient and secure, but with sufficient recovery plans and processes if an event does occur • The Government will have in place the services and capabilities to protect and manage the Island’s digital space and ultimately support the recovery following an incident. Conclusion 0021 Aware Develop cyber resilience across the Isle of Man government and positively influence the private and third sector entities operating on the Island along with the wider population. Instigate a major transformative programme for delivery through OCSIA designed to test, evaluate and promote cyber security, cyber resilience and information assurance across the Isle of Man. In conclusion, the strategy, through its implementation, will deliver on the following: Resilient Deliver a network of cyber awareness, implement specialist roles across government able to provide central policy advice, standards, active direction and support to allow the dissemination of knowledge and capability to defend the Island and maximise the safe use of information assets. Government will support the development of the Island’s public and businesses capacity and capability to better defend themselves from cybercrime and fraudulent activities. Secure Ensure departments, boards, offices and other public authorities as well as businesses and the public are able to deter and defend against cybercrime and other criminal activities by maintaining and sharing pertinent information. Enable the Isle of Man Government to deliver with assurance a level of cyber security that will both protect and deflect nefarious cyber activities to alternate targets. Additionally, the wider Government will be able to respond and recover from a cyber- incident through the coordination of the relevant authorities and bodies. 0022 National Cyber Security Strategy - 2018-2022 - Forword Glossary 0023 Critical National Infrastructure - Processes, systems, facilities, technologies, networks, assets and services essential to the nation’s health, safety, security or economic well-being and the effective functioning of government. Critical infrastructure can be stand-alone or interconnected and interdependent within and across national borders. Disruptions of critical infrastructure could result in catastrophic loss of life, adverse economic effects and significant harm to public confidence. Cybercrime – refers to a vast array of illegal activities that are implemented via IT systems, including mobile devices. A crime committed with the aid of, or directly involving, a data processing system or computer network. The computer or its data may be the target of the crime or the computer may be the tool with which the crime is committed. Cybercriminal – an individual who undertakes criminal activities via IT systems and/or mobile devices. Cybercriminals can range from individual, opportunistic criminals, through to highly-skilled and professional groups of computer hackers. Cybercriminals may specialise in: • Developing malware and selling it to others who go on to launch attacks • Harvesting data – such as credit card numbers – and selling it to other criminals or they may undertake every stage of an attack, from developing the malware to stealing money from the victim. Cyber-attack - An attack that involves the unauthorized use, manipulation, interruption or destruction of, or access to, via electronic means, electronic information or the electronic devices or computer systems and networks used to process, transmit or store that information. Cyber-espionage – the act of spying and illicitly accessing information via IT systems and/or the internet. Cyber-incident - Any unauthorized attempt, whether successful or not, to gain access to, modify, destroy, delete or render unavailable any computer network or system resource. Cyber-security - The protection of digital information, as well as the integrity of the infrastructure housing and transmitting digital information. More specifically, cyber security includes the body of technologies, processes, practices and response and mitigation measures designed to protect networks, computers, programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access so as to ensure confidentiality, integrity and availability. Cyberspace - The electronic world created by interconnected networks of information technology and the information on those networks. It is a global commons where more than three billion people are linked together to exchange ideas, services and friendship. Cyber-threat - A threat actor, using the internet, who takes advantage of a known vulnerability in a product for the purposes of exploiting a network and the information the network carries. Chat Rooms - An area on the Internet or other computer network where users can communicate, typically one dedicated to a particular topic. E-business – (Electronic business) refers to the use of the Web, internet, intranets, extranets or some combination thereof to conduct business. E-business is similar to e-commerce, but it goes beyond the simple buying and selling of products and services online. E-business includes a much wider range of businesses processes, such as supply chain management, electronic order processing and customer relationship management. E-business processes, therefore, can help companies to operate more effectively and efficiently. Hacktivists – despite the absence of ‘cyber’ in their title, these hacker activists deserve a mention in our glossary. Hacktivists are computer hackers that have aligned themselves with a specific protest organisation or group of activists. Their activities can be similar to those of cyberterrorists or cyber-saboteurs. Information Communication Technology (ICT) – refers to technologies that provide access to information through telecommunications. It is similar to Information Technology (IT), but focuses primarily on communication technologies. This includes the Internet, wireless networks, cell phones, and other communication media. Information Security - The preservation, confidentiality, integrity and availability of information; other properties such as authenticity, accountability and non-repudiation may be involved. Internet Service Provider (ISP) - An Internet Service Provider is a company that provides a service allowing business or personal users to access the internet. Intellectual Property (IP) - According to the World Intellectual Property Organization, intellectual property (IP) is a creation of the mind. IP includes inventions, literary and artistic works, designs and symbols, and names and images used in business. Internet of Things (IoT) - The interconnection via the internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data. Malware - Malicious software, known as malware, is an overarching term for software that is designed to infiltrate or damage a computer. Malware’s effects can include Denial of Service (DoS), Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), privilege escalation, keystroke logging, geo-location of smartphones, tablets, laptops and similar devices, and the exploiting social networks. Phishing – the use of electronic communication (e.g. email) under the guise of a legitimate source to lure a recipient into disclosing sensitive information, e.g. Personal Identifying Data (PID), bank details, etc. Ransomware - Software that denies you access to your files until you pay a ransom.

Howard Quayle MHK   Chief Minister  The world is seeing continued  threats to cyber security by means  of phishing, malware, ransomware  and other devious malpractice. In  this respect the Island is no different  from any other nation. The Isle of  Man is an internationally respected  and trusted Crown Dependency,  with a long history of providing a  stable, reliable and secure platform  that enables economic prosperity.   We must ensure that it remains so. Our reputation for security has become  even more significant in this new, digital age. Our Island has an important  role to play in the rapidly changing global economy and we have always  stepped up and adapted accordingly. As a Government, we are here to  support the prosperity of our Island. Our main business sectors operate  in the digital world and we must ensure that we stay highly connected  and provide an environment where e-commerce is able to operate with  minimal constraints, interruptions and insecurities.   Private individuals too must feel confident that  all necessary steps are being taken to keep their  information and digital lives as secure and protected as  possible. My Government fully supports this strategy as  it takes us forward. As Chief Minister, in endorsing this  strategy, I am determined to see it brought to life for  the benefit of the residents of the Island and all those  businesses which operate here.    005  Will Greenhow  Chief Secretary  One of my roles, as head of the Isle  of Man Government’s Civil Service,  is to ensure that the public service  continues to transform its services  into more efficient, digital ways of  working. This was a primary aim of  our digital strategy, launched in 2016.  We are increasingly dependent on  technology in all aspects of our  lives and we must ensure that while  providing digital services to business  and the public they are as safe,  secure and reliable as possible.   Our focus is now on the provision and application of  cyber security, and this strategy starts us on that vital  journey. It requires the Government to ensure that the  data it holds is secure and is held in accordance with  legislation; it requires that our national infrastructure is  protected and resilient; and, in the unfortunate event of  an incident, it ensures that we have the appropriate plans  and processes in place to rapidly restore operations  with minimal disruption. That’s why I fully support this  strategy and look forward to seeing it in action.    006 National Cyber Security Strategy - 2018-2022 - Excutive Summary  The Isle of Man has an excellent digital infrastructure. We are able to exploit  the benefits that a good network and a well-developed internet service  can bring for commerce, for public services and for citizens as individuals.  However, these benefits could be put at risk if we do not protect ourselves  effectively against cyber-attack. We are already plugged into international  efforts to combat cybercrime, including the UK’s cyber resilience initiatives.  But we cannot always rely on others to defend the Island’s commercial  resources or protect the personal and financial data of our citizens.  This National Cyber Security Strategy explains what  we must do for ourselves. The Government has made  it clear that cyber security is one of its top priorities.  There will be an initial financial outlay to strengthen  our defences and this will be money well spent.  The benefits will be enhanced protection for all our  residents and the development of new businesses.  The first section of this strategy document explains the  nature of the challenges we face. To date the Isle of Man  has been fortunate to have faced few cyber-attacks and  to have had sufficient resource to defend our systems.  However, we are aware of threats, vulnerabilities and  risks, which are set out here in detail.  A key aspect of our cyber defences must be to maintain the  Island’s Critical National Infrastructure. It includes our ports  and harbours, our Internet Service Providers, water and  sewerage, electricity, gas and oil supplies. The Government  will actively support the protection of these systems and  capacity for recovery in the event of a cyber-attack.  Emergency Planning and Business Continuity exercises  will be adapted to encompass cyber security incidents  on a larger scale. The government is also undertaking  a detailed analysis of the relevant global legislation  and standards for cyberspace, data management and  information assurance. It is committed to compliance  with international standards that enable our businesses  to operate in foreign markets, whilst ensuring that data  is secure and protected here on the Island. That will  include adopting the EU’s General Data Protection  Regulation into Manx law by the end of May 2018.  In a statement of strategic intent, this paper declares  there can be no excuses for failing to take cyber security  seriously. Across the developed world, businesses that  did not secure their customers’ personal details against  theft by hackers have suffered massive reputational  damage. The Isle of Man is fortunate to be afforded  fundamental levels of protection by the United  Kingdom in a number of areas. However, due to the  Island’s independence and separation from the UK, it  falls to us to defend our own digital space.  Executive  Summary    007  Attached to each of these four principles are a series of  strategic goals and detailed policy objectives. This builds  up into a programme of 27 objectives that will be turned  into an action plan over the next three months.  Tracking progress, defining success and tackling the  obstacles to delivery will be essential. There will be  routine quarterly reporting to the Council of Ministers  and Government’s Chief Officers’ Group to ensure that  strategic oversight is maintained and leadership is provided.   An annual review will be undertaken by the Chief Secretary  to ensure the strategy, in its entirety, remains relevant  and delivering the outputs required at the pace needed.   The document concludes with suggestions for  measuring how well the strategy is succeeding and  a description of the three aspects of effective cyber  security. The watchwords for the Isle of Man will be:  Aware, Secure and Resilient.  The strategy sets out four principles  for action between 2018 and 2022.  Committed leadership by Government   to achieve resilience  Through the leadership of the Chief Minister and the Chief Secretary, the Government  will ensure the strategy is fully implemented, working together with key partners to  provide a solution which meets our national needs. 1 Support for Critical National Infrastructure  In protecting the Island’s way of life, its commercial productivity and its economic  prosperity, the Government will work across both public and private Critical National  Infrastructure (CNI) providers to ensure that services are maintained, are as resilient as  is practicable and are able to recover quickly following a cyber-incident.2 Strong collaboration with business to achieve prosperity  In delivering a cyber-resilient Island, it is essential that Government works alongside  businesses and the public mutually and respectfully. The Government will deliver  the services and support required whilst ensuring that the rights and values of all are  respected. All activities will be undertaken as transparently as possible to ensure all  solutions are fully understood. 3 Everyone playing a part in a progressive society  Cyber security and resilience is a shared responsibility. By working together we can  ensure that businesses and residents are informed, supported, educated and have the  appropriate measures to protect against attacks and have the support to call upon if an  incident occurs. By sharing these responsibilities we help to create a society which is  well-equipped to deal with the challenges of the future.4    Our society is fully digitally integrated, primarily through the internet and  mobile devices. We are fortunate here on the Island to have a network and  internet service that is highly developed in comparison with many other  locations. Nevertheless, as an independent nation we need to ensure  that we apply the right levels of protection and security to the way we  operate in the digital environment. We are all aware that cyber-attacks  pose a significant risk to the Island’s security and safety. There are risks to  our infrastructure and to Government data holdings; there are risks to our  residents’ personal and financial data; and there are risks to our economic  stability and prosperity. These threats are always evolving and adapting and  we must do our utmost to remain up to date and ready to counter them.  The Government’s systems and processes are being reviewed continuously  to enhance detection and provide better protection, but they need to be  constantly adapted, refreshed and renewed to make sure they are giving all  of us the protection we need.  This strategy has been developed to address the risks faced  by businesses, those in the voluntary sectors, the public  sector and residents. We need the implementation to be  resilient in maintaining productivity and sustaining the  Island’s way of life, whilst making the Island the location  of choice for business. Its development will be continuous  and implementation of the national cyber security  programme will take place carefully, step by step. The  strategy team have been working hard to develop new  structures both inside and outside Government to ensure  a collaborative approach to a common threat. These  committees and working groups have been designed  to find solutions to near-term issues as well as look in to  the future to understand what challenges may lie ahead.   This is a long-term programme of major change that  needs resources, budget, focused political will and  national-level leadership. The Government’s competing  economic constraints are evident. However, the benefits  and opportunities that this strategy can deliver far outweigh  the costs. This strategy comprises a number of strands that   take account of these external factors and offers levels of  protection in line with the evolution of risks and threats.   There are opportunities that will arise for the Island as  a whole as the strategy delivers, including cost savings,  efficiencies and service improvements. Ultimately, the  Island will afford a level of protection for all its residents  and support the attraction of new businesses. But there will  be an initial outlay to improve, certify and install solutions  and services. The Government has made it clear that cyber  security is one of its top priorities and that it is to be delivered  and implemented as swiftly and efficiently as possible.   We are committed to working in partnership with other  nations and with our own industry and businesses. We  have an interesting and busy time ahead. This strategy  will be of huge benefit to the Island and to everyone  who lives and works here.  Richard Wild  Executive Director, Government Technology Services  (GTS), Government – Senior Information Risk Owner  Introduction  008 National Cyber Security Strategy - 2018-2022 - Introduction    009National Cyber Security Strategy - 2018-2022 - The challenge we face  The impact of cybercrime, cyber-attacks and wider cyber-incidents on  the Island could be disastrous and have long lasting ramifications. We  are all reliant on digital communications with the vast majority of activity  underpinning our everyday lives and the way our businesses operate. This  is evident as digital business operating from and on the Island grows year  on year. Residents are using the internet more and more in support of their  lifestyle and consumption of products and services. The risks are variable  and the impact can range from minor inconvenience to major disruption.  They can’t all be removed, but with appropriate measures, systems,  processes and technology they can be managed and reduced in   probability and impact.  Why do we need a National Cyber-Security Strategy?  The challenge  we face  Information and data are essential and highly valuable  commodities.  We need to ensure they are safely,  securely and appropriately managed and handled.   The digital world impacts all of us in so many ways:  how we shop, how power is delivered to our homes  and how businesses operate.  New technologies are  released daily, with items and components that utilise  the Internet of Things  (IoT). So there is a requirement  for Government to do its utmost to make secure the  spaces in which we all live and operate.   The Island is interconnected globally across the digital  space. This has removed the traditional barriers of  physical space and time; it has transcended the legal  boundaries of nations; and now digital transactions are  almost instantaneous to any part of the world.  To date, the Isle of Man has been fortunate to have  faced few cyber-attacks, and to have had sufficient  resource to defend our systems. However, with  the Government’s aspiration to further the Island’s  economic prosperity and its reach across global  markets, we must now review our position on cyber  security. We must develop a co-ordinated and tailored  approach to those risks and threats that the Island may  encounter, and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.   The Island does have well-established Unique Selling  Points (USPs), but they remain at risk of loss or erosion  in a potentially fickle digital business market. In order to  maintain these advantages and meet the ever-growing  levels of global data transactions, we must ensure the island  is safe, secure, and resilient in cyberspace. The Government  sees its priorities as protecting relevant data, sustaining  investment and ensuring the continued reliable functioning  of information and communication technologies.     What is Cyberspace?  Cyberspace is the digital world in which we   operate. It is made up of interconnected networks  that enable information to flow globally. It comprises  our Information and Communications Technology   (ICT) networks, our communications systems and   those systems that support our infrastructure. It  is essentially the virtual environment that enables  interactions between people and machines,   including computer networks.  What is Cyber Security?  In delivering Cyber Resilience we need to implement  a range of cyber security measures. Some of the most  important cyber security measures involve education  and awareness. By ensuring that all concerned  understand how to mitigate and manage those risks   and are aware of the wider issues, we will bring our  digital security one step closer.   What is Cyber Resilience?  Cyber Resilience is the ability to protect against  and recover from attacks or accidental events that  impact our digital world. When ensuring resilience,  Government, businesses and residents need to  act together. It is not purely about ICT or technical  solutions. The human aspects of cyber resilience need  consideration and measures should be put in place  to ensure everyone understands the risks. Individuals  are best placed to protect themselves and others with  whom they interact.   What are the associated threats, vulnerabilities and risks?  1. The Threats The Isle of Man is not impervious to cyber-attack or  the threats that are prevalent around the globe. These  cyber threats can be delivered by a range of attackers  from any location, in any time zone. Their intent may  be to disrupt, destroy, deny services and/or extort  money. They may, for example, be seeking to obtain  commercial proprietary information, commit financial  fraud or extort from a chief executive. These attackers  have different objectives. For example:  • Cyber Criminals seek financial gain through extortion  and ransom, as well as by selling any information they  may have acquired on the black market. They target  governments, businesses and the public at large  using both direct and indirect indiscriminate methods.   • Hacktivists seek to cause damage and disruption  to an organisation or body with which they have  an issue. Their goal may be to cause extensive  reputational and financial harm.   • Nation states (government agencies or their  contractors) focus on collecting strategic information  for political or economic gain or disrupting industrial  facilities in competitive or hostile countries.  • ‘Script Kiddies’ are the individuals who seek out  vulnerabilities and flaws in systems and services.  Notionally they are less skilled and not as well-resourced  as the more organised criminal actors. However,  they have been able to cause significant impact to  organisations and public bodies in other nations.   • Cyber Espionage is undertaken by one organisation  or person against another to obtain intellectual  property illicitly. This could be new technology,  accounts data etc. The goal is to obtain competitive  advantage or significantly harm the competitor.   0010 National Cyber Security Strategy - 2018-2022 - The challenge we face    0011  2. The vulnerabilities  • Systems Maintenance – IT systems across the public,  private and business sectors should be updated and  checked regularly and effectively. IT is an expensive  commodity and, at times, it may not be financially  viable for a company, or family, to replace its IT.  However, it is essential that these systems, both new  and legacy, are fully updated and all appropriate fixes  are applied. The Government, through the Office of  Cyber Security and Information Assurance (OCSIA),  will provide a focal point for advice and guidance on  this area that is accessible and approachable for all.  • Training and Skills - Like the rest of the world, the Isle  of Man has a shortage of cyber security resources  and skilled operators. This strategy is looking to  assess and remedy this as far as is practicably  possible. It is our belief that all residents and  employees need to have a fundamental awareness  of cyber security and, to support this, Government  will develop a nationwide cyber awareness campaign  to help the Island’s residents to understand the  fundamentals of staying safe online. Furthermore,  it will help business and other sectors to introduce  a programme of cyber awareness across their  organisations, adopting a methodology of cyber  security baselining, similar to that used in the   United Kingdom’s Cyber Essentials .  • Insider Threat - The human factor is one of the  greatest risks to a company and its network. Basic  education and training can mitigate most of  this potential risk. The insider threat may not be  malicious or intended; it may be simply an employee  inadvertently plugging in an infected USB stick   or sending a misdirected email. In England, the  NHS National Data Guardian has warned that staff  members tend to ignore precautions that make it  harder for them to do their job. Such workarounds  are dangerous. Helping staff understand the reasons  for the precautions as well as designing worker- friendly solutions will go some way to preventing  such dangerous behaviour.  • High Tech Crime - Cyber Crime is a fast moving area  of activity that can affect us all. The Government  and Isle of Man Constabulary (IOMC) are working  together to develop the skills, capabilities and  technologies to deliver law enforcement in regard  to cybercrime, including online fraud. The IOMC  is currently reviewing its capacity and capabilities  to counter criminality and illicit activity across the  digital domain. As part of this, the Government will  undertake a review of associated legislation and  guidelines pertinent to the Isle of Man.  • Online Fraud - Currently the City of London Police  operates the UK’s Online Fraud Portal. This portal  serves the whole of the UK and does offer support  to Island residents; however it provides limited  options for local analysis. IOMC supported by IOM  Government is therefore intent on creating an   Island-based comparable system that will feed  into the City of London Police, but will be primarily  focused on Island-based incidents to enable local  measures to be applied where applicable. The  solution is yet to be determined, but will enable  reporting by a variety of means.  3. The risks  The risks to Government are actively managed   across all of its operations and in delivery of its   services. Cyber risk management is a fundamental  part of broader risk management and is integral to the  Island’s wider resilience capabilities. The Government is  looking to manage, reduce and/or mitigate the relevant  cyber risks in cooperation with its partners and relevant  stakeholders. The main objective is to ensure that  Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability   (CIA) across the Island’s networks are assured and  can be quickly restored following an incident, with  minimum disruption.   The threats across cyberspace are prevalent and ever  changing. So the Government’s response must be  agile and kept under regular assessment. This requires  application of the appropriate controls and adherence  to the defined policies, procedures and protocols. By  this means we are striving to reduce and manage the  extent and ramifications of known and perceived risks.     What are the areas of potential impact?  Critical National Infrastructure (CNI)  The Island’s national infrastructure, both publicly and  privately owned and/or supplied, is the backbone of  our way of life. It includes the ports and harbours, the  Internet Service Providers (ISPs), water and sewerage,  our electricity supply, domestic gas and oil provision, to  name but a few. As a distinct island there is a necessity  to protect the full CNI within our shores from cyber- attacks and incidents, maintaining the provision of the  services they offer to all.   The backbone of the Island’s CNI is made up of large  and complex Industrial Control Systems (ICS). They  are, for example, embedded within the Island’s traffic  controls, water filtration, hospital systems, transport  network, sewerage, etc. The ICSs enable delivery of  essential services through a distributed network, with  a number of sub-systems that ensure the processes  operate correctly and in a timely manner. These systems  are often separated from office-based systems, but  can be just as vulnerable. The Government will actively  support the protection of these areas and its systems  by ensuring cyber risks and issues are mitigated as far  as is practicable, contingencies are catered for, and  appropriate recovery and remedial activity is developed  as part of our national resilience strand of work.   We will work with the non-government entities to ensure  the most appropriate and applicable standards and  systems are adopted where possible to sustain services  and enable expedient recovery following an incident.   Business  As the e-business market, inclusive of e-commerce,  develops on the Island, so does the potential for a  cyber-attack. The Government is committed to reducing  the number of harmful attacks and their impact on  the economic and digital sectors. Businesses on the  Island need to feel assured that the Government and  the Island’s Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have done  everything possible to secure the networks and services  they use in their business activities. The Government is   revising and developing its plans to support businesses  if they are unfortunate enough to have been a victim  of a cyber-attack. Recovery from an attack can be  expensive in terms of direct and indirect costs to the  business. Unfortunately, awareness of an attack may  come sometime after it has started or even finished and  the impact may potentially be far worse than initially  imagined. Small businesses are just as vulnerable as  larger organisations. The Government is determined  to provide the same support for Small-to-Medium  Enterprises (SMEs) as it does for larger businesses.   In line with the Government’s commitment, the Digital  Inclusion strategy is helping more people to get online.  It will help residents to access training and jobs, social  and leisure activities and internet shopping. Being online  can also help to address wider social issues and support  economic growth. The Government is aligning both  the Digital Inclusion and the National Cyber-Security  Strategy to ensure that they are complementary.   Reputation  The Isle of Man has a strong business reputation and  wishes to maintain and strengthen its reputation as  one of the safest places in the world . By ensuring that  the Island has a strong cyber-security strategy the  Government has committed to ensuring that the Island  is a location of choice for companies and the public are  secure and aware.  0012 National Cyber Security Strategy - 2018-2022 - The challenge we face    National Cyber Security Strategy - 2018-2022 - Acronyms 0013  What is Government doing about it? Business Continuity and Resilience Exercises  The Government has a set of well-developed and  established Business Continuity plans. However, as   the National Cyber Security Strategy comes into  operation, the current plans will need to be adapted   to incorporate cyber resilience.  The Isle of Man Government routinely undertakes  Emergency Planning and Business Continuity exercises.  These exercises will continue in the future. However, they  will be adapted to encompass cyber security incidents  on a larger scale. Through these exercises, all relevant  Government departments and partners will be tested  to assess the national response, with Learning from  Experience (LfE) protocol adopted whenever necessary.  The aim of such exercises is ultimately to maintain states  of readiness for key departments and partners,determine  any new weaknesses and validate current plans.  Legislation and Standards  In developing the Island’s resilience, capacity and  capabilities the Government is undertaking a detailed  analysis of the relevant global legislation and standards  for cyberspace, data management and information  assurance. It is committed to meeting the requirements  of those regulations and legislative frameworks that  enable businesses to operate in foreign markets whilst  ensuring data is secure and protected here on the Island.  Underpinning the national strategy are a number of  forthcoming EU regulations and directives. The ongoing  Brexit negotiations have also been factored into the  planning process. The Government has deployed  sufficient resource for developing our systems and  processes to meet these upcoming events. By the end  of May 2018 the Isle of Man Government will honour its  commitment, announced by the Chief Minister, to adopt  the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) into Manx   Law. There will be a review of the GDPR’s requirements  along with an investigation into whether its associated  Directives are applicable, namely Network and Information  Systems Directive (NISD), Policing and Criminal Justice  (PCJ) and the Health and Social Care (H&SC) Directives.  Partnering and unity of approach  The Office of Cyber Security and Information Assurance  (OCSIA), as part of the Cabinet Office, will on behalf of  Government have responsibility to deliver and manage  this strategy with oversight being provided directly by the  Chief Secretary and the delegated Member for Cyber.  The Isle of Man national capacity and capabilities are to  be developed on a long-term basis. However, accepting  that not all things can be achieved independently, the  government is ensuring that from the outset and where  required, development work will be done in partnership  with the United Kingdom’s agencies, bodies and  organisations to reinforce our own national systems,  practices and processes. IOM data and information will  remain IOM-owned and managed through properly  structured agreements. The Island will benefit further  through sharing best practices as a scaled national  cyber security solution is delivered.  Digital Government  The Isle of Man Government is currently delivering  both its Digital Strategy and Digital Inclusion Strategy,  and is keen to develop further the services available  over the digital networks. The Digital Strategy has been  developed to enable public services to be delivered  more expeditiously and more cost effectively. Although  the provision of digital services started some time ago,  the extent and breadth of online services will develop  alongside the advances of the Digital Strategy.     Aim of the Strategy  There can be no excuses for failing to take cyber-security seriously. Across  the developed world, businesses that did not secure their customers’  personal details against theft by hackers have suffered massive reputational  damage and commercial losses. Individuals know there may be a heavy  financial price to pay for divulging passwords and account details. And the  scale of the threat is increasing. In May 2017 the WannaCry ransomware  attack, which targeted computers running the Microsoft Windows  programme, infected more than 230,000 computers in more than 150  countries. It caused disruption in railway systems in Russia and Germany,  the phone network in Spain and the NHS in England.  0014 National Cyber Security Strategy - 2018-2022 - Our Strategic Intent  Our Strategic  Intent  The Isle of Man is small and distinct, but an important  player in global economic markets. It is fortunate to  be afforded fundamental levels of protection by the  United Kingdom in a number of areas, such as defence.  However, due to the Island’s independence and  separation from the United Kingdom, it falls to us   on the Island to defend our own digital space.  That is why we need the National Cyber-Security  Strategy set out in this document. It has been   developed for all residents, all businesses, the third  sector and Government. It is a crucial underpinning   of our society that will:  • Protect our networks  • Secure the data we hold and use  • Support our economic development  • Counter criminality and illicit activity  in the digital environment  • Foster enduring relationships with partners.  The Government is working towards formalising its  partnerships with other Crown Dependencies, nations,  organisations and academic institutions. For example,  the UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has  agreed to work with us on matters of cyber security,  and the Isle of Man Government is working towards  formalising that arrangement. However, there will  still be a requirement for us to maintain a high level  of independence to protect our fiscal integrity and  economic prosperity. We must develop our own cyber  security protection and resilience to minimise the need  for external support from partner nations.   The strategy has a clear vision and a strong mission  statement, which is explained in greater detail in   the rest of this document.    Mission The Office of Cyber-Security and  Information Assurance (OCSIA) will  contribute to securing the Isle of  Man’s information networks by  providing advice and guidance, raising   awareness and actively contributing  to the cyber resilience and  information security for the benefit  of citizens, consumers, enterprises  and public sector organisations  established on the Island  Vision To be secure and resilient to  cyber threats whilst remaining  progressive and prosperous       0017National Cyber Security Strategy - 2018-2022 - Principles, Goals and Objectives  The Isle of Man Government’s focus is on providing the Island’s residents,   its public services and businesses with a safe, secure, resilient and  prosperous place to live and operate from. It will do this through the  provision of the appropriate systems, processes and measures.  Principles,  Goals and  Objectives  To achieve success we need:   • Committed leadership by Government  • Strong collaboration with business  • Effective action to educate and train everyone  in society so that we can all play our part in  strengthening cyber security at work and in the home.  This chapter looks at each of these three requirements  in turn, setting out the principles we will follow, the  strategic goals we have set and the precise objectives  that we intend to achieve.    0018 National Cyber Security Strategy - 2018-2022 - Principles, Goals and Objectives  Committed leadership by  Government to achieve resilience  Principle:  The Government sees the Island’s cyber security  and resilience as a top priority. It is a complex area,  requiring focussed resources and capabilities. Through  strong leadership and governance, the Government  will drive progress in support of all on the Island.

Support for Critical   National Infrastructure  Principle:  In protecting the Island’s way of life, its commercial  productivity and its economic prosperity, the Government  will work with providers of Critical National Infrastructure  (CNI) in both the public and private sectors to ensure that  services are maintained, are as resilient as is practicable and  are able to recover swiftly following a cyber-incident.  Strategic goals:  • The Island’s CNI is secure and protected  • All appropriate legislation, standards, and policies  are implemented and enforced across national  infrastructure components, with new versions  drafted for consultation if required  • Enduring multilateral and bilateral relationships  enabling collaboration and interaction are  established specifically related to CNI.  Objectives:  • Ensure the Island’s CNI is robust, resilient and able to  respond/recover accordingly; develop and formalise  partnering with UK, other Crown Dependencies and  key International Partners on cyber security   and digital domain aspects    0019  • Implement a national capability to detect and  defeat high-end threats, whilst utilising partnering  agreements /Memorandum(s) of Understanding  (MOUs) to reinforce a national capability and capacity  across the critical infrastructure on the Island  • Strengthen, promote and formalise collaboration  with the UK and other international partners  • Bolster and refresh Government contingency  planning capacity and skills to expedite recovery  from a cyber-incident across the CNI network,   both public and private.  Strong collaboration with  business to achieve prosperity  Principle:  In delivering a cyber-resilient Island, it is essential  that Government works alongside the business  sector. The Government will deliver the services and  support required whilst ensuring that the rights and  values of all are respected. Furthermore, it will ensure  adherence to human rights law, the relevant data  protection regulations and other applicable legislation,  regulations and standards. Additionally, all activities will  be undertaken as transparently as possible to ensure all  solutions are fully understood.

Objectives:  • Support and develop cyber security research,  business and education across the Island  • Promote economic stability through the   provision of world class facilities and an   environment with freedom to flourish  • Support the protection of national   interests and reputation  • Promote investment, research and development in  the ICT sector and Island-based cyber capabilities  • Reinforce the wider Digital Strategy   and support the Digital Island concept  • Support the Island’s development of new   markets and technology offers – e.g. Data  Businesses, Data Farms, etc  • Reinforce the requirement for Information and   Data Assurance across all sectors on the Island  • Support the Island’s business community in its   ability to tackle financial crime-related activity –  money laundering, terrorist financing, etc  • Support the Island based banking community   to detect, deter and defend its networks  • Provide a secure cyberspace for business   and with business through guidelines,   regulation and enforcement  • Strengthen the economic stability, impact   and reach of the Isle of Man  • Protect the Island’s public and private digital  networks in conjunction with the local Internet  Service Providers (ISPs).  Everyone playing a part   in a progressive society  Principle:   Cyber security and resilience is a shared responsibility,  deliverable by all. We are all responsible for our actions  and activities online and in the digital space. By working  together we can ensure that businesses and residents  are informed, supported, educated and have the  appropriate measures to protect against attacks and  have the support to call upon if an incident occurs. By  sharing these responsibilities we help to create a more  progressive society.  Strategic goals:  • Plans for the development of national capabilities,  capacity and self-reliance in the realm of cyber security  through education, training and mentoring are in place  • Support is available to all the residents of the Island,  of all ages, through education and outreach, allowing  all to be safe and secure online with the appropriate  resources if an incident or issue occurs.  Objectives:  • Develop a national programme that encompasses  all aspects of cyber security, demystify the area, and  instil improved cyber awareness across all sectors  and among the public as a whole  • Promote public awareness so people are   better able to protect themselves online  • Develop a programme of inclusion on the Island,  such as the Cyber Challenge, to enhance digital skills  across all generations through community outreach  and other programmes  • Develop national cyber skills, knowledge and  capability that are able to sustain and meet the  market demands.  Government will issue the National Cyber-Security  Strategy Action Plan within three months. This Plan  will provide more detail on the implementation and  progress reporting of the strategy.     0020 National Cyber Security Strategy - 2018-2022 - Conclusion  It is essential that the Isle of Man Government protects its citizens,  businesses and the broader interests of the Isle of Man. This cyber   security strategy intends to deliver on the promises made in the   Programme for Government and further develop the Island’s   economic prospects, potential and performance.  Indicators of Progress Tracking progress, defining success and tackling the  obstacles to delivery will be essential. The Office of  Cyber Security and Information Assurance (OCSIA)   will work, on behalf of the Government, with our  partners to align our strategy with theirs. We will also  work collaboratively with the Island’s business sectors   to deliver an efficient and effective strategy.   There will be routine reporting, at least quarterly, to the  Council of Ministers and Chief Officers Group to ensure  that strategic oversight is maintained and leadership is  provided. An annual review will be undertaken by the  Chief Secretary to ensure the strategy, in its entirety,  remains relevant and delivering the outputs required   at the pace needed.   Measures of Success  Knowing if the strategy is delivering successfully  is essential to progress and a necessity for both  businesses and residents. Through routine review,  consultation and surveys, the Government will measure  progress and delivery against defined milestones,  changing requirements and actions in order to meet  any emerging threats and the development of new  technologies and ways of working.  We will be successful in delivering the strategy when:  • The Island’s businesses are able to operate in a  resilient and secure environment, managing their  own risks and having sufficient processes in place   to deal with them  • The residents of the Isle of Man are informed and  aware of the risks of using digital technologies, and  are able to report incidents, such as online fraud, and  be confident in the support being provided in dealing  with them  • E-Government and all public services are managed  and delivered in a secure resolute manner by a  Government that is cyber aware, cyber-resilient   and has the appropriate trained personnel and  systems in place  • Businesses and academia prosper on the Island   in their research, innovation and collaboration  • E-business continues to grow and operate   from the Island, based on a global reputation   for cyber-resilience  • Law Enforcement is able to deliver the support   and services required in dealing with cybercrime   to all on the Island  • The Island’s Critical National Infrastructure (CNI)   is resilient and secure, but with sufficient recovery  plans and processes if an event does occur  • The Government will have in place the services   and capabilities to protect and manage the Island’s  digital space and ultimately support the recovery  following an incident.   Conclusion    0021  Aware Develop cyber resilience across the Isle of Man  government and positively influence the private  and third sector entities operating on the Island  along with the wider population. Instigate a major  transformative programme for delivery through  OCSIA designed to test, evaluate and promote cyber  security, cyber resilience and information assurance  across the Isle of Man.   In conclusion, the strategy,  through its implementation,   will deliver on the following:   Resilient Deliver a network of cyber awareness, implement  specialist roles across government able to provide  central policy advice, standards, active direction and  support to allow the dissemination of knowledge  and capability to defend the Island and maximise  the safe use of information assets. Government will  support the development of the Island’s public and  businesses capacity and capability to better defend  themselves from cybercrime and fraudulent activities.   Secure Ensure departments, boards, offices and other  public authorities as well as businesses and  the public are able to deter and defend against  cybercrime and other criminal activities by  maintaining and sharing pertinent information.  Enable the Isle of Man Government to deliver with  assurance a level of cyber security that will both  protect and deflect nefarious cyber activities to  alternate targets. Additionally, the wider Government  will be able to respond and recover from a cyber- incident through the coordination of the relevant  authorities and bodies.    0022 National Cyber Security Strategy - 2018-2022 - Forword  Glossary    0023  Critical National Infrastructure - Processes, systems,  facilities, technologies, networks, assets and services  essential to the nation’s health, safety, security or  economic well-being and the effective functioning of  government. Critical infrastructure can be stand-alone  or interconnected and interdependent within and across  national borders. Disruptions of critical infrastructure  could result in catastrophic loss of life, adverse economic  effects and significant harm to public confidence.  Cybercrime – refers to a vast array of illegal activities that  are implemented via IT systems, including mobile devices. A  crime committed with the aid of, or directly involving, a data  processing system or computer network. The computer or  its data may be the target of the crime or the computer may  be the tool with which the crime is committed.  Cybercriminal – an individual who undertakes criminal  activities via IT systems and/or mobile devices.  Cybercriminals can range from individual, opportunistic  criminals, through to highly-skilled and professional groups  of computer hackers. Cybercriminals may specialise in:  • Developing malware and selling it to others   who go on to launch attacks  • Harvesting data – such as credit card numbers –   and selling it to other criminals or they may  undertake every stage of an attack, from developing  the malware to stealing money from the victim.  Cyber-attack - An attack that involves the unauthorized  use, manipulation, interruption or destruction of, or  access to, via electronic means, electronic information or  the electronic devices or computer systems and networks  used to process, transmit or store that information.  Cyber-espionage – the act of spying and illicitly  accessing information via IT systems and/or the internet.  Cyber-incident - Any unauthorized attempt, whether  successful or not, to gain access to, modify, destroy, delete or  render unavailable any computer network or system resource.  Cyber-security - The protection of digital information,  as well as the integrity of the infrastructure housing and  transmitting digital information. More specifically, cyber  security includes the body of technologies, processes,  practices and response and mitigation measures  designed to protect networks, computers, programs  and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access  so as to ensure confidentiality, integrity and availability.  Cyberspace - The electronic world created by  interconnected networks of information technology  and the information on those networks. It is a global  commons where more than three billion people are  linked together to exchange ideas, services and friendship.  Cyber-threat - A threat actor, using the internet, who  takes advantage of a known vulnerability in a product  for the purposes of exploiting a network and the  information the network carries.  Chat Rooms - An area on the Internet or other  computer network where users can communicate,  typically one dedicated to a particular topic.   E-business – (Electronic business) refers to the use  of the Web, internet, intranets, extranets or some  combination thereof to conduct business. E-business is  similar to e-commerce, but it goes beyond the simple  buying and selling of products and services online.  E-business includes a much wider range of businesses  processes, such as supply chain management,  electronic order processing and customer relationship  management. E-business processes, therefore, can help  companies to operate more effectively and efficiently.  Hacktivists – despite the absence of ‘cyber’ in their title,  these hacker activists deserve a mention in our glossary.  Hacktivists are computer hackers that have aligned  themselves with a specific protest organisation or group  of activists. Their activities can be similar to those of  cyberterrorists or cyber-saboteurs.   Information Communication Technology (ICT) – refers  to technologies that provide access to information  through telecommunications. It is similar to Information  Technology (IT), but focuses primarily on communication  technologies. This includes the Internet, wireless networks,  cell phones, and other communication media.  Information Security - The preservation, confidentiality,  integrity and availability of information; other properties  such as authenticity, accountability and non-repudiation  may be involved.   Internet Service Provider (ISP) - An Internet Service  Provider is a company that provides a service allowing  business or personal users to access the internet.   Intellectual Property (IP) - According to the World  Intellectual Property Organization, intellectual property  (IP) is a creation of the mind. IP includes inventions,  literary and artistic works, designs and symbols, and  names and images used in business.  Internet of Things (IoT) - The interconnection via the  internet of computing devices embedded in everyday  objects, enabling them to send and receive data.  Malware - Malicious software, known as malware, is  an overarching term for software that is designed to  infiltrate or damage a computer. Malware’s effects can  include Denial of Service (DoS), Distributed Denial of  Service (DDoS), privilege escalation, keystroke logging,  geo-location of smartphones, tablets, laptops and  similar devices, and the exploiting social networks.  Phishing – the use of electronic communication (e.g.  email) under the guise of a legitimate source to lure  a recipient into disclosing sensitive information, e.g.  Personal Identifying Data (PID), bank details, etc.  Ransomware - Software that denies you   access to your files until you pay a ransom.

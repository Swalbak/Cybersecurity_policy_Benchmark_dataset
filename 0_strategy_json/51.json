What kind of society do we want to become? How can we maintain and enhance a united and inclusive Marshallese identity? What are the transformations needed to improve our social and economic situation? How can we ensure sustainable development in the face of the growing concerns for the survival of the country from the existential threat of climate change and sea level rise, in addition to the unresolved nuclear legacy we continue to endure? These are some of the main issues The National Strategic Plan (NSP) 2020–2030 addresses. This NSP is a result of a national consultative process among government ministries and agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) the private sector and all relevant stakeholders, and provides a broad consensus on the necessity for Marshallese to clearly define the future of the country. The process provided the basis upon which this NSP: its Vision, Objectives, Context and Strategies were developed. The NSP is designed as a framework to coordinate the articulated long-term development goals and objectives of the RMI government at the national level. The NSP will be used by government leaders as the Roadmap for development and progress in the long-term (2020–2030) and will be continually updated for use in meeting longer term objectives as the RMI moves forward with meeting national priorities and development objectives. The NSP will enable RMI government leaders to articulate the direction of priorities over the coming decade, and can now clearly outline the chronological pathway for implementation of national priorities. 2 COUNTRY PROFILE Independence : 21 October 1986 UN/ESCAP Membership : 31 July 1991 Capital : Majuro (7N 171E) Geographical Location : Central-North Pacific Constitution : Mixed Parliamentary and Presidential System Parliament : Unicameral, 33 members elected every four years Official Languages : Marshallese and English Land Area : 180 square kilometers (70 square miles) Exclusive Economic Zone : 2.1 million square kilometers (1.3 million square miles) Population : 54,705 (2019)1 GNI per Capita : $4,860 (Atlas method, current US$ as of 2018)2 GDP : $201.7 million (in FY2015 constant prices)3 Annual Average GDP Growth : 3.0% (FY2016-2018)4 GDP by Institutional Sector : Public Sector 43.6%, Private Sector 31.4%, Others 25%5 Labor Force : Total 13,060, Male 8,458, Female 4,6026 Labor Force Participate Rate : Total 41.7%, Male 53.6%, Females 29.7%7 Life Expectancy at Birth : Male 71.3, Female 72.58 Human Development Index : 0.698 (ranked 117 of 189 countries)9 1 Based on Office of the Chief Secretary analysis, Republic of the Marshall Islands Population: Historical Review and Projections to 2027.

Past planning documents used to provide direction for this current plan include:  First Five-Year Economic Development Plan: 1986−1991  Second Five-Year Economic Development Plan: 1992−1996  Public Sector Investment Program: 1997  National Sustainable Development Strategy 2000  Vision 2018: Strategic Development Plan Framework 2003−2018  National Strategic Plan 2015-2017 The RMI Cabinet, on May 29, 2019, adopted the RMI National Planning Framework (C.M. 123 (2019)10, and reaffirmed the NSP as the apex planning document with a high-level strategic focus addressing all developmental activity both public and private, including external projects. The Planning Framework establishes a framework for sector and thematic level planning contributing to the alignment of all planning and budgeting with the NSP including the implementation of Three-Year Rolling Planning and Budgeting at the Ministry Level. NSP Critical Design Features The NSP 2020-2030 includes the following key design components:  Spans a 10-year timeframe  Sets the national vision and long-term development goals  Identifies Sector Over-Arching Goals  Specifies the Sectors, Strategic Areas and related Policy Objectives  Provides a guide for the allocation of budget resources through the MTBIF and annual budget appropriations. Further, that ‘resilience’, in all its dimensions including, environmental, social, economic resilience, would be the foundation of the NSP. The NSP contains references to building resilience, as a development necessity. There is a recognition that challenges faced by RMI are not just from climate change and natural disaster hazards but also from socio-economic factors. The cascading design of NSP 2020-2030 highlights that national priorities must align with sector strategies and further into organizational plans at the operational level. This is critical to the success of realizing the Goals and Policy Objectives of the NSP. The NSP 2020–2030 is defined around 5 Pillars, comprised of 24 Strategic Areas in total. Each Strategic Area includes its own Over-Arching Goal and related Policy Objectives, as detailed n Figure 1 below. 10 RMI (Confidential) C.M. 123 (2019) National Planning Framework, May 29, 2019 4 The planning process, illustrated in Figure 2 below, shows the link between the NSP, Sector/Thematic Strategies, Ministry/Organizational Work-plans and budgets and the Medium-Term Budget and Investment Framework (MTBIF).

As such, it is founded on the attributes of self-reliance, mutual respect, tolerance and integrity in line with constitutional obligations and international promises. The Vision Statement encompasses, in summary, the priorities and aspirations of the ongoing efforts at development in the RMI. The NSP Vision is founded on the Constitution of the Marshall Islands and the Vision 2018 “Declaration to the Marshallese.” Annex 3 includes the Preamble to the RMI Constitution and the Vision 2018 Declaration to the Marshallese People. NSP OBJECTIVE Our people and culture are the source of inspiration for the priorities of the NSP. Through successful implementation, the NSP moves Marshallese society so that all citizens achieve their potential through opportunities provided by the promise of sustainable development. This objective empowers all citizens with both responsibility and opportunity, and provides for every citizen the opportunity to enjoy improved quality of life in all areas including health, education, energy, food security, law and order, gender equality, employment opportunities and disaster mitigation. Furthermore, this empowerment is more deeply broadened by embracing our culture as a unifying force for sustainable development. NSP OBJECTIVE Sustainable, Equitable and Measurable Development Reflecting the Priorities and Culture of the Marshallese People NSP VISION STATEMENT “Kallib Bwe Kwon AKEO” Komelele 1: Jerbal ko ad rej monakaj𝒂 ne Ilju eo ad. Komelele 2: Eltan Peid enaaj lamlame ilju eo ad. In our own hands is our future. 6 NSP CONTEXT The NSP National Context is based on the ideas of Social and Economic Empowerment, Resilience, Adaptation to Climate Change, Security and Human Development. As one of the only four atoll countries in the world, we face threats to our existence and national survival from a variety of issues including the impacts of climate change and sea level rise. The issue of the RMI’s nuclear past and its continuing legacy strikes a sensitive chord in our society. The NSP, takes cognizance of these issues and growing challenges in trying to chart out a development path for the country and our people. Shaping the Context This sub-section provides a snapshot of the issues that shape the context of this NSP. Additional background information is located in Annex 4. Geography presents challenges for development: Our country will forever remain small and isolated, making transport and trade with major markets costly. While communication with the outside world has also been historically costly and inconsistent, the investment in submarine fiber optic cable in 2010 dramatically improved connectivity with the rest of the world. It is imperative that improvements continue in the domestic telecommunication and information technology services. As a low-lying atoll nation vulnerable to the damaging effects of climate change and natural disasters, with sea-level rise posing a direct threat to our very existence makes the development of a competitive, productive economy all the more challenging. Geography also provides real opportunities: Our strategic location in the central Pacific, large ocean area, and natural resources provide excellent platforms for a better economy for the people. High reliance on external resources and imports: Reflecting our isolation and narrow resource base, the economy remains highly dependent on international support, mostly in the forms of grants, which has been equivalent to 35 percent of GDP over the past decade. Approximately half of our annual budget is funded from external sources. Additionally, as a small island economy with a narrow resource base, access to international markets is crucial. The RMI consistently imports much more than it exports, relying on imported supplies for food, consumer goods, machinery, and petroleum products with limited scope to produce much of these commodities locally. Rural-urban disparities continue to exist: This is the case in both the urban centers and outer islands, and there is a clear trend of urban migration, with Majuro and Kwajalein atolls now home to three-fourths of our population. The economies of the outer island communities have not fundamentally changed over the past century, with these communities relying mostly on copra and handicraft production and limited commercial fisheries and farming activities for their livelihoods. Subsistence fishing and farming remain mainstays of daily life. Urban economies remain non-diversified. The urban economies in Majuro and Kwajalein rely heavily on government bureaucracy and the Kwajalein missile base for employment and income. These economies are dominated by the wholesale and retail trade, construction, banking and insurance, and commercial fisheries operations. 7 Human capital remains underdeveloped: At the heart of all development is human development, and at the heart of human development is early childhood and maternal health, nutrition, and care. While RMI’s broad human development indicators such as infant and child mortality rates and educational attainment have steadily improved since independence, the overall progress in building human capital can still be improved. We need to redouble efforts to ensure that every child born in the RMI is provided the proper health, nutrition, and care especially in the first 1,000 days of life and that educational opportunities are accessible to all. Such an investment will have a greater impact on long term social, economic, and development prospects. 1. SOCIAL AND CULTURE PILLAR The Pillar consists of four Strategic Areas: 1. Health 2. Education and Training 3. Social Justice and Inclusion 4. Culture and Traditional Knowledge The resilience of the people of any country is a measure of their true social capital and wealth. Enhancing the health, education and quality of life of all people, is central to building a fair and progressive nation. Pillar Over-Arching Objective Healthy, Peaceful and Inclusive Societies for Sustainable Development 1.1 Strategic Area: Health GOAL: Healthy Lives and Well-being for All Ages Policy Objectives 1) Strengthened response to non-communicable diseases, including nutrition, mental health, and injuries 2) Improved maternal, infant, child and adolescent health 3) Strengthened response and resilience to communicable disease, environmental health, and health emergency preparedness 4) Strengthened planning, management and administration of Human and Financial resources 5) Provision of quality health care infrastructure, especially cancer care, for all Marshallese 6) Strengthened outer island health services 7) Address issues of climate change and human health The goals of the Ministry of Health and Human Services underscore the theme that “Kumiti Ejmour” or Health is a shared responsibility. The “kumit” lifestyle is one where every Marshallese supports one another in every effort to improve healthy lifestyles now and in the years to come. Additionally, the ‘Healthy Islands’ concept has remained an inspiration for RMI and the Pacific. We remain committed to applying a Healthy Islands focus for health policies. This concept has played a significant role in energizing the approach to Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs). It has framed the approach health leaders have taken to engaging with other sectors, and framed the largely successful efforts in support of bringing global attention to the ongoing NCD epidemic. There is widespread consensus that the Healthy 8 Islands concept is strong and helpful and it should be maintained and supported. The breadth of this concept is only now being realized, with its weave of health, environmental, and Pacific cultural concepts. The RMI continues to witness a surge in NCDs and vector borne diseases including Dengue fever, Zika virus and Chikungunya. The introduction of COVID 19 in late 2019 prompted government planning and preparedness response. With the infectious nature of the COVID 19 virus, and with no current vaccine, this vector borne disease may continue to be part of RMI’s Health Sector planning for at least the medium-term future. Overall, for vector- borne diseases, whether projections are positive or negative depends on the disease, region and extent of change. 1.2 Education and Training GOAL: Inclusive and Equitable Education and Lifelong Learning Opportunities for All Policy Objectives 1) Improved early childhood development 2) Increased learning and student achievement in primary and secondary schools 3) Enhanced post-secondary and continuing education opportunities that provide in-country access to obtain qualifications such as certificates, diplomas, undergraduate and postgraduate degrees 4) Enhanced skills and attributes necessary for a dynamic workforce and resilient economy 5) Ensure schools are well equipped with facilities, resources and quality teachers to foster a more effective learning environment 6) Incorporate sports as an important component of the school system. 7) Address TVET and Workforce Development issues through the NTC, and STEM program Education and training are a shared responsibility that requires the collective and whole-hearted effort of schools, higher education institutions, national and local governments, communities, parents and civil society organizations. Yearly assessment of results has remained static for multiple years despite reforms and the re-crafting of Education curriculums. Outer island schools continually face a shortage of qualified teachers. There is support for the integration of technical and vocational education in the Education Sector Plan (ESP), recognizing that skills training and career planning should begin during primary and secondary years and continue through the provision of life-long training and re-training options for adults. The ESP, currently under development, aims to provide the Public School System (PSS) a workable road map toward constructing and implementing an educational system that recognizes the unique challenges and visions of our people. The plan recognizes the desire for a curriculum that is culturally appropriate and focused on implementation strategies that will improve all students’ lives. The ESP stresses the importance of adopting a standardized and internationally recognized TVET accreditation system. This will enable students to better access further training and secure employment at home and abroad and will focus on expanding educational opportunities for students. 9 1.3 Social Justice and Inclusion GOAL: Equality, Justice, and Empowerment for All Policy Objectives 1) Improve access to justice for RMI’s vulnerable populations 2) Ensure provisions and opportunities for equitable participation of all persons in society 3) Build social empowerment strategies into nationwide frameworks 4) Strengthen actions for accessing restitution for those most affected by the RMI’s nuclear legacy Justice, fairness, and equity are at the heart of any democratic society. There is increasing awareness about issues such as gender, disability and the more vulnerable in society. The Policy Objectives detailed in this Strategic Area focus on being inclusive and providing opportunities for all. 1.4 Culture and Traditional Knowledge GOAL: Integrate Marshallese Culture, Customary Law and Traditional Practices in all Facets of Development Policy Objectives 1) Undertake preservation of traditional knowledge-natural resources and historical sites (men ko bwinnir). 2) Maintain and preserve native Marshallese language. 3) Promote cultural industry- amimono (trademark). 4) Maintain traditional consumption and production of food and medicine. In the face of rapid globalization, it is more challenging for people around the world to maintain and pass on traditions and cultures. As the Marshall Islands, like much of the world, becomes more of a melting pot, cultural preservation of language, knowledge, values and customs becomes increasingly more difficult. The RMI National Cultural Policy and Strategies underscores the need for the safe upkeep and management of culture. Preservation of RMI’s history, historical places and arts are critical for social, education and economic reasons. Strengthening language is a necessary building block for common understanding, expression and identity. This policy also emphasizes that the RMI cultural identity needs to be better promoted for the economic benefit of our indigenous Marshallese society. 2. ENVIRONMENT CLIMATE CHANGE AND RESILIENCY PILLAR The Pillar consists of four Strategic Areas: 1. Atoll Environment 2. Climate Change 3. Disaster Risk Management 4. Radiation Contamination Building resilience of our people and ecosystems is necessary for sustainable development. Protecting our natural capital and strengthening our human capital is essential for meeting our national development objectives and ensuring the sustainability of economic growth regardless of the environmental impacts we may face in the future. 10 Pillar Over-Arching Objective Enhance Resilience of RMI and its Environmental Assets to the Impacts of Climate Change and Natural Disasters and its Environmental Assets through National, Regional and International Efforts The Goal focuses on adaptation and resilience to the looming threat of climate change, as well as natural disasters that can potentially impact development. The Policy Objectives in this Pillar entail greater climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. These efforts focus on increased renewable energy generation, increasing green investments, protecting biodiversity, improving waste management and mainstreaming climate change and environmental consideration into frameworks, policies and plans. 2.1 Atoll Environment GOAL: Protection, Management and Sustainable use of RMI’s Atoll Environment Resources Policy Objectives 1) Improved protection, conservation and sustainability of atoll environment and natural resources 2) Strengthened management of waste, chemicals, pollutants and nuclear radiation 3) Meet obligations to relevant national, regional and international treaties, agreements and frameworks Protecting our natural environment is essential to ensuring well-being and development that will be enjoyed by present and future generations. 2.2 Climate Change GOAL: Holistic Response to Climate Change for Sustainable Social, Economic Development and Well-Being of RMI and its People Policy Objectives 1) Adaptation and resilience actions to current and future impacts of climate change 2) Mitigation of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions in pursuance of RMI's NDC targets and pathway to net zero emissions by 2050 3) Strong advocacy, diplomacy and regional/global leadership to enhance urgent global climate action 4) Strengthened security and survival of RMI to the existential threats of climate change 5) Continued national advocacy, awareness and education on climate change and resilience building. 6) Increased climate finances to enable necessary response to climate change impacts on RMI's socio-economic development A holistic response requires a strengthened coordination and decision making across all stakeholders including government, private sector, NGOs and civil society. Additionally, we will mainstream climate- related risks into planning and budgeting at all levels and in all relevant sectors. We must ensure relevant organizations are adequately resourced and avenues for sustainable financing are secured. 11 2.3 Disaster Risk Management (DRM) GOAL: RMI Manages Disaster Risk for the Current and Future Well-Being of the Marshallese People Policy Objectives 1) Enhanced resilience to disasters and risks 2) Strengthened disaster preparedness, response and recovery 3) Greater coordination, nationally and internationally on DRM efforts Improved national and local capacity to undertake vulnerability and adaptation assessments and planning is critical for disaster risk management. Additionally, we need to ensure all stakeholders are integrated into the planning and implementation of disaster risk and adaptation as needed. An example of disaster risk management could be the design of an updated building code for disaster and climate-proofing, backed by appropriate legislation. 2.4 Radiation Contamination GOAL: Marshallese have the Capacity to Monitor, Understand, and Respond to the Incidence of Radiation Contamination for the Current and Future Well-Being of the Marshallese People Policy Objectives 1) Undertake environmental surveys focused on radiation monitoring, including data analysis and interpretation 2) Establish the necessary legal and policy frameworks to minimise future risks from radiation 3) The necessary policies, regulations, strategies or plans are available for the detection, assessment, response and recovery after radiation emergencies 4) Upskill people on nuclear technology used for peaceful purposes 5) Enhance capacity of stakeholders and community to manage radiation contamination There is ongoing concern about the impacts of lingering radiation in the environment on the health of communities and local food sources in the RMI. It is important that there is a plan to monitor the levels of radiation in our environment, especially the marine environment which is the lifeline for our people. Some potential dangers have been exposed through recent disclosures about the low-level radioactive waste facility on Runit Island (Enewetak Atoll), due to sea level rise and increased tidal fluctuations as a result of climate change. Lingering radiation on other atolls continues to prevent safe habitation of those islands and needs to be addressed. We now face the compounded risk from the nuclear testing impacts and climate change. Both risks require support from the international community. These two threats present challenges both in the present and the future, requiring a multi-dimensional response. As a result, our development focus includes the current and potential impacts of these threats to our resilience and basic survival. 12 3. INFRASTRUCTURE PILLAR The Pillar consists of six Strategic Areas: 1. Transportation (air, land, sea) 2. Energy 3. Water and Sanitation 4. Waste Management 5. Communications 6. Public Facilities Pillar Over-Arching Objective Provide Efficient, Effective, Resilient, Sustainable and Affordable Services and Facilities that Promote Sustainable Economic Growth Any infrastructure development must ensure healthy ecosystems are maintained and that scarce resources such as water are protected. Infrastructure development must also focus on reducing exposure to damage from natural hazards such as coastal inundation, flooding, erosion and contamination from ineffective sanitation and waste disposal. Infrastructure gaps remain significant. Without a dramatic increase in infrastructure investment, from a variety of financing sources, lack of infrastructure will continue to hamper our ability to achieve and sustain the rates of growth necessary for economic sustainability. We remain among those countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change and related natural disasters. However, addressing our nation’s need for infrastructure in the short term must not come at the expense of future generations. In line with the Tile Til Eo (Long-term strategy), we will embark on a low- carbon, blue-green economy development trajectory that emphasizes efficient use of natural resources. 3.1 Transportation GOAL: Sound and Efficient Transport Infrastructure that Supports Social and Economic Development Policy Objectives 1. Efficient and reliable air and sea connectivity to the outer islands and the world 2. Compliance with all applicable (international) maritime and civil aviation safety standards for the ports 3. Reliable roads for efficient movement of people and goods and services Providing efficient and effective transportation facilities to connect our atolls and linking us to international markets is challenging. This reflects both the inherent cost of providing low-volume services to remote places, and the market structure where insufficient competition amongst a small number of service providers inflates costs. The current high costs and low frequencies undermine the viability of investment opportunities and remain a significant concern. Improvements in transportation are crucial to addressing the geographic factors that make economic development so challenging especially when it comes to ensuring that the positive impacts are realized outside of the urban centers. 13 Given our location and distance from trading partners, efficient and affordable air and sea transport is vital. Air connectivity is currently limited to two international airlines and one domestic carrier. The cost of air travel to and from Majuro is a major contributor to the cost of local goods and services and an inhibitor for tourism and trade. Sea transport is vital for the greater connectivity to the outside world as well as between the outer islands. 3.2 Energy GOAL: Clean, Reliable, Affordable, Accessible, Resilient and Sustainable Energy Services for Economic Development Policy Objectives 1) Improved enabling frameworks for reducing dependence on imported fossil fuel for electricity generation 2) Increased energy efficiency in households, businesses, government, transport and other sectors 3) Reliable, sustainable and affordable energy supply Our Electricity Roadmap provides a strategic framework to enable us to meet our climate change targets and to strengthen our role as a climate leader. This roadmap will allow the RMI and our development partners to work together to achieve a common vision for the RMI electricity sector. Over the last 15 years, progress has been made to develop renewable energy. Almost all households on the outer islands, previously without electricity supply, now have solar home systems, and several larger solar projects totaling around 1 megawatt (MW) have been built on Majuro. 3.3 Water and Sanitation GOAL: Access to Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation Systems for the Economic, Social Development and Well-Being of all Marshallese Policy Objectives 1) Effective management of fresh water resources 2) Constant access to drinking water that meets World Health Organization standards 3) Improved sanitation for better health and well-being 4) Comprehensive management of waste water 5) Management of urban drainage and surface waters for safe public exposure The Water and Sanitation Strategic Plan (2017-2027) establishing the most appropriate water and sanitation services for Majuro Atoll over the next 20 years has been developed. It is part of the first phase of a Capital Improvement Program by Majuro Water and Sewer Company (MWSC) to improve water and sanitation services to Majuro Atoll. Additionally, there is ongoing improvement work on Ebeye regarding water and sanitation. 14 3.4 Waste Management GOAL: Establish Reliable Infrastructure for Effective Management of Waste, Chemicals and Pollutants Policy Objectives 1) Enhance accessible community collection services 2) Assess and promote sustainable and sanitary landfill applications and operation 3) Promote local recycling 4) Carry out appropriate incineration for medical waste and waste to energy conversion 5) Explore effective facilities and schemes to promote facilities and processes Waste disposal remains a critical issue, especially in the urban centers. The current dump site in Majuro has not only become an eyesore but a major hazard. The possible strategies for the next 10 years, which focus on sustainable disposal, processing, including waste to energy, and waste export are potential options for action. 3.5 Information and Communication Technology GOAL: Modern, Efficient, Resilient and Affordable Telecommunications Network and Services for Greater Social and Economic Prosperity Policy Objectives 1) Strengthen legal and regulatory framework 2) Provide resilient platforms for efficient and affordable connectivity 3) Improve outer island connectivity 4) Revise ICT Policy 2012 and existing telecom laws and regulations for greater relevance to current setting Geographical features and population dispersion present significant challenges for the provision of affordable telecommunications services. The importance of modern mobile technological solutions for increased and improved connectivity to the outside world and the outer islands cannot be over emphasized. 3.6 Public Facilities GOAL: Sound, Resilient, Efficient Public Facilities for Sustainable Social and Economic Development and Well-Being Policy Objectives 1) Strategic and resilient infrastructure planning and investment 2) Well-designed, built and maintained public facilities (roads, runways, buildings, amenities, schools, dispensaries, seawalls etc.) 3) Raise building standards through implementation of a Building Code Strategic infrastructure planning that takes into consideration social, environmental and economic costs. Analysis will need to be completed to ensure we can reap the greatest possible benefit from infrastructure development. Planning will help us to avoid the negative impact of poorly planned infrastructure such as coastal erosion, pollution and other negative impacts. Building an effective, integrated, maintained and sustainable infrastructure, including public facilities is needed to improve overall infrastructure resilience in the Marshall Islands We will integrate climate-sensitive approaches to existing laws and planning processes, 15 such as building codes. We will work with individuals and communities at all levels to improve natural resource management and mitigate, the impacts of climate change and other environmental hazards. 4. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PILLAR The Pillar consists of five Strategic Areas: 1. Land 2. Agriculture 3. Marine Resources 4. Trade, Investment and Tourism 5. Financial Sector and Services Pillar Over-Arching Objective To Achieve an Economy that Underpins a Resilient, Productive, and Self-Supportive Nation Supported by Implemented Legislation, Policies, and Conditions for an Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Growth, that will help Mobilize Investment both Domestic and Foreign to Create Decent Jobs, Drive Greater Productivity and Promote Better Living Standards Our vision is an economy that underpins a resilient, productive, and self-supportive nation. This will require efforts across a range of sectoral and cross-sectoral policy areas, planning and coordination. There is a need to identify a set of coherent, complementary policies and investments on the part of Government that will help to create the right conditions for an inclusive and sustainable economy An underlying aim is the need to create the right conditions to mobilize private investment, both domestic and foreign, so that high priority areas including the creation of decent jobs, driving greater productivity and better living standards can be realized. The five Strategic Areas in this pillar are important for catalyzing economic growth and unlocking the potential for greater trade and investment. 4.1 Land GOAL: Enhance Access to Land Policy Objectives 1) Greater opportunities to utilize land for economic growth 2) Promote greater awareness of land rights and opportunities through awareness and partnership Access to land remains a longstanding underlying challenge to both investment and development. One solution would be to design innovative long-term land leases and include provisions for timely and updated information on available land for investments. There is a need to streamline processes and regulations for land registration, allowing for more efficient use of properties and facilitate improved access to credit by allowing land to be used as collateral. This needs to be done in a culturally appropriate manner which requires new approaches and extensive consultation between landowners, the private sector and the policymakers. The provision of strategic infrastructure assets, access and retention of land resources, at reasonable costs and with secure tenure, will be pursued for the benefit of all Marshallese. 16 4.2 Agriculture GOAL: Enhancing Agricultural Development Policy Objectives 1) Improve production, supply and distribution of nutritious food 2) Promote environmental sustainability 3) Enhance capacity of agriculture sector stakeholders 4) Develop enabling policies and legislation. Agricultural production (excluding fisheries) represents a relatively small proportion of the RMI economy (around 4% of GDP), but is a critical source of livelihoods especially on the outer islands. There is some underutilized land which offers potential for increased output of agricultural food crops, but this is limited, and soil conditions are generally poor. The principal commercial crops are coconuts and breadfruit. Our people have been involved in copra production since the 1850s and the atolls are widely planted with coconut trees, however, copra currently accounts for only about 1% of GDP. Nevertheless, the coconut is still considered the “tree of life” with high potential to produce multiple valuable products both for food security and income generation. Consequently, the value chain of copra and coconut plantations rehabilitation and replanting continue to be championed as key pathways to promote economic development and income generation. Copra processing is done primarily through the Tobolar Copra Processing Authority, a State-Owned Enterprise (SOE). Tobolar guarantees the purchase of all coconuts harvested in the RMI and is responsible for collecting, transporting and processing the raw material, paying farmers for their produce, and selling the final products. An issue to be addressed is the government subsidy for Tobolar. This reliance on government subsidies leads to inefficiencies which have led to negative economic repercussions for the copra processing industry. The economic viability of Tobolar is an issue to be addressed at both the national and sector levels. There are opportunities for growth in the sector, and this needs to be explored for both food security and commercial production. 4.3 Marine Resources GOAL: Sustainable and Responsible use of Marine Resources Policy Objectives 1) Maximize the long-term value from its fisheries for the benefit of the economy and people of RMI 2) Conserve and manage the aquatic resources for current and future generations. 3) Enhance professionalism, transparency and accountability in the management of fisheries resources. 4) Maximise income and livelihood opportunities through sustainable coastal fisheries Fisheries are the most commercially valuable natural resource in the RMI. Fees for commercial fishing have become one of the largest sources of government revenue. There is a need to continue efforts to maximize fishing revenues in a way that considers the sustainability of fisheries and the needs of fishing companies and investors. RMI will pursue opportunities for:  Further private sector development and investment in fisheries-related activities 17  Public policy initiatives to stimulate increased economic activity via incentives to encourage greater transshipment, onshore fish processing and vessel support services, in particular  The ongoing maturing of the regional structures that govern oceanic fisheries royalties, including the Parties to the Nauru Agreement’s (PNA) Purse Seine and Longline Vessel Day Scheme. 4.4 Trade, Investment and Tourism GOAL: Local Economic and Employment Growth Policy Objectives 1) Increase import substitution and production and export of locally manufactured goods 2) Establish more sustainable and eco-friendly tourism 3) Promote fair and friendly business environment 4) Promote MSMEs and women entrepreneurs 5) Promote partnerships among public-private and Civil Society Organizations 6) Enhancement and protection of consumer interests and rights We in the RMI are blessed with great natural beauty and pristine environment that offers great potential for harnessing the “blue economy” as well as sectors such as tourism, and trade and investment The tourism sector has untapped potential in contributing to income and employment creation. We can promote tourism around the beauty of our atolls for diving, surfing, sport fishing and other ecotourism attractions. There is potential to market tourism with a focus on niche opportunities using technological innovations. This needs to be developed hand in hand with investments in enabling infrastructure, including accommodation facilities. There is potential for greater local participation and joint venture investments so that inclusive ecotourism destinations are developed allowing all to share in our rich culture and tradition. 4.5 Financial Sector and Services GOAL: Enhance Financial Sector Stability and Improve Financial Services. Policy Objectives 1) Strengthen financial sector oversight 2) Improve access to affordable and competitive financial services 3) Protect and develop links to the international financial system Access to affordable financial services is important for people to manage their finances and for micro, small and medium enterprises to develop. Financial institutions are in the best position to tailor products and services that promotes greater access to financial services that meet the social and economic development needs of the people of the RMI. Global connectivity of the financial system is critical to facilitate the flow of trade and payments, and correspondent banking relationships for local banks, need to be maintained. Regulatory and supervisory oversight of the financial system needs to be strengthened to address the challenges of money laundering and terrorist financing and to safeguard the stability of the financial system. Innovative channels of distributing financial services in rural and urban areas including the outer islands should be encouraged through the use of technology. Building financial capability through financial literacy in the communities and schools is an 18 important tool for imparting financial “know how” allowing for effective utilization of financial services by all stakeholders. 5. GOOD GOVERNANCE PILLAR The Pillar consists of five Strategic Areas: 1. Public Administration 2. Public Financial Management 3. Law, Justice and Public Safety 4. Judiciary 5. International Relations and Security Pillar Over-Arching Objective To Apply Good Governance to all Areas of Government and Society, Ensuring the Rule of Law Applies to Every Citizen, Ensuring Effective Measures are in Place to Eliminate any Corruption or Illegal Conduct Strengthening the machinery of government at all levels and the instalment of transparent and accountable systems that support effective service is vital for achieving high levels of administrative and institutional performance. The RMI recognizes that improving policy development and enhancing implementation will improve our governance mechanisms. Additionally, strengthening institutional performance management and monitoring systems are crucial elements underpinning good governance, and form a foundation upon which any long-term development process is based. 5.1 Public Administration GOAL: Provide High Quality, Accountable and Transparent Services Policy Objectives 1) Improve practices to achieve an effective, ethical, and transparent public service, local governments and related public agencies 2) Enhance capacity of public servants and employees of public agencies, including in particular those in the outer islands 3) Strengthen oversight, audit, alignment and coordination across and within the public service and related public agencies 4) Strengthen the connection and cooperation with civil society, private sector and outer islands 5) Strengthen the capability of accountability and integrity institutions to address corruption and unethical practices The NSP includes an emphasis on modernizing the public service and the introduction of new public-sector management practices. Transparency, accountability and integrity serve as the primary elements of this drive towards improved institutional performance. 19 5.2 Public Financial Management GOAL: Sound and Efficient Public Financial Management Policy Objectives 1) Promote stable growth through responsible fiscal policy targeting stability in inflation 2) Strengthen budget management and financial oversight for planned priorities 3) Enhance SOE financial performance and service delivery 4) Ensure public debt is sustainably managed and finances are directed towards projects with positive economic returns 5) Improve revenue generation 6) Strengthen dialogue between national and local government and the private sector, and enact a robust governance framework for effective partnership. 7) Strengthen accountability and oversight in the PFM In 2012, a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) study reviewed the Public Financial Management (PFM) system and highlighted areas of needed reform. Based on the PEFA, the government developed a PFM Reform Roadmap 2014–2016 (the Roadmap), consisting of 30 reform components, including promoting better fiscal responsibility and debt management. In December 2015, the Roadmap was endorsed by the Cabinet. A PFM Reform Steering Committee chaired by the Chief Secretary was established in March 2016 to provide high-level management. The Ministry of Finance, Banking and Postal Services (MOFBPS) was tasked to lead efforts to implement the Roadmap. The implementation of the PFM roadmap, began in 2016 and continues with assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank and the European Union. 5.3 Law, Justice and Public Safety GOAL: Robust Law Enforcement and Improved Community Safety Policy Objectives 1) Enable accountable, professional and ethical law making. 2) Require robust and unbiased enforcement of laws, justice and regulatory processes. 3) Implement effective systems of corporate regulation 4) Strengthen the capacity and processes of law making, regulation, enforcement and oversight of relevant agencies The rule of law and justice are fundamental principles which underpin democratic governance. We continue to work to make the law more transparent and consultative, producing legislation that is in the interest of all our people. It is also crucial that the law is administered fairly and impartially, with respect for human rights, and without discrimination so that no person is above the law and every person may benefit equally from its administration. Steps are also underway to strengthen the abilities of law enforcement institutions to deliver personal security, particularly for vulnerable groups, using new and innovative approaches such as community policing and greater border security. The need to enhance maritime patrol, crime prevention, including measures to combat drug, human trafficking is also an area we will address. Furthermore, we continue to be vigilant about cyber- 20 crime, money laundering and other illegal activities, in order to protect our environment and social fabric for communities and families. 5.4 Judiciary GOAL: A Court and Judicial System, which is Effective, Impartial, Fair and Transparent Policy Objectives 1) Resolve judicial issues fairly, effectively, and efficiently 2) Provide access to legal services that are affordable 3) Ensure judiciary shall remain independent, yet transparent and accountable To achieve our goals and objectives our courts must remain independent, and trials must be open and fair. Steps must be taken to strengthen the rule of law at the community level so that people continue to feel safe and are not denied justice. In this context, we recognize the important role played by civil society organizations in advancing justice and the rule of law, and the contribution they make to increasing public trust and awareness. 5.5 International Relations and Security GOAL: Protect and Promote the National Interests of the RMI Regionally and Internationally Policy Objectives 1) Enhance diplomacy and international relations 2) Catalyze external support for development from traditional and new partners 3) Facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people 4) Ensure safe, secure and resilient physical borders 5) Establish safe, secure and accessible cyber environment Security, in all its dimensions: (geopolitical, maritime, border, cyber, drug trafficking, people trafficking, diseases and pests etc.) is a necessary for the protection of the people and the country. This requires effective coordination with relevant agencies internally and externally and effective monitoring. To achieve our development objectives our global relationships are crucial with regard to the catalysis of funds and technical support. RMI’s leadership in critical issues such as climate change has been useful in unlocking greater funds from multilateral and bilateral sources, both traditional and new. At the same time we will continue to navigate our path carefully given the greater geopolitical interest in the region and ensure the long- term sustainability of any arrangements. Cross-Cutting Issues We have identified six cross-cutting issues that are inherent in the NSP. The five Pillars embrace these issues in the identified Policy Objectives. Summary information for each of these cross-cutting issues is provided below with additional information located in Annexes 5-7. 21 Outer Island Development This current NSP addresses Outer Island development through a cross-cutting approach in all five Pillars. It is a NATIONAL PLAN that is inclusive of the entire country. The Policy Objectives exemplify how the NSP addresses outer island development through the One Nation Development Concept outlined in Vision 2018. Development of the outer islands is also outlined in several RMI National Policies including (but not limited to) the 2050 Long-Term Climate Strategy, National Adaptation Plan (NAP), Food Security Policy, National Infrastructure and Investment Plan (NIIP), National Environment Management Strategy (NEMS), etc. The RMI is made up of 29 atolls and 5 islands that includes 24 local government jurisdictions. Of these 24 local governments, there are 22 that are considered to be rural or Outer Islands. The National Strategic Plan (NSP 2020-2030) continues to embrace the One Nation Concept and Ten Goals of Vision 2018 (Annex 5) and integrates these ideas through the five NSP Pillars. The development approach embraces all 24 RMI government jurisdictions as one country, however this does not prevent us from realizing the unique development needs of the rural (Outer Island) jurisdictions. Resilience The NSP 2020-2030 has a definition of resilience relevant to the particular issues of the RMI. Fundamentally, ‘resiliency’ can be defined as the empowerment of individuals to make the most of opportunities and resources available so that families and communities can adapt to changing circumstances, including the environment. This definition articulates why and generally how we should build resilience. The challenges we face, not only from growing climate change and natural disaster hazards, but also from socio-economic factors, require a sharper, cross-cutting, and cascading focus on resilience as a development imperative. Resilience, in all its dimensions, environmental, social, economic, etc., is the overarching strategic foundation priority of this NSP. Adopting a cross-cutting focus on resilience that ensures the security of communities, environments, and economies remains a fundamental focus of all planning and budgeting in the RMI. Building resilience to the effects of climate change and managing and mitigating disasters from natural hazard risks are imperatives for RMI. In the short to medium term, this requires far more investment in several areas including: coastal protection, climate-proofing critical infrastructure; food, water, and health security; early warning systems and disaster risk-reduction measures. Additionally, a focus on fiscal and financial resilience, innovative financing instruments; and the resilience of the private sector must be implemented. The continued vitality of the urban centers of Majuro and Ebeye is dependent on improved resilience and livelihoods of the outer islands and their 15,000 people. Not addressing this ensures the continued migration of the Marshallese people away from their land and culture. Efforts are underway to integrate this focus on building resilience into national policies and plans in all communities. Sectors and thematic plans will further articulate support for building resilience, and organizational level plans will further identify outcomes and actions to support the resilience agenda. 22 Adaptation to Climate Change and Sea Level Rise While sea-level rise is an undeniably real threat for the people who live on islands in the Pacific, the likely impacts of climate change over the next 50 to 100 years are going to have repercussions for the atolls and islands of the Republic of Marshall Islands. Sea level rise combined with more frequent and severe periodic wave surges are likely to create tipping points for tolerability of habitation. This will be made more pronounced in some atolls by coastal erosion and by more frequent and extended droughts and contamination of fresh water lenses. RMI therefore faces the stark choice as a low-lying Pacific island nation: either relocate or find other options. The RMI is considering whether to relocate all 55,000 citizens (making them climate refugees) or to find other feasible options. Understanding these risks atoll by atoll will be necessary to allow adaptation measures for well-being and livelihood (‘business as usual’) measures to be established with local atoll and village groups. This would be done with a view to strengthen resilience, defer the tipping points and provide time to prepare for more extreme measures. The key principles that underpin our approach to climate change adaptation are located in Annex 6. Additional information is found in the National Environment Management Strategy 2017-22. Additionally, RMI continues to call for strong and decisive global action, especially from the larger emitters, to reduce greenhouse gases, the root cause of global warming. Last year, Marshall Islands lawmakers called on the international community to address what they declared to be a “national climate crisis.” Nuclear Justice RMI’s nuclear legacy cuts across nearly every sector of its society, public and private, as it continues to face outstanding issues as a result of the U.S. nuclear weapons testing program from 1946-1958. Efforts to address nuclear justice for its people have been ongoing for decades and the adoption of the 2017 National Nuclear Commission Act and its establishment of a National Nuclear Commission (NNC) reflected a renewed effort to ensure that its nuclear legacy is never forgotten. Nuclear justice will only be achieved when the health of the Marshallese people and their islands is restored; when displaced communities are returned to or compensated for their homelands; when the full range of damages and injuries stemming from the program is acknowledged and compensated by the U.S. Government; when the record of adverse impacts from nuclear weapons testing is preserved for the benefit of humankind, and when every Marshallese citizen understands the activities that took place in his/her islands and their aftermath and feels empowered to use their voice to advocate for the needs of their communities. The National Strategy for Nuclear Justice was adopted in 2019 and addresses five crucial foundations of nuclear justice: 1. Full payment of all past and future awards of the Nuclear Claims Tribunal (Compensation) 2. Quality health care for all Marshallese (Health Care) 3. Reducing the risks of exposure to radiation and other toxins in the environment (Environment) 4. Building national capacity to monitor and understand radiation impacts (National Capacity) 5. Education and awareness of our nuclear legacy (Education and Awareness) 23 NSP 2020-2030 addresses the core areas of the Nuclear Justice Strategy by integrating these issues into the relevant Strategic Areas and Policy Objectives. Human Development Remoteness and small size lead to there being few education facilities in-country and a severe lack of specialised skills. The limited size of the job market means there are limited opportunities for employment. The close relationships and social structures of small island communities often bring challenges in managing employees. Our people are proud of our cultural roots and the government will ensure that it takes advantage of this heritage in all facets of the development process. For this development process to be a success, we must embrace the future and exploit innovations in science and technology to complement our cultural strengths. In the RMI, the rate of adoption and integration of science and technology in socio-economic life is very low and the shortage of technically qualified professionals is visible at all levels. From now until 2030, we should invest in capacity building to have adequate, highly skilled scientists and technicians to satisfy the needs of the national economy. There is a need to generate, disseminate and acquire scientific skills as well as to develop technological innovations. We must integrate these innovations into social and economic development. In order to achieve this objective, we need to develop the teaching of science and technology at secondary and post-secondary levels. We also need to accelerate research and development efforts. These ideas are threaded through the five NSP Pillars. Specific human resources challenges, unique to small island states, and the RMI in particular have been identified. These are detailed in Annex 7. Security Security is a broad term that covers a range of issues, the relative importance of these, are specific to each particular situation. The Pacific Island Forum Secretariat (PIFS) acknowledged the dynamic geopolitical environment that has led to an increasingly crowded and contested region and reaffirmed the need for strengthened collective and cohesive action to effectively manage the regional security environment. At the PIFS meeting in 2018, leaders endorsed the Regional Security Declaration called the BOE Declaration. It identifies six Strategic Focus Areas: climate security, human security and humanitarian assistance, environmental and resource security, transnational crime, cybersecurity/cybercrime and the provision of an enabling environment for implementation. For RMI these are important issues that are captured throughout the five Pillars of the NSP. These issues are addressed in the various Strategic Areas. In the absence of any ‘white’ paper or strategy on security the NSP serves as a “roadmap” in addressing some of the critical issues which were discussed during the NSP consultations. 24 Monitoring & Evaluation Framework The RMI National Strategic Plan is much more than just a document. It was developed through an extensive consultation process and is complemented by a National Monitoring & Evaluation Framework (M&E). The goals and policy objectives are the overarching guide for government planning and budgeting over the next 10 years. Furthermore, the M&E Framework aligns the NSP with our regional and international commitments including the Pacific Regional Framework, the Samoa Pathway, and the Global Sustainable Development Goals. The M&E Framework, forms a second part of the NSP and articulates key performance indicators and targets for monitoring and evaluating progress for the National Policy Objectives as detailed in each Strategic Area. These indicators underpin the twenty-four NSP Goals. The realization of these goals and objectives depends on both government and the people it serves. It requires the active participation of civil society, the private sector, and our international development partners. The goals and policy objectives will be delivered through coordinated and interlinked government planning, budgeting and service delivery. The annual portfolio budgets of line ministries coordinate with the policy objectives for which they are responsible. Ongoing monitoring and evaluation are critical to successful implementation of this plan. All of the policy objectives are linked to specific measurable indicators targets and milestones which are to be detailed in the M&E Framework. Annual review evaluating baselines against the milestones and targets will help to identify, and evaluate progress against the Goals and Policy Objectives. This approach is focused both on ensuring timely and reliable information is available to inform ongoing planning and budgeting, as well as informing annual progress reports on outcomes and impacts. The NSP Annual Development Report will be the principal means of communicating progress for the NSP. The process of data collection and analysis to populate the annual report will need to be further embedded into the regular activities of line ministries. Ministries will be expected to establish the baseline data, to best track progress against the targets and milestones. This will not only inform the annual report, but will also provide essential feedback to the people responsible for making decisions, programming activities, developing budgets and delivering services. The Economic Policy, Planning and Statistics Office (EPPSO) and other key government agencies including the Office of Chief Secretary (OCS) are responsible for overseeing the monitoring and evaluation of the RMI NSP. The necessary information for conducting monitoring and evaluation, and completing the Annual NSP Report, including alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), will form part of the M&E matrices in the M&E Framework. An example of the M&E matrixes is provided as Figure 3. 25 The M&E for NSP will:  Focus on indicators and measure progress against targets and milestones  Use milestones and targets used to determine progress with regard to policy objectives  Focus the level of evaluation on the Goals and Policy Objectives Figure 3: M&E Matrix SOCIAL and CULTURAL GOAL 1 Policy Objectives Indicators Targets Status/Analysis SDGs Policy Objective for each Pillar Indicators to be used for M&E RMI target for 2030  Milestones RMI Target for 2025  Milestones RMI Target for 2023  Milestones Current status of the baseline indicator (this can include where possible current annual budget for the indicator Alignment with SDG Targets and Indicators 26 ANNEX 1: SECTOR STRATEGIES Sector/Thematic Area Title Timeframe Education Education Sector Plan Under development Health Culture National Cultural Policy Under development Gender Youth National Youth Policy Under development Nuclear Nuclear Justice for Marshall Islands 2020–2023 Water and Sanitation Water and Sanitation Strategic Plan 2017–2027 Energy National Energy Policy and Energy Action Plan 2016 ICT National ICT Policy 2012 Electricity RMI Electricity Roadmap 2018 Climate Change National Climate Change Policy Framework Long Term (2050) Climate Strategy 2011 2018 Environment National Environment Management Strategy 2017–2022 Disaster Risk Management JNAP for DRM and CCA 2014–2018 Marine MMRA Strategic Plan 2019–2023 Agriculture Agriculture Strategic Plan Under development Tourism RMI Strategic Tourism Development Plan Under development Infrastructure National Infrastructure Investment Plan RMI National Building Code 2017–2026 2019 ANNEX 2: MINISTRY and AGENCY PLANS Ministry/Agency Main Directional Plan and Coverage Health and Human Services Three year Rolling Plan 2017–2019 Public School System Strategic Plan 2017–2020 National Training Council Strategic Plan 2019–2021 Office of the Auditor General Strategic Plan 2014–2019 Office of Commerce, Investment and Tourism Business Plan 2019–2021 Marshall Islands Police Department Strategic Plan 2019–021 Economic Policy, Planning and Statistics Office Strategic Plan 2019–2021 College of Marshall Islands Education Master Plan 2019–2029 Environment Protection Agency Strategic Plan 2018–2021 Foreign Affairs and Trade Strategic Plan 2017–2023 Finance, Banking and Postal Services Banking Commission Strategic Plan 2019– 2021 Financial Sector Plan under development Natural Resources and Commerce No current plan Climate Change Directorate No current plan Justice, Immigration and Labor No current plan Education, Sports and Training No current plan Transportation, Communication and Information Technology No current plan Works, Infrastructure and Utilities No current plan *Few Ministries and Agencies have current plans, strategies, etc., and even these are not consistently framed. 27 ANNEX 3: PREAMBLE RMI CONSTITUTION AND VISION 2018 DECLARATION Preamble of the RMI Constitution WE, THE PEOPLE OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, trusting in God, the Giver of our life, liberty, identity and our inherent rights, do hereby exercise these rights and establish for ourselves and generations to come this Constitution, setting forth the legitimate legal framework for the governance of the Republic. We have reason to be proud of our forefathers who boldly ventured across the unknown waters of the vast Pacific Ocean many centuries ago, ably responding to the constant challenges of maintaining a bare existence on these tiny islands, in their noble quest to build their own distinctive society. This society has survived, and has withstood the test of time, the impact of other cultures, the devastation of war, and the high price paid for the purposes of international peace and security. All we have and are today as a people, we have received as a sacred heritage which we pledge ourselves to safeguard and maintain, valuing nothing more dearly than our rightful home on the islands within the traditional boundaries of this archipelago. With this Constitution, we affirm our desire and right to live in peace and harmony, subscribing to the principles of democracy, sharing the aspirations of all other peoples for a free and peaceful world, and striving to do all we can to assist in achieving this goal. We extend to other peoples what we profoundly seek from them: peace, friendship mutual understanding, and respect for our individual idealism and our common humanity. Declaration to the Marshallese (Vision 2018) To become a country in an inter-dependent world, with an enhanced socio-economic reliance (and) an educated, healthy, productive, law-abiding and God-loving people in which individual freedom and fundamental human rights are protected and culture and traditions are respected, and development and environmental sustainability are in harmony. 28 ANNEX 4: RMI SITUATION ANALYSIS INFORMATION According to a recent (2017) WB analytical exercise, Pacific Possible11, relative to a baseline ‘business-as- usual’ scenario, there appears only modest opportunities for the RMI to realize additional economic growth, employment or public revenue generation from the four sectors that were identified as providing the greatest potential opportunity to foster shared prosperity in the region, namely: tourism; access to international labor markets – in addition to the RMI’s existing open access to the United States (U.S.) labor market as part of the Compact of Free Association; information and communication technologies (ICT); and fisheries. RMI’s population totals around 54,000, of which 28,000 (53 percent) reside in Majuro (the country’s capital) and 10,000 (18 percent) in Ebeye. Urbanization and crowding have intensified over the past 30 years, with migration from the outer islands to the urban centers of Majuro and Ebeye primarily due to: (i) a lack of employment opportunities in other locations; and (ii) greater reliance on the cash economy as compared to a subsistence lifestyle. Between 1962 and 1991 the RMI’s population increased by an average of 4 percent per year but has remained relatively stable since then, as the combination of declining real incomes and rising costs of living has resulted in significant outmigration as Marshallese citizens seek better jobs and educational opportunities abroad, mainly in Hawaii, the U.S. mainland and Guam. According to the WB Report, hardship is experienced by 51 percent of the RMI population. Inequality between populations in the urban centers and the outer islands is exacerbated by high transport costs and limited access and poor quality of public goods and services in remote areas, while increased crowding in Ebeye and Majuro has also increased inequality in the urban centers. Furthermore, recent poverty assessments have found that informal safety nets are weakening as increased urbanization, westernization and aid dependence have undermined traditional customs and values. As a result of the combination of small population size, extreme remoteness and dispersion, and environmental fragility, the challenges faced by the RMI are more pronounced and the economic opportunities more limited than those of most other remote regions in the world. The RMI’s economic geography increases transport cost and limits economies of scale which – combined with the RMI’s relatively limited natural resources – result in a narrow production base, constrain the opportunities for exports and make the economy highly dependent on imports. Consequently, the economy is dominated by the public sector, which accounts for around 40 percent of GDP and half of formal-sector employment, while private sector activity focuses on fisheries, retail services, copra and tourism. State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) dominate key sectors of the economy, with transfers to support their continued operational losses having expanded from an average of 4 percent of GDP over the decade from 2005–2014, to an estimated more than 9 percent of GDP in 2019. In terms of the external accounts, most foodstuffs (excluding local foods, such as fish, coconuts and some fruits), fuel, building materials, clothing and manufactured products are imported, while exports are limited to fish and copra products. The nation is thus highly exposed to fluctuations in international food and fuel prices. A large and persistent trade deficit is financed by substantial inflows of foreign assistance – on which the country’s fiscal framework relies – and more recently by increasing government revenues from fishing vessels with access to Marshallese waters. 11 Pacific Possible…. 29 According to the UN Human Development Report 201912, Marshall Islands’ HDI value for 2018 is 0.698— which put the country in the medium human development category—positioning it at 117 out of 189 countries and territories. Between 2017 and 2018, Marshall Islands’ HDI value increased from 0.696 to 0.698, an increase of 0.2 percent. Between 1990 and 2018, Marshall Islands’ life expectancy at birth increased by 11.5 years, mean years of schooling increased by 0.1 years and expected years of schooling remained constant. Marshall Islands’ GNI per capita increased by about 24.0 percent between 1990 and 2018. ANNEX 5: VISION 2018 ONE NATION CONCEPT Vision 2018 states the following: We believe that through the adoption of Outer Island Development as a key component of our sustainable development strategy, we would be able to achieve these results. Vision 2018 has identified several key areas of focus with regard to the formulation of strategies for Outer Island Development. These are:  Devolution and de-concentration of political and administrative functions  Infrastructure and maintenance development  Development of productive resources  Human resource development It sets forth ten goals which illustrate the one-nation concept of development that the RMI continues to embrace: 1. Operating in an Interdependent World 2. Enhanced Socio-Economic Self Reliance 3. An Educated People 4. A Healthy People 5. A Productive People 6. A Law-abiding People 7. A God Loving People 8. Respecting Individual Freedom and Fundamental Human Rights 9. Respecting Culture and Traditions 10. Environmental Sustainability ANNEX 6: RMI CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION PRINCIPLES For Marshall Islands, key principles that underpin that country’s approach to adaptation, are: 1. Right to remain: citizens of RMI have a natural right to remain in their homelands and this right should be protected; 2. Resilience imperative: resilience must be a fundamental focus across all sectors and areas of atoll development; building resilience to climate and disaster risks is an imperative given the high and unique vulnerability of atolls; 3. Integrated adaptation: climate change is complex and multidimensional, therefore efforts to adapt must be multidimensional and integrated, considering both the physical and non-physical; 12 Ibid (footnote 9) 30 4. Knowledge first: RMI would follow a knowledge first principle, using science and evidence-based decision making and identifying key knowledge gaps; 5. Adaptive capacity: adaptive capacity needs to be strengthened to improve the ability to respond to changing circumstances; as conditions are likely to deteriorate, atoll nations will need to be dynamic in their ability to adapt; 6. Consensus and inclusion: adaptation should go hand-in-hand with consultation and consensus building, so that the views of all stakeholders are taken into account; and 7. Technology and tradition: adaptation approaches should embrace innovation and modern technology as well as traditional knowledge. ANNEX 7: HUMAN RESOURCE CHALLENGES 1. Specific challenges identified for human resource development in Small Island States: 2. Small pool of qualified, skilled people available in the labour market—as a result of being a small country with a relatively low level of education. 3. Critical person risk – as a result of the small and shallow pool, there is critical person risk of individuals who hold exceptional institutional knowledge. If these people were to move on, critical functions would not be fulfilled. 4. Proliferation of projects – in the last decade there has been a proliferation of development partners and projects, resulting in very high demands on the time and attention of key personnel. These demands take the form of administrative requirements, hosting missions, negotiations with development partners and travel to off-island meetings and training courses. This impacts heavily on the capacity of the small professional-level workforce and creates a sense of fatigue. 5. Ad hoc training courses and meetings for RMI representatives are offered by development partners. This is not coordinated between development partners, often key people are away for too much time. Short training courses offered either internationally or in-country offer no follow up or embedding of learnings. Training is often poorly targeted, lacking context and too short to have lasting impact. 6. Scholarships are often not targeted to workforce needs—there is no systematic linkage of scholarships and training programs with the strategic workforce needs of the country in many areas, especially the science, engineering and technology. 7. Out migration/ brain drain – many of those who gain qualifications overseas will be attracted to the higher salaries, the lifestyle and the professional culture in the US or in other countries. A significant gap in recruitment of professionals is that there is no direct connection between individual agencies and the students studying overseas to allow recruitment of Marshallese nationals into professional positions. Of obvious concern is the loss of young educated Marshallese people who either choose not to return to the Marshall Islands upon completion of their studies, or else who leave after working there for a short time. 8. Poor recruitment and performance management processes—rarely are the human resource needs of an organisation systematically identified and recruitment of new staff is often done without a clear job description. Additionally, employee performance management systems within the public sector are 31 inadequate in terms of setting expectations, performing fair and professional performance evaluations and positive or negative consequences for performance. 9. Low participation of women in the sector—particularly the case in the sciences, technical and engineering fields.",

What kind of society do we want to become? How can   we maintain and enhance a united and inclusive Marshallese identity? What are the transformations   needed to improve our social and economic situation? How can we ensure sustainable development   in the face of the growing concerns for the survival of the country from the existential threat of   climate change and sea level rise, in addition to the unresolved nuclear legacy we continue to endure?       These are some of the main issues The National Strategic Plan (NSP) 2020–2030 addresses.          This NSP is a result of a national consultative process among government ministries and agencies,   non-governmental organizations (NGOs) the private sector and all relevant stakeholders, and   provides a broad consensus on the necessity for Marshallese to clearly define the future of the   country. The process provided the basis upon which this NSP: its Vision, Objectives, Context and   Strategies were developed.        The NSP is designed as a framework to coordinate the articulated long-term development goals and   objectives of the RMI government at the national level.  The NSP will be used by government leaders   as the Roadmap for development and progress in the long-term (2020–2030) and will be   continually updated for use in meeting longer term objectives as the RMI moves forward with   meeting national priorities and development objectives.       The NSP will enable RMI government leaders to articulate the direction of priorities over the coming   decade, and can now clearly outline the chronological pathway for implementation of national   priorities.           2     COUNTRY PROFILE   Independence   : 21 October 1986    UN/ESCAP Membership : 31 July 1991    Capital    : Majuro (7N 171E)    Geographical Location  : Central-North Pacific    Constitution   : Mixed Parliamentary and Presidential System    Parliament    : Unicameral, 33 members elected every four years    Official Languages  : Marshallese and English    Land Area   : 180 square kilometers (70 square miles)    Exclusive Economic Zone :  2.1 million square kilometers (1.3 million square miles)    Population   :  54,705 (2019)1    GNI per Capita   :  $4,860 (Atlas method, current US$ as of 2018)2     GDP    : $201.7 million (in FY2015 constant prices)3     Annual Average GDP Growth : 3.0% (FY2016-2018)4    GDP by Institutional Sector : Public Sector 43.6%, Private Sector 31.4%, Others 25%5     Labor Force   : Total 13,060, Male 8,458, Female 4,6026    Labor Force Participate Rate : Total 41.7%, Male 53.6%, Females 29.7%7    Life Expectancy at Birth : Male 71.3, Female 72.58    Human Development Index : 0.698 (ranked 117 of 189 countries)9                                                                 1 Based on Office of the Chief Secretary analysis, Republic of the Marshall Islands Population: Historical Review and Projections to   2027.

Past planning documents used to provide direction for this current plan include:     First Five-Year Economic Development Plan: 1986−1991     Second Five-Year Economic Development Plan: 1992−1996     Public Sector Investment Program: 1997     National Sustainable Development Strategy 2000     Vision 2018: Strategic Development Plan Framework 2003−2018    National Strategic Plan 2015-2017   The RMI Cabinet, on May 29, 2019, adopted the RMI National Planning Framework (C.M. 123 (2019)10,   and reaffirmed the NSP as the apex planning document with a high-level strategic focus addressing all   developmental activity both public and private, including external projects. The Planning Framework   establishes a framework for sector and thematic level planning contributing to the alignment of all planning   and budgeting with the NSP including the implementation of Three-Year Rolling Planning and Budgeting at   the Ministry Level.      NSP Critical Design Features    The NSP 2020-2030 includes the following key design components:       Spans a 10-year timeframe    Sets the national vision and long-term development goals    Identifies Sector Over-Arching Goals     Specifies the Sectors, Strategic Areas and related Policy Objectives    Provides a guide for the allocation of budget resources through the MTBIF and annual budget   appropriations.      Further, that ‘resilience’, in all its dimensions including, environmental, social, economic resilience, would   be the foundation of the NSP. The NSP contains references to building resilience, as a development necessity.   There is a recognition that challenges faced by RMI are not just from climate change and natural disaster   hazards but also from socio-economic factors.       The cascading design of NSP 2020-2030 highlights that national priorities must align with sector strategies   and further into organizational plans at the operational level.  This is critical to the success of realizing the   Goals and Policy Objectives of the NSP.      The NSP 2020–2030 is defined around 5 Pillars, comprised of 24 Strategic Areas in total. Each Strategic   Area includes its own Over-Arching Goal and related Policy Objectives, as detailed n Figure 1 below.                                                                        10 RMI (Confidential) C.M. 123 (2019) National Planning Framework, May 29, 2019        4        The planning process, illustrated in Figure 2 below, shows the link between the NSP, Sector/Thematic   Strategies, Ministry/Organizational Work-plans and budgets and the Medium-Term Budget and Investment   Framework (MTBIF).

As   such, it is founded on the attributes of self-reliance, mutual respect, tolerance and integrity in line with   constitutional obligations and international promises.  The Vision Statement encompasses, in summary, the   priorities and aspirations of the ongoing efforts at development in the RMI.                     The NSP Vision is founded on the Constitution of the Marshall Islands and the Vision 2018 “Declaration to   the Marshallese.” Annex 3 includes the Preamble to the RMI Constitution and the Vision 2018 Declaration   to the Marshallese People.   NSP OBJECTIVE                        Our people and culture are the source of inspiration for the priorities of the NSP. Through successful   implementation, the NSP moves Marshallese society so that all citizens achieve their potential through   opportunities provided by the promise of sustainable development.    This objective empowers all citizens with both responsibility and opportunity, and provides for every citizen   the opportunity to enjoy improved quality of life in all areas including health, education, energy, food   security, law and order, gender equality, employment opportunities and disaster mitigation. Furthermore,   this empowerment is more deeply broadened by embracing our culture as a unifying force for sustainable   development.        NSP OBJECTIVE   Sustainable, Equitable and Measurable Development    Reflecting the Priorities and Culture of the Marshallese People      NSP VISION STATEMENT   “Kallib Bwe Kwon AKEO”     Komelele 1: Jerbal ko ad rej monakaj𝒂 ne Ilju eo ad.  Komelele 2: Eltan Peid enaaj lamlame ilju eo ad.       In our own hands is our future.        6     NSP CONTEXT   The NSP National Context is based on the ideas of Social and Economic Empowerment, Resilience, Adaptation   to Climate Change, Security and Human Development. As one of the only four atoll countries in the world, we   face threats to our existence and national survival from a variety of issues including the impacts of climate   change and sea level rise. The issue of the RMI’s nuclear past and its continuing legacy strikes a sensitive   chord in our society. The NSP, takes cognizance of these issues and growing challenges in trying to chart out   a development path for the country and our people.   Shaping the Context   This sub-section provides a snapshot of the issues that shape the context of this NSP.  Additional background   information is located in Annex 4.   Geography presents challenges for development: Our country will forever remain small and isolated,   making transport and trade with major markets costly. While communication with the outside world has   also been historically costly and inconsistent, the investment in submarine fiber optic cable in 2010   dramatically improved connectivity with the rest of the world. It is imperative that improvements continue   in the domestic telecommunication and information technology services. As a low-lying atoll nation   vulnerable to the damaging effects of climate change and natural disasters, with sea-level rise posing a direct   threat to our very existence makes the development of a competitive, productive economy all the more   challenging.    Geography also provides real opportunities: Our strategic location in the central Pacific, large ocean area,   and natural resources provide excellent platforms for a better economy for the people.    High reliance on external resources and imports:  Reflecting our isolation and narrow resource base, the   economy remains highly dependent on international support, mostly in the forms of grants, which has been   equivalent to 35 percent of GDP over the past decade. Approximately half of our annual budget is funded   from external sources. Additionally, as a small island economy with a narrow resource base, access to   international markets is crucial. The RMI consistently imports much more than it exports, relying on   imported supplies for food, consumer goods, machinery, and petroleum products with limited scope to   produce much of these commodities locally.    Rural-urban disparities continue to exist: This is the case in both the urban centers and outer islands, and   there is a clear trend of urban migration, with Majuro and Kwajalein atolls now home to three-fourths of our   population. The economies of the outer island communities have not fundamentally changed over the past   century, with these communities relying mostly on copra and handicraft production and limited commercial   fisheries and farming activities for their livelihoods. Subsistence fishing and farming remain mainstays of   daily life.    Urban economies remain non-diversified. The urban economies in Majuro and Kwajalein rely heavily on   government bureaucracy and the Kwajalein missile base for employment and income. These economies are   dominated by the wholesale and retail trade, construction, banking and insurance, and commercial fisheries   operations.        7     Human capital remains underdeveloped: At the heart of all development is human development, and at   the heart of human development is early childhood and maternal health, nutrition, and care. While RMI’s   broad human development indicators such as infant and child mortality rates and educational attainment   have steadily improved since independence, the overall progress in building human capital can still be   improved. We need to redouble efforts to ensure that every child born in the RMI is provided the proper   health, nutrition, and care especially in the first 1,000 days of life and that educational opportunities are   accessible to all. Such an investment will have a greater impact on long term social, economic, and   development prospects.   1. SOCIAL AND CULTURE PILLAR    The Pillar consists of four Strategic Areas:   1. Health   2. Education and Training   3. Social Justice and Inclusion    4. Culture and Traditional Knowledge      The resilience of the people of any country is a measure of their true social capital and wealth. Enhancing the   health, education and quality of life of all people, is central to building a fair and progressive nation.       Pillar Over-Arching Objective   Healthy, Peaceful and Inclusive Societies for Sustainable Development   1.1 Strategic Area: Health    GOAL: Healthy Lives and Well-being for All Ages   Policy Objectives  1) Strengthened response to non-communicable diseases, including nutrition, mental health, and injuries   2) Improved maternal, infant, child and adolescent health   3) Strengthened response and resilience to communicable disease, environmental health, and health   emergency preparedness   4) Strengthened planning, management and administration of Human and Financial resources   5) Provision of quality health care infrastructure, especially cancer care, for all Marshallese   6) Strengthened outer island health services   7) Address issues of climate change and human health   The goals of the Ministry of Health and Human Services underscore the theme that “Kumiti Ejmour” or Health   is a shared responsibility. The “kumit” lifestyle is one where every Marshallese supports one another in every   effort to improve healthy lifestyles now and in the years to come.       Additionally, the ‘Healthy Islands’ concept has remained an inspiration for RMI and the Pacific.  We remain   committed to applying a Healthy Islands focus for health policies.  This concept has played a significant role   in energizing the approach to Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs). It has framed the approach health   leaders have taken to engaging with other sectors, and framed the largely successful efforts in support of   bringing global attention to the ongoing NCD epidemic. There is widespread consensus that the Healthy        8     Islands concept is strong and helpful and it should be maintained and supported.  The breadth of this concept   is only now being realized, with its weave of health, environmental, and Pacific cultural concepts.    The RMI continues to witness a surge in NCDs and vector borne diseases including Dengue fever, Zika virus   and Chikungunya. The introduction of COVID 19 in late 2019 prompted government planning and   preparedness response.  With the infectious nature of the COVID 19 virus, and with no current vaccine, this   vector borne disease may continue to be part of RMI’s Health Sector planning for at least the medium-term   future.  Overall, for vector- borne diseases, whether projections are positive or negative depends on the   disease, region and extent of change.    1.2 Education and Training    GOAL: Inclusive and Equitable Education and Lifelong Learning Opportunities for All     Policy Objectives  1) Improved early childhood development   2) Increased learning and student achievement in primary and secondary schools   3) Enhanced post-secondary and continuing education opportunities that provide in-country access to obtain   qualifications such as certificates, diplomas, undergraduate and postgraduate degrees   4) Enhanced skills and attributes necessary for a dynamic workforce and resilient economy  5) Ensure schools are well equipped with facilities, resources and quality teachers to foster a more effective   learning environment   6) Incorporate sports as an important component of the school system.   7) Address TVET and Workforce Development issues through the NTC, and STEM program      Education and training are a shared responsibility that requires the collective and whole-hearted effort of   schools, higher education institutions, national and local governments, communities, parents and civil   society organizations.    Yearly assessment of results has remained static for multiple years despite reforms and the re-crafting of   Education curriculums. Outer island schools continually face a shortage of qualified teachers. There is   support for the integration of technical and vocational education in the Education Sector Plan (ESP),   recognizing that skills training and career planning should begin during primary and secondary years and   continue through the provision of life-long training and re-training options for adults.    The ESP, currently under development, aims to provide the Public School System (PSS) a workable road map   toward constructing and implementing an educational system that recognizes the unique challenges and   visions of our people. The plan recognizes the desire for a curriculum that is culturally appropriate and   focused on implementation strategies that will improve all students’ lives.    The ESP stresses the importance of adopting a standardized and internationally recognized TVET   accreditation system.  This will enable students to better access further training and secure employment at   home and abroad and will focus on expanding educational opportunities for students.         9     1.3 Social Justice and Inclusion   GOAL:  Equality, Justice, and Empowerment for All   Policy Objectives   1) Improve access to justice for RMI’s vulnerable populations    2) Ensure provisions and opportunities for equitable participation of all persons in society   3) Build social empowerment strategies into nationwide frameworks    4) Strengthen actions for accessing restitution for those most affected by the RMI’s nuclear legacy      Justice, fairness, and equity are at the heart of any democratic society. There is increasing awareness about   issues such as gender, disability and the more vulnerable in society.  The Policy Objectives detailed in this   Strategic Area focus on being inclusive and providing opportunities for all.    1.4 Culture and Traditional Knowledge   GOAL: Integrate Marshallese Culture, Customary Law and   Traditional Practices in all Facets of Development   Policy Objectives  1) Undertake preservation of traditional knowledge-natural resources and historical sites (men ko bwinnir).   2) Maintain and preserve native Marshallese language.   3) Promote cultural industry- amimono (trademark).   4) Maintain traditional consumption and production of food and medicine.   In the face of rapid globalization, it is more challenging for people around the world to maintain and pass on   traditions and cultures.  As the Marshall Islands, like much of the world, becomes more of a melting pot, cultural   preservation of language, knowledge, values and customs becomes increasingly more difficult.        The RMI National Cultural Policy and Strategies underscores the need for the safe upkeep and management of   culture.    Preservation of RMI’s history, historical places and arts are critical for social, education and economic   reasons.  Strengthening language is a necessary building block for common understanding, expression and   identity.  This policy also emphasizes that the RMI cultural identity needs to be better promoted for the   economic benefit of our indigenous Marshallese society.   2.  ENVIRONMENT CLIMATE CHANGE AND RESILIENCY PILLAR   The Pillar consists of four Strategic Areas:   1. Atoll Environment  2. Climate Change  3. Disaster Risk Management  4. Radiation Contamination     Building resilience of our people and ecosystems is necessary for sustainable development. Protecting our   natural capital and strengthening our human capital is essential for meeting our national development   objectives and ensuring the sustainability of economic growth regardless of the environmental impacts we may   face in the future.        10       Pillar Over-Arching Objective   Enhance Resilience of RMI and its Environmental Assets to the Impacts of    Climate Change and Natural Disasters and its Environmental Assets through    National, Regional and International Efforts   The Goal focuses on adaptation and resilience to the looming threat of climate change, as well as natural   disasters that can potentially impact development.     The Policy Objectives in this Pillar entail greater climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts.  These efforts   focus on increased renewable energy generation, increasing green investments, protecting biodiversity,   improving waste management and mainstreaming climate change and environmental consideration into   frameworks, policies and plans.   2.1 Atoll Environment   GOAL: Protection, Management and Sustainable use of RMI’s Atoll Environment Resources   Policy Objectives  1) Improved protection, conservation and sustainability of atoll environment and natural resources   2) Strengthened management of waste, chemicals, pollutants and nuclear radiation   3) Meet obligations to relevant national, regional and international treaties, agreements and frameworks   Protecting our natural environment is essential to ensuring well-being and development that will be enjoyed   by present and future generations.     2.2 Climate Change   GOAL: Holistic Response to Climate Change for Sustainable Social,   Economic Development and Well-Being of RMI and its People   Policy Objectives  1) Adaptation and resilience actions to current and future impacts of climate change   2) Mitigation of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions in pursuance of RMI's NDC targets and pathway to net zero   emissions by 2050   3) Strong advocacy, diplomacy and regional/global leadership to enhance urgent global climate action   4) Strengthened security and survival of RMI to the existential threats of climate change   5) Continued national advocacy, awareness and education on climate change and resilience building.   6) Increased climate finances to enable necessary response to climate change impacts on RMI's socio-economic   development   A holistic response requires a strengthened coordination and decision making across all stakeholders   including government, private sector, NGOs and civil society.  Additionally, we will mainstream climate-  related risks into planning and budgeting at all levels and in all relevant sectors.  We must ensure relevant   organizations are adequately resourced and avenues for sustainable financing are secured.        11     2.3 Disaster Risk Management (DRM)   GOAL: RMI Manages Disaster Risk for the Current and   Future Well-Being of the Marshallese People     Policy Objectives  1) Enhanced resilience to disasters and risks   2) Strengthened disaster preparedness, response and recovery   3) Greater coordination, nationally and internationally on DRM efforts   Improved national and local capacity to undertake vulnerability and adaptation assessments and planning   is critical for disaster risk management. Additionally, we need to ensure all stakeholders are integrated into   the planning and implementation of disaster risk and adaptation as needed.  An example of disaster risk   management could be the design of an updated building code for disaster and climate-proofing, backed by   appropriate legislation.     2.4 Radiation Contamination   GOAL: Marshallese have the Capacity to Monitor, Understand, and Respond to the Incidence of  Radiation Contamination for the Current and Future Well-Being of the Marshallese People   Policy Objectives  1) Undertake environmental surveys focused on radiation monitoring, including data analysis and   interpretation   2) Establish the necessary legal and policy frameworks to minimise future risks from radiation   3) The necessary policies, regulations, strategies or plans are available for the detection, assessment, response   and recovery after radiation emergencies   4) Upskill people on nuclear technology used for peaceful purposes   5) Enhance capacity of stakeholders and community to manage radiation contamination   There is ongoing concern about the impacts of lingering radiation in the environment on the health of   communities and local food sources in the RMI. It is important that there is a plan to monitor the levels of   radiation in our environment, especially the marine environment which is the lifeline for our people. Some   potential dangers have been exposed through recent disclosures about the low-level radioactive waste facility   on Runit Island (Enewetak Atoll), due to sea level rise and increased tidal fluctuations as a result of climate   change. Lingering radiation on other atolls continues to prevent safe habitation of those islands and needs to   be addressed.   We now face the compounded risk from the nuclear testing impacts and climate change. Both risks require   support from the international community. These two threats present challenges both in the present and the   future, requiring a multi-dimensional response. As a result, our development focus includes the current and   potential impacts of these threats to our resilience and basic survival.         12     3.  INFRASTRUCTURE PILLAR   The Pillar consists of six Strategic Areas:  1. Transportation (air, land, sea)  2. Energy  3. Water and Sanitation  4. Waste Management  5. Communications  6. Public Facilities     Pillar Over-Arching Objective   Provide Efficient, Effective, Resilient, Sustainable and Affordable Services and    Facilities that Promote Sustainable Economic Growth   Any infrastructure development must ensure healthy ecosystems are maintained and that scarce resources   such as water are protected.  Infrastructure development must also focus on reducing exposure to damage   from natural hazards such as coastal inundation, flooding, erosion and contamination from ineffective   sanitation and waste disposal.       Infrastructure gaps remain significant. Without a dramatic increase in infrastructure investment, from a variety   of financing sources, lack of infrastructure will continue to hamper our ability to achieve and sustain the rates   of growth necessary for economic sustainability.       We remain among those countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change and related natural   disasters. However, addressing our nation’s need for infrastructure in the short term must not come at the   expense of future generations.  In line with the Tile Til Eo (Long-term strategy), we will embark on a low-  carbon, blue-green economy development trajectory that emphasizes efficient use of natural resources.     3.1 Transportation     GOAL: Sound and Efficient Transport Infrastructure that   Supports Social and Economic Development   Policy Objectives  1. Efficient and reliable air and sea connectivity to the outer islands and the world   2. Compliance with all applicable (international) maritime and civil aviation safety standards for the ports   3. Reliable roads for efficient movement of people and goods and services   Providing efficient and effective transportation facilities to connect our atolls and linking us to international   markets is challenging. This reflects both the inherent cost of providing low-volume services to remote places,   and the market structure where insufficient competition amongst a small number of service providers inflates   costs.       The current high costs and low frequencies undermine the viability of investment opportunities and remain a   significant concern. Improvements in transportation are crucial to addressing the geographic factors that make   economic development so challenging especially when it comes to ensuring that the positive impacts are   realized outside of the urban centers.           13     Given our location and distance from trading partners, efficient and affordable air and sea transport is vital. Air   connectivity is currently limited to two international airlines and one domestic carrier. The cost of air travel to   and from Majuro is a major contributor to the cost of local goods and services and an inhibitor for tourism and   trade. Sea transport is vital for the greater connectivity to the outside world as well as between the outer   islands.    3.2 Energy   GOAL:  Clean, Reliable, Affordable, Accessible, Resilient and Sustainable   Energy Services for Economic Development   Policy Objectives  1) Improved enabling frameworks for reducing dependence on imported fossil fuel for electricity generation   2) Increased energy efficiency in households, businesses, government, transport and other sectors   3) Reliable, sustainable and affordable energy supply     Our Electricity Roadmap provides a strategic framework to enable us to meet our climate change targets and   to strengthen our role as a climate leader. This roadmap will allow the RMI and our development partners   to work together to achieve a common vision for the RMI electricity sector.   Over the last 15 years, progress has been made to develop renewable energy. Almost all households on the   outer islands, previously without electricity supply, now have solar home systems, and several larger solar   projects totaling around 1 megawatt (MW) have been built on Majuro.   3.3 Water and Sanitation   GOAL: Access to Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation Systems for the   Economic, Social Development and Well-Being of all Marshallese   Policy Objectives  1) Effective management of fresh water resources   2) Constant access to drinking water that meets World Health Organization standards   3) Improved sanitation for better health and well-being   4) Comprehensive management of waste water   5) Management of urban drainage and surface waters for safe public exposure   The Water and Sanitation Strategic Plan (2017-2027) establishing the most appropriate water and sanitation   services for Majuro Atoll over the next 20 years has been developed. It is part of the first phase of a Capital   Improvement Program by Majuro Water and Sewer Company (MWSC) to improve water and sanitation   services to Majuro Atoll. Additionally, there is ongoing improvement work on Ebeye regarding water and   sanitation.        14     3.4 Waste Management   GOAL: Establish Reliable Infrastructure for Effective   Management of Waste, Chemicals and Pollutants   Policy Objectives  1) Enhance accessible community collection services   2) Assess and promote sustainable and sanitary landfill applications and operation   3) Promote local recycling   4) Carry out appropriate incineration for medical waste and waste to energy conversion   5) Explore effective facilities and schemes to promote facilities and processes   Waste disposal remains a critical issue, especially in the urban centers. The current dump site in Majuro has   not only become an eyesore but a major hazard. The possible strategies for the next 10 years, which focus on   sustainable disposal, processing, including waste to energy, and waste export are potential options for action.     3.5 Information and Communication Technology   GOAL: Modern, Efficient, Resilient and Affordable Telecommunications   Network and Services for Greater Social and Economic Prosperity   Policy Objectives  1) Strengthen legal and regulatory framework   2) Provide resilient platforms for efficient and affordable connectivity   3) Improve outer island connectivity   4) Revise ICT Policy 2012 and existing telecom laws and regulations for greater relevance to current setting   Geographical features and population dispersion present significant challenges for the provision of affordable   telecommunications services. The importance of modern mobile technological solutions for increased and   improved connectivity to the outside world and the outer islands cannot be over emphasized.   3.6 Public Facilities   GOAL: Sound, Resilient, Efficient Public Facilities for   Sustainable Social and Economic Development and Well-Being   Policy Objectives  1) Strategic and resilient infrastructure planning and investment   2) Well-designed, built and maintained public facilities (roads, runways, buildings, amenities, schools,   dispensaries, seawalls etc.)   3) Raise building standards through implementation of a Building Code   Strategic infrastructure planning that takes into consideration social, environmental and economic costs.   Analysis will need to be completed to ensure we can reap the greatest possible benefit from infrastructure   development. Planning will help us to avoid the negative impact of poorly planned infrastructure such as   coastal erosion, pollution and other negative impacts. Building an effective, integrated, maintained and   sustainable infrastructure, including public facilities is needed to improve overall infrastructure resilience in   the Marshall Islands We will integrate climate-sensitive approaches to existing laws and planning processes,        15     such as building codes.  We will work with individuals and communities at all levels to improve natural   resource management and mitigate, the impacts of climate change and other environmental hazards.   4. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PILLAR   The Pillar consists of five Strategic Areas:   1. Land   2. Agriculture   3. Marine Resources   4. Trade, Investment and Tourism   5. Financial Sector and Services      Pillar Over-Arching Objective   To Achieve an Economy that Underpins a Resilient, Productive, and Self-Supportive Nation   Supported by Implemented Legislation, Policies, and Conditions for an Inclusive and Sustainable   Economic Growth, that will help Mobilize Investment both Domestic and Foreign to Create   Decent Jobs, Drive Greater Productivity and Promote Better Living Standards   Our vision is an economy that underpins a resilient, productive, and self-supportive nation. This will require   efforts across a range of sectoral and cross-sectoral policy areas, planning and coordination. There is a need to   identify a set of coherent, complementary policies and investments on the part of Government that will help to   create the right conditions for an inclusive and sustainable economy An underlying aim is the need to create   the right conditions to mobilize private investment, both domestic and foreign, so that high priority areas   including the creation of decent jobs, driving greater productivity and better living standards can be realized.      The five Strategic Areas in this pillar are important for catalyzing economic growth and unlocking the potential   for greater trade and investment.   4.1 Land   GOAL: Enhance Access to Land   Policy Objectives  1) Greater opportunities to utilize land for economic growth   2) Promote greater awareness of land rights and opportunities through awareness and partnership      Access to land remains a longstanding underlying challenge to both investment and development. One solution   would be to design innovative long-term land leases and include provisions for timely and updated information   on available land for investments.       There is a need to streamline processes and regulations for land registration, allowing for more efficient use of   properties and facilitate improved access to credit by allowing land to be used as collateral. This needs to be   done in a culturally appropriate manner which requires new approaches and extensive consultation between   landowners, the private sector and the policymakers. The provision of strategic infrastructure assets, access   and retention of land resources, at reasonable costs and with secure tenure, will be pursued for the benefit of   all Marshallese.        16     4.2 Agriculture   GOAL: Enhancing Agricultural Development   Policy Objectives   1) Improve production, supply and distribution of nutritious food   2) Promote environmental sustainability   3) Enhance capacity of agriculture sector stakeholders   4) Develop enabling policies and legislation.      Agricultural production (excluding fisheries) represents a relatively small proportion of the RMI economy   (around 4% of GDP), but is a critical source of livelihoods especially on the outer islands. There is some   underutilized land which offers potential for increased output of agricultural food crops, but this is limited, and   soil conditions are generally poor. The principal commercial crops are coconuts and breadfruit.       Our people have been involved in copra production since the 1850s and the atolls are widely planted with   coconut trees, however, copra currently accounts for only about 1% of GDP. Nevertheless, the coconut is still   considered the “tree of life” with high potential to produce multiple valuable products both for food security   and income generation. Consequently, the value chain of copra and coconut plantations rehabilitation and   replanting continue to be championed as key pathways to promote economic development and income   generation.        Copra processing is done primarily through the Tobolar Copra Processing Authority, a State-Owned Enterprise   (SOE).  Tobolar guarantees the purchase of all coconuts harvested in the RMI and is responsible for collecting,   transporting and processing the raw material, paying farmers for their produce, and selling the final products.       An issue to be addressed is the government subsidy for Tobolar. This reliance on government subsidies leads   to inefficiencies which have led to negative economic repercussions for the copra processing industry. The   economic viability of Tobolar is an issue to be addressed at both the national and sector levels. There are   opportunities for growth in the sector, and this needs to be explored for both food security and commercial   production.      4.3 Marine Resources   GOAL: Sustainable and Responsible use of Marine Resources   Policy Objectives   1) Maximize the long-term value from its fisheries for the benefit of the economy and people of RMI    2) Conserve and manage the aquatic resources for current and future generations.   3) Enhance professionalism, transparency and accountability in the management of fisheries resources.   4) Maximise income and livelihood opportunities through sustainable coastal fisheries      Fisheries are the most commercially valuable natural resource in the RMI. Fees for commercial fishing have   become one of the largest sources of government revenue. There is a need to continue efforts to maximize   fishing revenues in a way that considers the sustainability of fisheries and the needs of fishing companies and   investors. RMI will pursue opportunities for:    Further private sector development and investment in fisheries-related activities        17      Public policy initiatives to stimulate increased economic activity via incentives to encourage greater   transshipment, onshore fish processing and vessel support services, in particular     The ongoing maturing of the regional structures that govern oceanic fisheries royalties, including the   Parties to the Nauru Agreement’s (PNA) Purse Seine and Longline Vessel Day Scheme.   4.4 Trade, Investment and Tourism   GOAL:  Local Economic and Employment Growth   Policy Objectives    1) Increase import substitution and production and export of locally manufactured goods    2) Establish more sustainable and eco-friendly tourism   3) Promote fair and friendly business environment    4) Promote MSMEs and women entrepreneurs   5) Promote partnerships among public-private and Civil Society Organizations   6) Enhancement and protection of consumer interests and rights      We in the RMI are blessed with great natural beauty and pristine environment that offers great potential for   harnessing the “blue economy” as well as sectors such as tourism, and trade and investment      The tourism sector has untapped potential in contributing to income and employment creation. We can   promote tourism around the beauty of our atolls for diving, surfing, sport fishing and other ecotourism   attractions. There is potential to market tourism with a focus on niche opportunities using technological   innovations. This needs to be developed hand in hand with investments in enabling infrastructure, including   accommodation facilities. There is potential for greater local participation and joint venture investments so   that inclusive ecotourism destinations are developed allowing all to share in our rich culture and tradition.    4.5 Financial Sector and Services   GOAL: Enhance Financial Sector Stability and Improve Financial Services.   Policy Objectives   1) Strengthen financial sector oversight   2) Improve access to affordable and competitive financial services   3) Protect and develop links to the international financial system      Access to affordable financial services is important for people to manage their finances and for micro, small   and medium enterprises to develop. Financial institutions are in the best position to tailor products and   services that promotes greater access to financial services that meet the social and economic development   needs of the people of the RMI.        Global connectivity of the financial system is critical to facilitate the flow of trade and payments, and   correspondent banking relationships for local banks, need to be maintained. Regulatory and supervisory   oversight of the financial system needs to be strengthened to address the challenges of money laundering and   terrorist financing and to safeguard the stability of the financial system. Innovative channels of distributing   financial services in rural and urban areas including the outer islands should be encouraged through the use of   technology. Building financial capability through financial literacy in the communities and schools is an        18     important tool for imparting financial “know how” allowing for effective utilization of financial services by all   stakeholders.   5. GOOD GOVERNANCE PILLAR   The Pillar consists of five Strategic Areas:   1. Public Administration   2. Public Financial Management  3. Law, Justice and Public Safety  4. Judiciary   5. International Relations and Security      Pillar Over-Arching Objective   To Apply Good Governance to all Areas of Government and Society, Ensuring the Rule of Law    Applies to Every Citizen, Ensuring Effective Measures are in    Place to Eliminate any Corruption or Illegal Conduct   Strengthening the machinery of government at all levels and the instalment of transparent and accountable   systems that support effective service is vital for achieving high levels of administrative and institutional   performance. The RMI recognizes that improving policy development and enhancing implementation will   improve our governance mechanisms.  Additionally, strengthening institutional performance management and   monitoring systems are crucial elements underpinning good governance, and form a foundation upon which   any long-term development process is based.   5.1 Public Administration   GOAL: Provide High Quality, Accountable and Transparent Services   Policy Objectives   1) Improve practices to achieve an effective, ethical, and transparent public service, local governments and   related public agencies   2) Enhance capacity of public servants and employees of public agencies, including in particular those in the   outer islands   3) Strengthen oversight, audit, alignment and coordination across and within the public service and related   public agencies   4) Strengthen the connection and cooperation with civil society, private sector and outer islands   5) Strengthen the capability of accountability and integrity institutions to address corruption and unethical   practices     The NSP includes an emphasis on modernizing the public service and the introduction of new public-sector   management practices. Transparency, accountability and integrity serve as the primary elements of this drive   towards improved institutional performance.        19     5.2 Public Financial Management   GOAL: Sound and Efficient Public Financial Management   Policy Objectives   1) Promote stable growth through responsible fiscal policy targeting stability in inflation   2) Strengthen budget management and financial oversight for planned priorities   3) Enhance SOE financial performance and service delivery   4) Ensure public debt is sustainably managed and finances are directed towards projects with positive   economic returns   5) Improve revenue generation   6) Strengthen dialogue between national and local government and the private sector, and enact a robust   governance framework for effective partnership.   7) Strengthen accountability and oversight in the PFM     In 2012, a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) study reviewed the Public Financial   Management (PFM) system and highlighted areas of needed reform. Based on the PEFA, the government   developed a PFM Reform Roadmap 2014–2016 (the Roadmap), consisting of 30 reform components,   including promoting better fiscal responsibility and debt management.     In December 2015, the Roadmap was endorsed by the Cabinet. A PFM Reform Steering Committee chaired   by the Chief Secretary was established in March 2016 to provide high-level management.  The Ministry of   Finance, Banking and Postal Services (MOFBPS) was tasked to lead efforts to implement the Roadmap.  The   implementation of the PFM roadmap, began in 2016 and continues with assistance from the Asian   Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank and the European Union.   5.3 Law, Justice and Public Safety   GOAL: Robust Law Enforcement and Improved Community Safety   Policy Objectives   1) Enable accountable, professional and ethical law making.   2) Require robust and unbiased enforcement of laws, justice and regulatory processes.   3) Implement effective systems of corporate regulation   4) Strengthen the capacity and processes of law making, regulation, enforcement and oversight of relevant   agencies     The rule of law and justice are fundamental principles which underpin democratic governance.  We continue   to work to make the law more transparent and consultative, producing legislation that is in the interest of all   our people.  It is also crucial that the law is administered fairly and impartially, with respect for human rights,   and without discrimination so that no person is above the law and every person may benefit equally from its   administration.         Steps are also underway to strengthen the abilities of law enforcement institutions to deliver personal security,   particularly for vulnerable groups, using new and innovative approaches such as community policing and   greater border security. The need to enhance maritime patrol, crime prevention, including measures to combat   drug, human trafficking is also an area we will address. Furthermore, we continue to be vigilant about cyber-       20     crime, money laundering and other illegal activities, in order to protect our environment and social fabric for   communities and families.     5.4 Judiciary   GOAL: A Court and Judicial System, which is Effective, Impartial, Fair and Transparent   Policy Objectives   1) Resolve judicial issues fairly, effectively, and efficiently   2) Provide access to legal services that are affordable   3) Ensure judiciary shall remain independent, yet transparent and accountable      To achieve our goals and objectives our courts must remain independent, and trials must be open and fair.   Steps must be taken to strengthen the rule of law at the community level so that people continue to feel safe   and are not denied justice. In this context, we recognize the important role played by civil society organizations   in advancing justice and the rule of law, and the contribution they make to increasing public trust and   awareness.    5.5 International Relations and Security   GOAL: Protect and Promote the National Interests of the RMI Regionally and Internationally   Policy Objectives   1) Enhance diplomacy and international relations   2) Catalyze external support for development from traditional and new partners   3) Facilitate orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobility of people   4) Ensure safe, secure and resilient physical borders   5) Establish safe, secure and accessible cyber environment     Security, in all its dimensions: (geopolitical, maritime, border, cyber, drug trafficking, people trafficking,   diseases and pests etc.) is a necessary for the protection of the people and the country. This requires effective   coordination with relevant agencies internally and externally and effective monitoring.      To achieve our development objectives our global relationships are crucial with regard to the catalysis of funds   and technical support.  RMI’s leadership in critical issues such as climate change has been useful in unlocking   greater funds from multilateral and bilateral sources, both traditional and new. At the same time we will   continue to navigate our path carefully given the greater geopolitical interest in the region and ensure the long-  term sustainability of any arrangements.   Cross-Cutting Issues   We have identified six cross-cutting issues that are inherent in the NSP.  The five Pillars embrace these issues   in the identified Policy Objectives.  Summary information for each of these cross-cutting issues is provided   below with additional information located in Annexes 5-7.        21     Outer Island Development   This current NSP addresses Outer Island development through a cross-cutting approach in all five Pillars. It   is a NATIONAL PLAN that is inclusive of the entire country.  The Policy Objectives exemplify how the NSP   addresses outer island development through the One Nation Development Concept outlined in Vision 2018.   Development of the outer islands is also outlined in several RMI National Policies including (but not limited   to) the 2050 Long-Term Climate Strategy, National Adaptation Plan (NAP), Food Security Policy, National   Infrastructure and Investment Plan (NIIP), National Environment Management Strategy (NEMS), etc.   The RMI is made up of 29 atolls and 5 islands that includes 24 local government jurisdictions.  Of these 24   local governments, there are 22 that are considered to be rural or Outer Islands.    The National Strategic Plan (NSP 2020-2030) continues to embrace the One Nation Concept and Ten Goals   of Vision 2018 (Annex 5) and integrates these ideas through the five NSP Pillars.  The development approach   embraces all 24 RMI government jurisdictions as one country, however this does not prevent us from   realizing the unique development needs of the rural (Outer Island) jurisdictions.     Resilience    The NSP 2020-2030 has a definition of resilience relevant to the particular issues of the RMI. Fundamentally,   ‘resiliency’ can be defined as the empowerment of individuals to make the most of opportunities and   resources available so that families and communities can adapt to changing circumstances, including the   environment.  This definition articulates why and generally how we should build resilience.   The challenges we face, not only from growing climate change and natural disaster hazards, but also from   socio-economic factors, require a sharper, cross-cutting, and cascading focus on resilience as a development   imperative.   Resilience, in all its dimensions, environmental, social, economic, etc., is the overarching strategic foundation   priority of this NSP. Adopting a cross-cutting focus on resilience that ensures the security of communities,   environments, and economies remains a fundamental focus of all planning and budgeting in the RMI.    Building resilience to the effects of climate change and managing and mitigating disasters from natural   hazard risks are imperatives for RMI. In the short to medium term, this requires far more investment in   several areas including: coastal protection, climate-proofing critical infrastructure; food, water, and health   security; early warning systems and disaster risk-reduction measures.  Additionally, a focus on fiscal and   financial resilience, innovative financing instruments; and the resilience of the private sector must be   implemented.   The continued vitality of the urban centers of Majuro and Ebeye is dependent on improved resilience and   livelihoods of the outer islands and their 15,000 people. Not addressing this ensures the continued migration   of the Marshallese people away from their land and culture.   Efforts are underway to integrate this focus on building resilience into national policies and plans in all   communities. Sectors and thematic plans will further articulate support for building resilience, and   organizational level plans will further identify outcomes and actions to support the resilience agenda.        22     Adaptation to Climate Change and Sea Level Rise   While sea-level rise is an undeniably real threat for the people who live on islands in the Pacific, the likely   impacts of climate change over the next 50 to 100 years are going to have repercussions for the atolls and   islands of the Republic of Marshall Islands.    Sea level rise combined with more frequent and severe periodic wave surges are likely to create tipping   points for tolerability of habitation. This will be made more pronounced in some atolls by coastal erosion   and by more frequent and extended droughts and contamination of fresh water lenses.   RMI therefore faces the stark choice as a low-lying Pacific island nation: either relocate or find other   options. The RMI is considering whether to relocate all 55,000 citizens (making them climate refugees) or   to find other feasible options.    Understanding these risks atoll by atoll will be necessary to allow adaptation measures for well-being and   livelihood (‘business as usual’) measures to be established with local atoll and village groups. This would be   done with a view to strengthen resilience, defer the tipping points and provide time to prepare for more   extreme measures.  The key principles that underpin our approach to climate change adaptation are located   in Annex 6.  Additional information is found in the National Environment Management Strategy 2017-22.    Additionally, RMI continues to call for strong and decisive global action, especially from the larger emitters,   to reduce greenhouse gases, the root cause of global warming. Last year, Marshall Islands lawmakers called   on the international community to address what they declared to be a “national climate crisis.”     Nuclear Justice    RMI’s nuclear legacy cuts across nearly every sector of its society, public and private, as it continues to face   outstanding issues as a result of the U.S. nuclear weapons testing program from 1946-1958. Efforts to   address nuclear justice for its people have been ongoing for decades and the adoption of the 2017 National   Nuclear Commission Act and its establishment of a National Nuclear Commission (NNC) reflected a renewed   effort to ensure that its nuclear legacy is never forgotten. Nuclear justice will only be achieved when the   health of the Marshallese people and their islands is restored; when displaced communities are returned to   or compensated for their homelands; when the full range of damages and injuries stemming from the   program is acknowledged and compensated by the U.S. Government; when the record of adverse impacts   from nuclear weapons testing is preserved for the benefit of humankind, and when every Marshallese citizen   understands the activities that took place in his/her islands and their aftermath and feels empowered to use   their voice to advocate for the needs of their communities.    The National Strategy for Nuclear Justice was adopted in 2019 and addresses five crucial foundations of   nuclear justice:    1. Full payment of all past and future awards of the Nuclear Claims Tribunal (Compensation)   2. Quality health care for all Marshallese (Health Care)   3. Reducing the risks of exposure to radiation and other toxins in the environment (Environment)   4. Building national capacity to monitor and understand radiation impacts (National Capacity)   5. Education and awareness of our nuclear legacy (Education and Awareness)      https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2019-10-11/marshall-islands-national-climate-crisis      23     NSP 2020-2030 addresses the core areas of the Nuclear Justice Strategy by integrating these issues into the   relevant Strategic Areas and Policy Objectives.    Human Development   Remoteness and small size lead to there being few education facilities in-country and a severe lack of   specialised skills. The limited size of the job market means there are limited opportunities for employment.   The close relationships and social structures of small island communities often bring challenges in managing   employees. Our people are proud of our cultural roots and the government will ensure that it takes advantage   of this heritage in all facets of the development process.    For this development process to be a success, we must embrace the future and exploit innovations in science   and technology to complement our cultural strengths. In the RMI, the rate of adoption and integration of   science and technology in socio-economic life is very low and the shortage of technically qualified   professionals is visible at all levels. From now until 2030, we should invest in capacity building to have   adequate, highly skilled scientists and technicians to satisfy the needs of the national economy. There is a   need to generate, disseminate and acquire scientific skills as well as to develop technological innovations.   We must integrate these innovations into social and economic development.     In order to achieve this objective, we need to develop the teaching of science and technology at secondary   and post-secondary levels. We also need to accelerate research and development efforts.  These ideas are   threaded through the five NSP Pillars. Specific human resources challenges, unique to small island states,   and the RMI in particular have been identified.  These are detailed in Annex 7.   Security    Security is a broad term that covers a range of issues, the relative importance of these, are specific to each   particular situation.       The Pacific Island Forum Secretariat (PIFS) acknowledged the dynamic geopolitical environment that has   led to an increasingly crowded and contested region and reaffirmed the need for strengthened collective and   cohesive action to effectively manage the regional security environment. At the PIFS meeting in 2018, leaders   endorsed the Regional Security Declaration called the BOE Declaration. It identifies six Strategic Focus Areas:   climate security, human security and humanitarian assistance, environmental and resource security,   transnational crime, cybersecurity/cybercrime and the provision of an enabling environment for   implementation.      For RMI these are important issues that are captured throughout the five Pillars of the NSP. These issues are   addressed in the various Strategic Areas. In the absence of any ‘white’ paper or strategy on security the NSP   serves as a “roadmap” in addressing some of the critical issues which were discussed during the NSP   consultations.        24     Monitoring & Evaluation Framework    The RMI National Strategic Plan is much more than just a document. It was developed through an extensive   consultation process and is complemented by a National Monitoring & Evaluation Framework (M&E).   The goals and policy objectives are the overarching guide for government planning and budgeting over the   next 10 years. Furthermore, the M&E Framework aligns the NSP with our regional and international   commitments including the Pacific Regional Framework, the Samoa Pathway, and the Global Sustainable   Development Goals.      The M&E Framework, forms a second part of the NSP and articulates key performance indicators and targets   for monitoring and evaluating progress for the National Policy Objectives as detailed in each Strategic Area.   These indicators underpin the twenty-four NSP Goals.        The realization of these goals and objectives depends on both government and the people it serves. It   requires the active participation of civil society, the private sector, and our international development   partners. The goals and policy objectives will be delivered through coordinated and interlinked government   planning, budgeting and service delivery. The annual portfolio budgets of line ministries coordinate with the   policy objectives for which they are responsible.      Ongoing monitoring and evaluation are critical to successful implementation of this plan. All of the policy   objectives are linked to specific measurable indicators targets and milestones which are to be detailed in the   M&E Framework. Annual review evaluating baselines against the milestones and targets will help to identify,   and evaluate progress against the Goals and Policy Objectives. This approach is focused both on ensuring   timely and reliable information is available to inform ongoing planning and budgeting, as well as informing   annual progress reports on outcomes and impacts.      The NSP Annual Development Report will be the principal means of communicating progress for the NSP.   The process of data collection and analysis to populate the annual report will need to be further embedded   into the regular activities of line ministries. Ministries will be expected to establish the baseline data, to best   track progress against the targets and milestones. This will not only inform the annual report, but will also   provide essential feedback to the people responsible for making decisions, programming activities,   developing budgets and delivering services.      The Economic Policy, Planning and Statistics Office (EPPSO) and other key government agencies including   the Office of Chief Secretary (OCS) are responsible for overseeing the monitoring and evaluation of the RMI   NSP. The necessary information for conducting monitoring and evaluation, and completing the Annual NSP   Report, including alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), will form part of the M&E   matrices in the M&E Framework.   An example of the M&E matrixes is provided as Figure 3.              25        The M&E for NSP will:    Focus on indicators and measure progress against targets and milestones    Use milestones and targets used to determine progress with regard to policy objectives    Focus the level of evaluation on the Goals and Policy Objectives         Figure 3: M&E Matrix  SOCIAL and CULTURAL GOAL 1   Policy  Objectives   Indicators Targets Status/Analysis SDGs   Policy  Objective for  each Pillar   Indicators to  be used for  M&E   RMI target for 2030   Milestones   RMI Target for 2025   Milestones   RMI Target for 2023   Milestones   Current status of the  baseline indicator   (this can include where  possible current annual  budget for the  indicator    Alignment with  SDG Targets and  Indicators        26     ANNEX 1: SECTOR STRATEGIES   Sector/Thematic Area Title Timeframe  Education Education Sector Plan  Under development  Health    Culture National Cultural Policy Under development  Gender    Youth National Youth Policy Under development  Nuclear Nuclear Justice for Marshall Islands 2020–2023  Water and Sanitation Water and Sanitation Strategic Plan 2017–2027  Energy National Energy Policy and Energy Action Plan 2016  ICT National ICT Policy 2012  Electricity RMI Electricity Roadmap 2018  Climate Change National Climate Change Policy Framework   Long Term (2050) Climate Strategy  2011  2018   Environment National Environment Management Strategy 2017–2022  Disaster Risk Management JNAP for DRM and CCA 2014–2018  Marine MMRA Strategic Plan 2019–2023  Agriculture Agriculture Strategic Plan Under development  Tourism RMI Strategic Tourism Development Plan Under development  Infrastructure National Infrastructure Investment Plan   RMI National Building Code  2017–2026  2019   ANNEX 2: MINISTRY and AGENCY PLANS   Ministry/Agency Main Directional Plan and Coverage  Health and Human Services Three year Rolling Plan 2017–2019  Public School System Strategic Plan 2017–2020  National Training Council Strategic Plan 2019–2021  Office of the Auditor General Strategic Plan 2014–2019  Office of Commerce, Investment and Tourism Business Plan 2019–2021  Marshall Islands Police Department Strategic Plan 2019–021  Economic Policy, Planning and Statistics Office Strategic Plan 2019–2021  College of Marshall Islands Education Master Plan 2019–2029  Environment Protection Agency Strategic Plan 2018–2021  Foreign Affairs and Trade Strategic Plan 2017–2023   Finance, Banking and Postal Services Banking Commission Strategic Plan 2019–  2021 Financial Sector Plan under  development   Natural Resources and Commerce No current plan  Climate Change Directorate No current plan  Justice, Immigration and Labor No current plan  Education, Sports and Training No current plan  Transportation, Communication and Information  Technology   No current plan   Works, Infrastructure and Utilities No current plan  *Few Ministries and Agencies have current plans, strategies, etc., and even these are not consistently framed.        27     ANNEX 3:    PREAMBLE RMI CONSTITUTION AND VISION 2018 DECLARATION   Preamble of the RMI Constitution       WE, THE PEOPLE OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE MARSHALL ISLANDS, trusting in   God, the Giver of our life, liberty, identity and our inherent rights, do hereby exercise these rights and   establish for ourselves and generations to come this Constitution, setting forth the legitimate legal   framework for the governance of the Republic.      We have reason to be proud of our forefathers who boldly ventured across the unknown waters of the   vast Pacific Ocean many centuries ago, ably responding to the constant challenges of maintaining a   bare existence on these tiny islands, in their noble quest to build their own distinctive society.      This society has survived, and has withstood the test of time, the impact of other cultures, the   devastation of war, and the high price paid for the purposes of international peace and security.       All we have and are today as a people, we have received as a sacred heritage which we pledge ourselves   to safeguard and maintain, valuing nothing more dearly than our rightful home on the islands within   the traditional boundaries of this archipelago.      With this Constitution, we affirm our desire and right to live in peace and harmony, subscribing to the   principles of democracy, sharing the aspirations of all other peoples for a free and peaceful world, and   striving to do all we can to assist in achieving this goal.      We extend to other peoples what we profoundly seek from them: peace, friendship mutual   understanding, and respect for our individual idealism and our common humanity.         Declaration to the Marshallese (Vision 2018)     To become a country in an inter-dependent world, with an enhanced socio-economic reliance (and) an   educated, healthy, productive, law-abiding and God-loving people in which individual freedom and   fundamental human rights are protected and culture and traditions are respected, and development and   environmental sustainability are in harmony.        28     ANNEX 4: RMI SITUATION ANALYSIS INFORMATION   According to a recent (2017) WB analytical exercise, Pacific Possible11, relative to a baseline ‘business-as-  usual’ scenario, there appears only modest opportunities for the RMI to realize additional economic growth,   employment or public revenue generation from the four sectors that were identified as providing the   greatest potential opportunity to foster shared prosperity in the region, namely: tourism; access to   international labor markets – in addition to the RMI’s existing open access to the United States (U.S.) labor   market as part of the Compact of Free Association; information and communication technologies (ICT); and   fisheries.    RMI’s population totals around 54,000, of which 28,000 (53 percent) reside in Majuro (the country’s capital)   and 10,000 (18 percent) in Ebeye. Urbanization and crowding have intensified over the past 30 years, with   migration from the outer islands to the urban centers of Majuro and Ebeye primarily due to: (i) a lack of   employment opportunities in other locations; and (ii) greater reliance on the cash economy as compared to   a subsistence lifestyle. Between 1962 and 1991 the RMI’s population increased by an average of 4 percent   per year but has remained relatively stable since then, as the combination of declining real incomes and   rising costs of living has resulted in significant outmigration as Marshallese citizens seek better jobs and   educational opportunities abroad, mainly in Hawaii, the U.S. mainland and Guam.    According to the WB Report, hardship is experienced by 51 percent of the RMI population. Inequality   between populations in the urban centers and the outer islands is exacerbated by high transport costs and   limited access and poor quality of public goods and services in remote areas, while increased crowding in   Ebeye and Majuro has also increased inequality in the urban centers. Furthermore, recent poverty   assessments have found that informal safety nets are weakening as increased urbanization, westernization   and aid dependence have undermined traditional customs and values.   As a result of the combination of small population size, extreme remoteness and dispersion, and   environmental fragility, the challenges faced by the RMI are more pronounced and the economic   opportunities more limited than those of most other remote regions in the world. The RMI’s economic   geography increases transport cost and limits economies of scale which – combined with the RMI’s relatively   limited natural resources – result in a narrow production base, constrain the opportunities for exports and   make the economy highly dependent on imports. Consequently, the economy is dominated by the public   sector, which accounts for around 40 percent of GDP and half of formal-sector employment, while private   sector activity focuses on fisheries, retail services, copra and tourism. State Owned Enterprises (SOEs)   dominate key sectors of the economy, with transfers to support their continued operational losses having   expanded from an average of 4 percent of GDP over the decade from 2005–2014, to an estimated more than   9 percent of GDP in 2019. In terms of the external accounts, most foodstuffs (excluding local foods, such as   fish, coconuts and some fruits), fuel, building materials, clothing and manufactured products are imported,   while exports are limited to fish and copra products. The nation is thus highly exposed to fluctuations in   international food and fuel prices. A large and persistent trade deficit is financed by substantial inflows of   foreign assistance – on which the country’s fiscal framework relies – and more recently by increasing   government revenues from fishing vessels with access to Marshallese waters.                                                               11 Pacific Possible….        29     According to the UN Human Development Report 201912, Marshall Islands’ HDI value for 2018 is 0.698—  which put the country in the medium human development category—positioning it at 117 out of 189   countries and territories. Between 2017 and 2018, Marshall Islands’ HDI value increased from 0.696 to   0.698, an increase of 0.2 percent. Between 1990 and 2018, Marshall Islands’ life expectancy at birth increased   by 11.5 years, mean years of schooling increased by 0.1 years and expected years of schooling remained   constant. Marshall Islands’ GNI per capita increased by about 24.0 percent between 1990 and 2018.   ANNEX 5: VISION 2018 ONE NATION CONCEPT     Vision 2018 states the following:    We believe that through the adoption of Outer Island Development as a key component of our sustainable   development strategy, we would be able to achieve these results. Vision 2018 has identified several key areas of   focus with regard to the formulation of strategies for Outer Island Development. These are:    Devolution and de-concentration of political and administrative functions   Infrastructure and maintenance development   Development of productive resources   Human resource development       It sets forth ten goals which illustrate the one-nation concept of development that the RMI continues to   embrace:    1. Operating in an Interdependent World  2. Enhanced Socio-Economic Self Reliance  3. An Educated People  4. A Healthy People  5. A Productive People  6. A Law-abiding People  7. A God Loving People  8. Respecting Individual Freedom and Fundamental Human Rights  9. Respecting Culture and Traditions   10. Environmental Sustainability    ANNEX 6: RMI CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION PRINCIPLES   For Marshall Islands, key principles that underpin that country’s approach to adaptation, are:    1. Right to remain: citizens of RMI have a natural right to remain in their homelands and this right should   be protected;   2. Resilience imperative: resilience must be a fundamental focus across all sectors and areas of atoll   development; building resilience to climate and disaster risks is an imperative given the high and   unique vulnerability of atolls;    3. Integrated adaptation: climate change is complex and multidimensional, therefore efforts to adapt must   be multidimensional and integrated, considering both the physical and non-physical;                                                                12 Ibid (footnote 9)        30     4. Knowledge first: RMI would follow a knowledge first principle, using science and evidence-based   decision making and identifying key knowledge gaps;   5. Adaptive capacity: adaptive capacity needs to be strengthened to improve the ability to respond to   changing circumstances; as conditions are likely to deteriorate, atoll nations will need to be dynamic in   their ability to adapt;   6. Consensus and inclusion: adaptation should go hand-in-hand with consultation and consensus building,   so that the views of all stakeholders are taken into account; and   7. Technology and tradition: adaptation approaches should embrace innovation and modern technology   as well as traditional knowledge.   ANNEX 7: HUMAN RESOURCE CHALLENGES   1. Specific challenges identified for human resource development in Small Island States:    2. Small pool of qualified, skilled people available in the labour market—as a result of being a small country   with a relatively low level of education.    3. Critical person risk – as a result of the small and shallow pool, there is critical person risk of individuals   who hold exceptional institutional knowledge. If these people were to move on, critical functions would   not be fulfilled.   4. Proliferation of projects – in the last decade there has been a proliferation of development partners and   projects, resulting in very high demands on the time and attention of key personnel. These demands take   the form of  administrative requirements, hosting missions, negotiations with development partners and   travel to off-island meetings and training courses. This impacts heavily on the capacity of the small   professional-level workforce and creates a sense of fatigue.    5. Ad hoc training courses and meetings for RMI representatives are offered by development partners. This   is not coordinated between development partners, often key people are away for too much time. Short   training courses offered either internationally or in-country offer no follow up or embedding of   learnings. Training is often poorly targeted, lacking context and too short to have lasting impact.    6. Scholarships are often not targeted to workforce needs—there is no systematic linkage of scholarships   and training programs with the strategic workforce needs of the country in many areas, especially the   science, engineering and  technology.   7. Out migration/ brain drain – many of those who gain qualifications overseas will be attracted to the   higher salaries, the lifestyle and the professional culture in the US or in other countries. A significant gap   in recruitment of professionals is that there is no direct connection between individual agencies and the   students studying overseas to allow recruitment of Marshallese nationals into professional positions. Of   obvious concern is the loss of young educated Marshallese people who either choose not to return to the   Marshall Islands upon completion of their studies, or else who leave after working there for a short time.   8. Poor recruitment and performance management processes—rarely are the human resource needs of an   organisation systematically identified and recruitment of new staff is often done without a clear job   description. Additionally, employee performance management systems within the public sector are        31     inadequate in terms of setting expectations, performing fair and professional performance evaluations   and positive or negative consequences for performance.   9. Low participation of women in the sector—particularly the case in the sciences, technical and   engineering fields.",

NO.: PS64-128/2015E-PDF ISBN: 978-0-660-03030-2 3Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy Executive Summary In 2010, the Government of Canada launched Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy to protect Canadian governments, businesses, critical infrastructure and citizens from cyber threats. The Strategy helped shape Canada’s knowledge of cyber technology and guides Canada’s efforts in securing government and other vital systems, and protecting Canadians online. Consistent with the government’s efforts to make cyberspace more secure for all Canadians, the RCMP Cybercrime Strategy is based on extensive internal and external consultation and focuses on ways to improve Canada’s national police force in its fight against the rising and evolving threat of cybercrime. This strategy complements Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy to help keep Canadians secure online. The RCMP has a broad mandate when it comes to investigating and apprehending criminals in the online world, or otherwise disrupting cybercrime activity. The RCMP Cybercrime Strategy is therefore broad in scope and reflects the role of cyber in several law enforcement areas. The RCMP Cybercrime Strategy’s vision is to reduce the threat, impact and victimization of cybercrime in Canada through law enforcement action. The following three pillars are identified within the strategy to guide the RCMP’s efforts in combating cybercrime: • Identify and prioritize cybercrime threats through intelligence collection and analysis; • Pursue cybercrime through targeted enforcement and investigative action; and, • Support cybercrime investigations with specialized skills, tools and training. The RCMP Cybercrime Strategy sets out in an Operational Framework and a supporting Action Plan, objectives, strategic enablers and 15 action items, which the RCMP will implement over the next five years and beyond. Collectively, these initiatives will enable Canada’s national police force to better combat cybercrime in concert with its domestic and international law enforcement partners and other stakeholders. 4 Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy 5Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy Table of Contents Cybercrime requires new ways of policing 6 Defining cybercrime 7 The RCMP’s approach to combating cybercrime 8 RCMP Cybercrime Operational Framework 11 RCMP Action Plan to Combat Cybercrime 12 Conclusion 20 6 Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy Cybercrime requires new ways of policing Cybercrime is on the rise, both in Canada and internationally. Once considered the domain of individuals with specialized skills, cybercrime has expanded to other offenders as the requisite technical know-how becomes more accessible. Widely available and ready- made malicious software (‘malware’) and online cybercrime-for-hire services provide criminals with new and simplified ways to steal and exchange sensitive and personal information. As a result, criminals are constantly looking for vulnerabilities in new technologies that may be exploited for unlawful purposes, and new ways to victimize public and private sector organizations and Canadian citizens who rely on these technologies. Cybercrime threats range in scope and impact. On a personal level, cybercrimes may target individuals through online scams or other fraudulent techniques. Cybercrimes may come with other social costs and devastating forms of victimization, such as online child sexual exploitation or the rising prevalence of cyber bullying. Cybercrime threats are also facilitated by organized crime networks and cause significant economic losses to Canadian businesses and citizens. On a commercial level, these threats target financial institutions, large-scale retailers and other organizations to steal personal consumer information, such as online passwords and credit card information, or to gain insider knowledge on intellectual property or trade secrets. On a national security level, state-sponsored and other criminal threat actors use sophisticated and covert cyber capabilities to perform espionage, steal sensitive information or to potentially conduct more disruptive attacks against Canada’s critical infrastructure and other vital cyber systems. The criminal exploitation of new and emerging technologies requires new policing measures to keep pace in a digital era. The same technologies that people and organizations use for legitimate purposes may be used by criminals to mask their online activities and evade detection from law enforcement. Police must often find technical solutions to decrypt, unlock or otherwise deal with encryption technologies, re-routed Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and other technical roadblocks that criminals exploit to cover their digital tracks and commit cybercrimes. Criminal activities in cyberspace are also complex and often transnational in character, where potential evidence is transient and spread across multiple jurisdictions. To varying degrees, cybercrimes affect Canadians in real and harmful ways. For law enforcement, addressing cybercrime requires broad-based domestic and international police cooperation, engagement with public and private sector organizations, and integrating new technical skills and tools with traditional enforcement measures. As Canada’s national police force, the RCMP must strive to be a leader in combating cybercrime. The following strategy and action plan demonstrates the RCMP’s continued commitment against cybercrime. 7Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy Defining cybercrime The RCMP interprets cybercrime to be any crime where cyber - the Internet and information technologies, such as computers, tablets, personal digital assistants or mobile devices - has a substantial role in the commission of a criminal offence. Under this broad lens, the RCMP breaks cybercrime into two categories: • technology-as-target - criminal offences targeting computers and other information technologies, such as those involving the unauthorized use of computers or mischief in relation to data, and; • technology-as-instrument - criminal offences where the Internet and information technologies are instrumental in the commission of a crime, such as those involving fraud, identity theft, intellectual property infringements, money laundering, drug trafficking, human trafficking, organized crime or terrorist activities, child sexual exploitation or cyber bullying. Prevalence of cybercrime RCMP statistics suggest that cybercrime is increasing in Canada. In 2013, the RCMP received over 4,400 reported incidents of cybercrime: an increase of more than 40% (over 1,300 reported incidents) from 2011. The majority of reported cybercrime incidents involve technology-as-instrument offences, but reported cybercrime incidents involving technology-as-target offences are on the rise. In a small number of reported cybercrime incidents, the type of offence could not be determined as either technology-as-instrument or technology-as-target (i.e. Unknown). Additional information on cybercrime Additional information on cybercrime, including expanded definitions and select case studies, may be found in the RCMP’s first public report on cybercrime, Cybercrime: an overview of incidents and issues in Canada (available online at: 8 Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy The RCMP’s approach to combating cybercrime The RCMP is the only federal organization with the mandate and authority to investigate criminal offences related to cybercrime, such as those targeting government systems and networks, or other critical infrastructure sectors. Criminal intelligence allows law enforcement to ‘connect the dots’ of information from local to national and international criminal activity. As Canada’s national police force, the RCMP has a broad mandate to investigate criminals in the cyber realm, resulting in their apprehension or otherwise disrupting their cybercrime activity. Law enforcement activities extend from identifying and prioritizing cybercrime threats based on criminal intelligence, to investigating and disrupting cybercrime activities, to handling digital evidence in support of cybercrime investigations. The RCMP’s cyber-related roles and responsibilities align with its duty to preserve the peace and prevent crime and other offences against Canadian law as outlined in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act. Where the RCMP has been contracted as the local police service of jurisdiction at provincial, territorial and municipal levels, it also has a broad policing mandate in matters related to cybercrime as many crimes are committed by way of modern technologies. The RCMP also has a pivotal role within the broader government’s cyber community. Under Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy, the RCMP works closely with its government partners to foster a safe and secure cyber environment in Canada. The following section organizes the RCMP’s cyber-related roles and responsibilities around three main areas: criminal intelligence, criminal investigations and specialized services. Criminal intelligence The RCMP takes an intelligence-led approach to policing. Criminal intelligence allows law enforcement to ‘connect the dots’ of information from local to national and international criminal activity. Whether tactical, operational or strategic, criminal intelligence enables the RCMP and other Canadian police forces to set priorities and allocate resources based on the most significant criminal threats to Canada. This concept also applies to cybercrime, especially given its transnational dimension and the inherent need to identify patterns and relationships between cybercrime data and other relevant data sources from multiple jurisdictions. The RCMP may investigate cybercrime in response to a complaint or proactively as a result of criminal intelligence. Cybercrime intelligence - coming from investigations, police information databases, open source research and analysis, or partner collaboration between law enforcement and public and private sector stakeholders - can identify prolific and serious offenders in cyberspace and may objectively direct police resources to major cybercrime targets. The RCMP analyzes criminal intelligence from a wide array of sources, identifies emerging cybercrime threats, and makes links between cybercrime and other criminal domains, such as organized crime or financial crime. 9Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy Operational centres Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC) is Canada’s trusted source for reporting and mitigating online mass marketing fraud. It is a partnership among the RCMP, Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) and the Competition Bureau. In 2014, the CAFC received over 14,000 complaints of cyber-related fraud (email and website scams), accounting for more than $45 million in reported losses. Additional information may be found at: National Child Exploitation Coordination Centre The RCMP National Child Exploitation Coordination Centre (NCECC) works with law enforcement partners, government agencies, non-government organizations and industry stakeholders across Canada and internationally to combat the online sexual exploitation of children. The NCECC also works closely with the Canadian Centre for Child Protection, an organization that operates Canada’s national tipline ( for reporting the online sexual exploitation of children. In 2014, the NCECC received nearly 8,500 reported incidents and requests for assistance from law enforcement and other partners concerning online child sexual exploitation. Criminal investigations At the federal level, the RCMP investigates serious and organized crime, economic crime, a range of national security threats, and enforces Federal statutes. These investigations may extend to federal offences involving suspected cybercrime activities, such as money laundering and terrorist financing, market fraud, threats to Canada’s critical infrastructure, intellectual property infringements or drug trafficking. The RCMP works in concert with domestic and international law enforcement partners and other stakeholders to combat cybercrime threats that cross jurisdictional boundaries and require joint force operations. International policing plays a pivotal role in the RCMP’s response to cybercrime. Cybercrime is often transnational, where a perpetrator in one country can affect victims in many others. As evidence of criminal activity may easily flow across national borders in cyberspace, the RCMP must work with multilateral partners to obtain and analyze evidence, which is enabled by police-to-police information sharing and formal legal mechanisms. Given the borderless nature of cybercrime, the RCMP works closely with its domestic and international law enforcement partners, and other stakeholders in both public and private sectors, to address common cybercrime threats through various enforcement measures, leading to arrests and charges or other disruption outcomes. Through contract policing services, the RCMP plays a significant role in addressing cybercrime in contracted provinces, territories and municipalities. Law enforcement activities in these jurisdictions extend to a range of criminal offences where the Internet and related technologies play an integral role, such as online child sexual exploitation, local and regional types of fraud, or various offences associated with cyber bullying. 10 Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy Specialized Services The RCMP’s specialized and technological services play a critical role in cybercrime investigations. Cybercrime often involves surreptitious online activity, where the right law enforcement skills and tools are required to attribute cybercrime activity to a source, identify possible suspects and handle high volumes of digital evidence, such as terabytes of data from lawfully seized computers, hard drives and mobile devices. Cybercrime investigations differ significantly from traditional criminal investigations. They have a greater requirement for operating in online environments through open source analysis and covert means, and obtaining and analyzing data - and potential digital evidence - to drive investigations. This work is critical to criminal investigations with cyber elements, and will increase in complexity and volume as criminals continue to exploit new and emerging technologies. The RCMP Technical Investigation Services (TIS) is a key part of the RCMP’s specialized services for cybercrime investigations. The TIS provides technical domain expertise and digital forensic services to cybercrime investigations to all levels of policing in Canada, in addition to those involving international policing. The TIS maintains expertise in the forensic investigation of computers and networks, and provides other specialized services, such as expert testimony in criminal court proceedings involving cybercrime investigations. The RCMP Integrated Technological Crime Units (ITCUs) also provide specialized services to cybercrime investigations. ITCUs are strategically located across Canada to respond to cybercrime incidents in collaboration with other domestic and international police services, and often lead cybercrime investigations on behalf of Canada that are national or international in scope. These units also process and analyze digital evidence in support of cybercrime and other criminal investigations, which may involve computer forensics, network systems analysis, data recovery and retrieval, malware reverse engineering, and acquiring operational tools in support of cybercrime investigative techniques. The RCMP’s specialized services also extend to equipping law enforcement with the right training and skills to combat cybercrime. Cybercrime investigations require basic and advanced training to keep pace with criminals in cyberspace. As part of its National Police Services, the RCMP, through the Canadian Police College, provides law enforcement training and educational opportunities on cybercrime investigations and intelligence gathering. The National Police Services are a coordinated and integrated series of programs and services accessible to Canadian law enforcement that assist in the investigation of crime, including cybercrime. 11Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy RCMP Cybercrime Operational Framework The RCMP Cybercrime Operational Framework is designed to capture the RCMP’s vision, pillars, objectives and strategic enablers to combat cybercrime, which cascade throughout the action plan in the next section. The framework and action plan centre on core policing operations in the cyber realm, and equipping the RCMP with the right people, skills and tools in a digital era.

To address this requirement, the RCMP will establish a dedicated cybercrime intelligence unit within the RCMP National Intelligence Coordination Centre (NICC). The NICC will gather and analyze cybercrime intelligence from domestic and international sources where suspected cybercrime activity has been identified and reported to the RCMP. The dedicated cybercrime intelligence unit will enhance the RCMP’s ability to analyze cybercrime threats in an operational capacity and direct resources to target Canada’s most serious and prolific cybercriminals. The NICC will also improve the RCMP’s ability to link cybercrime threats to criminal activity in other domains, such as financial crime or serious and organized crime. 4. Improve digital evidence capabilities for cybercrime investigations. Links to operational framework: P3; O7; O8; E2 - Provide digital forensic support to cybercrime investigations, including those led by the cybercrime investigative team. - Acquire new operational tools to analyze digital evidence more effectively. Ramp-up: 2015-2020. Full implementation: 2020 and ongoing. Description: Cybercrime investigations differ significantly from traditional criminal investigations. They have a greater requirement for operating in online environments through open source analysis and covert means, and obtaining and analyzing data (potential digital evidence) to drive investigations. The new cybercrime investigative team is expected to handle large and complex volumes of digital evidence, such as potential evidence from lawfully seized digital devices and servers. To address this requirement, the RCMP will devote new personnel and acquire new operational tools to directly support digital evidence requirements for cybercrime investigations, including those led by the new cybercrime investigative team. These digital forensic resources will ensure that state-of-the-art technological tools and capabilities are in place to support priority cybercrime investigations. In addition, the RCMP will examine capacity and capability requirements to push digital forensic skills and tools to the frontline of policing. 14 Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy Action Item Sucess Indicators Planned Timeline 5. Expand cybercrime investigative training opportunities for Canadian law enforcement Links to operational framework: P3; O9; E1 - Develop and implement new cybercrime investigative courses for law enforcement. - Expand basic and advanced cybercrime investigative skills across Canada. Ramp-up: 2015-17. Full implementation: 2017 and ongoing. Description: Criminal investigators and intelligence analysts require basic and advanced training in new and emerging technologies to keep pace with cybercrime. To address this requirement, the RCMP will improve its law enforcement training for cybercrime-related matters by providing new cybercrime investigative and intelligence training opportunities for the RCMP and its provincial and municipal law enforcement partners. The RCMP provides law enforcement training on cybercrime investigative and intelligence- gathering techniques through the Canadian Police College, Technological Crime Learning Institute (TCLI). The TCLI is the only institute in Canada that offers a comprehensive cybercrime training program for law enforcement on various cybercrime investigative techniques. Through the TCLI, the RCMP will develop and implement new courses on digital and mobile device analysis, and Internet-based open source and online covert investigative techniques, areas in high demand from Canadian law enforcement agencies. 6. Examine ways to more effectively recruit cybercrime investigators and other individuals with technical skills to combat cybercrime. Links to operational framework: P2; P3; O4; O5; O9; E1 - Develop a strategy to more effectively recruit cybercrime investigators, intelligence analysts and other individuals with technical skills to combat cybercrime. - Consider cyber recruitment strategies by other government organizations. Ongoing. Description: Cybercrime investigations are often complex, long-running and require individuals with highly specialized and technical skills, such as advanced proficiencies in computer science and network engineering, and other technical domain areas. To address this requirement, the RCMP will examine its existing recruitment strategies for police officers and civilians, and will consider new recruitment tactics to better attract and retain individuals with technical domain expertise in cyber technologies. Recruitment strategies may include examining international recruitment models and other ways to reform cyber recruitment measures, such as considering: the United States, Department of Homeland Security, Cyber Student Volunteer Initiative; the United Kingdom’s Joint Cyber Reserve; developing targeted recruitment campaigns aimed at academic institutions that specialize in computing or similar technological fields; promoting immediate cybercrime investigative training opportunities for new RCMP Cadets; or taking part in broader recruitment initiatives within the government’s cyber community. 15Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy Action Item Sucess Indicators Planned Timeline 7.

Ongoing. Description: Cybercrime poses serious threats to Canada’s critical infrastructure and other vital cyber systems, such as those in energy, telecommunications and financial sectors. Critical infrastructure systems may include Internet-facing components, potentially leaving them vulnerable to malicious software and other cybercrime threats. The impact of these threats to critical infrastructure and other vital cyber systems may vary, ranging from industrial espionage, to data extraction and theft of intellectual property or trade secrets, to more disruptive tactics involving system compromises. These threats are growing in sophistication and volume, and require greater collaboration between law enforcement and other public and private sector stakeholders. To address this requirement, the RCMP will examine ways to improve its collection and analysis of suspicious cybercrime incidents involving Canada’s critical infrastructure and other vital cyber systems. This initiative will consider the RCMP National Critical Infrastructure Team (NCIT) and its analysis of cybercrime threats to critical infrastructure and other vital cyber systems. This initiative will also involve law enforcement collaboration with Canada’s critical infrastructure community, such as the National Cross Sector Forum and sector-specific briefings. Notably, the NCIT examines physical and cyber threats to Canada’s critical infrastructure, and collaborates with law enforcement, public and private sector stakeholders to ensure a common understanding of the criminal threats and risks surrounding Canada’s critical infrastructure, including those in the cyber realm. 10. Improve the intake and triage of reported cybercrime incidents. Links to operational framework: P1; O1; O2; O3; E3; E5 - Improve ability to obtain and disseminate information on cybercrime incidents to operational areas. - Improve situational awareness on suspected cybercrime activity in Canada. Ongoing. Description: The RCMP anticipates that domestic and international cybercrime incidents will require a greater ability to intake and triage requests for law enforcement assistance, improve situational awareness on cybercrime activities in Canada and disseminate information on cybercrime incidents to RCMP jurisdictions and other Canadian police services. To address this requirement, the RCMP will examine ways to improve its intake and triage functions for reported incidents of suspected cybercrime activities. This initiative will focus on examining RCMP operational areas that facilitate intake and triage functions for domestic criminal investigations and foreign law enforcement requests for assistance, including the RCMP Federal Policing Operational Information Management Intake Unit and INTERPOL Ottawa. 17Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy The RCMP will also examine its international networks involving reported cybercrime incidents and foreign requests for law enforcement assistance, including INTERPOL, G7 and the Council of Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime 24/7 networks. More broadly, the RCMP, through Federal Policing and National Police Services, will examine how it can better assist all Canadian law enforcement to intake and triage new cybercrime complaints and coordinate cybercrime investigations involving the widespread unauthorized use of computers and mischief in relation to data. Action Item Sucess Indicators Planned Timeline 11. Examine integrated enforcement models for combating cybercrime. Links to operational framework: P1; P2; O3; O6; E4 - Greater national coordination and deconfliction for major cybercrime investigations. Ongoing. Description: Cybercrime activities are often multi-jurisdictional in nature and require the combined efforts of Canadian police services, including national law enforcement coordination and deconfliction. To address this requirement, the RCMP will examine its existing enforcement models for joint force operations and will consider models that may better address criminal investigations in the cyber realm. An emphasis will be placed on examining national law enforcement coordination and deconfliction measures for technically complex and multi-jurisdictional cybercrimes, particularly those involving the widespread unauthorized use of computers and mischief in relation to data. This examination will focus on examining operations across RCMP federal policing, contract policing and national police services, including protocols for collaboration between the RCMP and its provincial and municipal law enforcement partners. 12. Expand international collaboration with close allies to better understand and combat cybercrimes that are transnational in character. Links to operational framework: P1; P2; O3; O6; E4 - Greater participation in international law enforcement fora on cybercrime. - Greater understanding of cybercrime threats that are transnational in character. - Provide liaison officers and analysts deployed abroad with foundational cyber-related training as it becomes available. Ongoing. Description: Cybercrime is often an international threat that requires an international and cohesive law enforcement response. To address this requirement, the RCMP and its international law enforcement allies are increasingly working together to develop a shared understanding of common cybercrime threats, and to ensure that collaborative, proactive operational activities are aligned against these threats. Through key international bodies, such as INTERPOL, EUROPOL, G7 and Five Eyes working groups, the RCMP will continue to work with its international law enforcement allies to identify and address common cybercrime threats. 18 Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy The RCMP will also examine ways to bolster its international role in combating cybercrime, such as playing more active and leadership roles in shared international threat assessments and prioritization activities against cybercrime. This work may include international law enforcement activities involving the RCMP, such as: the Five Eyes Law Enforcement Group, Cyber Crime Working Group; the Europol’s Cyber Crime Centre, Joint Cybercrime Taskforce; the G7 Roma Lyon Group, High-Tech Crime Subgroup; the NCFTA International Task Force; and the INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation. Action Item Sucess Indicators Planned Timeline 13. Examine ways to further inform Canadians and industry of emerging cybercrime threats. Links to operational framework: P1; O1; O2; O3; E3; E6 - Provide Canadians and industry with more relevant and timely information on cybercrime threats. - Encourage Canadians and industry to take proactive measures against cybercrime. Ongoing. Description: Under the broad context of cyber security, public and private sector organizations, and Canadians themselves, play important roles in addressing cybercrime. The private sector has a critical cyber role in securing its own networks and systems of wider importance, such as telecommunications, banking and other critical infrastructure sectors. Canadians should also take basic measures to protect themselves online, such as using up-to-date cyber security and anti-virus software, using unique and secure user names and passwords, and downloading online applications from only trusted sources. To take these and other proactive measures against cyber threats, Canadians and industry must be aware of cybercrimes facing Canada. To address this requirement, the RCMP will continue to work with Public Safety Canada and other organizations by informing Canadians and industry of new and emerging cybercrime threats. Notably, the RCMP National Crime Prevention Services assist with public awareness and educational strategies to prevent cyber bullying, including initiatives related to Public Safety Canada’s GetCyberSafe campaigns. The RCMP will continue to support the GetCyberSafe campaigns through youth crime prevention activities. The RCMP will also look for ways to increase industry’s awareness of emerging cybercrime threats through the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, Private Sector Liaison Committee, and improved information-sharing between the RCMP National Critical Infrastructure Team and critical infrastructure owners and operators. 14. Continue to support the modernization of Canada’s legal and policy tools to keep pace with technological change. Links to operational framework: P2; O6; E7 - Modernized and new criminal offences and investigative legal tools to better address cybercrime in Canada. - Improve law enforcement’s ability to conduct international cybercrime investigations through harmonized legal tools between state allies. Ongoing. 19Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy Description: At all levels of government, the RCMP and other Canadian police forces address cybercrime within the boundaries of Canada’s legal environment, which includes a combination of jurisprudence, legislation, public policies, and other legal and policy instruments. While the RCMP Cybercrime Strategy focuses on strengthening the RCMP’s posture against cybercrime within today’s legal environment, it is clear that Canada’s legal and public policy regime will need to keep pace with the evolution of technology to permit the effective investigation of cybercrime, both domestically and internationally. The RCMP will continue to support Canada’s modernization of criminal offences and investigative tools to better address crime in a digital age. The RCMP will also engage Canada’s criminal justice community and identify requirements for educating prosecutors on cybercrime investigations and the novel legal aspects of cybercrime. Action Item Sucess Indicators Planned Timeline 15. Continue to work with the broader Canadian law enforcement community to devise a ‘national’ picture of - and response to - cybercrime. Links to operational framework: P2; O6; E4 - Provide a leadership role in developing a framework for a ‘national’ law enforcement strategy to combat cybercrime. - Identify actions that could be taken by all Canadian police forces to more effectively address cybercrime. Ongoing. Description: Cybercrime represents a shared and common threat to all levels of policing in Canada, and requires collaboration between the RCMP and its Canadian law enforcement partners. To address this requirement, the RCMP and its Canadian law enforcement partners, through the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, Electronic Crime Committee, and other fora, continue to discuss and develop coordinated, national law enforcement approaches to combat cybercrime. Consistent with this approach, the RCMP will use the RCMP Cybercrime Strategy as a basis to lead the development of broader national law enforcement strategies against cybercrime, including measures to develop a broader account of cybercrime based on aggregated police data, and to identify and improve shared, multi-jurisdictional law enforcement operations, collaboration and deconfliction measures against cybercrime. The RCMP will also engage other key stakeholders, such as the National Police Services National Advisory Committee and the Five Eyes Law Enforcement Group, Cyber Crime Working Group, to fully examine operational requirements for a national law enforcement strategy to combat cybercrime. 20 Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy Conclusion Cybercrime has an immediate, tangible and ongoing impact on Canadians. On a macro level, cybercrime affects Canadian government and critical infrastructure systems and the integrity of Canada’s economy and financial sectors. On a personal level, cybercrime involves personal financial losses, the infringement of privacy rights and the grievous harm associated with offences such as child sexual exploitation and cyber bullying. These threats continue to evolve and require a paradigm shift in how crimes are understood and policed in a digital era. They require a law enforcement response that addresses the criminal element in cyberspace while complementing broader government and industry security measures. The RCMP Cybercrime Strategy identifies key steps that Canada’s national police force will take to address this challenge. The strategy’s action items are operationally relevant and will enable the RCMP to more effectively keep pace with cybercrime. The RCMP’s cyber deliverables will be measured and reported on through Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy. The RCMP Cybercrime Strategy will strengthen the RCMP’s ability to work with its domestic and international law enforcement partners and other stakeholders to combat cybercrime. 21Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy 22 Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy",

NO.: PS64-128/2015E-PDF ISBN: 978-0-660-03030-2    3Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy  Executive Summary  In 2010, the Government of Canada launched Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy to protect  Canadian governments, businesses, critical infrastructure and citizens from cyber threats. The  Strategy helped shape Canada’s knowledge of cyber technology and guides Canada’s efforts in  securing government and other vital systems, and protecting Canadians online.   Consistent with the government’s efforts to make cyberspace more secure for all Canadians,  the RCMP Cybercrime Strategy is based on extensive internal and external consultation and  focuses on ways to improve Canada’s national police force in its fight against the rising and  evolving threat of cybercrime. This strategy complements Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy to  help keep Canadians secure online.    The RCMP has a broad mandate when it comes to investigating and apprehending criminals in  the online world, or otherwise disrupting cybercrime activity. The RCMP Cybercrime Strategy  is therefore broad in scope and reflects the role of cyber in several law enforcement areas.  The RCMP Cybercrime Strategy’s vision is to reduce the threat, impact and victimization of  cybercrime in Canada through law enforcement action. The following three pillars are identified  within the strategy to guide the RCMP’s efforts in combating cybercrime:   •  Identify and prioritize cybercrime threats through intelligence collection and analysis;  •  Pursue cybercrime through targeted enforcement and investigative action; and,  •  Support cybercrime investigations with specialized skills, tools and training.  The RCMP Cybercrime Strategy sets out in an Operational Framework and a supporting Action  Plan, objectives, strategic enablers and 15 action items, which the RCMP will implement over  the next five years and beyond. Collectively, these initiatives will enable Canada’s national  police force to better combat cybercrime in concert with its domestic and international law  enforcement partners and other stakeholders.       4 Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy    5Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy  Table of Contents  Cybercrime requires new ways of policing       6  Defining cybercrime          7  The RCMP’s approach to combating cybercrime      8  RCMP Cybercrime Operational Framework       11  RCMP Action Plan to Combat Cybercrime       12  Conclusion           20    6 Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy  Cybercrime requires new ways of policing Cybercrime is on the rise, both in Canada and internationally.     Once considered the domain of individuals with specialized skills, cybercrime has expanded to other  offenders as the requisite technical know-how becomes more accessible. Widely available and ready- made malicious software (‘malware’) and online cybercrime-for-hire services provide criminals  with new and simplified ways to steal and exchange sensitive and personal information. As a result,  criminals are constantly looking for vulnerabilities in new technologies that may be exploited for  unlawful purposes, and new ways to victimize public and private sector organizations and Canadian  citizens who rely on these technologies.   Cybercrime threats range in scope and impact. On a personal level, cybercrimes may target individuals  through online scams or other fraudulent techniques. Cybercrimes may come with other social costs  and devastating forms of victimization, such as online child sexual exploitation or the rising prevalence  of cyber bullying. Cybercrime threats are also facilitated by organized crime networks and cause  significant economic losses to Canadian businesses and citizens. On a commercial level, these threats  target financial institutions, large-scale retailers and other organizations to steal personal consumer  information, such as online passwords and credit card information, or to gain insider knowledge on  intellectual property or trade secrets. On a national security level, state-sponsored and other criminal  threat actors use sophisticated and covert cyber capabilities to perform espionage, steal sensitive  information or to potentially conduct more disruptive attacks against Canada’s critical infrastructure  and other vital cyber systems.   The criminal exploitation of new and emerging technologies requires new policing measures to keep  pace in a digital era. The same technologies that people and organizations use for legitimate purposes  may be used by criminals to mask their online activities and evade detection from law enforcement.  Police must often find technical solutions to decrypt, unlock or otherwise deal with encryption  technologies, re-routed Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and other technical roadblocks that criminals  exploit to cover their digital tracks and commit cybercrimes. Criminal activities in cyberspace are also  complex and often transnational in character, where potential evidence is transient and spread across  multiple jurisdictions.  To varying degrees, cybercrimes affect Canadians in real and harmful ways. For law enforcement,  addressing cybercrime requires broad-based domestic and international police cooperation,  engagement with public and private sector organizations, and integrating new technical skills and  tools with traditional enforcement measures. As Canada’s national police force, the RCMP must strive  to be a leader in combating cybercrime. The following strategy and action plan demonstrates the  RCMP’s continued commitment against cybercrime.    7Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy  Defining cybercrime  The RCMP interprets cybercrime to be any crime where cyber - the Internet and information technologies,  such as computers, tablets, personal digital assistants or mobile devices - has a substantial role in the  commission of a criminal offence. Under this broad lens, the RCMP breaks cybercrime into two categories:    •  technology-as-target - criminal offences targeting computers and other information technologies,  such as those involving the unauthorized use of computers or mischief in relation to data, and;  •  technology-as-instrument - criminal offences where the Internet and information technologies  are instrumental in the commission of a crime, such as those involving fraud, identity theft,  intellectual property infringements, money laundering, drug trafficking, human trafficking,  organized crime or terrorist activities, child sexual exploitation or cyber bullying.  Prevalence of cybercrime   RCMP statistics suggest that cybercrime is increasing in Canada. In 2013, the RCMP received over  4,400 reported incidents of cybercrime: an increase of more than 40% (over 1,300 reported incidents)  from 2011. The majority of reported cybercrime incidents involve technology-as-instrument offences,  but reported cybercrime incidents involving technology-as-target offences are on the rise. In a small  number of reported cybercrime incidents, the type of offence could not be determined as either  technology-as-instrument or technology-as-target (i.e. Unknown).  Additional information on cybercrime  Additional information on cybercrime, including expanded definitions and select case studies, may be  found in the RCMP’s first public report on cybercrime, Cybercrime: an overview of incidents and issues in  Canada (available online at: http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/pubs/cc-report-rapport-cc-eng.htm).     8 Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy  The RCMP’s approach to combating cybercrime  The RCMP is the only federal organization with the mandate and authority to investigate criminal  offences related to cybercrime, such as those targeting government systems and networks, or other  critical infrastructure sectors. Criminal intelligence allows law enforcement to ‘connect the dots’ of  information from local to national and international criminal activity. As Canada’s national police  force, the RCMP has a broad mandate to investigate criminals in the cyber realm, resulting in their  apprehension or otherwise disrupting their cybercrime activity. Law enforcement activities extend  from identifying and prioritizing cybercrime threats based on criminal intelligence, to investigating and  disrupting cybercrime activities, to handling digital evidence in support of cybercrime investigations.   The RCMP’s cyber-related roles and responsibilities align with its duty to preserve the peace and  prevent crime and other offences against Canadian law as outlined in the Royal Canadian Mounted  Police Act. Where the RCMP has been contracted as the local police service of jurisdiction at provincial,  territorial and municipal levels, it also has a broad policing mandate in matters related to cybercrime  as many crimes are committed by way of modern technologies.     The RCMP also has a pivotal role within the broader government’s cyber community. Under Canada’s  Cyber Security Strategy, the RCMP works closely with its government partners to foster a safe and  secure cyber environment in Canada.    The following section organizes the RCMP’s cyber-related roles and responsibilities around three main  areas: criminal intelligence, criminal investigations and specialized services.    Criminal intelligence  The RCMP takes an intelligence-led approach to policing. Criminal intelligence allows law enforcement  to ‘connect the dots’ of information from local to national and international criminal activity. Whether  tactical, operational or strategic, criminal intelligence enables the RCMP and other Canadian police  forces to set priorities and allocate resources based on the most significant criminal threats to Canada.  This concept also applies to cybercrime, especially given its transnational dimension and the inherent  need to identify patterns and relationships between cybercrime data and other relevant data sources  from multiple jurisdictions.   The RCMP may investigate cybercrime in response to a complaint or proactively as a result of criminal  intelligence. Cybercrime intelligence - coming from investigations, police information databases, open  source research and analysis, or partner collaboration between law enforcement and public and private  sector stakeholders - can identify prolific and serious offenders in cyberspace and may objectively  direct police resources to major cybercrime targets. The RCMP analyzes criminal intelligence from a  wide array of sources, identifies emerging cybercrime threats, and makes links between cybercrime  and other criminal domains, such as organized crime or financial crime.     9Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy  Operational centres   Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC) is Canada’s trusted source for reporting and mitigating  online mass marketing fraud. It is a partnership among the RCMP, Ontario Provincial Police  (OPP) and the Competition Bureau. In 2014, the CAFC received over 14,000 complaints of  cyber-related fraud (email and website scams), accounting for more than $45 million in reported  losses. Additional information may be found at: www.antifraudcentre-centreantifraude.ca.   National Child Exploitation Coordination Centre  The RCMP National Child Exploitation Coordination Centre (NCECC) works with law  enforcement partners, government agencies, non-government organizations and industry  stakeholders across Canada and internationally to combat the online sexual exploitation of  children. The NCECC also works closely with the Canadian Centre for Child Protection, an  organization that operates Canada’s national tipline (www.cybertip.ca) for reporting the online  sexual exploitation of children. In 2014, the NCECC received nearly 8,500 reported incidents  and requests for assistance from law enforcement and other partners concerning online child  sexual exploitation.                       Criminal investigations   At the federal level, the RCMP investigates serious and organized crime, economic crime, a range of  national security threats, and enforces Federal statutes. These investigations may extend to federal  offences involving suspected cybercrime activities, such as money laundering and terrorist financing,  market fraud, threats to Canada’s critical infrastructure, intellectual property infringements or drug  trafficking. The RCMP works in concert with domestic and international law enforcement partners  and other stakeholders to combat cybercrime threats that cross jurisdictional boundaries and require  joint force operations.   International policing plays a pivotal role in the RCMP’s response to cybercrime. Cybercrime is often  transnational, where a perpetrator in one country can affect victims in many others. As evidence of  criminal activity may easily flow across national borders in cyberspace, the RCMP must work with  multilateral partners to obtain and analyze evidence, which is enabled by police-to-police information  sharing and formal legal mechanisms. Given the borderless nature of cybercrime, the RCMP works  closely with its domestic and international law enforcement partners, and other stakeholders in both  public and private sectors, to address common cybercrime threats through various enforcement  measures, leading to arrests and charges or other disruption outcomes.   Through contract policing services, the RCMP plays a significant role in addressing cybercrime in  contracted provinces, territories and municipalities. Law enforcement activities in these jurisdictions  extend to a range of criminal offences where the Internet and related technologies play an integral  role, such as online child sexual exploitation, local and regional types of fraud, or various offences  associated with cyber bullying.    10 Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy  Specialized Services   The RCMP’s specialized and technological services play a critical role in cybercrime investigations.  Cybercrime often involves surreptitious online activity, where the right law enforcement skills and  tools are required to attribute cybercrime activity to a source, identify possible suspects and handle  high volumes of digital evidence, such as terabytes of data from lawfully seized computers, hard  drives and mobile devices. Cybercrime investigations differ significantly from traditional criminal  investigations. They have a greater requirement for operating in online environments through open  source analysis and covert means, and obtaining and analyzing data - and potential digital evidence  - to drive investigations. This work is critical to criminal investigations with cyber elements, and will  increase in complexity and volume as criminals continue to exploit new and emerging technologies.    The RCMP Technical Investigation Services (TIS) is a key part of the RCMP’s specialized services for  cybercrime investigations. The TIS provides technical domain expertise and digital forensic services to  cybercrime investigations to all levels of policing in Canada, in addition to those involving international  policing. The TIS maintains expertise in the forensic investigation of computers and networks, and  provides other specialized services, such as expert testimony in criminal court proceedings involving  cybercrime investigations. The RCMP Integrated Technological Crime Units (ITCUs) also provide  specialized services to cybercrime investigations. ITCUs are strategically located across Canada to  respond to cybercrime incidents in collaboration with other domestic and international police services,  and often lead cybercrime investigations on behalf of Canada that are national or international in scope.  These units also process and analyze digital evidence in support of cybercrime and other criminal  investigations, which may involve computer forensics, network systems analysis, data recovery and  retrieval, malware reverse engineering, and acquiring operational tools in support of cybercrime  investigative techniques.   The RCMP’s specialized services also extend to equipping law enforcement with the right training  and skills to combat cybercrime. Cybercrime investigations require basic and advanced training to  keep pace with criminals in cyberspace. As part of its National Police Services, the RCMP, through  the Canadian Police College, provides law enforcement training and educational opportunities on  cybercrime investigations and intelligence gathering. The National Police Services are a coordinated  and integrated series of programs and services accessible to Canadian law enforcement that assist in  the investigation of crime, including cybercrime.    11Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy  RCMP Cybercrime Operational Framework The RCMP Cybercrime Operational Framework is designed to capture the RCMP’s vision, pillars,  objectives and strategic enablers to combat cybercrime, which cascade throughout the action plan in  the next section. The framework and action plan centre on core policing operations in the cyber realm,  and equipping the RCMP with the right people, skills and tools in a digital era.

Through key international bodies, such as INTERPOL, EUROPOL, G7 and Five Eyes working  groups, the RCMP will continue to work with its international law enforcement allies to identify  and address common cybercrime threats.     18 Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy  The RCMP will also examine ways to bolster its international role in combating cybercrime,  such as playing more active and leadership roles in shared international threat assessments and  prioritization activities against cybercrime. This work may include international law enforcement  activities involving the RCMP, such as: the Five Eyes Law Enforcement Group, Cyber Crime  Working Group; the Europol’s Cyber Crime Centre, Joint Cybercrime Taskforce; the G7 Roma  Lyon Group, High-Tech Crime Subgroup; the NCFTA International Task Force; and the  INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation.     Action Item Sucess Indicators Planned Timeline 13. Examine ways to further  inform Canadians and industry of  emerging cybercrime threats.   Links to operational framework: P1; O1; O2; O3; E3; E6  - Provide Canadians and industry  with more relevant and timely  information on cybercrime threats. - Encourage Canadians and  industry to take proactive  measures against cybercrime.   Ongoing.  Description: Under the broad context of cyber security, public and private sector organizations,  and Canadians themselves, play important roles in addressing cybercrime. The private sector  has a critical cyber role in securing its own networks and systems of wider importance, such as  telecommunications, banking and other critical infrastructure sectors. Canadians should also  take basic measures to protect themselves online, such as using up-to-date cyber security and  anti-virus software, using unique and secure user names and passwords, and downloading online  applications from only trusted sources. To take these and other proactive measures against cyber  threats, Canadians and industry must be aware of cybercrimes facing Canada.   To address this requirement, the RCMP will continue to work with Public Safety Canada and  other organizations by informing Canadians and industry of new and emerging cybercrime  threats. Notably, the RCMP National Crime Prevention Services assist with public awareness  and educational strategies to prevent cyber bullying, including initiatives related to Public  Safety Canada’s GetCyberSafe campaigns. The RCMP will continue to support the GetCyberSafe  campaigns through youth crime prevention activities. The RCMP will also look for ways to  increase industry’s awareness of emerging cybercrime threats through the Canadian Association  of Chiefs of Police, Private Sector Liaison Committee, and improved information-sharing between  the RCMP National Critical Infrastructure Team and critical infrastructure owners and operators.  14. Continue to support the  modernization of Canada’s legal  and policy tools to keep pace with  technological change.   Links to operational framework: P2; O6; E7  - Modernized and new criminal  offences and investigative legal  tools to better address cybercrime  in Canada. - Improve law enforcement’s  ability to conduct international  cybercrime investigations through  harmonized legal tools between  state allies.   Ongoing.    19Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy  Description: At all levels of government, the RCMP and other Canadian police forces address  cybercrime within the boundaries of Canada’s legal environment, which includes a combination of  jurisprudence, legislation, public policies, and other legal and policy instruments. While the RCMP  Cybercrime Strategy focuses on strengthening the RCMP’s posture against cybercrime within today’s  legal environment, it is clear that Canada’s legal and public policy regime will need to keep pace with  the evolution of technology to permit the effective investigation of cybercrime, both domestically and  internationally.   The RCMP will continue to support Canada’s modernization of criminal offences and investigative  tools to better address crime in a digital age. The RCMP will also engage Canada’s criminal justice  community and identify requirements for educating prosecutors on cybercrime investigations and  the novel legal aspects of cybercrime.

Links to operational framework: P2; O6; E4  - Provide a leadership role in  developing a framework for a  ‘national’ law enforcement strategy  to combat cybercrime. - Identify actions that could be  taken by all Canadian police  forces to more effectively address  cybercrime.    Ongoing.  Description: Cybercrime represents a shared and common threat to all levels of policing in Canada,  and requires collaboration between the RCMP and its Canadian law enforcement partners.     To address this requirement, the RCMP and its Canadian law enforcement partners, through the  Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, Electronic Crime Committee, and other fora, continue  to discuss and develop coordinated, national law enforcement approaches to combat cybercrime.  Consistent with this approach, the RCMP will use the RCMP Cybercrime Strategy as a basis to  lead the development of broader national law enforcement strategies against cybercrime, including  measures to develop a broader account of cybercrime based on aggregated police data, and to  identify and improve shared, multi-jurisdictional law enforcement operations, collaboration and  deconfliction measures against cybercrime. The RCMP will also engage other key stakeholders,  such as the National Police Services National Advisory Committee and the Five Eyes Law  Enforcement Group, Cyber Crime Working Group, to fully examine operational requirements  for a national law enforcement strategy to combat cybercrime.         20 Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy  Conclusion  Cybercrime has an immediate, tangible and ongoing impact on Canadians. On a macro level,  cybercrime affects Canadian government and critical infrastructure systems and the integrity of  Canada’s economy and financial sectors. On a personal level, cybercrime involves personal financial  losses, the infringement of privacy rights and the grievous harm associated with offences such as child  sexual exploitation and cyber bullying. These threats continue to evolve and require a paradigm shift  in how crimes are understood and policed in a digital era. They require a law enforcement response  that addresses the criminal element in cyberspace while complementing broader government and  industry security measures.       The RCMP Cybercrime Strategy identifies key steps that Canada’s national police force will take to  address this challenge. The strategy’s action items are operationally relevant and will enable the RCMP  to more effectively keep pace with cybercrime. The RCMP’s cyber deliverables will be measured and  reported on through Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy.     The RCMP Cybercrime Strategy will strengthen the RCMP’s ability to work with its domestic and  international law enforcement partners and other stakeholders to combat cybercrime.       21Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy    22 Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cybercrime Strategy",

Fiji has also emerged as a respected advocate on some of the great challenges facing humanity, including climate change, sustainable development and the preservation of our oceans. Fiji’s National Development Plan (NDP), with the vision of “Transforming Fiji”, maps out the way forward for Fiji and all Fijians to realise our full potential as a nation. For the first time, Fiji has both a 20-Year Development Plan (2017-2036) and a comprehensive 5-Year Development Plan (2017-2021). These plans work together, as the 5-Year Development Plan provides a detailed action agenda with specific targets and policies that are aligned to the long-term transformational 20-Year Development Plan. This forward-looking NDP is the outcome of a nationwide consultation process that involved the private sector, civil society, community groups, government and the general public. It reflects the aspirations of the Fijian people, and their Government’s commitment to deliver on these goals. Inclusive socio-economic development is at the heart of this NDP, and the strategies within are ultimately designed to empower every Fijian and widen the reach of programmes, services and networks of infrastructure to transform Fiji for every Fijian. The NDP is aligned with global commitments including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Consistent with the goal of the Paris Agreement to achieve climate neutrality and a low-emission world, we will develop a 2050 Pathway to decarbonise the Fijian economy. The integrated nature of development and the need for multi-sectoral solutions are recognised and addressed. Critical cross-cutting issues such as climate change, green growth, the environment, gender equality, disability and governance are mainstreamed in the NDP. Progress of the NDP will be monitored to help keep implementation on track and ensure our collective vision is realised. We thank all Fijians for their input and suggestions in taking our country forward. Honourable Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum Attorney-General and Minister for Economy At no time in our history have Fijians held greater confidence in the direction of our nation or in the future we are working together to build. Our income levels are steadily increasing, we have moved up the ladder to become an upper middle-income country, and our living standards are the highest they have ever been, as Fijians enjoy the benefits of eight consecutive years of economic growth.

We are at a point of strength with a rapidly expanding economy, improving infrastructure and institutions, a large number of young people, growing digital connectivity, a stronger standing in the international arena, and continuing inherent geographical and environmental advantages. These positive developments and advantages provide a sound platform for future prosperity. The Plan builds upon these strengths and enablers to expand the development frontier to further transform Fiji. The 20-Year Development Plan provides the forward- looking vision for “Transforming Fiji” towards an even more progressive, vibrant and inclusive society. It outlines a framework that encompasses strategic policy manoeuvres, new approaches to development and the aspirations of all Fijians. The Plan consists of two prongs or approaches, which are designated as: “Inclusive Socio-economic Development” and “Transformational Strategic Thrusts”. These prongs are mutually inclusive and reinforcing. ° Inclusive Socio-economic Development- will ensure that all socio economic rights in the Constitution are realised. Inclusivity will be at the centre of growth and development, and the benefits of prosperity will be spread as widely as possible to improve the social well-being of all Fijians. No one will be left behind regardless of geographical location, gender, ethnicity, physical and intellectual capability and social and economic status. ° Transformational Strategic Thrusts- are game changing forward-looking policy shifts to expand our development frontier and support the vision of transforming Fiji. New and emerging growth sectors will be nurtured, connectivity within and to the outside world will be improved, new technologies will be embraced, productivity will be maximised, human capital development will be accelerated and green growth will be a key guiding principle in the implementation of this Plan. 1.1 Inclusive Socio-economic Development Inclusive socio-economic development is essential to further improve the living standards of Fijians. Sustained economic expansion supported by private sector investment and trade and the enhanced provision of social services and public goods will be paramount. Macroeconomic and fiscal stability will be maintained. A wide range of sector policies and programmes have been identified with detailed plans for implementation to achieve these goals and targets. Successful implementation of the overall strategy will support the realisation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). y Fourfold Increase in GDP per Person Fiji has graduated to the group of upper middle-income countries. Our current per capita income stands at around $10,000. Based on current economic performance, economic outlook and projected population growth, Fiji is likely to achieve a fourfold increase in per capita income by 2036. This is consistent with a sustained annual real GDP growth averaging 4 to 5 percent, investment levels of 25 percent of GDP and an inflation target of 2 to 3 percent. A fourfold increase in per capita income over the next 20 years will raise Fiji up the international development ladder and lead to tangible improvements in the lives of all Fijians. Effectively implementing the transformational strategic thrusts will be critical to realising these gains. The Fijian Government is fully committed to delivering this overall objective and to achieving inclusive growth and development. y Government Debt to be Reduced to 35 Percent of GDP With more than fourfold growth in nominal GDP expected, government debt will be reduced to 35 percent of GDP over the next 20 years. This commitment will be achieved through an expansion in the overall size of the economy resulting from transformational shifts rather than by constraining the development budgets of government. With the rapid expansion in the economy, rising government revenues will create more fiscal space for the required future public expenditure. Nominal GDP is expected to grow twice as fast as the nominal debt. This will support both overall development and financial sustainability. y Reducing Unemployment Rate to Below 4 Percent With sustained economic expansion and the implementation of new job creation policies, the unemployment rate will be reduced to below 4 percent. All Fijians will be empowered with education and skill sets so that they may be easily absorbed into the workforce. A key focus will be on skills development and turning job seekers into job creators. With the establishment of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) Council and Central Coordinating Agency, greater support and incentives will be provided to small and medium enterprises. New growth sectors with high labour- absorption capacity will be nurtured and expanded. Seasonal employment opportunities overseas will also be effectively utilised. y Eradicating Poverty With the rapid economic and social development over TWENTY YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2036 3 the last decade, poverty is now on a declining trend. A new measure of poverty that incorporates relevant and measurable social determinants will be developed to help guide improvements to service delivery. Extreme poverty and hardship will be eradicated, and well-being improved for all. This will be addressed through a multi-sectoral approach, sustainable growth and better access to social services. Targeted social protection will continue to be provided for the vulnerable through new initiatives to empower Fijians so that they may graduate out of poverty. y 100 Percent Access to Clean and Safe Water and Proper Sanitation Every Fijian has a right to clean and safe water in adequate quantities. For the urban areas, 100 percent access to clean and safe water will be realised by 2021 and for the rural and maritime areas by 2030. Resources will be allocated for sustained maintenance and construction of new water treatment plants, reservoirs and reticulation systems, rural water schemes, development of groundwater sources, setting up desalination plants in the maritime region, and distribution of water tanks in rural areas. To support low-income households, the free water programme will continue. To meet the long-term demand, new dam sites including Sovi river catchment, upper Waimanu River and Waibogi in the upper reaches of Navua River have been identified. Other potential sites in the Western and Northern divisions will be identified in the future, and feasibility studies will be undertaken for new dam development. Consideration will be given to joint development of both water supply and hydro-power. Innovative technologies will be adopted for industrial recycling, rainwater harvesting and storage, storm water and aquifer management and use of renewable energy for desalination plants. Building climate resilient water infrastructure will be a key aspect of all new projects. Leak reduction programmes will continue so that piped- water losses are significantly reduced, and other water conservation initiatives will be pursued. To build resilience to climate change, adaptation measures will be implemented to protect freshwater aquifers from saltwater intrusion. Public awareness and education on water conservation and management will be increased to support adaptation to changes in seasonal rainfall patterns that may occur due to climate change. To ensure improved sanitation, 70 percent of the population will have access to centralised sewerage systems within the next 20 years. Public sewerage treatment systems will be built and expanded in all urban centres. Sustainable and viable sewerage and sanitation options will also be explored for rural areas. Ensuring that every Fijian household is connected to a proper sewerage treatment system is a key priority. y Electricity for All Ninety percent of the population currently has access to electricity. Electrification projects in the rural and maritime areas will be expedited to ensure that the entire population has access to electricity by 2021. Further grid extensions will be undertaken in Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Ovalau and Taveuni. Government will continue to fully fund rural electrification projects, including connections for households near the grid lines. For the rural and outer islands, decentralised renewable energy sources such as solar, mini hydro, hybrid biofuel/ diesel operated generators and wind systems will be adopted where feasible. Electricity generation from renewable energy sources will be increased to 100 percent by 2036. Apart from the ongoing hydro projects such as the Qaliwana/Upper Wailoa Diversion Hydro Project and Lower Ba Hydro Project, new areas will be identified for feasibility studies. Other renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, biomass, geothermal and wave and tidal energy will be developed where they are viable and affordable. Future electricity infrastructure projects will be climate- resilient, and opportunities for underground cables for electricity distribution will be explored and adopted where feasible. Carbon credits under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) will be employed as part of the financing arrangements. Other sources of climate finance will also be accessed. 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 4 Independent power producers of both small- and large- scale electricity production will be supported with fair pricing for sale of electricity. The ongoing regulatory reforms in the electricity sector with the partial divestment of FEA will promote private sector participation and raise efficiency and service delivery. y Provision of Affordable Housing All households will have access to affordable housing through the construction of new housing units. Ensuring that more land is made available for home construction will help increase the supply of housing. Government will encourage both public and private investments in the provision of housing units with strata titles. Investment in the establishment of “vertical villages” will be supported to accommodate a more diverse group of Fijians, that is, with differing incomes, cultural and occupational backgrounds and family sizes. This diversity will help improve the marketability of public housing units with strata titles. The Housing Authority and Public Rental Board will ensure that more land is developed for residential lots and more affordable and accessible housing is provided. Private sector investments in residential lot developments will be supported and incentivised. Government will continue to support landowners to develop residential lots on iTaukei land. This will increase the availability of housing lots and at the same time ensure profit making opportunities for landowners. Government financial support for new home construction and purchase of first homes will be maintained. Informal settlements will continue to be upgraded and leases granted to those on state land. Leases will also be granted to informal settlements on iTaukei land with the consent of landowners. Income-generating projects to support the creation of sustainable livelihoods will continue in economically depressed rural areas. Future public housing will be designed to cater for people with disabilities and special needs. Building standards will also be uplifted to withstand natural disasters. To assist those households whose homes are destroyed in natural disasters and by fire, government will set up a contingency fund and explore opportunities for disaster insurance schemes with bilateral development partners and multilateral financial institutions. This is critical given Fiji’s vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters. y Universal Access to Quality Education Universal access to education at all levels will be maintained with a focus on improving the quality of education. This will increase the supply of well-trained, world-class professionals who are equipped for job opportunities in the global market. Investments will be undertaken to improve existing and new education facilities, purchase new equipment and materials, embrace digital learning and improve teacher performance. Teacher-to-student ratios will be improved and maintained, with more hiring and in-service teacher training to improve teaching quality. Government will continue with the free education initiative through per capita grants to schools. Initiatives such as the bus-fare and boat-fare subsidies, free textbooks and other financial assistance will continue to ensure that no one is deprived of quality education. Early childhood education (ECE) will be improved, and ECE centres will be attached to all primary schools around Fiji. The curriculum for primary and secondary schools will be reviewed to support national integration and prepare Fijians for a transformed Fiji, to accommodate creative and active learning and to develop entrepreneurial skills, learning by doing, and effective peer learning. This holistic approach will incorporate enhanced parental engagement to support learning. Tertiary education will be further improved to focus on current and future needs, including the future demands of the labour market. Technical and vocational training for lifelong learning will continue with the establishment of more technical colleges. This will assist in the creation of technical skills needed by all sectors of the economy. The education system will be made more inclusive by establishing facilities to accommodate children with disabilities and special needs. y High Quality Healthcare System In the next 20 years, medical services will be raised to international standards with a major focus on tertiary health care and overall medical service delivery. Investments will be made to reduce patient waiting time, improve hospital services, increase the number of beds, improve ambulance services and raise the doctor-to- patient ratio to 1 doctor per 1,000 people. Government will continue with the free medicine scheme to assist low- income households. TWENTY YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2036 5 Investments in the construction of new hospitals, health centres and nursing stations will continue. Inventory management will be improved, and other opportunities will be explored to ensure that drugs and consumables are available at all times. New and modern equipment will be made readily available. The government is exploring options to engage strategic partners in the management and operation of certain public hospitals to improve their service delivery. Incentives are already in place to attract private sector investment in tertiary health care. A major focus moving forward will be to ensure that Fijians can take advantage of specialised tertiary care in Fiji rather than having to pay high medical bills overseas. Tertiary health care services have the potential to become an important growth sector and revenue earner and assist Fiji to become the health hub of the South Pacific. More emphasis will be placed on preventive health care by promoting healthy eating habits, physical activity and other lifestyle changes to reduce Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs). y Food and Nutrition Security Food and nutrition security will be improved by ensuring increased local production, raising farm efficiency and productivity, and developing more effective distribution systems. Agriculture and fisheries programmes will be enhanced, and local produce made available to all Fijians. New technology, mechanisation and better production practices will be adopted. Market linkages will be improved. Large-scale production will be encouraged and supported to achieve greater economies of scale. Organic farming will be promoted, and production of traditional crops and niche agricultural and fisheries products will be pursued. Production will be made more climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable. To adapt to climate change, increased funding will be directed towards agriculture research into crop varieties that can be more resilient to expected changes in weather patterns. In addition, extension training will evolve to ensure that farming practices adapt to changes due to climate change. y Women in Development Women will be empowered, allowing them opportunities for greater participation in leadership and decision- making across all sectors. Police and the courts will appropriately attend to gender-based violence in all its forms. Such is the confidence in these initiatives that 100 percent reporting of these crimes is expected. The law and justice system that protects the public and deters crime will be functional and responsive. Gender inequality and discrimination will be eliminated, providing women with greater choice and freedom for their participation in the family and society. Women’s access to education will be supported, as will their desires for fulfilling employment and career advancement. Women who choose to have children will be adequately remunerated for paid work and will be able to continue to advance their careers if that is their wish. It is expected that home duties in caring for children and household work will be shared by the spouse or partner. Support for women’s health and decisions regarding family planning and sexual and reproductive health will be shared and respected. Access to health and other social services will be improved and available as required. Women will be included and consulted in all planning for future development projects, and their input will be translated into tangible project outcomes. This includes adaptation planning at the community level, where women can be key agents to change unsustainable production and consumption practices within the family and community. Response to Gender Based Violence (GBV) continues to be a strong focus of government policy and programmes. GBV service delivery protocols will ensure that the health sector provides strong support to victims. y Protecting Culture, Heritage and Natural Environment Fiji has a rich cultural diversity and heritage that will be protected and promoted. Our language, food, festivals, rituals, arts and traditions, which hold essential intrinsic value, will be preserved. Local culture and heritage will be promoted as part of our vibrant tourism industry. Intellectual property rights for protection of traditional knowledge will be developed and strengthened. There will be an increased focus on proper management of our forests, mangroves and coral reefs because of the complex natural biodiversity that these systems support. These natural systems are critical for food and nutrition security, sustaining endemic flora and fauna, and maintaining the natural balance in nature. Our pristine natural environment will be protected, and the economy will be made more climate-resilient. 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 6 y National Security Government will ensure a safe, secure and stable Fiji guided by the National Security Strategy. The rule of law will be upheld and the Constitution will be protected. Adequate resources will be allocated to prevent and appropriately respond to domestic and transnational crimes, border security and access to justice. Responsive security forces and police, together with an adapting legislative and policy framework, will support a strong approach to the administration of justice and maintenance of the rule of law. Fiji will also continue its role in UN Peacekeeping missions. 1.2 Transformational Strategic Thrusts Given our geographical location, economic prospects, ongoing infrastructure development and strong institutions, Fiji is well positioned to become the modern regional hub of the South Pacific. y Nurturing New and Emerging Growth Sectors The Fijian economy has evolved over time with a more diversified and broad economic base. Moving forward, new growth sectors will be nurtured to enable the economy to thrive and create more jobs. Existing sectors will be expanded and modernised. Large-scale commercialisation will be pursued together with Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) development. Development of niche products and services for export will be pursued. This includes organic agricultural produce, agro-processing, premium-quality garments, increasing the range of tourism products (sports tourism, cruise tourism, wedding tourism, retirement villages, medical tourism and conference tourism), filmmaking, regional communications and transport services, and many other new sector initiatives. Value addition will be further developed in resource-based sectors such as forestry, fisheries and agriculture to support new manufacturing industries. Ecotourism to promote our unique flora and fauna, cultural diversity and adventure tourism such as whale and dolphin watching will be developed. Promotion of traditional handicrafts, natural body products, local ceramic ware, and exotic herbs and spices will be nurtured and expanded, offering more opportunities for women to use their traditional skills to expand opportunities for economic empowerment. To support development of sports tourism, investments in new sporting facilities built to international standards will be prioritised together with increased accommodation capacity. Fiji will continue to position itself to host international sporting events such as the Pacific Games, Commonwealth Games, International Rugby Sevens, Super 15 rugby matches, golf tournaments and other sports. Developing ICT and improving prospects for the audio- visual industry and film-making will be achieved in partnership with the private sector. This will include the development of large production studios, enhanced availability of specialised equipment and nurturing of local talent. Service sectors such as financial services and insurance will be expanded, and new manufacturing sectors will be supported. The business climate, including administrative and regulatory processes, will be further improved to facilitate private sector investment, including enticing more foreign investment. Government will provide the necessary infrastructure and enabling services. Marketing will play a crucial part in developing these sectors. Options will be explored for regional marketing in areas like tourism. Government, together with the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) Council, will continue to support and incentivise MSMEs and thereby create more jobs and encourage inclusive growth. Training, mentoring, access to finance and advisory services will be enhanced to harness the true potential of the MSME sector. The secured transactions framework to allow use of movable property as collateral, and government’s MSME financing and credit guarantee scheme, will improve financing and growth of MSMEs. Access to markets through improvements in infrastructure and marketing services will be developed. National branding campaigns such as the Fijian Made and Buy Fijian initiatives will be further enhanced. y Improving Transport and Digital Connectivity Greater connectivity is central to transforming Fiji. Transportation networks within the country and connectivity to the outside world will be enhanced. We will also continue to modernise Fiji’s air, maritime and land transport networks and weather recording, forecasting and reporting services to meet our long term needs and aspirations. Apart from transport connectivity, there will be a major focus on digital connectivity. All this will support human capital development, commerce and trade. TWENTY YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2036 7 ROAD TRANSPORTATION Investment in road infrastructure is essential for future growth. Modernising our road infrastructure will continue to support strong economic expansion, rising income levels, the increase in urban population and the growth in agriculture and industries. New roads will be developed and existing ones improved. More road expansions, including four-lane projects, will be undertaken. Current four-lane projects such as Nausori airport to Suva and Nadi airport to Denarau will be completed by 2018. Government will embark on major projects to seal a large portion of the existing gravel roads over the next 20 years. Where practical, consideration will be given to diverting roads inland to open up land for social and economic development. Installation of streetlights in all major urban centres and peri-urban areas and in front of villages and settlements along the Queens and Kings Roads will continue. This will also be expanded to Vanua Levu. Apart from improving aesthetics and road safety, this will encourage development of MSMEs such as roadside stalls and help with employment and income generation. New footpaths will be constructed across populated areas, major cities and towns to make roads safer for pedestrians and drivers. Traffic lights will be installed at critical junctions where there are high traffic flows. This will assist in managing traffic congestion and improve safety. To accommodate the rising number of vehicles, investments in larger car parks and the expansion of bus bays on high-traffic roads will be facilitated. Private sector partnerships will be essential in pursuing some of these initiatives. Investment in upgrading our bridges and constructing new ones will continue. This will include development of access roads to connect farming areas to markets. Road transportation will be made more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. Better emission and fuel standards will be adopted. Government will support importation and use of fuel-efficient hybrid and electric vehicles to reduce fuel importation and protect the environment. AIR CONNECTIVITY International and domestic airports will be modernised and upgraded to international standards. This has already commenced with the modernisation of the Nadi International Airport, which involves the upgrading of the terminal, widening of the runway, pavement rehabilitation and construction of new aprons and parking areas. To meet the demand for increasing visitor arrivals, a second terminal will be developed, and to improve service for passengers flying to other destinations in Fiji, the domestic terminal at the Nadi International Airport will be upgraded. A new international airport will be developed in Vanua Levu, and the Nausori International Airport will be revamped and expanded. Fiji Airways will continue to renew and expand its fleet with leasing of new aircrafts. New air connections will be explored and new routes developed. This will be aligned to our plans for the expansion of new tourist source markets, including attracting visitors from emerging regions such as Southeast Asia and North and South America. Domestic air services will be enhanced to support the growth in the tourism industry and more-efficient mobility of all passengers within the country. Major upgrading works will be undertaken at domestic airports and airstrips over the next 20 years. PORT SERVICES AND INTER-ISLAND NETWORK Government will work in partnership with strategic partners to make our ports more efficient and modern. Port infrastructure will continue to be modernised, and services will be improved further to facilitate trade and commerce. Modern technology, efficient cargo- handling machinery and international best practices will be adopted to enhance Fiji’s position as the hub of the Pacific. A Ports Master Plan is being prepared to guide the long- term development of our ports. Options are being explored for the establishment of a new port in Valaga Bay in Vanua Levu. Feasibility studies will be undertaken to identify other new sites for future port development including Natovi jetty. Investments in modern slipways, the revival of the shipbuilding and maintenance industry will be pursued. Government is exploring the possibility of upgrading and expanding the current Suva wharf facility to cater for future cargo and passenger demand. Upgrade works at a number of outer island ports will also be undertaken. The inter-island sea-transport network is critical for Fijians living in the maritime islands. Shipping services will be improved to ensure reliability, safety, efficiency and affordability of ferry services. Government will continue 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 8 to subsidise uneconomical sea routes to ensure that shipping services are provided on a regular basis to these regions. This will support transportation, commerce and income-generating opportunities in the maritime region. DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY Digital connectivity through high-speed internet networks and broadband access will be improved, and all areas of Fiji will be digitally connected. Competition will be enhanced in broadband internet services by making communication infrastructure available to multiple users under reasonable terms and conditions. Fibre optic connectivity between Viti Levu and Vanua Levu will be established, and the fibre optic ring around Viti Levu will be completed. All utility providers will cooperate in laying fibre optic cable conduits and chambers when undertaking trenching works during road construction or maintenance. Government will expand existing telecentres and establish new ones around the country. Digital literacy will be improved. Such improved connectivity will provide employment opportunities for all Fijians living in rural and remote communities, and more employment in IT support services will be realised. These developments will create a more conducive environment for commerce and development, including attracting new sources of investment and growth. y Skill Development and Demographic Dividend Fiji has a great opportunity to exploit its demographic dividend. With 62 percent of the population below the age of 34, we are a young nation. The continued investment in education and skill development with an increasing working age population will not only provide a valuable pool of human resources for Fiji’s future development needs but also help turn job seekers into job creators. Government will work closely with industry, tertiary education institutions and development partners to prepare a workforce of highly skilled Fijians in line with future industry demand, in particular for the new growth sectors. Skills development in areas such as trades and craftsmanship, engineering and IT-related professions, health care services, hospitality and aged care, foreign languages, resource-based sector expertise, and education and other services will be supported. The intelligence and capability of women will be further realised, and they will be encouraged to choose from a variety of occupations, many of which were previously the domain of men. Initiatives will be introduced to promote the employment of Fijians with these new skills by both small and large- scale businesses. Support will be provided for youth entrepreneurship. The development of professionalism in sports provides another opportunity for employment generation and to position Fiji as a source of world-class athletes. Government will continue to invest in the potential of our youth to develop into world-class athletes and sports administrators. Sports complexes, rural sporting grounds and school sporting facilities will be improved and new ones constructed to international standards. Talent will be identified and developed from an early age with world-class training and coaching through the National Academy of Sports. Assistance will continue to be provided to enable international coaches to be hired and thereby improve our competitiveness. Corporate sponsorship in sports will also be incentivised to encourage better partnerships in sports development. y Embracing Appropriate and New Technology for Productivity Improvement Appropriate new technology will be adopted to raise overall efficiency and productivity and to improve service delivery across all sectors. Adoption of new technology will be supported in areas like transportation, renewable energy, manufacturing, agriculture, ICT, education and other service-related sectors. Innovation, research and implementation of new ideas will also be incentivised. A facilitative environment will be created to assist the importation of new and modern technology. Government will explore options to provide the necessary infrastructure to embrace new technology. This will include installing chargers for electric vehicles across the country, supporting vehicle upgrades to accommodate better fuel standards and promoting technology transfer. In the manufacturing sector, greater value-addition and investment in energy-efficient machinery and equipment will be incentivised. Government will support the increased use of cloud computing, 3D printing, inter-networking of smart devices and other emerging technologies to improve efficiency and productivity. For agriculture, government will further explore mechanised land preparation and harvesting, modern seed-breeding methods, and hydroponic and greenhouse farming techniques to address the issues of poor soil fertility, declining farm productivity and intermittent local supply. Service industries involved in the transportation of goods and passengers could benefit from greater government TWENTY YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2036 9 investment in modern traffic management software and equipment, as well as dedicated bus and truck lanes. For the tourism industry, increased use of marketing automation, a stronger social media presence, use of smart-phone applications for customer bookings and enquiries, and investment in smart appliances will be promoted to improve service delivery. All major government services will be placed online. E-Government platforms to speed up approvals processes, business registration, land use administration, taxation, and other services will be further streamlined. ICT-based planning, budgeting and monitoring will be used in the public sector to improve work processes, productivity and service delivery. IT related skills will continue to be developed and retained. y Building Vibrant Cities and Towns and a Stronger Rural Economy Development will be balanced to ensure the development of both a stronger rural economy and vibrant urban centres. To create vibrant urban centres, existing city and town schemes will be reviewed, and new growth centres will be identified and developed. Urban areas will be further modernised with improved facilities and services. Transport infrastructure, housing development, law-and- order facilities, bus stands and fresh-food markets will be restructured and redeveloped where needed for improved convenience and better urban management. Disaster response within cities will be improved through better early warning systems, inter-agency coordination and enhanced disaster response capacities. New towns and cities will be established, and town boundaries will be extended where necessary. Spatial plans and long-term miniature models will be developed to guide the future development of all urban centres. Cities will be beautified with development of recreation facilities and parks, urban gardens and better zoning. Traffic management plans will be enhanced to ease traffic congestion. Government is exploring options to decentralise some of its offices currently based in Suva to the Western and Northern divisions. This would involve private partnerships for investment in new buildings and facilities and other support for the future growth of these urban centres. Such investment will create the platform for more private-sector investment to follow and thereby ensure that urbanisation is spread more across the country. Rural development will be prioritised with improvements in infrastructure and provision of adequate public utilities. Agriculture and other sectors will be supported to generate income opportunities for people in rural and maritime areas. The Ministry of Agriculture will create better linkages to enhance the marketing, promotion and value- addition of local agricultural produce. Costing and Financing The implementation of the entire plan is expected to inject over $50 billion of government investment over the next 20 years. This includes both funding for capital expenditure and expenditure for provision of social services. To finance this, government will mobilise its domestic revenues, both tax and non-tax, and access international financial resources, including funding from multilateral development partners. Self-funding of projects undertaken by State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and municipal councils will complement funding from the central government. Financing through private sector partnerships and climate finance will increasingly be a core source of financing.

STRENGTHS AND ENABLING ENVIRONMENT 11 Strengths & Enabling Environment 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 12 2.0 STRENGTHS AND ENABLING ENVIRONMENT Fiji has evolved over the years in terms of its demography, economic and social development, institutions and governance. The majority of our population are young, presenting a great opportunity for further development. Our economy has almost doubled in the last 10 years, with real per capita incomes rising every year. Trade flows have increased, and investment levels are also growing. Significant achievements have been made in social development. Fiji’s image has been transformed to that of a country of equal opportunities for all. Infrastructure is continually improving through substantial public sector investment. The business regulatory environment and the tax regime have been reformed to support commerce. Technological advancements have been made on many fronts, and the country is digitally connected. 2.1 Demography Fiji’s population was estimated at 865,611 in 2014 and is projected to exceed 1.1million in the next 20 years. With around 62 percent of the population below the age of 34, we are a young nation. The rate of outward migration has steadily declined and further declines are anticipated based on current trends. The population distribution is also changing. Urban population is rising, and 61 percent of the population is expected to live in urban areas in the next 20 years. While the majority of the urban population is between the ages of 15 and 44, rural population is dominated by the young under the age of 14 and the elderly aged 60 years and over. This offers both opportunities and challenges for the future. The national census that will be conducted this year will provide more up-to-date population statistics and demographic structure. 2.2 Economic Development GLOBAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS As a small, open economy, Fiji has both benefited and at times has been negatively affected by global economic developments. However, despite the uncertainties in the global economy, Fiji can capitalise on a number of positive global developments. Oil prices have been low, although rising slowly recently. Fiji’s major trading partners are performing relatively well. The prospects for Fiji’s exports and visitor arrivals are promising, and there are new opportunities for offshore employment and growth in remittances. Changing global economic power and the rise of emerging economies also provide new opportunities that could be tapped. DOMESTIC ECONOMY Despite the frequent occurrence of natural disasters and external shocks, the Fijian economy has been quite resilient. Economic growth has been positive since 2009. This has been one of the longest periods of uninterrupted economic growth since independence. The average growth rate from 2011 to 2015 has been close to 4 percent. Growth has been broad-based and spurred by record tourist arrivals, a booming construction industry, strong consumption, and rising manufacturing, finance and transportation sectors. Growth in the medium-term is also expected to be positive and strong. Total investment increased to an estimated 26 percent of GDP in 2015, driven largely by private sector investment. This trend is expected to continue and increase further. Both exports and imports have increased over the years. While current account deficits have posed challenges for the balance of payments, positive financial flows have supported the strong increase in foreign reserves since 2009. Foreign reserves at the end of 2016 stood at $1.92 billion, sufficient to cover 5.1 months of retained imports of goods and non-factor services. The healthy foreign reserves levels will support our future foreign exchange requirements, including requirements for the imports needed to undertake development projects. Inflation has been moderating over the recent years, underpinned by lower prices of food, clothing and footwear, communication, and education. However, temporary spikes have been prevalent due to the impacts of natural disasters. The prevailing low and stable global food and fuel prices and reduction in the VAT rate have maintained inflation at acceptable levels. MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY The Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) has kept monetary policy accommodative, with its twin objectives of adequate foreign reserves and low inflation safeguarded. This has augured well for maintaining sufficient liquidity in the system and keeping interest rates low. The RBF will continue to pursue monetary and exchange-rate policies in support of external balance, economic stability and growth over the medium-term. Fiscal policy over the years has supported public investments, economic growth and social development. Capital expenditure as a proportion of total expenditure has been increased to over 40 percent. More resources have been channelled towards infrastructure, education, healthcare and provision of other social services to raise the living standards of all Fijians. Government will continue to allocate adequate budgetary resources to key priority sectors that have the capacity to deliver better economic and social returns and support higher, broad-based, inclusive and sustainable economic growth. Figure 1: Public Expenditure 2007-2016 STRENGTHS AND ENABLING ENVIRONMENT 13 The tax regime has been reformed to improve tax administration, strengthen compliance and maintain broad-based and low tax rates. Strengthening compliance, simplifying tax administration, and ensuring certainty and predictability are the key guiding principles of revenue policy. Government debt as a percentage of GDP was reduced from 48.4 percent in 2014 to 47 percent in 2016. In line with the national targets, debt will be reduced to 35 percent of GDP in the next 20 years. 2.3 Social Development Social development policies have focused on empowering Fijians to attain sustainable livelihoods. Development has been made more people-centred with provision of better healthcare, education, water and electricity and social safety nets to ensure higher living standards. EDUCATION Fiji has a high literacy rate. This is supported by universal access to primary, secondary and tertiary education. Increased opportunities are being provided for technical and vocational training. This focus on education is supporting the development of a knowledge-based society that will result in positive ripples throughout the economy through improvements in efficiency and productivity, the rate of diffusion and adoption of technology, and research and innovation. Over the past five years, government has increased investment in education at all levels through the free education initiative, bus fare assistance, free textbooks for primary and secondary education, and tertiary education scholarship and loan schemes. HEALTH Significant progress has been made in increasing life expectancy, improving health outcomes in mothers and children, and reducing illness from communicable diseases. Life expectancy at birth stands at 70 years, a consistent improvement over the years. This increase can be attributed to improvements in public health, nutrition and medicine. The maternal mortality rate (per 100,000 live births) has declined. Almost all births are now attended by skilled health professionals, indicative of the strength and efficiency of maternal and child health programs. The mortality rate for children under the age of five years has also significantly dropped, with marked reduction in infant mortality rates. Improving access and quality of public health services remains a major priority, particularly in addressing non- communicable diseases and dealing effectively with the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. SOCIAL PROTECTION Fiji’s social welfare system continues to evolve to ensure that it is well targeted and provides support to vulnerable Fijians in need. Social protection programmes have been expanded from welfare allowances to support the living expenses of needy families, the elderly and disabled persons. In addition, targeted assistance is provided to support education, the health of pregnant women in rural areas, subsidies to access basic utilities, and access to essential medicine. HOUSING There has been significant public investment to improve access to affordable housing. Government assistance is provided for the purchase and construction of new homes for first-home owners. Major squatter resettlement programmes and provision of leases for those on state land are continuing. Access to land and provision of utility services have been extended to informal settlements. More land development projects and provision of new residential blocks have also been undertaken, including funding support for iTaukei land development. GENDER EQUALITY There has been a noticeable improvement in the female literacy rate over the last four decades. Indicators also show improvements in the labour force participation rate for females. Achieving gender equality in decision-making and income levels and eliminating violence against women in accordance with international conventions is crucial for sustainable development. Sex disaggregated data on the value of development programmes allows agencies to refine strategies for equitable distribution of resources. 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 14 Fiji has incorporated significant elements of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) into its laws and policies and is implementing the National Gender Policy and the Women’s Plan of Action. Domestic violence legislation has been developed and utilised by the Fiji Police Force and courts as part of an overarching approach to bring down the amount of violence experienced by women and children. Complementary to this is the establishment of a toll-free 24-hours’ hotline to provide counselling and appropriate referral for survivors of GBV as well as to avenues for redress. These measures, backed by our vibrant NGOs, are leading the way in the region in best practice in service delivery for GBV victims and survivors. DISABILITY People with special needs comprise an estimated 1.4 percent of the total population. Fiji became a signatory to the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2010, and the right to basic services for persons with disabilities is enshrined in the Constitution. With increased awareness of the needs of people living with disabilities, the trend in new commercial developments and public infrastructure is towards being more inclusive in design and accessibility. 2.4 Structural Reforms A number of structural reforms have been undertaken to reduce the cost of doing business, promote more efficient allocation of resources, provide more room for private sector development and provide policy space for the government’s development agenda. The broad structural reform areas include the regulatory environment for private sector development, trade, the financial sector, the labour market, land, public enterprises, the sugar industry, and goods markets. REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT FOR PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT The regulatory environment for private-sector development has been improved through more effective administration of regulatory frameworks for land use, development control and building permissions. Tax administration has been made more business friendly, yet effective. Incentives, and where necessary subsidies, have been provided to spur investment and meet basic needs, particularly in areas like renewable energy and infrastructure development, and to support growth in key economic sectors such as ICT, tourism, manufacturing and agriculture. These initiatives complement national branding initiatives like ‘Fijian Made’. Capacity to effectively resolve commercial disputes and civil cases has improved with efforts to ensure effective arbitration and mediation processes and improving registration and enforcement of copyright, trademarks and patents. TRADE POLICY Boosting productive capacity for exports has been a high priority for government. The National Trade Policy Framework provides the policy settings and institutional framework to address challenges such as market access, trade facilitation and export growth. Government has been undertaking tariff policy reviews consistent with its economic development aspirations and priorities. FINANCIAL SECTOR Fiji has a sound and well-managed financial system. In seeking to develop a robust and deep financial sector, the Financial Sector Development Plan 2016-2025 provides the necessary overarching policy direction. In the years ahead, reform initiatives will include: a diagnostic review of legislative and regulatory frameworks affecting the financial system, establishment of the National Switch, developing capital markets, streamlining and reducing the cost of overseas remittances, enhancing the competitiveness of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), implementing a Secured Transaction Framework and strengthening the MSME sector. LABOUR MARKET Reforms have been implemented to put in place a modern employment-relations regulatory framework that can protect the fundamental rights of all employees and also support inclusive private sector-led growth. Employment Relations (Amendment) Acts of 2015 and 2016 facilitate compliance with the Tripartite Agreement among government, Fiji Trades Union Congress and Fiji Commerce and Employers Federation. Under this Plan, the strategic focus for human resource development will be on building individual and institutional capacity in all sectors of the economy. Continuous efforts will be focused on improving Fiji’s labour-market standards to meet accredited international best practices, including the fostering of a modern workforce encouraging increased participation from women and recognising the abilities of those from diverse groups. These reforms provide a platform for equality where both men and women can enjoy the benefits of employment and conditions conducive to productivity and prosperity for all. STRENGTHS AND ENABLING ENVIRONMENT 15 LAND REFORM Reforms to improve access to land through the land-bank initiative have been implemented. The next area of focus is on the review of administrative processes, digitisation of land records and capacity-building to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of land-use administration. SUGARCANE INDUSTRY Government will continue to support the sugar industry to sustain the livelihoods of the more-than 200,000 people who depend on it. Efforts will be geared towards increasing productive capacity, improving transportation, implementing a new cane-quality payment system and generating additional revenue. To raise sugarcane production, replanting on unused sugar cane leases, securing more lease renewals and mechanisation will be pursued. GOODS MARKET REFORM An effective and well-functioning competition framework is an essential prerequisite for growth. Given the nature of business structures in Fiji, interventions to ensure competitive market behaviour in certain sectors will continue; however, progressive liberalisation (de-listing from the basket) will also be considered. CIVIL SERVICE Government will continue with the reform of the civil service to ensure strong leadership and service delivery. Recruitment will be based on merit and equal opportunity, and high performers will be retained. Staff performance will be improved through better training and an improved work environment where effort and hard work are recognised and rewarded. Institutional reviews and job evaluation exercises are being undertaken and implemented beginning with new salary bands for the civil service. This will improve the work environment, improve work processes and bring greater accountability and transparency. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT Reforms to improve management of public finances will continue. Assessments of public expenditure and financial accountability have been undertaken to identify future areas of improvement and reform. The Financial Management Act is also being reviewed to align it with the Constitution and international best practices. For financial reporting, government has adopted cash-basis International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) and will move towards accrual accounting in the future. To facilitate this, the chart of accounts is under review, and the national asset register is being developed. Government procurement systems and processes have been enhanced, and we will continue to build capacity to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and accountability of the public financial management systems. PUBLIC ENTERPRISES Government had embarked on partial divestment of shares in a number of SOEs to encourage private sector partnerships and improve efficiency and service delivery. Moving forward, key sectors will be restructured to establish a multi-sector regulator for water, electricity and communications. Legislation governing public- private partnerships (PPPs) will be reviewed to support development of major national infrastructure, public utilities and other development projects. 2.5 Good Governance The fundamentals for democratic and accountable governance set out under the Constitution are important enablers involving a commitment to free and fair elections, ensuring that the law applies equally to all, limiting corruption, allowing active participation in political, economic and social affairs, ensuring safe and secure communities and protecting the basic freedoms and human rights of all Fijians. Government will be fully accountable to the people of Fiji through Parliament, and resources will be allocated to support a robust and effective parliamentary and committee system, ensuring scrutiny of public programmes and policies through open and informed debates on issues of national interest. Resources have been allocated to independent commissions to enable the effective performance of their constitutional roles and responsibilities. This includes the Fiji Elections Office, where capacity will be maintained to support the effective conduct of future general elections. Reforms to the legislative framework for local government will be implemented to facilitate the conduct of municipal elections. A whole-of-government approach, in partnership with civil society, is needed to support reforms to implement the recommendations agreed to under Fiji’s 2nd Universal Periodic Review (UPR) in 2014.7 This includes ratification of all human rights treaties and conventions by 2024. The Human Rights and Anti-discrimination Commission (HRADC) will be resourced to address all human rights complaints efficiently and effectively. Effective administration and enforcement of standards of conduct for senior public officials and the Freedom of Information law are critical measures to ensure 7. 28th Session of UNHRC - Fiji’s 2nd Universal Periodic Review (UPR). Other major commitments are the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway 2014 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 16 transparent and accountable governance.8 Effective enforcement of the anti-corruption legal framework will be complemented by Corruption Prevention Risk Reduction (CPRR) Assessments for government ministries and departments and other stakeholders. It will also be supported by annual audits by the Office of the Auditor-General under the accountability framework to maintain the integrity of, and public confidence in, the government’s systems. The management of public records will be enhanced to ensure open and transparent government. This will include support for informed decision-making by improving statistical data-collection and analysis, including the national census, and the preservation of national archives. 2.6 Climate Change Climate change has emerged as a major global challenge threatening biodiversity, livelihoods and human life. Small island developing states are already being adversely affected by the increased intensity and frequency of natural disasters, loss of productive farmland from salt- water intrusion, relocation of communities near coastal regions and substantial financial drain for mitigation and rehabilitation efforts. The whole world faces catastrophic consequences if decisive and collective global action is not taken to reduce carbon emissions, build resilience and adapt to climate change. In this regard, Fiji has been given the opportunity to lead the negotiations on climate change at the COP 23 meeting in Bonn, Germany. The rulebook for practical implementation of the Paris Agreement will be a key agenda for this meeting. Fiji was the first country to ratify the Paris Climate Change Agreement on 22 April, 2016, an Agreement dubbed as the world’s greatest diplomatic success. The Agreement, hailed as “historic, durable and ambitious”, generally aims to hold increase in the global average temperature to well below 2oC above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5oC above pre-industrial levels. Consistent with this objective, Fiji’s goal is to achieve net-zero global GHG emissions by 2050, which reflects the long-term goal of the Paris Agreement to achieve climate neutrality and a low-emission world in the second half of the century. Fiji has submitted near-term targets to address GHG emissions, called “nationally determined contributions” or NDCs, and will review and extend these targets every five years. Furthermore, Fiji will strive to formulate and communicate long-term greenhouse gas emission development strategies, in accordance with Article 4, paragraph 19, of the Paris Agreement, mindful of Article 2 of the Agreement taking into account its common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. As such, Fiji will develop by 2020, mid-century long- term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies, laying out a plan to deeply decarbonize the Fijian economy by 2050. A decarbonized Fiji will be a more attractive Fiji. Such an effort will be key towards eliminating poverty and supporting the achievement of the SDGs. Fiji will continue its stewardship of climate change issues at the local, regional and global level with the plight of small island developing states at the centre of this concern. We will work together with other nations to access climate finance and explore innovative ways of mobilising public and private sector resources for adaptation and mitigation. This includes support for community-based adaptation planning. 8. Information Bill 2016 and Code of Conduct Bill 2016 – currently before Parliament. FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2021 17 5-Year Development Plan 2017-2021 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 18 3.0 FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2021 The long-term national development plan, supported by Fiji’s strengths and an enabling national environment, is translated into individual sector development plans to be implemented over the next 5 years. The sector goals are set against an analysis of sector context, including challenges and opportunities to justify priority policies and strategies. The selected sector policies and strategies in turn help validate the priority development programmes to be implemented over the next 5 years. Policies and strategies and the corresponding programmes and targets are tabulated under each chapter. The major programmes and projects are based on the development needs gathered from the nationwide consultations. Emphasis is placed on access to basic services for all Fijians such as water, electricity, housing, medical services and education. Government will concurrently undertake substantial investments to implement the transformational strategic thrusts identified under the long-term development plan. 3.1 INCLUSIVE SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT The Constitution provides every Fijian with socio- economic and environmental rights. The realisation of these rights is critical for inclusive and sustainable development. This will empower every Fijian through provision of essential social services and other public goods. 3.1.1 WATER AND SANITATION “Clean and safe water in adequate quantities and proper and adequate sanitation for every Fijian household” The Constitution guarantees the right of every Fijian to clean and safe water in adequate quantities, and accessible and adequate sanitation facilities. Realising this entitlement will ensure improved living standards with positive spill over benefits to the entire economy. WATER Currently, approximately 78 percent of Fiji’s population has access to a treated and reticulated water supply. While in the urban centres 98 percent of the population has access, coverage in the rural areas needs to be expanded. In the next 5 years, government will undertake major investments to cater for long-term water supply needs. Resources will be allocated for construction of new water treatment plants, reticulation systems and reservoirs to increase supply capacity. An aggressive leakage reduction programme to eliminate water loss will be pursued. Regarding the development of potential new water sources, government—with assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Green Climate Fund (GCF) and European Investment Bank (EIB)—is embarking on the construction of a new, 40-megalitre treatment plant on the Rewa River to meet the increasing demand for water in the greater Suva and Nausori areas. The Water Authority of Fiji (WAF) is exploring options for other new dam sites such as at Waibogi in the upper reaches of Navua River and the upper Waimanu River as well as in the Western Division to meet the increasing demand in the Nadi-to-Lautoka corridor. Investments will be made to renew existing water infrastructure, including pipeline replacement, construction and upgrade of water reticulation systems, electrical upgrades, valve replacements, reservoir upgrades and reducing non-revenue water. Options for enhanced rainwater harvesting and storage, industrial recycling, storm water management, aquifer management and the use of renewable energy technologies for desalination plants in remote locations will be explored on a continuing basis and implemented where feasible. Government will provide rebates for rainwater harvesting systems. The rural water supply programme will be augmented to provide access to clean water in rural areas and to meet the target of 85 percent of rural communities having access by 2021. Free water tanks will be distributed in the rural and maritime communities. For the remote island communities, groundwater sources will be developed and diesel-powered water-desalination plants will be provided. Awareness and strategies for water conservation policies will be pursued to raise civic responsibility on the use of water and protection of water sources. The free water initiative for households with combined household income of $30,000 that are consuming less than 91,250 litres per year will also continue. SANITATION Around 71 percent of the population have access to improved sanitation, including 25 percent that have access to sewerage facilities. Sanitation services will be improved FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2021 19 Goal, Policies and Strategies Goal: Clean and safe water in adequate quantities and proper and adequate sanitation for every Fijian house- hold POLICIES STRATEGIES Strengthen water policy planning and sustainable resource management. y Formulate and implement a National Water Resource Management and Sanitation Policy to govern the planning and development of water resources. yAn integrated approach by the Water Authority of Fiji and Department of Water and Sewerage to develop a mechanism for detailed water resource monitoring and management in collaboration with Fiji Meteorological Services, Ministry of Waterways, FEA and other relevant agencies. yBetter coordinate roles and responsibilities and improve management and sharing of data among various stakeholders, including Water Authority of Fiji, Department of Water and Sewerage and Ministry of Waterways. yDevelop and adopt a policy framework for environmentally appropriate and sustainable commercial extraction of groundwater.

Forty percent of the population will be connected to the central sewerage system by 2021. Sewerage plants with larger treatment capacities and efficient technologies will be constructed in urban areas. To improve access to sanitation services in the rural and maritime areas, government will construct smaller sewerage treatment plants. With Fiji’s increased risk and vulnerability to climate change, water and sewerage infrastructure will be made more climate-resilient, and freshwater resources will be protected from pollution and unsustainable use. 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 20 Programmes and Projects PROGRAMME ANNUAL TARGET TOTAL OUTPUT EXPECTED LEAD AGENCY 2017-2018 2018-2019 2019-2020 2020- 2021 2021- 2022

environmentally sustainable energy sector” ELECTRICITY With substantial investments in electrification initiatives over the years, almost 90 percent of the population now has proper access to electricity. Lack of access in the unserviced rural and maritime areas will be addressed over the next 5 years. To achieve 10 percent electrification by 2021, grid extension programmes will be accelerated in Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Ovalau and Taveuni. Government will continue with the policy to fully fund rural electrification projects. Electricity from renewable sources will be increased further. Currently, over 60 percent of electricity generated is from renewable sources such as hydro, biomass, wind and solar energy. Over 50 MW of renewable energy generation capacity has been added in the last 10 years. Further investments in renewable energy will be undertaken to ensure that over 80 percent of all electricity is generated from renewable sources by 2021. Concessional financing and grants for these projects will continue to be accessed under climate finance funds together with carbon credits under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Three major hydro projects are currently being developed by the Fiji Electricity Authority (FEA). These are the Qaliwana Hydro Project, Upper Wailoa Diversion Hydro Project and Lower Ba Hydro Project. Future sites are being investigated, including the Upper Ba River, the Waivaka Hydropower Scheme in Namosi, and Wailevu River in Cakaudrove. Further detailed studies are required to confirm the viability of these sites for hydro projects. The research and development of new and renewable energy technologies will continue. This includes further exploration of ocean energy, geothermal energy, wave energy and the generation of energy from waste. Decentralised renewable energy sources such as solar, mini-hydro, and wind systems will be used to electrify rural areas and maritime zones where feasible. Contingency plans to address prolonged periods of dry weather have been put in place with installation of an additional 40 MW of diesel generators. Independent Power Producers (IPP) are supplementing electricity production. To encourage further private sector participation in the electricity sector, partial divestment of FEA is underway. In developing an IPP framework to increase private sector generation of electricity from both renewable and non-renewable sources, government will ensure that a system of fair pricing and a transparent process are maintained. Tax incentives aimed at investments in renewable energy technologies will continue. There are also opportunities for the private sector and households to invest in small- scale renewable systems that will be supported by government. FEA will also explore the possibility of adopting smart grid technologies, allowing for greater customer participation in managing demand. Electricity conservation and efficient technology to support energy saving will be promoted. The codes and standards for buildings and industry will be updated to require mandatory minimum standards for energy use for ventilation, cooling and lighting, among other improvements. These can typically reduce electricity consumption by around 25 percent. Because Fiji is vulnerable to adverse climate change- related events, it will ensure that electricity infrastructure is made disaster-resilient. Options for further underground cabling for grid distribution are being explored. Government will also work closely with the private sector to improve designs, offer practical training and possibly support mandatory certification of designers/installers in order to improve resilience to cyclone conditions for renewable energy systems. Environmental considerations will be factored into the appraisal of future hydro power, geothermal and other energy resources. To meet the human-resource needs of the future electricity sector, government will support education for civil, electrical and hydrological engineers and other required skill needs of the sector. In-service training for the existing technical staff will continue. PETROLEUM AND BIOMASS The high reliance on imported petroleum remains a challenge and is being continually addressed. The transport sector (land, sea and air) is the principal consumer of imported fossil fuel. To ensure energy efficiency improvements in the transportation industry, government has incentivised the importation of hybrid and electric cars over the last few years. Fiji is complying with the Euro 2 emissions standard of 500 parts per million (PPM) of sulphur content and is moving towards the Euro 5 emission standard of 50 PPM. This initiative intends to reduce carbon emissions and concurrently attract new vehicle technologies with high fuel efficiency. Government will continue to promote and encourage the use of environmentally friendly fuel standards. Significant efficiency gains have also been made in the aviation sector as Fiji Airways has upgraded its fleet with more fuel-efficient aircrafts. Government will continue research and development on biofuel and its use in the transport sector. Incentives to 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 26 promote investments in biofuel will continue. Energy generation from biomass will be expanded over the next 5 years. Apart from the biomass waste co- generation at Tropik Woods and Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC), a10MW biomass power plant at Navutu, Sigatoka is currently being constructed by Nabou Green Energy Limited. Traditional, renewable biomass fuels still play a major role in rural areas. Wood is the main cooking fuel and is also used for drying copra in many areas. While most of Goal, Policies and Strategies Goal: A resource-efficient, cost-effective and environmentally sustainable energy sector. POLICIES STRATEGIES Access to affordable, reliable, modern and sustainable energy services for all Fijians. yContinue to develop the existing grid electricity supply in Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Ovalau and Taveuni. yDevelop small grid systems in other islands where practical. yReview operation of hydropower and other renewable energy facilities to maximize output under new climate conditions. yContinue to develop and improve the human resource capacity in the energy sector. yReview design and construction standards for energy facilities that are climate change resilient. Increase share of electricity generation from renewable energy resources. y Implement a research, data collection and investment identification programme to accelerate the renewable energy share in electricity generation. yEstablish a net-metering (or similar) mechanism to set out clear rules for small companies or households to feed excess electricity from renewables to the grid at a price fair to them and to FEA. y Set economically justified feed-in tariffs or pricing framework (price differential system) including studies to provide incentives for production of electricity from various renewable energy sources. yUndertake a study and develop an Independent Power Producer (IPP) framework that addresses the issue of intermittent supply of power from IPPs. yEstablish a transparent process for procurement of new large-scale capacity from IPPs, pricing and other principles to be applied in all new power purchase agreements and grid connection standards. Increase private sector participation in electricity supply through reform of regulatory aspects of the electricity sector. yReform the regulation of the electricity sector to establish a more enabling environment for private sector participation in the electricity sector, including both large-scale and small-scale supply. the biomass use can be considered renewable, there are considerable negative health impacts, such as emphysema and eye irritations. To address this, government has introduced the energy-efficient Rocket Wood Stove in rural areas. Government will monitor energy sources that may have a detrimental health effects and will provide an enabling environment for affordable and safe alternative energy sources. Piggery and dairy-farming biogas projects that address waste management, health and energy needs are ongoing.

Key initiatives undertaken over the years include financial assistance to first-home owners for construction or purchase of a new home, the development of residential lots by the Housing Authority (HA) and Public Rental Board (PRB), informal housing upgrades and resettlement, development of iTaukei land, and rural housing schemes. In the next five years, new strategies will be implemented to increase the supply of affordable housing, in particular housing units with strata titles, by both the public and private sector. The existing housing programmes will continue. To promote more integration and marketability of public housing and housing units with strata titles, “vertical villages” will be established. This will include a range of unit sizes and will accommodate a more diverse group of households with different income levels, cultural backgrounds, family sizes and other characteristics. This will create a renewed image of integrated housing and encourage Fijians to buy units with strata titles. Leases will continue to be issued to settlements on state land, and those on iTaukei land will be provided leases only after approval from landowners. Providing leases to Fijians in these settlements will raise confidence and provide some security for further investments. Government will continue to work with NGO partners in these projects. Government will also continue to support landowners to develop their land for subdivisions and residential purposes. Funding assistance will be provided for development costs and provision of public utilities. This scheme will allow landowners to profit from developing their land. To assist homeowners who do not have access to insurance to re-build their houses after natural disasters and fire, government will put in place a contingency fund and explore options for disaster insurance in the coming years.

Therefore, the development of domestic agriculture and fisheries to support access to an adequate supply of healthy and nutritious food is critical as a legal and political matter as well as for food and nutrition security. To better understand food and nutrition security, an overarching framework will be developed to objectively assess the status, including the current capacity of the domestic agriculture and fisheries sector to meet the national food demand. The development of such a framework will require collaboration among stakeholders to help build a credible food and nutrition security database, assess the national food and nutrition security status and support the formulation of strategies to improve the situation. Over the next 5 years, government will ensure increased domestic food production and supply of fisheries products. Challenges such as the destruction of food production due to natural disasters and other issues facing the agriculture and fisheries sector will be addressed. Specific policies to promote agriculture and fisheries production are described under the resource-based sector chapters. Large commercial agriculture and aquaculture projects will be supported to achieve economies of scale and competitive pricing. Cluster farming will be encouraged and incentivised together with the promotion of small- holder farms and back yard farming for subsistence level. Production efficiencies will be improved through mechanisation and the adoption of new technologies and better product varieties. More research and extension services will be provided by government to improve farm productivity and awareness of best farming practices. Organic farming practices will be employed. Government will encourage the consumption of locally produced fresh foods and ensure that it is conveniently accessible at fresh food markets, supermarkets and road- side stalls. Assistance will be provided to expand the supply of traditional foods such as Uvi, Tivoli, Via, Dalo, Cassava and Kumala given their suitability to the local climate. The consumption of fresh, home-grown food will be promoted through awareness programmes. Strategies to mitigate climate change related effects on food supply will also be promoted. While production and consumption of locally produced food will be encouraged, import of certain products will continue to help meet our food requirements. 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 32 Goal, Policies and Strategies Goal: Every Fijian has access to adequate food of acceptable quality and nutritional value.

Maternal- and infant-mortality rates have declined. Primary health care is well established, with major improvements in secondary health care. Substantial investments have been made in construction and upgrading of hospitals, health centres and nursing stations. Medical services have been decentralised to ensure convenience and easy access. More doctors and nurses have been recruited and are well remunerated. The doctor-to-patient ratio is improving, and funding for supply for essential drugs and consumables has been increased. In the next 5 years, more investments will be made to upgrade and expand existing divisional hospitals to provide more beds and better facilities. New sub-divisional hospitals will be constructed and existing ones upgraded. New health centres will be constructed with proper services and equipment. Government will ensure that every health centre is provided with a full-time doctor. In addition a new National Kidney Research and Treatment Centre will be constructed that will act as a national hub for treatment and prevention of kidney disease, and to provide patients the most economical access to treatment of kidney disease. Funding will be channelled towards purchase of more equipment, drugs and consumables. The procurement process and supply-chain management will be streamlined to ensure that adequate supplies of medicines and consumables are available at all times. Education and information will be provided to men and women regarding family planning, and equal-parenting initiatives will be promoted. Hiring of skilled healthcare workers will continue to ensure that the ratio of doctors, nurses and midwives per 1,000 people is increased to internationally accepted levels. To assist those low and middle-income Fijians, the free medicine scheme will continue. Strategies will be pursued to tackle NCDs in the country. Changes in lifestyle, healthy diets and physical activity are crucial for preventive health care and prevention of NCDs. A multi-sectoral approach through better health education, production and adequate supply of fresh fruits and vegetables, and promotional and awareness campaigns will be further enhanced to address this issue. Collaboration and partnership with the private sector, NGOs and development partners will be pursued. Early detection and preventive measures will be strengthened to address communicable diseases like HIV/ AIDS and tuberculosis. Physical and sexual violence against women and children will be addressed as Fiji practitioners will adhere to processes of referral and evidence preservation to support women and increase the rate of perpetrator accountability. Adherence to international standards of tertiary health care will be pursued as a major initiative to ensure that Fijians are provided with advanced tertiary care. Tax incentives to entice private sector investment in this area were introduced in the 2016-2017 National Budget. Government will explore further opportunities for public investment in this area. 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 40 Goal, Policies and Strategies Goal: Access to quality health facilities necessary to good health, and to health care services, including repro- ductive health care.

Extreme poverty and hunger do not exist in Fiji due to the availability of agricultural and fisheries products and the existence of a sharing culture. Income poverty is also on a declining trend. Spending power and basic living standards have been secured for all Fijians through the provision of free water, electricity, education, medicine and health services; the bus-fare subsidy; housing assistance; and social protection initiatives such as food vouchers and the social pension scheme. Opportunities for income generation and better employment also have raised income levels and standards of living in the country. Over the next 5 years, the government will ensure that every Fijian is provided with the basic amenities of life. Social inclusion programmes such as the poverty benefit scheme, welfare graduation programme and social pension scheme will be maintained. Targeted assistance will be provided to the vulnerable, including children living in poverty, children in orphanages and foster care, people with disabilities and special needs, and the elderly. A major focus in the years ahead will be to support MSMEs and other self-employment initiatives to ensure all Fijians have a stable source of income. Major government initiatives will ensure that the guarantee of socio-economic rights in the Constitution is realised. This will empower Fijians to become self-reliant. Government will ensure that prosperity is shared and all development is inclusive. 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 50 Goal, Policies and Strategies Goal: A socially inclusive Fiji and empowered Fijians. POLICIES STRATEGIES Promote a caring environment where everyone is safe and protected. y Strengthen data gathering for baseline studies and analyses of the needs of children, elderly, people with disabilities and assessments of poverty. yReview state social protection systems for the protection and care of vulnerable groups. yReview and, if needed, enhance education, employment, trade, fiscal and other government policies as they impact vulnerable groups and social empowerment programmes. y Implement, monitor and review legislation relating to the principles and provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Convention on the Rights of Older Persons, Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability and other relevant international instruments. yEncourage in-family support for the elderly. Improve the lives of vulnerable people (elderly, children and those with special needs). y Strengthen empowerment programmes to build capacity among vulnerable groups and create access to productive resources to facilitate migration from welfare to workfare. yContinue to engage with faith based organisations and NGOs in promoting family values and social cohesion. y Promote greater integration and participation of vulnerable people in decision-making and community affairs. y Increase labour force participation and self-employment of older persons and those with special needs. y Provision of post-traumatic counselling services for the vulnerable groups after natural disasters including the identification and mapping of communities that are most vulnerable to disasters.

The poverty gap is the mean shortfall from the poverty lines (counting the non-poor as having zero shortfalls) as a percentage of the poverty lines. This measure reflects the depth of poverty as well as its incidence. 15. According to the 2008-2009 HIES, the Poverty Gap is 3.1% of GDP. 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 52 3.1.8 YOUTH AND SPORTS DEVELOPMENT “Empowering youth to be agents of change and promoting sports for development” YOUTH DEVELOPMENT Fiji is a young country with around 62 percent of the population below the age of 35. Effective engagement of youth in the economy, society and the political sphere will stimulate growth and development. Government will ensure that educational, employment and leadership opportunities are provided to young Fijians. This is a cross-cutting issue that has been also addressed throughout other thematic areas. In the next 5 years, initiatives will be strengthened for training, empowerment and awareness programmes for youth in areas such as entrepreneurship, leadership, climate change and sexual health awareness. Financial support will continue to be made available for voluntary organisations in these areas. Support will be provided for the establishment of MSMEs for rural and urban youth. This will create self- employment opportunities and develop entrepreneurial skills. The National Employment Centre will continue to provide the “one-stop shop” service to assist employment seekers to find jobs. Initiatives that empower youth and encourage their participation in national policy development will continue, such as the International Youth Exchange Programme, National Youth Conference and Youth Parliament initiative. SPORTS DEVELOPMENT Sports has played a key role in building social cohesion and has improved Fiji’s image globally. It has also supported improvements in health and well-being and generated employment opportunities for many Fijians. Remittance inflows from Fijian sports people overseas have been a good source of foreign exchange earnings and income support for many families. There is a huge potential to harness our sporting prowess and transform sports into a major income-generating sector. Over the next 5 years, emphasis will be placed on developing elite sportspersons and modernising and building new state-of-the-art facilities. Support services associated with the professional development of sports will be strengthened. This includes sports education and the development of qualified sports trainers and coaches. Sports psychology, sports science and sports medicine will also be part of the tertiary curriculum. An increased participation in sports by all Fijians will contribute to reducing our increasing levels of NCDs and obesity. Fiji will bid to host major regional and international sporting events, including the 2023 Pacific Games and 2026 Commonwealth Games. Government will continue to invest in the upgrading and maintenance of sporting infrastructure and facilities to raise them to international standards. Such investments will strengthen Fiji’s attractiveness as a host for future international events and encourage sports tourism. A National Sports Academy will be established to support the development of future sportspersons. Sports development will include talent identification, specialised training, exposure to specialised coaching and training methods, and management of sports injuries and dietary programmes.

Their potential needs to be fully harnessed for the benefit of the entire nation. Government will provide equal opportunities for all, including the participation of women in education, leadership, and overall economic development, and will continue its strong efforts to eliminate violence against women. Past programmes have managed to attain gender parity for students. Female representation in Parliament increased at the last election and is now one of the highest in the Pacific region. Around 58 percent of SOEs have women representation at board level. In the labour market, women account for over 40 percent of salary earners and 30 percent of wage earners. Equal opportunities in education, health and other social services will raise women’s participation in the workforce. With legislative changes such as the introduction of the Domestic Violence Act, provisions in the Constitution and the reestablishment of the Elimination of Violence Against Women (EVAW) Task Force, government is working towards providing positive and innovative approaches to achieving gender equality and to eliminating discrimination and violence against women. This Plan will provide women experiencing gender-based violence with access to greater help. Effective access to health services, specialist advocacy and counselling, police protection and the justice system will be strengthened. Prevention of gender-based violence will be a priority for government, and police, the NGO partners and donor agencies will continue to work in close partnership. As a signatory to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action in 1995, Fiji is dedicated to continue its commitment to ensure that women are included prominently in the development process. In line with SDG 5, (Gender equality and empowerment of women), women’s participation in leadership and decision-making at all levels will be increased through strategies that generate greater economic participation, recognition of domestic workers, and elimination of discrimination due the importance of the biological reproductive role of women. Government will support the freedom of all women to participate in any profession they choose. Accordingly, policies will focus on encouraging shared decision-making in relationships, especially as they relate to family planning, child care, economic independence and choices of paid work. Fiji will value women as an important resource and asset and recognise their right to enjoy a life free from violence and to access the entitlements and privileges guaranteed 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 56 under our Constitution unencumbered by discrimination, culture or oppressive religious interpretation. Government will continue to work with regional partners and civil society (including faith-based organisations) in the empowerment and development of women. Resources will be provided to women’s groups to support income-generating projects. The National Women’s Expo, sponsored by government, will continue to focus on marketing products produced by women for the local and international market. Over the Plan period, government will create a gender- fair society that protects and promotes the rights of women. This will be realised through the implementation of the Women’s Plan of Action and the National Gender Policy over the next five years.

Fiji’s rich cultural heritage, ranging from language, food, festivals, rituals, arts and traditions, holds intrinsic value for both present and future generations. This heritage will be safeguarded and promoted. The National Culture Policy and National Culture and Education Strategy set the platform for protection and preservation of both tangible and intangible cultural heritage. The ongoing cultural mapping programme and framework for gathering cultural statistics will be a key initiative to gather information on traditional knowledge and heritage. This will also support the mainstreaming of culture in educational curriculum. The use of local culture in the tourism industry will both protect and promote our cultural heritage. This includes cultural performances and traditional arts and craft made by local artisans that will be promoted through the “Fijian Crafted” campaign. The nation’s vast documentary will be preserved in accordance with archival conservation practices and made available to all Fijians. A monetary valuation of this heritage will also be undertaken. The upgrade of Fiji Museum and the National Library housed within the National Archives will greatly contribute to the preservation of Fiji’s heritage. The positive steps already undertaken to produce authentic heritage merchandise will be scaled up to provide genuine, culturally appropriate and iconic goods to tourists in an effort to boost the economic spin-off from Fiji’s cultural and documentary heritage. Cultural heritage sites and places will also be protected as part of our unique biodiversity and used sustainably for national development.

Preserving this system warrants a strong commitment to upholding the rule of law and national security. The Fijian Constitution will be protected and defended at all times. Apart from the traditional security challenges, focus will also be placed on protecting Fijians from environmental risks and natural disasters, transnational crimes (human and drug trafficking), food and nutrition security and public health risks and financial and cybercrime. The Police Force will be strengthened to ensure security and effective crime prevention. Resources will channelled towards recruitment and training, provision of vehicles and equipment, and decentralisation of services for quick and effective response. Programmes to promote community engagement and public awareness will be pursued. Border security will be maintained through improved coordination and ensuring availability of adequate resources. Fiji will continue implementation of its National Security Strategy and support for UN Peacekeeping operations. Government will continue its efforts to further improve access to justice. Correctional services and rehabilitation of inmates for re-integration of inmates into society will continue. This will help maintain the current low recidivism rate by providing inmates with opportunities to learn skills for income generation and through other personal support. Expanding legal services to improve access to justice for all Fijians has been a key priority. Provision of resources will continue for legal aid services, court sittings in rural and outer islands, and the greater decentralisation of services.

We already have the major foundations and enabling environment, and game-changing strategic interventions will allow us to build much further over the next 5 years. Connectivity, both within and to the outside world, will be enhanced. Investments will build digital connectivity, and new and better technologies will be adopted for productivity improvement and better service delivery. The ICT sector will be harnessed for job creation and efficiency gains and to raise the overall standard of living. The business environment will be improved to further reduce the cost of doing business and support private sector investments in the country. Manufacturing and service sectors will be supported and new growth sectors will be nurtured and harnessed. Niche-product development and areas of comparative advantage will be incentivised and further developed. MSME development will be strengthened for job creation and income generation. Urban development with better services and development of new cities, towns and growth centres will be pursued. Equal attention will also be paid to growing the rural economy, providing better public services and creating many more opportunities for income and employment. Resource-based sectors will be developed with a major focus on value addition, efficiency gains and raising overall production. The tourism industry will be expanded with a focus on increasing source markets and also meeting the developing and diverse needs of tourists. Trade will be promoted and regional and multilateral partnerships will be enhanced. 3.2.1 MODERNISING LAND TRANSPORT “Access to transportation through an efficient and sustainable transport network” In transforming Fiji, a modern, safe and well-connected road infrastructure is necessary. The government has already embarked on modernising the infrastructure with substantial funding to improve our roads, bridges, jetties, streetlights and footpaths over recent years. Existing trunk roads have been upgraded and expanded and new roads have been constructed in rural and maritime areas. Fijians are now more connected and enjoy improved road quality. Roads connecting major centres have also been modernised to international standards. This includes the four-lane projects connecting 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 68 Nausori Airport to Suva and Nadi Airport to Denarau. In the next 5 years, more investments will be made to further improve our road network. Existing roads will be upgraded and sealed. Options are being explored for a four-lane project in the Nadi-to-Lautoka corridor. The upgrading and rehabilitation programme for bridges and jetties will be pursued on a bigger scale. A major street lighting programme is being undertaken to replace all faulty streetlights and install new ones with LED lights in both urban and rural areas. This includes installation of streetlights at major junctions; in front of villages, settlements, schools, hospitals and health centres; at shopping centres along the Queens Road and Kings Road; and along the Labasa to Savusavu corridor. Streetlights will also be installed in urban and peri-urban areas of the greater Suva area. Government will install traffic lights at junctions, develop roundabouts and re-design some of the existing high- traffic roads to ease traffic congestion and make our roads safer. Construction of footpaths will be continued in populated urban and peri-urban areas including industrial areas and residential subdivisions. Resources will be allocated to develop rural and maritime- island roads and other unsealed roads throughout Fiji. Irish crossings, suspension bridges, rural jetties, waiting sheds and foot crossings will be upgraded and constructed. This will support rural agriculture and other industries, assist in transportation of students, improve access to markets and help sustain livelihoods. To reduce damage to the road network, more weighbridges will be constructed to ensure that shippers comply with the weight limits on our roads and bridges. Emission standards and energy efficiency for transport will be a key priority. The replacement of existing uneconomical vehicles with hybrid and electric vehicles will be supported. Fuel savings through the use of biofuel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) in land transport will be supported, as will be the use of cycling lanes. FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2021 69 Goal, Policies and Strategies Goal: Access to transportation through an efficient and sustainable transport network. POLICIES STRATEGIES Expansion of the rural road network. yReview of the existing policies and legislation surrounding the management of farm roads and re- examine the standards for construction of rural roads. y Implement an augmented programme for roads in rural and maritime areas that will also include construction of Irish crossings, suspension bridges, jetties, waiting sheds and foot crossings. Further development of full road network to international standards with a greater emphasis on maintenance, rehabilitation and upgrading. yContinue with high levels of investment to reduce the backlog in the upgrading, replacement and maintenance of roads, bridges and jetty networks. yContinue implementation of existing major roads programmes including the FRA Maintenance Programme, Renewals and Replacements of Roads and Services, and Upgrading and Replacement of Bridges and Jetties. yCompletion of the four-lane projects from Suva to Nausori Airport and Denarau Road to Nadi Airport by 2018. yComplete feasibility study of four-lanes to other stretches like Nadi to Lautoka with construction to start by 2018. yConsideration of Public Private Partnerships such as build-operate-transfer and similar arrangements where private entities partially or fully finance the construction of new roads, bridges or jetties. Extending rural transportation services. yReview the guidelines and the legal framework on the issuance of Rural Service Licenses (RSLs). yReview bus routes and timetables with the intention to increase services in the rural areas.

Our location is also ideal to be a regional and international air and sea transport hub as well as provide a feeder network to service other hubs. As such, modernising and expanding Fiji’s airports and seaports and provision of efficient services will continue in partnership with relevant agencies. The Nadi International Airport has been modernised with the upgrade of the terminal to international level, pavement rehabilitation and other development works. This has created a new image of Fiji’s main international gateway. There are now plans to construct a second international terminal and an upgraded domestic terminal. Upgrade works for the Nausori International Airport terminal and runway will also be undertaken to continually raise standards and facilities. Government is also exploring options for development of a new international airport in Vanua Levu that will support our vibrant tourism industry and international passenger movements. Preliminary works have already started, with site identification underway. To facilitate this huge investment by Airports Fiji Limited, Government will provide the necessary infrastructure support. Fiji Airways has also been undertaking major investments in renewing its fleet through both outright purchases and leasing arrangements. This will continue and will ensure that our national air carrier offers passengers a well- maintained and efficient aircraft fleet. These additional aircrafts will support plans to increase the number of available seats across all markets. Apart from this, government will assist Fiji Airways in exploring and establishing new routes across the globe. SEA CONNECTIVITY Fiji’s seaports provide the major gateway for container and cargo movement and more recently for passenger movements with the growth in cruise tourism. Recently, government has partnered with the private sector for the management of Fiji’s ports and cargo terminals. This is to FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2021 83 ensure increased efficiency in port services. International best practices have been embraced, and plans have been developed to modernise port infrastructure. For Fiji to be a regional and international hub, it is necessary to improve cargo-volume handling for imports, exports and transhipments. Investments will be made to raise berthing capacity and water depth, improve port efficiency, reduce turnaround time, adopt modern technology (communications and information technology), and make supporting industries and services available, with reasonable charges levied. The Suva and Lautoka ports have been upgraded to better facilitate container movement. Modern cargo- handling machinery has been introduced, leading to improvements in service delivery and gains in efficiency. With increasing trade flows and cargo movements, expansion of berthing facilities and cargo storage is needed. A long-term Ports Master Plan with a 7-year implementation plan is currently being developed to determine the current state and scope of international port operations. Government is exploring options for development of a new international seaport in Vanua Levu and the possibility of relocating cargo services from the Suva Wharf. An initial feasibility study for the port in Vanua Levu has been undertaken, with work underway for technical, economic and environmental impact assessment and detailed design work. There are also opportunities to expand Fiji Ships & Heavy Industries Limited’s (FSHIL) core business, such as in slipping, ship repairs, refit, refurbishments and heavy industries and engineering works. Partnerships between government and the private sector will be pursued to support the company in expanding its services in these areas. 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 84 Goal, Policies and Strategies Goal: Enhancing Fiji’s status as a vibrant and modern regional and international hub for people and cargo movement POLICIES STRATEGIES Improve Nadi’s position as the nation’s main gateway. yComplete upgrade and modernisation of Nadi International Airport. yUpgrade current terminal to include transit lounges and other services. yConstruct Terminal 2 and additional flight gates. yUpgrade current runways. yConstruction of international transit hotel near Nadi Airport. yOngoing modernisation of the Fiji Airways fleet and the introduction of new international destinations.

Government is continuously working towards improving the enabling environment for the private sector to thrive and expand. Tax rates have been reduced substantially, registration and licensing requirements are being streamlined, the new Companies Act has been enacted, business-opening hours have been relaxed, private sector participation in strategic areas is being pursued and supportive infrastructure is being developed. All this is contributing to reducing the overall cost of doing business in Fiji. In the next 5 years, further improvements will be made to support business activity. The policy and regulatory framework for investment will be reviewed to entice more investment. Government is working with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) on the review of the Investment Policy and legislation. The implementation of the single-window clearance platform for tier 1 agencies will be strengthened and tier 2 agencies will be expedited. Government has engaged Singapore Cooperation Enterprise to provide technical assistance to improve the ease of doing business. Approvals processes for regulatory agencies in the provision of services such as registration, land-use administration, development control, environmental protection, employment relations and tax administration will be enhanced through e-government. Land-use administration will be improved through digitisation of the Titles Office and development of the national land register. This will also include better access to accurate geospatial land-use information. Development permission and building approvals are also important aspects of the business regulatory framework. In this regard, the Regulation of Building Permits Act 2017 has been passed and will provide a fast-track and streamlined process to enhance the existing building permits approvals process. The Town Planning Act and the Sub-division of Land Act are currently under review. Tax administration will be further improved through development of the National Tax Information System (NTIS), opening new Fiji Revenue & Customs Services (FRCS) offices around Fiji and streamlining processes to improve efficiency and consistency in tax administration. The competition policy framework will be enhanced to promote greater self-regulation and compliance and reduce restrictive trade practices. A PPP policy framework will be adopted to support private-sector investment in major national infrastructure projects and other strategic areas. The Public Enterprises Act 1996 will be reviewed to support reorganisation processes and increase private-sector participation. 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 88 Goal, Policies and Strategies Goal: A sound regulatory environment for inclusive and sustainable private sector development POLICIES STRATEGIES Enhance land use administration. yCapacity building to develop the Fiji Geospatial Information System, National Land Bank and National Land Register. y Support development of iTaukei and State land to improve access for productive purposes, including identification of land for deposit in the Land Bank through public awareness. y Strengthen administration of lease processes.

In the next 5 years, interventions will focus on improving the institutional setting, access to finance, business incubation and training and connecting MSMEs to markets. A MSME council has been established to provide policy direction and leadership to enable and facilitate strategies for the development of MSMEs in the country. A Central Coordinating Agency will be established to develop, implement, monitor and evaluate MSME development in collaboration with various stakeholders. The primary focus will be on coordinating financing, facilitating business training, mentoring, advisory and incubation, and data-collection support. Government will continue and further expand financial assistance provided under the Micro and Small Business Grant (MSBG) scheme, SME credit guarantee, and subsidies through the Fiji Development Bank (FDB) and continue to encourage the financial sector to provide loans to MSMEs. Government will also launch the Young Entrepreneurship Scheme (YES), which will provide immediate assistance in the form of grants to qualified young and budding entrepreneurs, who have bankable ideas/projects which financial institutions are not willing to support due to lack of collaterals. A ‘Roadside Stalls Project’ will be piloted to provide vendors along the highway in the areas outside of municipalities with standardized stalls to sell their produce. This project will not only improve the standards, presentation and hygiene of their produce, but also assist to gradually mainstream these vendors into the formal sector. A Secured Transactions Framework is being drafted that will allow for the use of movable property such as equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, equities, crops and livestock as collateral for accessing loans. This will ease the access of MSMEs to the formal financial sector. To guide the operations of microfinance service providers, a legal and regulatory framework will be developed. A database will be established to register MSMEs to ensure availability of reliable data that will assist in policymaking. More funding and other resources will be channelled towards business incubation, skills training and other support services. 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 92 Goal, Policies and Strategies Goal: Promoting entrepreneurial culture through sustainable micro, small and medium enterprises POLICIES STRATEGIES Reform of MSME business regulatory environment. yEstablishment of a National MSME Council. yEstablishment of a new MSME Central Coordinating Agency. yReview the legislative and strategic framework for MSMEs in line with the recommendations of the Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP). yReview of Fiji Development Bank. yReview of current data sources on MSMEs and establishment of new MSME database.

The elimination of fiscal duty on raw materials, zero duty on plant and machinery, low corporate taxes, tax free regions and other fiscal incentives have been provided by Government to support manufacturing and commerce. Apart from this, the Fijian Made-Buy Fijian campaign has augured well for the promotion of locally manufactured products, both within Fiji and internationally. Government’s focus in the next 5 years is to develop Fiji as a manufacturing hub of the Pacific. Our large educated workforce, competitive wage rates, and attractive business environment provide the enabling environment for the manufacturing sector to thrive. The Fijian Trade Policy Framework identifies the manufacturing sector as a key sector that will lead to broadening of the export base through the promotion of value addition and diversification. Investments will be supported for competitive high- value-added industries with an emphasis on agro- based manufacturing and niche products for export development. Foreign direct investment will be encouraged in a number of new industries. Government will develop specialised economic zones built on the “plug and play” concept with tailor made incentives to attract investments in the services and manufacturing industries. In this regard, the Wairabetia Economic Zone, in the Western Division, will be the first such specialised economic zone. Joint ventures between foreign and local investors and other PPP modalities will be encouraged, with a key focus on technology transfer. To meet the skills requirements of the manufacturing sector, specialised training and skill development will be provided. The required skills will be developed in collaboration with the technical colleges and tertiary institutions. The apprenticeship programme will also be strengthened. 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 94 Goal, Policies and Strategies Goal: Building sustainable and globally competitive manufacturing and commerce.

Fiji has a relatively well-developed financial sector comprising commercial banks, licensed credit institutions, insurance companies, non-bank financial institutions, a superannuation fund and the stock exchange. The financial system has been well regulated by the Reserve Bank of Fiji. In the next 5 years, more emphasis will be placed on improving financial literacy, financial inclusion, improving access to finance, integrated digital-payment systems, access to insurance services, capital market development, and establishing the legal framework for regulation of credit unions and moneylenders. 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 96 Goal, Policies and Strategies Goal: A deep, competitive and stable financial system POLICIES STRATEGIES Improve financial literacy. yReview and monitor financial education programs for primary and secondary schools. y Introduce financial literacy programs for tertiary students, low-income groups, and rural and marginalised communities. yEncourage a savings culture amongst youths. y Improve coordination of adult financial education training programs between government, the private sector and development partners.

This is projected to increase to around 56 percent by 2021. To create vibrant and sustainable urban centres, government in the next 5 years will focus on better urban development strategies, the identification and development of future growth centres, extension of town boundaries, urban waste management, beautification, disaster planning and response, upgrading and relocation of informal settlements, better traffic management and provision of basic services. The Urban Policy Action Plan 2007 will be reviewed with a view to undertaking institutional reforms. Spatial plans and miniature models will be developed to guide long- term development in all urban centres. Areas identified for new-town development include Navua, Korovou, Nabouwalu, Keiyasi, Vunidawa, and Seaqaqa. The City and Town Planning Scheme will be reviewed and town boundaries will be extended to enable provision of municipal services. Nature and recreation parks, gardens and walkways will be developed to beautify towns and cities and also ensure balance between urban expansion, nature and quality of living. Consideration will be given to the establishment of a Waste Management Authority to provide more efficient, effective and financially viable waste-management services to municipal councils. Waste recycling and transfer stations will also be developed in strategic areas around the country. All new urban development projects will need to comply with guidelines to ensure resilience to climatic hazards and natural disasters. Structural integrity and climate and disaster-proof designs will be key aspects of future projects, together with early-warning systems, disaster- response plans, inter-agency coordination and enhanced disaster-response capacity. A special Smart City Programme shall be developed for the Towns and Cities to ensure that the towns are cities adapt to global modern urban management practices. Smart City is expected to see that town and city centres promote green growth initiatives including green energy, effective and environmentally friendly transport systems, security for inhabitants, green building construction, technology advancement and new techniques for solid- waste management—all for the purpose of promoting a clean and green environment. Sister-city arrangements shall be formed to drive the agenda at the town and city level. Sister-city arrangements are seen as a way to drive economic and green growth within our township centres and to foster technical advancement of town and city councils. Ministry of Local Government and Housing has been working with councils to establish sister-city relations with overseas counterparts. This year two sister-city relationships have been formed, one for Suva and one for Lautoka City. FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2021 99 Goal, Policies and Strategies Goal: Creating vibrant and environmentally sustainable urban centres. POLICIES STRATEGIES Strengthen urban management and administration of town planning at municipal level. yReview status of Urban Policy Action Plan to determine achievements and areas for future work. The outcome of the review will guide the relevant institutional changes needed to improve urban management. yUpdate all town-planning schemes to ensure they reflect the current state on the ground. This will provide a better basis to develop long-term spatial plans. yDevelop spatial plans with associated 20-year miniature models for all urban centres. The participation of all stakeholders within the municipality will be required to agree on the long-term vision for each urban centre. The development of the miniature models can be outsourced. yDevelop a programme to support the capacity of all municipal councils to effectively administer town-planning responsibilities. This will include stronger enforcement and adherence to the town- planning schemes and spatial plans that will be developed. yUpdate town-planning schemes of small towns. Take the opportunity to adopt technology and urban management practices used successfully in towns abroad but adapted to suit the local context. Develop functional linkages between small towns and surrounding rural areas. These linkages to be part of the long-term development plan for the Division. Strengthen long-term planning for identification of growth centres and their development into vibrant urban centres. y Identify areas for future growth in line with the development plans of each Division. y Identify potential industries to support development and viability of growth centres in each relevant area through private-public partnerships. yContinue with the identification and extension of town boundaries that will ensure standardisation of building structures, creation of employment opportunities and bring social services to the people. Create an environment that fosters resource efficiency and effective management practices by individual households and corporate bodies within urban centres. y Incentivise households and businesses to invest in renewable energy and adopt energy efficiency practices and technology including provision for subsidies. yDevelop and legislate energy efficiency standards for new buildings. All new buildings should have an energy conservation plan before they are approved. y Introduce a rating system based on energy efficiency level of buildings (both existing and new) relative to legislated standards. Achievement of certain standards will earn certification and receive benefits from government. Start with voluntary assessment then move to mandatory assessment 10 years after standards have been adopted. yExamine options for effective and efficient rainwater harvesting systems within urban centres. The recommended solutions for each urban centre to be integrated into Municipal plans. y Incentivise waste management processes, including controlling the type of packaging material entering the country and recycling. yReview institutional arrangements for waste management with a view to identifying the best model that can deliver an efficient, effective and financially viable waste management operation. This includes undertaking a feasibility study for a Waste Management Authority proposed in the Green Growth Framework. In the interim, the Central Government will provide support to local municipal councils to effectively manage waste disposal. Include vulnerability assessments, and climate change and natural hazards impact projections in infrastructure and urban planning. yUndertake climate change modelling on all urban centres and develop hazard maps for all urban centres. y Incorporate climate change adaptation and disaster risk management into town planning schemes. y Infrastructure designs to incorporate building resilience to disasters. y Strengthen coastal boundaries of urban centres through running a competition on design for coastal development of main urban central business districts that not only support natural biodiversity but also build resilience and protect urban infrastructure. The winning design to be adopted as a model in the spatial plan for an urban centre. For this plan period, the focus will be on Suva. yEnsure disaster risk reduction and disaster management response plans are developed for all urban centres. These plans should address issues such as early warning systems, inter-agency coordination and the disaster response capacity of key agencies. yBuild partnerships between the community, private sector and municipal councils to collectively address climate change and disaster risk management challenges in urban centres. y Improve knowledge and understanding at all levels of municipal governance of the hazard maps relevant to their respective jurisdictions. yEstablish a National Platform for Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management where stakeholders can interact and better coordinate resources. yUndertake awareness on climate change adaptation and strengthen disaster management at community level through the dissemination of user-friendly brochures, public debates, social media and other multimedia sources. y Implement a mangrove revitalization program. 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 100 Programmes and Projects PROGRAMME ANNUAL TARGET TOTAL OUTPUT EXPECTED LEAD AGENCIES2017-2018 2018-2019 2019-2020 2020-2021 2021-2022 New or revised legislation 3 (Town Planning Act, Subdivision of Lands Act, and Local Government Act) 3 MLGH Town Planning Schemes 2 Levuka, Nadi 1 Nausori 1 Labasa 3 Sigatoka, Nabouwalu, Navua 2 Savusavu, Levuka 9 MLG Urban Centre Miniature Models 3 Suva, Lautoka, Nadi 3 Nausori, Labasa, Nasinu 3 Sigatoka, Ba, Lami 9 MLG and Municipal Councils Improvement of final disposal sites 1 Labasa 1 Sigatoka 1 Savusavu 1 Levuka 1 Rakiraki 5 Municipal Council and MoEn Waste Management in Municipal Councils 1 Nasinu 1 Nadi 1 Nausori 1 Labasa 4 Municipal Council and MoEn New Growth Centres 6 (Navua, Korovou, Nabouwalu, Keiyasi, Vunidawa, and Seaqaqa.) 6 MLG and FEA, WAF, NFA and FRA Hazard maps of urban areas 20 20 MLG and DOL Suva Coastal development plan 1 1 Suva City Council Municipal Councils Investment Projects: Suva 1 2 1 1 5 Suva City Council Lami 2 1 3 Lami Town Council Sigatoka 2 1 3 Sigatoka Town Council Nadi 1 1 2 Nadi Town Council Ba 1 1 2 Ba Town Council MSBG 1 1 2 Tavua Town Council Rakiraki 1 1 Rakiraki Town Council Nausori 2 1 3 Nausori Town Council Nasinu 1 1 1 3 Nasinu Town Council Levuka 5 5 Levuka Town Council Labasa 1 1 Labasa Town Council FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2021 101 PROGRAMME ANNUAL TARGET TOTAL OUTPUT EXPECTED LEAD AGENCIES2017-2018 2018-2019 2019-2020 2020-2021 2021-2022 Savusavu 1 1 2 Savusavu Town Council MoEn: Ministry of Environment; DOL: Department of Lands; MLG: Ministry of Local Government; FEA: Fiji Electricity Authority; FRA: Fiji Roads Authority; MLGH: Ministry of Local Government and Housing; NFA: National Fire Authority; WAF: Water Authority of Fiji.

Because this is a cross-cutting issue, other thematic areas also address the development of rural and maritime areas. Recent years have witnessed substantial government investment in the development of rural infrastructure, provision of education and health services, rural electrification, access to water, income-generating opportunities, better communications and transportation. Over the next 5 years, these investments will continue in a more integrated manner. Divisional development plans will be developed in consultation with the relevant communities and other stakeholders for consideration for funding support by government. Strategies will be implemented to improve production and better facilitate linkages between the agriculture sector and the market. This will assist in better organising rural farmers through cluster farming, provision of extension services, farm-access roads, irrigation, mechanisation, marketing support and export development. The role of the Agriculture Marketing Authority will be strengthened to provide effective marketing support without crowding out the private sector. For disaster-risk management in rural and maritime areas, government has identified 830 vulnerable communities at risk from climate-related events to be relocated. Out of this, 48 communities in urgent need of relocation would be supported through government funding with assistance from development partners. As part of its disaster-response and rehabilitation policy, the government is identifying and constructing evacuation centres that are compliant with the building code. Community-based adaptation measures in rural and maritime regions will also be prioritised. These include the construction of sea walls, watershed management, river dredging and drainage, and riverbank protection. There will be equal access by all to the factors of agricultural production. This policy will pay particular attention to the gender differences in access to and repayment of credit, the beneficiaries of land purchase, land titling, public amenities, extension services and technology. The policy will consider the disadvantaged position of the most vulnerable women in rural areas.

In preparation for the phasing out of preferential access to the EU, industry reforms have been undertaken to depoliticise the industry, improve milling efficiency and increase cane production. The Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) 5 year Strategic Action Plan lays out a vision that supports the transition towards a modern and vibrant industry. The objective of the Action Plan is to raise sugarcane production to around 3.9 million tonnes to match the crushing capacity of the mills, which is estimated at around 4.2 million tons per annum32. The industry is currently producing around 1.6 million tonnes of cane. Cane replanting over the past five years has been badly affected by natural disasters and adverse climatic conditions. To support adaptation to climate change, Government will invest in improving farm drainage infrastructure and irrigation to control water run-off and saltwater intrusion. Through the Sugar Research Institute of Fiji (SRIF), FSC will develop improved cane varieties to improve resilience of crops and production systems to climate change. In the next five years, the government will support FSC and farmers to raise cane production to 3 million tonnes each year. Existing programmes on farm access roads, cane replanting and fertiliser subsidy will continue to ensure that production costs remain stable. In addition, FSC will invest in establishing its own farms. Such an investment will lead to an increase in the adoption of mechanisation within the industry. 32. According to FSC records this target has been achieved 9 times over the 135 years history of the company. FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2021 107 Goal, Policies and Strategies Goal: A sustainable sugar industry POLICIES STRATEGIES Enhance the growth of the sugar industry. y Improve industry governance through introduction of relevant legislation to support reform and reorganisation for growth of the industry. y Secure new sugar markets. y Promote programmes to entice young and active famers into sugar cane farming. yEstablish FSC owned farms to support production. y Increase support for and adoption of mechanisation. y Increase cane production to 3.0 million tonnes per annum by 2022/23. y Introduction of mechanical harvesting and establishment of lorry to rail transfer stations. y Full implementation of the cane quality payment system by 2022/23. yDevelop climate resilient cane varieties Programmes and Projects PROGRAMME ANNUAL TARGET TOTAL OUTPUT EXPECTED LEAD AGENCIES 2017-2018 2018-2019 2019-2020 2020-2021 2021- 2022 Sugar Development Programme (No. of hectares of fallow land planting and replanting) 6,000 6,000 6,000 7,000 8,000 33,000 ha FSC, MoS Sugar Development Programme (No. of hectares of ratoon restoration) 160 1,000 1,000 1,000 1,500 4,660 ha FSC, MoS Penang to Rarawai cartage subsidy (tonnes of sugar cane) 175,000 180,000 185,000 185,000 200,000 925,000 tonnes FSC, MoS Subsidy to South Pacific Fertilizer Limited (No. of farmers subsidized) 12,500 12,500 12,500 12,500 12,500 12,500 per annum FSC, MoS, SPFL active farmers Upgrade of Cane Access Roads (No. of roads upgraded) 2,869 2,869 2,869 2,869 2,869 2,869 roads per year FSC, MoS FSC: Fiji Sugar Corporation; MoS: Ministry of Sugar; SPFL: South Pacific Fertilizer Limited.

Source: Ministry of Sugar. 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 108 3.2.12 NON SUGAR AGRICULTURE ‘‘Competitive, sustainable and value- adding agriculture” The agriculture sector provides an important source of livelihood, food and nutrition security, income and employment. Government is focused on promoting self-sufficiency in the production and export of those agricultural products where Fiji has a competitive advantage. In the next 5 years, key interventions will be pursued to increase production of commodities under bilateral quarantine agreements (eggplant, okra, pawpaw, chillies, and breadfruit), as well as rice, taro, cassava, fruits and vegetables, kava, organic products, livestock and dairy products. Commodity plans for each product will be developed or reviewed. These plans will set targets and map out clear strategies to be implemented over the Plan period. Government will support initiatives for crop replanting, supplying agro inputs, extension services and training for young farmers, relevant crop-oriented research, provision of high-yielding and climate-resilient seeds and crop varieties, and better land-use planning. Apart from these initiatives, the commodity plans will provide directions for cluster farming, contract farming, and access to finance and labour requirements. Mechanisation and new technologies will be adopted through government support and through private sector partnerships in areas of hydroponics, livestock and dairy, organic farming, and processing of agricultural products (ginger, rice, fresh fruits and vegetables) and fruit drinks. These initiatives will boost large-scale production. They will also help knowledge transfer, help build expertise, and attract investment and access to markets. Small farms will also be assisted to graduate to semi-commercial status. The Agricultural Marketing Authority (AMA) will be strengthened to provide effective marketing support to farmers in the rural and outer islands, while avoiding crowding out private sector participation. Stronger links will be forged between farms and markets to create greater synergy between the agricultural sector and the tourism industry. For export development, we will continue to capitalise on our favourable trade and quarantine arrangements that allow exports of agricultural produce to Australia, New Zealand, the US, Europe, Canada, China and neighbouring Pacific Island countries. Opportunities to expand Fiji’s exports for sale in mainstream supermarket chains overseas will also be pursued in the future.

FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2021 113 3.2.13 FISHERIES “Sustainably managed fisheries resources” The fisheries industry is one of Fiji’s key resource-based sectors. The sector consists of commercial offshore fishing, inshore fisheries, bêche-de-mer, aquarium fish, reef fish, seaweed, black pearls, aquaculture and other aquatic- based products. The private sector has been the lead player in the fishing industry, with government providing the regulatory and resource-management oversight and pursuing adherence to regional and international commitments. Government has also supported the industry in the diversification of export markets, trade facilitation, product research and development, conducive fiscal and tax environment and infrastructure. The government is endeavouring to address several sector- development challenges, including falling fish stocks, slow growth in aquaculture, finding ways to add value to fisheries resources, and the negative effects of climate change. The National Fisheries Policy that will be finalised soon will guide the management and development of sustainable fisheries within the offshore, inshore, coastal and aquaculture sub-sectors. The Offshore Fisheries Decree 2014 and the Offshore Fisheries Management Regulations 2014 will continue to guide the development and sustainable management of the tuna fishery as well as the overall offshore fisheries sector. Monitoring and enforcement will be strengthened to minimise illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. The Government is devising a distribution model to provide financial assistance to domestic fishing companies through the Tuna Stabilisation Fund. To obtain premium prices in export markets, certification for sustainable harvesting practices will continue and will be periodically monitored and reviewed. The inshore fisheries sector will be sustainably managed through the further establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPA) and other measures to provide for better catch management. The issue of permits and licences for traditional fishing rights of Qoliqoli (Customary Fishing Rights Area) is currently under review in consultation with relevant stakeholders. Government, in collaboration with its partners, will continue to support the revitalisation and conservation of mangroves and corals. To ensure better management of coastal and inshore fisheries, a reliable data-gathering framework will be established to track the level of catch and fish stock on a regular basis. In light of the increasing demand for fisheries product, private sector investments will be supported in aquaculture projects through tax incentives, provision of juvenile fry and post-larva stocks, and research and extension services. The government will continue investment in the development of a multispecies hatchery. Value addition of fish products will also be supported and promoted. 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 114 Goal, Policies and Strategies Goal: Sustainably managed fisheries resources.

Sustainable forest-management practices will continue for the wood growing and processing industry to flourish. An increased effort will be placed on plantation development. The Government has been the key player in forest-plantation management, with the private sector involved in harvesting and timber processing. Moving forward, private sector involvement in forest-plantation development and management will be increased through long-term leasing arrangements and appropriate technical support. A National Plantation Policy will be introduced to provide guidelines for setting up private- sector plantations and their operations as well as a Fire Management Strategic Plan to address the threat of forest fires to standing stock. The Government will support reforestation of native and exotic forests, and Fiji’s forest area, which is protected under long-term conservation initiatives, will be increased further. More areas will be identified under the Fiji REDD+35 programme to protect our forests and at the same time generate financial benefits under carbon-trading mechanisms. This will also support Fiji’s commitment to reduce carbon emissions. A new framework has been adopted for the harvesting of native forests. Framework guidelines set specific diameter limits by wood species, frequency of wood species logged and the standing volume of a forest. The excellent quality of the country’s timber and wood products is well-known in international markets, and Fiji is also known to have the world’s largest non-native mahogany stock in the world. Strategies will be put in place to capture better returns from greater value addition by incorporating more down-stream processing. An important engine of growth for the forestry sector will be local micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) such as wood carvers and traditional handicraft artisans. Support will continue to be given to the development of small-to-medium cottage industries through the timber utilisation and research division within the Ministry of Forests. Fiji also has potential for growth in wood bio-energy. Private sector partnerships will continue to be supported in this area. Goal, Policies and Strategies Goal: Sustainable management and development of forestry resources. POLICIES STRATEGIES Strengthen sustainable forest management. y Strengthen efforts on forest conservation, sustainable forest harvesting practices and climate change mitigation and adaptation. yLong-term leasing mechanism(s) to support forest conservation, forest concessions and plantation leases.

Mining activities are expected to increase in the near future, with eight mining leases currently being monitored and 78 exploratory licenses being issued. Apart from mineral exploration, these licences include offshore oil exploration and geothermal exploration to support renewable energy production. Government will ensure sustainable mining practices and ecological balance together with equitable sharing of revenue amongst investors, landowners and the State. The Mining Act, policies and institutional framework for mining and quarrying and the monitoring and evaluation of operations will be revised and updated for better oversight in areas such as Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) and environmental safeguards. Monitoring the environmental impact of mining and quarrying activities will be strengthened. The responsibilities of the Environment Unit within the Ministry of Land and Mineral Resources have been broadened to include the assessment and monitoring of river-gravel extraction, fine-sand dredging, and all foreshore development leases and licenses. Environmental impact assessments, compliance monitoring, consultations and rehabilitation work will also be part of the expanded role of the unit. Investigation of potential groundwater sites will continue in order to increase production and access to sustainable, clean and safe drinking water. More boreholes will be drilled and linked to water reticulation systems supplied to households. The mining department will purchase a drill rig in 2017/18. Local laboratories will be upgraded to undertake water-quality testing and geochemical analysis so that samples do not need to be sent overseas for analysis. 36.

Key Performance Indicators INDICATOR 2015 2021 Private Sector Investment (% of GDP) 20.9 >15 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 122 3.2.16 TOURISM “A world-class tourism destination that increasingly adds value to the local economy” Tourism is one of the leading sectors of the Fijian economy. It makes a major contribution to foreign exchange earnings and employment and has large beneficial multiplier effects in the economy. Visitor arrivals increased to an all-time high of 792,320 in 2016, with total tourism earnings of over $1.6 billion. While Australia, New Zealand and the USA remain Fiji’s key source markets, visitor arrivals from emerging markets like China and India are growing at significant rates. Over the last few years, our accommodation services have been continually improving, with the number of rooms and beds increasing. Airline services have improved with increased fleet and capacity for Fiji Airways, new direct flights and increased frequency. With our pristine natural environment, top-class hospitality services, improved air connectivity, competitive Fijian dollar, effective marketing and cultural diversity and heritage, there is more potential to be realised. By 2021, tourism earnings are expected to increase to around $2.2 billion. The Fijian Tourism 2021 (Fijian Tourism Development Plan 2017-2021) sets out the following priority areas to achieve the goal of total earnings of $2.2 billion: y Driving demand for Fiji’s tourism brand; y Increasing the value of Fiji’s tourism products; y Facilitating and promoting domestic and foreign investment; y Investing in tourism-related infrastructure; y Strengthening linkages to the tourism industry; y Ensuring continued sustainable development of the tourism industry; y Building a conducive and updated legal framework; y Enhancing Risk Management; and y Measuring the performance of Fiji’s tourism industry. In the next 5 years, Fiji will expand its tourism industry to niche segments, such as sports tourism, cruise tourism, wedding and honeymoon tourism, hosting of conferences and entertainment events, wellness tourism, and adventure tourism. The Fijian Government will continue to bring international events such as rugby competitions, golf tournaments, sailing regattas and formal conferences and meetings to Fiji. This will not only attract visitors during off-peak seasons, but also promote Fiji in foreign markets that would otherwise require large marketing outlays. The Fijian Government, in partnership with the private sector, is also exploring the possibility of developing large production studios, securing specialised equipment for hire by foreign crews, nurturing local acting and production talent and continuing to offer attractive tax rebates for production of films and television shows in Fiji. This will also promote Fiji as a tourism destination. Apart from supporting large-scale hotel development and related facilities, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the tourism sector will continue to be supported. Other niche activities, such as dolphin and whale watching, village tours, river rafting and zip lining, snorkelling and boating, eco-tourism and promoting Fiji’s cultural and heritage sites will support MSMEs and local communities. MSMEs will also be provided training, mentoring, incubation and other business development support services through the MSME Central Coordinating Agency. Market linkages that enable the supply of local agricultural and fisheries produce to the tourism industry will be facilitated and developed. Manufacturing of high- end niche products such as natural body products, exotic herbs and spices, local confectionaries, local fruit juices, handicrafts and packed organic goods will be promoted. Retail-sector development that provides unique shopping experiences and promotes the Fijian Made-Buy Fijian Campaign will also continue to be supported. Urban centres will be developed with urban gardens, parks, seaside walkways, cultural and heritage sculptures, art installations and museums to entice visitors to explore urban and suburban areas. This will particularly benefit cruise tourism, which has been flourishing in recent years. To further support this form of tourism, our wharves and jetties will be modernised and upgraded. Government will continue to provide a marketing grant to Tourism Fiji. In order to capitalise on its position as the transportation hub, Fiji will participate in initiatives to market the Pacific as a tourism destination that would benefit Fiji and the region. In addition, the Tourism Satellite Accounts (TSA) will be prepared by the Fijian Bureau of Statistics on a two-year interval to accurately measure the economic contribution of the tourism industry and at the same time identify areas of strategic intervention where the industry can expand further.

In this regard, Fiji is a member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and party to a number of trade agreements such as Pacific Islands Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA), Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) Trade Agreement, South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement (SPARTECA) and Interim Economic Partnership Agreement (IEPA). Upon the expiration of the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement-Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Scheme (SPARTECA-TCF) in 2014, Fiji qualified for trade benefits under Australia’s Developing Country (DC) Preferences Scheme. Under the WTO, Fiji has recently ratified the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement, which is expected to increase efficiency and effectiveness of trade facilitation agencies in Fiji. Fiji will continue to engage with Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER) Plus parties and push for commencement of negotiation on the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with the European Union, which has been suspended for 3 years. Fiji continues its policy to seek beneficial trade and political relationships with new and non-traditional partners and is engaged in discussions with China on a bilateral trade arrangement. The Interim Economic Partnership Agreement between Fiji/Papua New Guinea and the European Union (EU) will be mirrored with the United Kingdom, in light of Britain’s exit from the EU. Furthermore, discussions will commence on improving the provisions of IEPA for better market access and conditions. The Fijian Trade Policy Framework guides Fiji’s engagement in future trade agreements to capitalise on Fiji’s position as the hub of the Pacific. The Trade Policy Framework determines how to connect all the dots and addresses our production capacity, and supply-side constraints. It is about all stakeholders working together towards the ultimate goal of increasing exports for Fijian made products and services. Export development will be supported through raising competitiveness, diversification and value addition under the National Export Strategy (NES) in priority sectors. With the increase in flight connectivity and cargo traffic, 38. World Travel and Tourism Council, 2016, Travel and Tourism Economic Impact Analysis - Fiji, London, United Kingdom. 39. Fiji Higher Education Commission 40. South Pacific Tourism Organisation, Pacific Cruise Market Research and Intelligence Project FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2021 127 new opportunities for trade between Fiji and Europe, the USA, Singapore, and other Asian countries will be developed. Trade promotion and facilitation will be pursued through our trade commissions based in key markets, in collaboration with relevant domestic stakeholders. Customs procedures, biosecurity inspections and port services will be further streamlined and improved to reduce red tape. Tariff policy reviews will be consistent with our economic development aspirations and priorities, taking into account the potential risks to revenue, industrial growth, employment and social conditions and the facilitation of private sector adjustment. Government will seek to improve Fiji’s trading position and competitiveness through training, research and institution-building and continue to seek access to Aid for Trade from development partners to assist in building trade capacity and infrastructure. INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS Fiji’s foreign policy is guided by our Constitution to best serve the interests of the people of Fiji, recognising universally accepted principles and rules of international law and treaties to which Fiji is a party. Pacific regionalism will be promoted and strengthened based on equality and genuine partnership. A level platform for dialogue and consensus building will be promoted on critical development issues for all Pacific Island countries. Fiji acknowledges and aims to strengthen regional dialogue and consensus-building through the Pacific Island Development Forum (PIDF). The Forum promotes regional cooperation in pursuit of home-grown solutions to address sustainable development challenges faced by Pacific Small Island States, including the adoption and mainstreaming of the Green Growth Framework for Fiji. Similarly, this commitment will also be pursued through the MSG. Within the global community, Fiji is a member of the United Nations and its specialised agencies, the International Monetary Fund, World Bank group, the Asian Development Bank, the European Investment Bank and the World Trade Organization. Fiji supports an inclusive and participatory approach to sustainable development and recognises that development partnership and cooperation should be guided by the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Fiji will strengthen its regional standing through South- South Cooperation, as a development partner in the region promoting cooperation to enhance regional integration and active cooperation in addressing common regional issues at both regional and international fora. Goal, Policies and Strategies Goal: Expanding trade base and economic engagement in the global community POLICIES STRATEGIES Improve Fiji’s overall trade performance through a more competitive economy and thereby help establish Fiji as the modern hub of the Pacific. y Facilitate the engagement of Fiji in multilateral, regional and bilateral trade agreements/arrangements. y Secure and maintain improved market access into the regional and international markets. y Promote and enhance the competitiveness of Fijian products and services in the international market. y Facilitate the efficient flow of trade through compliance with the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement and successful implementation of single window clearance. y Support the improvement of trade related infrastructure. y Provide trade or market information to traders and the business community. yCreate conditions for sustained increase in investment and the increase in total factor productivity. yAssist domestic firms to increase their levels of efficiency and competitiveness. y Stimulate and encourage value-addition activities through research and development. y Strengthen capacities of trade support institutions particularly those directly engaged with trade policy, customs, standards, trade facilitation, competition, consumer protection and provisions of trade –related information. 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 128 Programmes and Projects PROGRAMME ANNUAL TARGET TOTAL OUTPUT EXPECTED LEAD AGENCIES2017-2018 2018-2019 2019-2020 2020-2021 2021- 2022 Market Access: Alternative markets for sugar At least 1 new or alternative market for sugar 1 new market for sugar MoS, MITT Trade negotiations: Comprehensive EPA, PACER Plus, Melanesian Free Trade Agreement, revision of PICTA trade in goods rules of origin, enhancement of the United States GSP scheme and preferential trade arrangement with China Finalisation of IEPA with the UK 41 MITT Trade Facilitation Compliance with the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement.

FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2021 129 3.2.18 INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY “Universal access to information and competitive telecommunication services delivered on a secure platform” Information and communication technology (ICT) has transformed the lives of people by raising productivity and growth, creating more employment, improving connectivity between urban and rural areas, enhancing service delivery and promoting innovation. Fiji has a competitive edge in the region because of our access to the Southern Cross Cable fibre optic network (SCCN), which provides fast (240Gbps), direct and secure connectivity with Australia, New Zealand, and the USA and reduces reliance on satellite capacity, which can be congested and costly. Our telecommunications and internet capabilities have seen marked improvements, with 95 percent of the country connected through wire and wireless network. Fiji has also developed the region’s first national broadband policy. Mobile phone penetration and mobile broadband access have increased with the extension of 3G and 4G network coverage. Government services are being provided on the digital platform, and Community Telecentres have been developed. The fibre optic cable project between Viti Levu and Vanua Levu via the Samoa-Fiji submarine cable is currently underway and will address bandwidth capacity constraints and make internet more accessible to all Fijians. Other planned fibre optic cable projects will be pursued through private sector partnerships. Competition will be enhanced in broadband internet services by making communication infrastructure available to multiple users under reasonable terms and conditions. The Telecommunication Authority of Fiji (TAF) will regularly survey areas to be a “Declared Universal Service Area”, which is a prerequisite for telecommunications companies to erect network towers in those areas. Government will adopt strategies to ensure that ICT infrastructure is climate resilient. Fiji’s strategic location between Asia and the USA provides a time-zone business advantage to access East Asia, the USA, and Europe. With abundant skilled technical labour, a good English-speaking population, low costs of doing business and tax incentives, investment will be attracted for ICT development in back-office operations and call centres. 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 130 Goal, Policies and Strategies Goal: Universal access to information and competitive telecommunication services delivered on a secure plat- form. POLICIES STRATEGIES Improve the telecommunications infrastructure. yDigital Government implementation – make priority government services, particularly Disaster, Recovery and Rehabilitation accessible online by 2020. yEnhance competition in broadband internet services, by making the existing fixed line infrastructure available to multiple users under reasonable terms and conditions i.e. local loop unbundling. yConsider Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in the construction of communications infrastructure (particularly for towers), and landing station infrastructure for connectivity to the Southern Cross Cable fibre optic network (SCCN). Funds from the universal service obligation fund and the international inbound call levy can be used for this purpose. y Fiji Roads Authority (FRA), the Water Authority of Fiji (WAF), Fiji Electricity Authority (FEA) and Telecom Fiji Limited (TFL) along with other utility providers to lay fibre optic cables, conduits and chambers when conducting trenching works during road construction or maintenance. yComplete the TFL fibre optic cable ring around Viti Levu. yEstablish a second redundant link from Viti Levu to Vanua Levu through Lomaiviti, to provide resiliency to Vanua Levu, Taveuni, Levuka, Lakeba and backhaul to other islands. yEstablish fibre optic connectivity between Viti Levu and Vanua Levu through the Samoa-Fiji submarine cable. y Fully implement the ICT Development Policy and National Broadband Policy 2011.

Timely assessments of public programmes and services will allow government to identify any constraints and address them. The immediate priority is to ensure effective, efficient and accountable delivery of Ministry and Department outputs, i.e. the delivery of public services and implementation of public programmes and projects under the 5-year Development Plan and measuring national development targets, which are aligned to regional and international indicators like the SDGs. 4.1 NATIONAL OUTCOMES AND MINISTRY OUTPUTS Monitoring and evaluation of the Plan and the 5-year DP will rely on the standard performance-based monitoring and evaluation framework focusing on outcomes and outputs. National outcomes are the: y National Development Targets under the 20-Year Development Plan; and y Sector goals, policy objectives and key performance indicators under the 5-year DP. Outputs are the strategies, programmes and projects for implementation by line ministries and other implementing agencies. Major national development challenges and issues that are cross-cutting in nature, such as human rights, green growth, climate change adaptation and disaster risk management, human resource development, employment and productivity and poverty alleviation have been mainstreamed into the various sector goals, policy objectives, strategies and programmes of the 5-year DP. The outputs for each Ministry and Department for monitoring and evaluation are aligned to relevant sector goals and national outcomes under the 5-year DP. 4.2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES The institutional framework for monitoring and evaluation is described in Table 2. Table 2: Institutional Framework for Monitoring and Evaluation COMPONENT ACTIVITY FOR M&E M&E INSTITUTIONS AND LEAD AGENCIES ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES Accountability Framework Compliance with Systems and Processes Parliament of Fiji - Public Accounts Committee Performance monitoring including compliance with systems and processes for effective management of public resourcesOffice of the Auditor-General Ministry of Civil Service Civil Service Performance Management Ministry of Economy: Fiji Procurement Office; Internal Audit and budget and Planning Division National Budget Implementation Resource Requirements Ministry of Economy; Line Ministries Incorporate M&E assessments by institutions and lead agencies into planning and decision-making processes Programme Performance Assess contribution of programmes and projects to Sectoral Goals and National Development Targets Macroeconomic Policy and Technical Committees Assess macroeconomic performance National Environment Council42 Assess the State of the Environment and National Resource Inventory Official Statistics Fiji Bureau of Statistics Line Ministries and Other Data Sources Coordinate compilation, collation and release of official statistics 42. Established under the EMA 2005 and responsible for the formulation of the National Environment Strategy including production of periodic State of the Environment Reports and Natural Resource Inventories. MONITORING AND EVALUATION SYSTEMS 135 Guiding Principles for Monitoring and Evaluation The monitoring and evaluation systems will operate under two main principles: i. Being strategic about how and what to monitor and evaluate to ensure efficient, effective and accountable delivery of agency outputs, i.e. programmes and projects for provision of public services. a. There will be ongoing periodic monitoring and evaluation of implementation progress and performance results for all programmes and projects under the 5-year DP identified for implementation under the National Budget or through other sources of funding. There will also be regular review of priority areas for monitoring and evaluation to support achievement of the 20-year Development Plan. b. Annual reviews by accountability institutions like the OAG and PAC will be used for monitoring and evaluation, with continued focus on implementing findings of annual audit reports. c. Efforts will be made by all government monitoring and evaluation agencies to streamline reporting processes for implementing agencies. This will be pursued by sharing information, relying on internal reports by implementing agencies whenever possible, and any other appropriate measures to reduce reporting requirements. ii. Monitoring and evaluation of national performance and outcomes are an integral part of the National Budget process. This involves the collection of official statistics and public sector performance management. Monitoring and evaluation of National Development Targets will: a. Commence with existing baseline data for national outcomes and where necessary baseline data will be compiled (e.g. national baseline data for the state of Fiji’s environment needs to be collated); b. Carry out assessments according to existing methodology (e.g. Public Sector Investment Programme - PSIP and Capital Budget Appraisals) for the provision of a service, adoption of a programme and allocation of resources. The evaluation will: i. Determine viability through assessments of the effectiveness and impact of public services, policy objectives, strategies, programmes and projects; and ii. Identify critical factors that have resulted in success or failure and possible areas for improvement. c. Be incorporated into government’s decision- making machinery, particularly the National Budget; d. Involve all programme stakeholders, particularly the general public (increase use of official statistics to not only report performance but to support decision making); and e. Be regularly reviewed as and when appropriate. Consideration will be given to monitoring and evaluation processes, such as consultations with the public and other national stakeholders and a Mid- Term Review. 4.3 MONITORING AND EVALUATION TEMPLATE A Monitoring and Evaluation template for monitoring of outputs by Ministries and Departments under the 5-year DP and the national budget is reflected in Table 3. The template is based on the logical framework and captures sector outputs and planned activities for periodic monitoring and evaluation. 5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan 136 Ta bl e 3: A nn ua l W or k Pr og ra m m e an d R ep or tin g Te m pl at e A N N U A L W O R K P R O G R A M M E A N D R EP O R TI N G T EM P LA TE Pr oj ec t T itl e: Im pl em en tin g A ge nc y: H ea d/ Pr og ra m m e/ A ct iv ity /S EG : Bu dg et : An nu al W or k Pr og ra m m e R ep or ti ng T em pl at e E xp ec te d O ut pu t Pl an ne d Ac ti vi ti es T im ef ra m e Po te nt ia l R is ks R es po ns ib le Pa rt y Pl an ne d E xp en di tu re Pr og re ss R ep or t b y Im pl em en tin g A ge nc y St ar t Fi ni sh Q 1 Q 2 Q 3 Q 4 E xp en di tu re Is th e ac ti vi ty on tr ac k?

Fiji has also emerged  as a respected advocate on some of  the great challenges  facing humanity, including climate change, sustainable  development and the preservation of  our oceans.  Fiji’s National Development Plan (NDP), with the vision  of  “Transforming Fiji”, maps out the way forward for Fiji  and all Fijians to realise our full potential as a nation. For  the first time, Fiji has both a 20-Year Development Plan  (2017-2036) and a comprehensive 5-Year Development  Plan (2017-2021). These plans work together, as the  5-Year Development Plan provides a detailed action  agenda with specific targets and policies that are aligned  to the long-term transformational 20-Year Development  Plan.   This forward-looking NDP is the outcome of  a  nationwide consultation process that involved the private  sector, civil society, community groups, government and  the general public. It reflects the aspirations of  the Fijian  people, and their Government’s commitment to deliver on  these goals.   Inclusive socio-economic development is at the heart  of  this NDP, and the strategies within are ultimately  designed to empower every Fijian and widen the reach of   programmes, services and networks of  infrastructure to  transform Fiji for every Fijian.    The NDP is aligned with global commitments including  the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the  Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Consistent with the  goal of  the Paris Agreement to achieve climate neutrality  and a low-emission world, we will develop a 2050 Pathway  to decarbonise the Fijian economy.   The integrated nature of  development and the need for  multi-sectoral solutions are recognised and addressed.  Critical cross-cutting issues such as climate change, green  growth, the environment, gender equality, disability and  governance are mainstreamed in the NDP.  Progress of  the NDP will be monitored to help keep  implementation on track and ensure our collective vision  is realised.    We thank all Fijians for their input and suggestions in  taking our country forward.    Honourable Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum Attorney-General and Minister for Economy  At no time in our history have Fijians held greater confidence in the direction of   our nation or in the future we are working together to build. Our income levels are  steadily increasing, we have moved up the ladder to become an upper middle-income  country, and our living standards are the highest they have ever been, as Fijians enjoy  the benefits of  eight consecutive years of  economic growth.

We are at a point of  strength with a rapidly expanding  economy, improving infrastructure and institutions, a large  number of  young people, growing digital connectivity,  a stronger standing in the international arena, and  continuing inherent geographical and environmental  advantages. These positive developments and advantages  provide a sound platform for future prosperity. The Plan  builds upon these strengths and enablers to expand the  development frontier to further transform Fiji.  The 20-Year Development Plan provides the forward- looking vision for “Transforming Fiji” towards an  even more progressive, vibrant and inclusive society. It  outlines a framework that encompasses strategic policy  manoeuvres, new approaches to development and the  aspirations of  all Fijians.  The Plan consists of  two prongs or approaches, which are  designated as: “Inclusive Socio-economic Development”  and “Transformational Strategic Thrusts”. These prongs  are mutually inclusive and reinforcing.   ° Inclusive Socio-economic Development-  will ensure that all socio economic rights in the  Constitution are realised. Inclusivity will be at the  centre of  growth and development, and the benefits  of  prosperity will be spread as widely as possible  to improve the social well-being of  all Fijians. No  one will be left behind regardless of  geographical  location, gender, ethnicity, physical and intellectual  capability and social and economic status.   ° Transformational Strategic Thrusts- are  game changing forward-looking policy shifts to  expand our development frontier and support the  vision of  transforming Fiji. New and emerging  growth sectors will be nurtured, connectivity within  and to the outside world will be improved, new  technologies will be embraced, productivity will  be maximised, human capital development will be  accelerated and green growth will be a key guiding  principle in the implementation of  this Plan.  1.1 Inclusive Socio-economic  Development  Inclusive socio-economic development is essential  to further improve the living standards of  Fijians.  Sustained economic expansion supported by private  sector investment and trade and the enhanced provision  of  social services and public goods will be paramount.  Macroeconomic and fiscal stability will be maintained.  A wide range of  sector policies and programmes have  been identified with detailed plans for implementation to  achieve these goals and targets. Successful implementation   of  the overall strategy will support the realisation of  the  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).   y Fourfold Increase in GDP per Person  Fiji has graduated to the group of  upper middle-income  countries. Our current per capita income stands at around  $10,000. Based on current economic performance,  economic outlook and projected population growth, Fiji is  likely to achieve a fourfold increase in per capita income  by 2036. This is consistent with a sustained annual real  GDP growth averaging 4 to 5 percent, investment levels  of  25 percent of  GDP and an inflation target of  2 to 3  percent.  A fourfold increase in per capita income over the next  20 years will raise Fiji up the international development  ladder and lead to tangible improvements in the lives of   all Fijians. Effectively implementing the transformational  strategic thrusts will be critical to realising these gains.  The Fijian Government is fully committed to delivering  this overall objective and to achieving inclusive growth  and development.   y Government Debt to be Reduced to 35 Percent  of  GDP  With more than fourfold growth in nominal GDP  expected, government debt will be reduced to 35 percent  of  GDP over the next 20 years. This commitment will  be achieved through an expansion in the overall size  of  the economy resulting from transformational shifts  rather than by constraining the development budgets of   government.  With the rapid expansion in the economy, rising  government revenues will create more fiscal space for  the required future public expenditure. Nominal GDP  is expected to grow twice as fast as the nominal debt.  This will support both overall development and financial  sustainability.   y Reducing Unemployment Rate to Below 4  Percent  With sustained economic expansion and the  implementation of  new job creation policies, the  unemployment rate will be reduced to below 4 percent.  All Fijians will be empowered with education and skill sets  so that they may be easily absorbed into the workforce.  A key focus will be on skills development and turning job  seekers into job creators. With the establishment of  the  Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) Council  and Central Coordinating Agency, greater support  and incentives will be provided to small and medium  enterprises. New growth sectors with high labour- absorption capacity will be nurtured and expanded.  Seasonal employment opportunities overseas will also be  effectively utilised.   y Eradicating Poverty  With the rapid economic and social development over     TWENTY YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2036  3  the last decade, poverty is now on a declining trend. A  new measure of  poverty that incorporates relevant and  measurable social determinants will be developed to help  guide improvements to service delivery. Extreme poverty  and hardship will be eradicated, and well-being improved  for all. This will be addressed through a multi-sectoral  approach, sustainable growth and better access to social  services. Targeted social protection will continue to be  provided for the vulnerable through new initiatives to  empower Fijians so that they may graduate out of  poverty.   y 100 Percent Access to Clean and Safe Water and  Proper Sanitation  Every Fijian has a right to clean and safe water in  adequate quantities. For the urban areas, 100 percent  access to clean and safe water will be realised by 2021 and  for the rural and maritime areas by 2030.  Resources will be allocated for sustained maintenance and  construction of  new water treatment plants, reservoirs and  reticulation systems, rural water schemes, development of   groundwater sources, setting up desalination plants in the  maritime region, and distribution of  water tanks in rural  areas. To support low-income households, the free water  programme will continue.  To meet the long-term demand, new dam sites including  Sovi river catchment, upper Waimanu River and Waibogi  in the upper reaches of  Navua River have been identified.  Other potential sites in the Western and Northern  divisions will be identified in the future, and feasibility  studies will be undertaken for new dam development.  Consideration will be given to joint development of  both  water supply and hydro-power.  Innovative technologies will be adopted for industrial  recycling, rainwater harvesting and storage, storm water  and aquifer management and use of  renewable energy  for desalination plants. Building climate resilient water  infrastructure will be a key aspect of  all new projects.  Leak reduction programmes will continue so that piped- water losses are significantly reduced, and other water  conservation initiatives will be pursued.  To build resilience to climate change, adaptation measures  will be implemented to protect freshwater aquifers from  saltwater intrusion. Public awareness and education on  water conservation and management will be increased to  support adaptation to changes in seasonal rainfall patterns  that may occur due to climate change.  To ensure improved sanitation, 70 percent of  the  population will have access to centralised sewerage  systems within the next 20 years. Public sewerage  treatment systems will be built and expanded in all urban  centres. Sustainable and viable sewerage and sanitation  options will also be explored for rural areas. Ensuring that  every Fijian household is connected to a proper sewerage  treatment system is a key priority.   y Electricity for All  Ninety percent of  the population currently has access  to electricity. Electrification projects in the rural and  maritime areas will be expedited to ensure that the entire  population has access to electricity by 2021.  Further grid extensions will be undertaken in Viti Levu,  Vanua Levu, Ovalau and Taveuni. Government will  continue to fully fund rural electrification projects,  including connections for households near the grid lines.  For the rural and outer islands, decentralised renewable  energy sources such as solar, mini hydro, hybrid biofuel/ diesel operated generators and wind systems will be  adopted where feasible.  Electricity generation from renewable energy sources  will be increased to 100 percent by 2036. Apart from  the ongoing hydro projects such as the Qaliwana/Upper  Wailoa Diversion Hydro Project and Lower Ba Hydro  Project, new areas will be identified for feasibility studies.  Other renewable energy sources such as wind, solar,  biomass, geothermal and wave and tidal energy will be  developed where they are viable and affordable.  Future electricity infrastructure projects will be climate- resilient, and opportunities for underground cables for  electricity distribution will be explored and adopted where  feasible. Carbon credits under the Clean Development  Mechanism (CDM) will be employed as part of  the  financing arrangements. Other sources of  climate finance  will also be accessed.    5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  4   Independent power producers of  both small- and large- scale electricity production will be supported with fair  pricing for sale of  electricity. The ongoing regulatory  reforms in the electricity sector with the partial divestment  of  FEA will promote private sector participation and raise  efficiency and service delivery.   y Provision of  Affordable Housing  All households will have access to affordable housing  through the construction of  new housing units. Ensuring  that more land is made available for home construction  will help increase the supply of  housing. Government  will encourage both public and private investments in the  provision of  housing units with strata titles.  Investment in the establishment of  “vertical villages”  will be supported to accommodate a more diverse group  of  Fijians, that is, with differing incomes, cultural and  occupational backgrounds and family sizes. This diversity  will help improve the marketability of  public housing units  with strata titles.  The Housing Authority and Public Rental Board will  ensure that more land is developed for residential lots  and more affordable and accessible housing is provided.  Private sector investments in residential lot developments  will be supported and incentivised.  Government will continue to support landowners to  develop residential lots on iTaukei land. This will increase  the availability of  housing lots and at the same time  ensure profit making opportunities for landowners.  Government financial support for new home construction  and purchase of  first homes will be maintained.  Informal settlements will continue to be upgraded and  leases granted to those on state land. Leases will also be  granted to informal settlements on iTaukei land with  the consent of  landowners. Income-generating projects  to support the creation of  sustainable livelihoods will  continue in economically depressed rural areas.  Future public housing will be designed to cater for people  with disabilities and special needs. Building standards will  also be uplifted to withstand natural disasters.  To assist those households whose homes are destroyed  in natural disasters and by fire, government will set up a  contingency fund and explore opportunities for disaster  insurance schemes with bilateral development partners  and multilateral financial institutions. This is critical given  Fiji’s vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters.   y Universal Access to Quality Education  Universal access to education at all levels will be  maintained with a focus on improving the quality of   education. This will increase the supply of  well-trained,  world-class professionals who are equipped for job  opportunities in the global market.  Investments will be undertaken to improve existing and  new education facilities, purchase new equipment and  materials, embrace digital learning and improve teacher  performance. Teacher-to-student ratios will be improved  and maintained, with more hiring and in-service teacher  training to improve teaching quality.  Government will continue with the free education  initiative through per capita grants to schools. Initiatives  such as the bus-fare and boat-fare subsidies, free textbooks  and other financial assistance will continue to ensure that  no one is deprived of  quality education.  Early childhood education (ECE) will be improved,  and ECE centres will be attached to all primary  schools around Fiji. The curriculum for primary and  secondary schools will be reviewed to support national  integration and prepare Fijians for a transformed Fiji, to  accommodate creative and active learning and to develop  entrepreneurial skills, learning by doing, and effective peer  learning. This holistic approach will incorporate enhanced  parental engagement to support learning.  Tertiary education will be further improved to focus on  current and future needs, including the future demands of   the labour market. Technical and vocational training for  lifelong learning will continue with the establishment of   more technical colleges. This will assist in the creation of   technical skills needed by all sectors of  the economy.  The education system will be made more inclusive by  establishing facilities to accommodate children with  disabilities and special needs.   y High Quality Healthcare System  In the next 20 years, medical services will be raised to  international standards with a major focus on tertiary  health care and overall medical service delivery.  Investments will be made to reduce patient waiting time,  improve hospital services, increase the number of  beds,  improve ambulance services and raise the doctor-to- patient ratio to 1 doctor per 1,000 people. Government  will continue with the free medicine scheme to assist low- income households.    TWENTY YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2036  5  Investments in the construction of  new hospitals, health  centres and nursing stations will continue. Inventory  management will be improved, and other opportunities  will be explored to ensure that drugs and consumables are  available at all times. New and modern equipment will be  made readily available.  The government is exploring options to engage strategic  partners in the management and operation of  certain  public hospitals to improve their service delivery.  Incentives are already in place to attract private sector  investment in tertiary health care. A major focus moving  forward will be to ensure that Fijians can take advantage  of  specialised tertiary care in Fiji rather than having  to pay high medical bills overseas. Tertiary health care  services have the potential to become an important  growth sector and revenue earner and assist Fiji to  become the health hub of  the South Pacific.  More emphasis will be placed on preventive health care  by promoting healthy eating habits, physical activity and  other lifestyle changes to reduce Non-Communicable  Diseases (NCDs).   y Food and Nutrition Security  Food and nutrition security will be improved by ensuring  increased local production, raising farm efficiency and  productivity, and developing more effective distribution  systems. Agriculture and fisheries programmes will be  enhanced, and local produce made available to all Fijians.  New technology, mechanisation and better production  practices will be adopted. Market linkages will be  improved. Large-scale production will be encouraged and  supported to achieve greater economies of  scale.  Organic farming will be promoted, and production of   traditional crops and niche agricultural and fisheries  products will be pursued. Production will be made  more climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable.  To adapt to climate change, increased funding will be  directed towards agriculture research into crop varieties  that can be more resilient to expected changes in weather  patterns. In addition, extension training will evolve to  ensure that farming practices adapt to changes due to  climate change.   y Women in Development  Women will be empowered, allowing them opportunities  for greater participation in leadership and decision- making across all sectors. Police and the courts will  appropriately attend to gender-based violence in all its  forms. Such is the confidence in these initiatives that 100  percent reporting of  these crimes is expected.  The law  and justice system that protects the public and deters  crime will be functional and responsive.  Gender inequality and discrimination will be eliminated,  providing women with greater choice and freedom for  their participation in the family and society. Women’s  access to education will be supported, as will their desires  for fulfilling employment and career advancement.  Women who choose to have children will be adequately  remunerated for paid work and will be able to continue  to advance their careers if  that is their wish. It is expected  that home duties in caring for children and household  work will be shared by the spouse or partner.  Support for women’s health and decisions regarding  family planning and sexual and reproductive health  will be shared and respected. Access to health and  other social services will be improved and available as  required. Women will be included and consulted in all  planning for future development projects, and their input  will be translated into tangible project outcomes. This  includes adaptation planning at the community level,  where women can be key agents to change unsustainable  production and consumption practices within the family  and community.  Response to Gender Based Violence (GBV) continues to  be a strong focus of  government policy and programmes.  GBV service delivery protocols will ensure that the health  sector provides strong support to victims.   y Protecting Culture, Heritage and Natural  Environment  Fiji has a rich cultural diversity and heritage that will be  protected and promoted. Our language, food, festivals,  rituals, arts and traditions, which hold essential intrinsic  value, will be preserved.  Local culture and heritage will be promoted as part of  our  vibrant tourism industry. Intellectual property rights for  protection of  traditional knowledge will be developed and  strengthened. There will be an increased focus on proper  management of  our forests, mangroves and coral reefs  because of  the complex natural biodiversity that these  systems support. These natural systems are critical for  food and nutrition security, sustaining endemic flora and  fauna, and maintaining the natural balance in nature.  Our pristine natural environment will be protected, and  the economy will be made more climate-resilient.    5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  6    y National Security  Government will ensure a safe, secure and stable Fiji  guided by the National Security Strategy. The rule of  law  will be upheld and the Constitution will be protected.  Adequate resources will be allocated to prevent and  appropriately respond to domestic and transnational  crimes, border security and access to justice. Responsive  security forces and police, together with an adapting  legislative and policy framework, will support a  strong approach to the administration of  justice and  maintenance of  the rule of  law.  Fiji will also continue its role in UN Peacekeeping  missions.  1.2 Transformational Strategic  Thrusts  Given our geographical location, economic prospects,  ongoing infrastructure development and strong  institutions, Fiji is well positioned to become the modern  regional hub of  the South Pacific.   y Nurturing New and Emerging Growth Sectors  The Fijian economy has evolved over time with a  more diversified and broad economic base. Moving  forward, new growth sectors will be nurtured to enable  the economy to thrive and create more jobs. Existing  sectors will be expanded and modernised. Large-scale  commercialisation will be pursued together with Small  and Medium Enterprise (SME) development.  Development of  niche products and services for export  will be pursued. This includes organic agricultural  produce, agro-processing, premium-quality garments,  increasing the range of  tourism products (sports tourism,  cruise tourism, wedding tourism, retirement villages,  medical tourism and conference tourism), filmmaking,  regional communications and transport services, and  many other new sector initiatives.  Value addition will be further developed in resource-based  sectors such as forestry, fisheries and agriculture to support  new manufacturing industries. Ecotourism to promote our  unique flora and fauna, cultural diversity and adventure  tourism such as whale and dolphin watching will be   developed.  Promotion of  traditional handicrafts, natural body  products, local ceramic ware, and exotic herbs and  spices will be nurtured and expanded, offering more  opportunities for women to use their traditional skills to  expand opportunities for economic empowerment.  To support development of  sports tourism, investments  in new sporting facilities built to international standards  will be prioritised together with increased accommodation  capacity. Fiji will continue to position itself  to host  international sporting events such as the Pacific Games,  Commonwealth Games, International Rugby Sevens,  Super 15 rugby matches, golf  tournaments and other  sports.  Developing ICT and improving prospects for the audio- visual industry and film-making will be achieved in  partnership with the private sector. This will include  the development of  large production studios, enhanced  availability of  specialised equipment and nurturing of   local talent. Service sectors such as financial services and  insurance will be expanded, and new manufacturing  sectors will be supported.  The business climate, including administrative and  regulatory processes, will be further improved to facilitate  private sector investment, including enticing more foreign  investment. Government will provide the necessary  infrastructure and enabling services. Marketing will play  a crucial part in developing these sectors. Options will be  explored for regional marketing in areas like tourism.  Government, together with the Micro, Small and Medium  Enterprise (MSME) Council, will continue to support  and incentivise MSMEs and thereby create more jobs  and encourage inclusive growth. Training, mentoring,  access to finance and advisory services will be enhanced  to harness the true potential of  the MSME sector. The  secured transactions framework to allow use of  movable  property as collateral, and government’s MSME financing  and credit guarantee scheme, will improve financing  and growth of  MSMEs. Access to markets through  improvements in infrastructure and marketing services will  be developed.  National branding campaigns such as the Fijian Made  and Buy Fijian initiatives will be further enhanced.   y Improving Transport and Digital Connectivity  Greater connectivity is central to transforming Fiji.  Transportation networks within the country and  connectivity to the outside world will be enhanced.  We will also continue to modernise Fiji’s air, maritime  and land transport networks and weather recording,  forecasting and reporting services to meet our long term  needs and aspirations. Apart from transport connectivity,  there will be a major focus on digital connectivity. All this  will support human capital development, commerce and  trade.    TWENTY YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2036  7  ROAD TRANSPORTATION  Investment in road infrastructure is essential for future  growth. Modernising our road infrastructure will continue  to support strong economic expansion, rising income  levels, the increase in urban population and the growth in  agriculture and industries.  New roads will be developed and existing ones improved.  More road expansions, including four-lane projects, will  be undertaken. Current four-lane projects such as Nausori  airport to Suva and Nadi airport to Denarau will be  completed by 2018. Government will embark on major  projects to seal a large portion of  the existing gravel roads  over the next 20 years.  Where practical, consideration will be given to diverting  roads inland to open up land for social and economic  development.  Installation of  streetlights in all major urban centres and  peri-urban areas and in front of  villages and settlements  along the Queens and Kings Roads will continue.  This will also be expanded to Vanua Levu. Apart from  improving aesthetics and road safety, this will encourage  development of  MSMEs such as roadside stalls and help  with employment and income generation.  New footpaths will be constructed across populated areas,  major cities and towns to make roads safer for pedestrians  and drivers.  Traffic lights will be installed at critical junctions where  there are high traffic flows. This will assist in managing  traffic congestion and improve safety. To accommodate  the rising number of  vehicles, investments in larger car  parks and the expansion of  bus bays on high-traffic roads  will be facilitated. Private sector partnerships will be  essential in pursuing some of  these initiatives.  Investment in upgrading our bridges and constructing  new ones will continue. This will include development of   access roads to connect farming areas to markets.  Road transportation will be made more energy-efficient  and environmentally friendly. Better emission and fuel  standards will be adopted. Government will support  importation and use of  fuel-efficient hybrid and electric  vehicles to reduce fuel importation and protect the   environment.  AIR CONNECTIVITY  International and domestic airports will be modernised  and upgraded to international standards. This has  already commenced with the modernisation of  the Nadi  International Airport, which involves the upgrading of  the  terminal, widening of  the runway, pavement rehabilitation  and construction of  new aprons and parking areas.  To meet the demand for increasing visitor arrivals,  a second terminal will be developed, and to improve  service for passengers flying to other destinations in Fiji,  the domestic terminal at the Nadi International Airport  will be upgraded. A new international airport will be  developed in Vanua Levu, and the Nausori International  Airport will be revamped and expanded.  Fiji Airways will continue to renew and expand its fleet  with leasing of  new aircrafts. New air connections will be  explored and new routes developed. This will be aligned  to our plans for the expansion of  new tourist source  markets, including attracting visitors from emerging  regions such as Southeast Asia and North and South  America.  Domestic air services will be enhanced to support the  growth in the tourism industry and more-efficient mobility  of  all passengers within the country. Major upgrading  works will be undertaken at domestic airports and airstrips  over the next 20 years.  PORT SERVICES AND INTER-ISLAND NETWORK  Government will work in partnership with strategic  partners to make our ports more efficient and modern.  Port infrastructure will continue to be modernised,  and services will be improved further to facilitate trade  and commerce. Modern technology, efficient cargo- handling machinery and international best practices will  be adopted to enhance Fiji’s position as the hub of  the  Pacific.  A Ports Master Plan is being prepared to guide the long- term development of  our ports.  Options are being explored for the establishment of  a  new port in Valaga Bay in Vanua Levu. Feasibility studies  will be undertaken to identify other new sites for future  port development including Natovi jetty. Investments  in modern slipways, the revival of  the shipbuilding and  maintenance industry will be pursued.  Government is exploring the possibility of  upgrading and  expanding the current Suva wharf  facility to cater for  future cargo and passenger demand. Upgrade works at a  number of  outer island ports will also be undertaken.  The inter-island sea-transport network is critical for  Fijians living in the maritime islands. Shipping services  will be improved to ensure reliability, safety, efficiency and  affordability of  ferry services. Government will continue     5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  8   to subsidise uneconomical sea routes to ensure that  shipping services are provided on a regular basis to these  regions. This will support transportation, commerce and  income-generating opportunities in the maritime region.  DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY  Digital connectivity through high-speed internet networks  and broadband access will be improved, and all areas of   Fiji will be digitally connected.  Competition will be enhanced in broadband internet  services by making communication infrastructure available  to multiple users under reasonable terms and conditions.  Fibre optic connectivity between Viti Levu and Vanua  Levu will be established, and the fibre optic ring around  Viti Levu will be completed.  All utility providers will cooperate in laying fibre optic  cable conduits and chambers when undertaking trenching  works during road construction or maintenance.  Government will expand existing telecentres and establish  new ones around the country. Digital literacy will be  improved. Such improved connectivity will provide  employment opportunities for all Fijians living in rural  and remote communities, and more employment in IT  support services will be realised.  These developments  will create a more conducive environment for commerce  and development, including attracting new sources of   investment and growth.   y Skill Development and Demographic Dividend  Fiji has a great opportunity to exploit its demographic  dividend. With 62 percent of  the population below the age  of  34, we are a young nation. The continued investment  in education and skill development with an increasing  working age population will not only provide a valuable  pool of  human resources for Fiji’s future development  needs but also help turn job seekers into job creators.  Government will work closely with industry, tertiary  education institutions and development partners to  prepare a workforce of  highly skilled Fijians in line with  future industry demand, in particular for the new growth  sectors. Skills development in areas such as trades and  craftsmanship, engineering and IT-related professions,  health care services, hospitality and aged care, foreign  languages, resource-based sector expertise, and education   and other services will be supported. The intelligence and  capability of  women will be further realised, and they will  be encouraged to choose from a variety of  occupations,  many of  which were previously the domain of  men.  Initiatives will be introduced to promote the employment  of  Fijians with these new skills by both small and large- scale businesses. Support will be provided for youth  entrepreneurship.  The development of  professionalism in sports provides  another opportunity for employment generation and  to position Fiji as a source of  world-class athletes.  Government will continue to invest in the potential of   our youth to develop into world-class athletes and sports  administrators. Sports complexes, rural sporting grounds  and school sporting facilities will be improved and new  ones constructed to international standards.  Talent will be identified and developed from an early  age with world-class training and coaching through the  National Academy of  Sports. Assistance will continue to  be provided to enable international coaches to be hired  and thereby improve our competitiveness. Corporate  sponsorship in sports will also be incentivised to encourage  better partnerships in sports development.   y Embracing Appropriate and New Technology  for Productivity Improvement  Appropriate new technology will be adopted to raise  overall efficiency and productivity and to improve service  delivery across all sectors. Adoption of  new technology  will be supported in areas like transportation, renewable  energy, manufacturing, agriculture, ICT, education and  other service-related sectors. Innovation, research and  implementation of  new ideas will also be incentivised.  A facilitative environment will be created to assist the  importation of  new and modern technology. Government  will explore options to provide the necessary infrastructure  to embrace new technology. This will include installing  chargers for electric vehicles across the country, supporting  vehicle upgrades to accommodate better fuel standards  and promoting technology transfer.  In the manufacturing sector, greater value-addition  and investment in energy-efficient machinery and  equipment will be incentivised. Government will support  the increased use of  cloud computing, 3D printing,  inter-networking of  smart devices and other emerging  technologies to improve efficiency and productivity.  For agriculture, government will further explore  mechanised land preparation and harvesting, modern  seed-breeding methods, and hydroponic and greenhouse  farming techniques to address the issues of  poor soil  fertility, declining farm productivity and intermittent local  supply.  Service industries involved in the transportation of  goods  and passengers could benefit from greater government     TWENTY YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2036  9  investment in modern traffic management software and  equipment, as well as dedicated bus and truck lanes.  For the tourism industry, increased use of  marketing  automation, a stronger social media presence, use of   smart-phone applications for customer bookings and  enquiries, and investment in smart appliances will be  promoted to improve service delivery.  All major government services will be placed online.  E-Government platforms to speed up approvals processes,  business registration, land use administration, taxation,  and other services will be further streamlined.  ICT-based planning, budgeting and monitoring will  be used in the public sector to improve work processes,  productivity and service delivery. IT related skills will  continue to be developed and retained.   y Building Vibrant Cities and Towns and a  Stronger Rural Economy  Development will be balanced to ensure the development  of  both a stronger rural economy and vibrant urban  centres.  To create vibrant urban centres, existing city and town  schemes will be reviewed, and new growth centres  will be identified and developed. Urban areas will be  further modernised with improved facilities and services.  Transport infrastructure, housing development, law-and- order facilities, bus stands and fresh-food markets will be  restructured and redeveloped where needed for improved  convenience and better urban management. Disaster  response within cities will be improved through better  early warning systems, inter-agency coordination and  enhanced disaster response capacities.  New towns and cities will be established, and town  boundaries will be extended where necessary. Spatial plans  and long-term miniature models will be developed to  guide the future development of  all urban centres.  Cities will be beautified with development of  recreation  facilities and parks, urban gardens and better zoning.  Traffic management plans will be enhanced to ease traffic  congestion.  Government is exploring options to decentralise some  of  its offices currently based in Suva to the Western  and Northern divisions. This would involve private  partnerships for investment in new buildings and facilities  and other support for the future growth of  these urban  centres. Such investment will create the platform for more  private-sector investment to follow and thereby ensure that  urbanisation is spread more across the country.  Rural development will be prioritised with improvements  in infrastructure and provision of  adequate public utilities.  Agriculture and other sectors will be supported to generate  income opportunities for people in rural and maritime  areas. The Ministry of  Agriculture will create better  linkages to enhance the marketing, promotion and value-  addition of  local agricultural produce.  Costing and Financing  The implementation of  the entire plan is expected to  inject over $50 billion of  government investment over  the next 20 years. This includes both funding for capital  expenditure and expenditure for provision of  social  services.  To finance this, government will mobilise its domestic  revenues, both tax and non-tax, and access international  financial resources, including funding from multilateral  development partners. Self-funding of  projects undertaken  by State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and municipal  councils will complement funding from the central  government.  Financing through private sector partnerships and climate  finance will increasingly be a core source of  financing.

STRENGTHS AND ENABLING ENVIRONMENT  11  Strengths & Enabling Environment    5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  12   2.0 STRENGTHS AND ENABLING             ENVIRONMENT  Fiji has evolved over the years in terms of  its demography,  economic and social development, institutions and  governance. The majority of  our population are young,  presenting a great opportunity for further development.  Our economy has almost doubled in the last 10 years,  with real per capita incomes rising every year. Trade flows  have increased, and investment levels are also growing.  Significant achievements have been made in social  development.  Fiji’s image has been transformed to that of  a country of   equal opportunities for all. Infrastructure is continually  improving through substantial public sector investment.  The business regulatory environment and the tax regime  have been reformed to support commerce. Technological  advancements have been made on many fronts, and the  country is digitally connected.  2.1 Demography  Fiji’s population was estimated at 865,611 in 2014 and is  projected to exceed 1.1million in the next 20 years. With  around 62 percent of  the population below the age of  34,  we are a young nation. The rate of  outward migration  has steadily declined and further declines are anticipated  based on current trends.  The population distribution is also changing. Urban  population is rising, and 61 percent of  the population is  expected to live in urban areas in the next 20 years. While  the majority of  the urban population is between the ages  of  15 and 44, rural population is dominated by the young  under the age of  14 and the elderly aged 60 years and  over. This offers both opportunities and challenges for the  future.  The national census that will be conducted this year  will provide more up-to-date population statistics and  demographic structure.  2.2 Economic Development  GLOBAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS  As a small, open economy, Fiji has both benefited and at  times has been negatively affected by global economic  developments. However, despite the uncertainties in  the global economy, Fiji can capitalise on a number  of  positive global developments. Oil prices have been  low, although rising slowly recently. Fiji’s major trading  partners are performing relatively well. The prospects  for Fiji’s exports and visitor arrivals are promising, and  there are new opportunities for offshore employment and  growth in remittances. Changing global economic power  and the rise of  emerging economies also provide new  opportunities that could be tapped.  DOMESTIC ECONOMY  Despite the frequent occurrence of  natural disasters  and external shocks, the Fijian economy has been quite  resilient. Economic growth has been positive since 2009.  This has been one of  the longest periods of  uninterrupted  economic growth since independence. The average  growth rate from 2011 to 2015 has been close to 4  percent.  Growth has been broad-based and spurred by record  tourist arrivals, a booming construction industry, strong  consumption, and rising manufacturing, finance and  transportation sectors. Growth in the medium-term is  also expected to be positive and strong. Total investment  increased to an estimated 26 percent of  GDP in 2015,  driven largely by private sector investment. This trend is  expected to continue and increase further.  Both exports and imports have increased over the years.  While current account deficits have posed challenges for  the balance of  payments, positive financial flows have  supported the strong increase in foreign reserves since  2009. Foreign reserves at the end of  2016 stood at $1.92  billion, sufficient to cover 5.1 months of  retained imports  of  goods and non-factor services. The healthy foreign  reserves levels will support our future foreign exchange  requirements, including requirements for the imports  needed to undertake development projects.  Inflation has been moderating over the recent years,  underpinned by lower prices of  food, clothing and  footwear, communication, and education. However,  temporary spikes have been prevalent due to the impacts  of  natural disasters. The prevailing low and stable global  food and fuel prices and reduction in the VAT rate have  maintained inflation at acceptable levels.  MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICY  The Reserve Bank of  Fiji (RBF) has kept monetary policy  accommodative, with its twin objectives of  adequate  foreign reserves and low inflation safeguarded. This has  augured well for maintaining sufficient liquidity in the  system and keeping interest rates low. The RBF will  continue to pursue monetary and exchange-rate policies  in support of  external balance, economic stability and  growth over the medium-term.  Fiscal policy over the years has supported public  investments, economic growth and social development.  Capital expenditure as a proportion of  total expenditure  has been increased to over 40 percent. More resources  have been channelled towards infrastructure, education,  healthcare and provision of  other social services to raise  the living standards of  all Fijians.  Government will continue to allocate adequate budgetary  resources to key priority sectors that have the capacity to  deliver better economic and social returns and support  higher, broad-based, inclusive and sustainable economic  growth.  Figure 1: Public Expenditure 2007-2016    STRENGTHS AND ENABLING ENVIRONMENT  13  The tax regime has been reformed to improve tax  administration, strengthen compliance and maintain  broad-based and low tax rates. Strengthening compliance,  simplifying tax administration, and ensuring certainty and  predictability are the key guiding principles of  revenue  policy.  Government debt as a percentage of  GDP was reduced  from 48.4 percent in 2014 to 47 percent in 2016. In  line with the national targets, debt will be reduced to 35  percent of  GDP in the next 20 years.  2.3 Social Development  Social development policies have focused on empowering  Fijians to attain sustainable livelihoods. Development has  been made more people-centred with provision of  better  healthcare, education, water and electricity and social  safety nets to ensure higher living standards.  EDUCATION  Fiji has a high literacy rate. This is supported by universal  access to primary, secondary and tertiary education.  Increased opportunities are being provided for technical  and vocational training. This focus on education is  supporting the development of  a knowledge-based society  that will result in positive ripples throughout the economy  through improvements in efficiency and productivity, the  rate of  diffusion and adoption of  technology, and research  and innovation.  Over the past five years, government has increased  investment in education at all levels through the free  education initiative, bus fare assistance, free textbooks for  primary and secondary education, and tertiary education  scholarship and loan schemes.  HEALTH  Significant progress has been made in increasing life  expectancy, improving health outcomes in mothers  and children, and reducing illness from communicable  diseases. Life expectancy at birth stands at 70 years, a  consistent improvement over the years. This increase can  be attributed to improvements in public health, nutrition  and medicine.  The maternal mortality rate (per 100,000 live births) has  declined. Almost all births are now attended by skilled  health professionals, indicative of  the strength and  efficiency of  maternal and child health programs. The  mortality rate for children under the age of  five years  has also significantly dropped, with marked reduction in  infant mortality rates.  Improving access and quality of  public health services  remains a major priority, particularly in addressing non- communicable diseases and dealing effectively with the  prevention and treatment of  HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.  SOCIAL PROTECTION  Fiji’s social welfare system continues to evolve to ensure  that it is well targeted and provides support to vulnerable  Fijians in need. Social protection programmes have been  expanded from welfare allowances to support the living  expenses of  needy families, the elderly and disabled  persons. In addition, targeted assistance is provided to  support education, the health of  pregnant women in  rural areas, subsidies to access basic utilities, and access to  essential medicine.  HOUSING  There has been significant public investment to improve  access to affordable housing. Government assistance  is provided for the purchase and construction of  new  homes for first-home owners. Major squatter resettlement  programmes and provision of  leases for those on state  land are continuing. Access to land and provision of  utility  services have been extended to informal settlements.  More land development projects and provision of  new  residential blocks have also been undertaken, including  funding support for iTaukei land development.  GENDER EQUALITY  There has been a noticeable improvement in the female  literacy rate over the last four decades. Indicators also  show improvements in the labour force participation rate  for females. Achieving gender equality in decision-making  and income levels and eliminating violence against women  in accordance with international conventions is crucial  for sustainable development. Sex disaggregated data on  the value of  development programmes allows agencies to  refine strategies for equitable distribution of  resources.    5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  14   Fiji has incorporated significant elements of  the  Convention on the Elimination of  All Forms of   Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) into its laws  and policies and is implementing the National Gender  Policy and the Women’s Plan of  Action. Domestic  violence legislation has been developed and utilised by  the Fiji Police Force and courts as part of  an overarching  approach to bring down the amount of  violence  experienced by women and children.  Complementary to this is the establishment of  a toll-free  24-hours’ hotline to provide counselling and appropriate  referral for survivors of  GBV as well as to avenues for  redress.  These measures, backed by our vibrant NGOs,  are leading the way in the region in best practice in service  delivery for GBV victims and survivors.  DISABILITY  People with special needs comprise an estimated 1.4  percent of  the total population. Fiji became a signatory  to the International Convention on the Rights of  Persons  with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2010, and the right to  basic services for persons with disabilities is enshrined  in the Constitution. With increased awareness of  the  needs of  people living with disabilities, the trend in new  commercial developments and public infrastructure is  towards being more inclusive in design and accessibility.  2.4 Structural Reforms  A number of  structural reforms have been undertaken to  reduce the cost of  doing business, promote more efficient  allocation of  resources, provide more room for private  sector development and provide policy space for the  government’s development agenda.  The broad structural reform areas include the regulatory  environment for private sector development, trade,  the financial sector, the labour market, land, public  enterprises, the sugar industry, and goods markets.  REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT FOR PRIVATE SECTOR  DEVELOPMENT  The regulatory environment for private-sector  development has been improved through more effective  administration of  regulatory frameworks for land use,  development control and building permissions. Tax  administration has been made more business friendly,   yet effective. Incentives, and where necessary subsidies,  have been provided to spur investment and meet basic  needs, particularly in areas like renewable energy and  infrastructure development, and to support growth in key  economic sectors such as ICT, tourism, manufacturing  and agriculture. These initiatives complement national  branding initiatives like ‘Fijian Made’.  Capacity to effectively resolve commercial disputes and  civil cases has improved with efforts to ensure effective  arbitration and mediation processes and improving  registration and enforcement of  copyright, trademarks  and patents.  TRADE POLICY  Boosting productive capacity for exports has been a high  priority for government. The National Trade Policy  Framework provides the policy settings and institutional  framework to address challenges such as market access,  trade facilitation and export growth. Government has  been undertaking tariff policy reviews consistent with its  economic development aspirations and priorities.  FINANCIAL SECTOR  Fiji has a sound and well-managed financial system. In  seeking to develop a robust and deep financial sector,  the Financial Sector Development Plan 2016-2025  provides the necessary overarching policy direction. In the  years ahead, reform initiatives will include: a diagnostic  review of  legislative and regulatory frameworks affecting  the financial system, establishment of  the National  Switch, developing capital markets, streamlining and  reducing the cost of  overseas remittances, enhancing  the competitiveness of  non-bank financial institutions  (NBFIs), implementing a Secured Transaction Framework  and strengthening the MSME sector.  LABOUR MARKET  Reforms have been implemented to put in place a  modern employment-relations regulatory framework  that can protect the fundamental rights of  all employees  and also support inclusive private sector-led growth.  Employment Relations (Amendment) Acts of  2015 and  2016 facilitate compliance with the Tripartite Agreement  among government, Fiji Trades Union Congress and  Fiji Commerce and Employers Federation. Under this  Plan, the strategic focus for human resource development  will be on building individual and institutional capacity  in all sectors of  the economy. Continuous efforts will be  focused on improving Fiji’s labour-market standards to  meet accredited international best practices, including the  fostering of  a modern workforce encouraging increased  participation from women and recognising the abilities  of  those from diverse groups. These reforms provide  a platform for equality where both men and women  can enjoy the benefits of  employment and conditions  conducive to productivity and prosperity for all.    STRENGTHS AND ENABLING ENVIRONMENT  15  LAND REFORM  Reforms to improve access to land through the land-bank  initiative have been implemented. The next area of  focus  is on the review of  administrative processes, digitisation  of  land records and capacity-building to improve the  efficiency and effectiveness of  land-use administration.  SUGARCANE INDUSTRY  Government will continue to support the sugar industry  to sustain the livelihoods of  the more-than 200,000  people who depend on it. Efforts will be geared towards  increasing productive capacity, improving transportation,  implementing a new cane-quality payment system  and generating additional revenue. To raise sugarcane  production, replanting on unused sugar cane leases,  securing more lease renewals and mechanisation will be  pursued.  GOODS MARKET REFORM  An effective and well-functioning competition framework  is an essential prerequisite for growth. Given the nature  of  business structures in Fiji, interventions to ensure  competitive market behaviour in certain sectors will  continue; however, progressive liberalisation (de-listing  from the basket) will also be considered.  CIVIL SERVICE  Government will continue with the reform of  the  civil service to ensure strong leadership and service  delivery. Recruitment will be based on merit and equal  opportunity, and high performers will be retained. Staff  performance will be improved through better training and  an improved work environment where effort and hard  work are recognised and rewarded. Institutional reviews  and job evaluation exercises are being undertaken and  implemented beginning with new salary bands for the civil  service. This will improve the work environment, improve  work processes and bring greater accountability and  transparency.  FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT  Reforms to improve management of  public finances  will continue. Assessments of  public expenditure and  financial accountability have been undertaken to identify  future areas of  improvement and reform. The Financial  Management Act is also being reviewed to align it with  the Constitution and international best practices. For   financial reporting, government has adopted cash-basis  International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS)  and will move towards accrual accounting in the future.  To facilitate this, the chart of  accounts is under review,  and the national asset register is being developed.  Government procurement systems and processes have  been enhanced, and we will continue to build capacity to  improve the efficiency, effectiveness and accountability of   the public financial management systems.  PUBLIC ENTERPRISES  Government had embarked on partial divestment of   shares in a number of  SOEs to encourage private sector  partnerships and improve efficiency and service delivery.  Moving forward, key sectors will be restructured to  establish a multi-sector regulator for water, electricity  and communications. Legislation governing public- private partnerships (PPPs) will be reviewed to support  development of  major national infrastructure, public  utilities and other development projects.  2.5 Good Governance  The fundamentals for democratic and accountable  governance set out under the Constitution are important  enablers involving a commitment to free and fair  elections, ensuring that the law applies equally to all,  limiting corruption, allowing active participation in  political, economic and social affairs, ensuring safe and  secure communities and protecting the basic freedoms  and human rights of  all Fijians.  Government will be fully accountable to the people  of  Fiji through Parliament, and resources will be  allocated to support a robust and effective parliamentary  and committee system, ensuring scrutiny of  public  programmes and policies through open and informed  debates on issues of  national interest.  Resources have been allocated to independent  commissions to enable the effective performance of  their  constitutional roles and responsibilities. This includes the  Fiji Elections Office, where capacity will be maintained to  support the effective conduct of  future general elections.  Reforms to the legislative framework for local government  will be implemented to facilitate the conduct of  municipal  elections.  A whole-of-government approach, in partnership with  civil society, is needed to support reforms to implement  the recommendations agreed to under Fiji’s 2nd Universal  Periodic Review (UPR) in 2014.7 This includes ratification  of  all human rights treaties and conventions by 2024.  The Human Rights and Anti-discrimination Commission  (HRADC) will be resourced to address all human rights  complaints efficiently and effectively.  Effective administration and enforcement of  standards  of  conduct for senior public officials and the Freedom  of  Information law are critical measures to ensure   7.  28th Session of  UNHRC - Fiji’s 2nd Universal Periodic Review (UPR). Other major commitments are the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and                         SIDS Accelerated Modalities of  Action (SAMOA) Pathway 2014    5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  16   transparent and accountable governance.8 Effective  enforcement of  the anti-corruption legal framework  will be complemented by Corruption Prevention Risk  Reduction (CPRR) Assessments for government ministries  and departments and other stakeholders. It will also  be supported by annual audits by the Office of  the  Auditor-General under the accountability framework to  maintain the integrity of, and public confidence in, the  government’s systems.  The management of  public records will be enhanced  to ensure open and transparent government. This  will include support for informed decision-making  by improving statistical data-collection and analysis,  including the national census, and the preservation of   national archives.  2.6 Climate Change  Climate change has emerged as a major global challenge  threatening biodiversity, livelihoods and human life.  Small island developing states are already being adversely  affected by the increased intensity and frequency of   natural disasters, loss of  productive farmland from salt- water intrusion, relocation of  communities near coastal  regions and substantial financial drain for mitigation and  rehabilitation efforts.  The whole world faces catastrophic consequences if   decisive and collective global action is not taken to reduce  carbon emissions, build resilience and adapt to climate  change. In this regard, Fiji has been given the opportunity  to lead the negotiations on climate change at the COP 23  meeting in Bonn, Germany. The rulebook for practical  implementation of  the Paris Agreement will be a key  agenda for this meeting.  Fiji was the first country to ratify the Paris Climate  Change Agreement on 22 April, 2016, an Agreement  dubbed as the world’s greatest diplomatic success. The  Agreement, hailed as “historic, durable and ambitious”,  generally aims to hold increase in the global average  temperature to well below 2oC above pre-industrial levels  and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to  1.5oC above pre-industrial levels. Consistent with this  objective, Fiji’s goal is to achieve net-zero global GHG  emissions by 2050, which reflects the long-term goal of   the Paris Agreement to achieve climate neutrality and  a low-emission world in the second half  of  the century.  Fiji has submitted near-term targets to address GHG  emissions, called “nationally determined contributions”  or NDCs, and will review and extend these targets every  five years. Furthermore, Fiji will strive to formulate  and communicate long-term greenhouse gas emission  development strategies, in accordance with Article 4,  paragraph 19, of  the Paris Agreement, mindful of  Article  2 of  the Agreement taking into account its common but  differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.  As such, Fiji will develop by 2020, mid-century long- term low greenhouse gas emission development  strategies, laying out a plan to deeply decarbonize the  Fijian economy by 2050. A decarbonized Fiji will be a  more attractive Fiji. Such an effort will be key towards  eliminating poverty and supporting the achievement of   the SDGs.  Fiji will continue its stewardship of  climate change  issues at the local, regional and global level with the  plight of  small island developing states at the centre of   this concern. We will work together with other nations  to access climate finance and explore innovative ways  of  mobilising public and private sector resources for  adaptation and mitigation. This includes support for  community-based adaptation planning.  8.  Information Bill 2016 and Code of  Conduct Bill 2016 – currently before Parliament.    FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2021  17  5-Year Development Plan 2017-2021    5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  18   3.0 FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT     PLAN 2017-2021  The long-term national development plan, supported by  Fiji’s strengths and an enabling national environment, is  translated into individual sector development plans to be  implemented over the next 5 years.  The sector goals are set against an analysis of  sector  context, including challenges and opportunities to justify  priority policies and strategies. The selected sector  policies and strategies in turn help validate the priority  development programmes to be implemented over the  next 5 years. Policies and strategies and the corresponding  programmes and targets are tabulated under each chapter.  The major programmes and projects are based on  the development needs gathered from the nationwide  consultations. Emphasis is placed on access to basic  services for all Fijians such as water, electricity, housing,  medical services and education. Government will  concurrently undertake substantial investments to  implement the transformational strategic thrusts identified  under the long-term development plan.   3.1 INCLUSIVE SOCIO-ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT  The Constitution provides every Fijian with socio- economic and environmental rights. The realisation  of  these rights is critical for inclusive and sustainable  development. This will empower every Fijian through  provision of  essential social services and other public  goods.  3.1.1 WATER AND SANITATION  “Clean and safe water in adequate  quantities and proper and adequate  sanitation for every Fijian household”  The Constitution guarantees the right of  every Fijian  to clean and safe water in adequate quantities, and  accessible and adequate sanitation facilities. Realising this  entitlement will ensure improved living standards with   positive spill over benefits to the entire economy.  WATER  Currently, approximately 78 percent of  Fiji’s population  has access to a treated and reticulated water supply. While  in the urban centres 98 percent of  the population has  access, coverage in the rural areas needs to be expanded.  In the next 5 years, government will undertake major  investments to cater for long-term water supply needs.  Resources will be allocated for construction of  new water  treatment plants, reticulation systems and reservoirs to  increase supply capacity. An aggressive leakage reduction  programme to eliminate water loss will be pursued.  Regarding the development of  potential new water  sources, government—with assistance from the Asian  Development Bank (ADB), Green Climate Fund (GCF)  and European Investment Bank (EIB)—is embarking on  the construction of  a new, 40-megalitre treatment plant  on the Rewa River to meet the increasing demand for  water in the greater Suva and Nausori areas. The Water  Authority of  Fiji (WAF) is exploring options for other  new dam sites such as at Waibogi in the upper reaches of   Navua River and the upper Waimanu River as well as in  the Western Division to meet the increasing demand in  the Nadi-to-Lautoka corridor.  Investments will be made to renew existing water  infrastructure, including pipeline replacement,  construction and upgrade of  water reticulation systems,  electrical upgrades, valve replacements, reservoir upgrades  and reducing non-revenue water.  Options for enhanced rainwater harvesting and  storage, industrial recycling, storm water management,  aquifer management and the use of  renewable energy  technologies for desalination plants in remote locations  will be explored on a continuing basis and implemented  where feasible. Government will provide rebates for  rainwater harvesting systems.  The rural water supply programme will be augmented to  provide access to clean water in rural areas and to meet  the target of  85 percent of  rural communities having  access by 2021. Free water tanks will be distributed in the  rural and maritime communities. For the remote island  communities, groundwater sources will be developed and  diesel-powered water-desalination plants will be provided.  Awareness and strategies for water conservation policies  will be pursued to raise civic responsibility on the use of   water and protection of  water sources.  The free water initiative for households with combined  household income of  $30,000 that are consuming less  than 91,250 litres per year will also continue.  SANITATION  Around 71 percent of  the population have access to  improved sanitation, including 25 percent that have access  to sewerage facilities. Sanitation services will be improved     FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2021  19  Goal, Policies and Strategies  Goal: Clean and safe water in adequate quantities and proper and adequate sanitation for every Fijian house- hold  POLICIES STRATEGIES  Strengthen water  policy planning and  sustainable resource  management.   y Formulate and implement a National Water Resource Management and Sanitation Policy to govern the  planning and development of  water resources.  yAn integrated approach by the Water Authority of  Fiji and Department of  Water and Sewerage to  develop a mechanism for detailed water resource monitoring and management in collaboration with Fiji  Meteorological Services, Ministry of  Waterways, FEA and other relevant agencies.  yBetter coordinate roles and responsibilities and improve management and sharing of  data among  various stakeholders, including Water Authority of  Fiji, Department of  Water and Sewerage and  Ministry of  Waterways.  yDevelop and adopt a policy framework for environmentally appropriate and sustainable commercial  extraction of  groundwater.

substantial investments in electrification initiatives  over the years, almost 90 percent of  the population now  has proper access to electricity. Lack of  access in the  unserviced rural and maritime areas will be addressed  over the next 5 years.   To achieve 10 percent electrification by 2021, grid  extension programmes will be accelerated in Viti Levu,  Vanua Levu, Ovalau and Taveuni. Government will  continue with the policy to fully fund rural electrification  projects.  Electricity from renewable sources will be increased  further. Currently, over 60 percent of  electricity generated  is from renewable sources such as hydro, biomass,  wind and solar energy. Over 50 MW of  renewable  energy generation capacity has been added in the last  10 years. Further investments in renewable energy will  be undertaken to ensure that over 80 percent of  all  electricity is generated from renewable sources by 2021.  Concessional financing and grants for these projects  will continue to be accessed under climate finance  funds together with carbon credits under the Clean  Development Mechanism (CDM).   Three major hydro projects are currently being developed  by the Fiji Electricity Authority (FEA). These are the  Qaliwana Hydro Project, Upper Wailoa Diversion Hydro  Project and Lower Ba Hydro Project. Future sites are  being investigated, including the Upper Ba River, the  Waivaka Hydropower Scheme in Namosi, and Wailevu  River in Cakaudrove. Further detailed studies are required  to confirm the viability of  these sites for hydro projects.   The research and development of  new and renewable  energy technologies will continue. This includes further  exploration of  ocean energy, geothermal energy, wave  energy and the generation of  energy from waste.  Decentralised renewable energy sources such as solar,  mini-hydro, and wind systems will be used to electrify  rural areas and maritime zones where feasible.  Contingency plans to address prolonged periods of  dry  weather have been put in place with installation of  an  additional 40 MW of  diesel generators.   Independent Power Producers (IPP) are supplementing  electricity production. To encourage further private sector  participation in the electricity sector, partial divestment  of  FEA is underway. In developing an IPP framework  to increase private sector generation of  electricity from  both renewable and non-renewable sources, government  will ensure that a system of  fair pricing and a transparent  process are maintained.  Tax incentives aimed at investments in renewable energy  technologies will continue. There are also opportunities  for the private sector and households to invest in small- scale renewable systems that will be supported by  government.  FEA will also explore the possibility of  adopting  smart grid technologies, allowing for greater customer  participation in managing demand. Electricity  conservation and efficient technology to support energy  saving will be promoted.   The codes and standards for buildings and industry will  be updated to require mandatory minimum standards for  energy use for ventilation, cooling and lighting, among  other improvements. These can typically reduce electricity  consumption by around 25 percent.   Because Fiji is vulnerable to adverse climate change- related events, it will ensure that electricity infrastructure  is made disaster-resilient. Options for further underground  cabling for grid distribution are being explored.  Government will also work closely with the private sector  to improve designs, offer practical training and possibly  support mandatory certification of  designers/installers  in order to improve resilience to cyclone conditions for  renewable energy systems.   Environmental considerations will be factored into the  appraisal of  future hydro power, geothermal and other  energy resources.  To meet the human-resource needs of  the future  electricity sector, government will support education for  civil, electrical and hydrological engineers and other  required skill needs of  the sector. In-service training for  the existing technical staff will continue.  PETROLEUM AND BIOMASS  The high reliance on imported petroleum remains  a challenge and is being continually addressed. The  transport sector (land, sea and air) is the principal  consumer of  imported fossil fuel.  To ensure energy efficiency improvements in the  transportation industry, government has incentivised the  importation of  hybrid and electric cars over the last few  years. Fiji is complying with the Euro 2 emissions standard  of  500 parts per million (PPM) of  sulphur content and  is moving towards the Euro 5 emission standard of  50  PPM. This initiative intends to reduce carbon emissions  and concurrently attract new vehicle technologies with  high fuel efficiency. Government will continue to promote  and encourage the use of  environmentally friendly fuel  standards.  Significant efficiency gains have also been made in the  aviation sector as Fiji Airways has upgraded its fleet with  more fuel-efficient aircrafts.  Government will continue research and development on  biofuel and its use in the transport sector. Incentives to     5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  26   promote investments in biofuel will continue.   Energy generation from biomass will be expanded over  the next 5 years. Apart from the biomass waste co- generation at Tropik Woods and Fiji Sugar Corporation  (FSC), a10MW biomass power plant at Navutu, Sigatoka  is currently being constructed by Nabou Green Energy  Limited.   Traditional, renewable biomass fuels still play a major  role in rural areas. Wood is the main cooking fuel and is  also used for drying copra in many areas. While most of    Goal, Policies and Strategies  Goal: A resource-efficient, cost-effective and environmentally sustainable energy sector. POLICIES STRATEGIES  Access to affordable,  reliable, modern and  sustainable energy services  for all Fijians.   yContinue to develop the existing grid electricity supply in Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Ovalau and  Taveuni.  yDevelop small grid systems in other islands where practical.  yReview operation of  hydropower and other renewable energy facilities to maximize output under  new climate conditions.   yContinue to develop and improve the human resource capacity in the energy sector.  yReview design and construction standards for energy facilities that are climate change resilient.   Increase share of   electricity generation  from renewable energy  resources.   y Implement a research, data collection and investment identification programme to accelerate the  renewable energy share in electricity generation.  yEstablish a net-metering (or similar) mechanism to set out clear rules for small companies or  households to feed excess electricity from renewables to the grid at a price fair to them and to FEA.  y Set economically justified feed-in tariffs or pricing framework (price differential system) including  studies to provide incentives for production of  electricity from various renewable energy sources.  yUndertake a study and develop an Independent Power Producer (IPP) framework that addresses the  issue of  intermittent supply of  power from IPPs.   yEstablish a transparent process for procurement of  new large-scale capacity from IPPs, pricing and  other principles to be applied in all new power purchase agreements and grid connection standards.  Increase private sector  participation in electricity  supply through reform of   regulatory aspects of  the  electricity sector.   yReform the regulation of  the electricity sector to establish a more enabling environment for private  sector participation in the electricity sector, including both large-scale and small-scale supply.  the biomass use can be considered renewable, there are  considerable negative health impacts, such as emphysema  and eye irritations. To address this, government has  introduced the energy-efficient Rocket Wood Stove in  rural areas. Government will monitor energy sources that  may have a detrimental health effects and will provide an  enabling environment for affordable and safe alternative  energy sources.  Piggery and dairy-farming biogas projects that address  waste management, health and energy needs are ongoing.

Key initiatives  undertaken over the years include financial assistance to  first-home owners for construction or purchase of  a new  home, the development of  residential lots by the Housing  Authority (HA) and Public Rental Board (PRB), informal  housing upgrades and resettlement, development of   iTaukei land, and rural housing schemes.   In the next five years, new strategies will be implemented  to increase the supply of  affordable housing, in particular  housing units with strata titles, by both the public and  private sector. The existing housing programmes will  continue.  To promote more integration and marketability of  public  housing and housing units with strata titles, “vertical  villages” will be established. This will include a range of   unit sizes and will accommodate a more diverse group  of  households with different income levels, cultural  backgrounds, family sizes and other characteristics. This  will create a renewed image of  integrated housing and  encourage Fijians to buy units with strata titles.   Leases will continue to be issued to settlements on state  land, and those on iTaukei land will be provided leases  only after approval from landowners. Providing leases   to Fijians in these settlements will raise confidence  and provide some security for further investments.  Government will continue to work with NGO partners in  these projects.   Government will also continue to support landowners  to develop their land for subdivisions and residential  purposes. Funding assistance will be provided for  development costs and provision of  public utilities. This  scheme will allow landowners to profit from developing  their land.   To assist homeowners who do not have access to  insurance to re-build their houses after natural disasters  and fire, government will put in place a contingency fund  and explore options for disaster insurance in the coming  years.

Therefore, the development of  domestic  agriculture and fisheries to support access to an adequate  supply of  healthy and nutritious food is critical as a legal  and political matter as well as for food and nutrition  security.  To better understand food and nutrition security, an  overarching framework will be developed to objectively  assess the status, including the current capacity of  the  domestic agriculture and fisheries sector to meet the  national food demand. The development of  such a  framework will require collaboration among stakeholders  to help build a credible food and nutrition security  database, assess the national food and nutrition security  status and support the formulation of  strategies to  improve the situation.  Over the next 5 years, government will ensure increased  domestic food production and supply of  fisheries products.  Challenges such as the destruction of  food production due  to natural disasters and other issues facing the agriculture  and fisheries sector will be addressed. Specific policies  to promote agriculture and fisheries production are  described under the resource-based sector chapters.   Large commercial agriculture and aquaculture projects  will be supported to achieve economies of  scale and  competitive pricing. Cluster farming will be encouraged   and incentivised together with the promotion of  small- holder farms and back yard farming for subsistence level.   Production efficiencies will be improved through  mechanisation and the adoption of  new technologies and  better product varieties. More research and extension  services will be provided by government to improve farm  productivity and awareness of  best farming practices.  Organic farming practices will be employed.  Government will encourage the consumption of  locally  produced fresh foods and ensure that it is conveniently  accessible at fresh food markets, supermarkets and road- side stalls. Assistance will be provided to expand the  supply of  traditional foods such as Uvi, Tivoli, Via, Dalo,  Cassava and Kumala given their suitability to the local  climate.  The consumption of  fresh, home-grown food will be  promoted through awareness programmes. Strategies to  mitigate climate change related effects on food supply will  also be promoted.  While production and consumption of  locally produced  food will be encouraged, import of  certain products will  continue to help meet our food requirements.    5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  32   Goal, Policies and Strategies  Goal: Every Fijian has access to adequate food of acceptable quality and nutritional value.

FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2021  35  3.1.5 EDUCATION  “Quality education for all”  Quality education for all is essential to create a more  skilled and adaptable workforce and create a knowledge- based society. The Constitution guarantees the right of   every child to early-childhood, primary, secondary and  further education. A number of  bold initiatives have been  introduced to improve the provision of  quality education.   Universal access to primary education has been achieved,  and net secondary school enrolment is over 80 percent.  With the free-education initiative, free bus fares and free  textbooks, enrolment numbers have increased significantly.  More teachers have been recruited, and continuous hiring  of  quality teachers will continue to improve the teacher- to-student ratio for rural and urban areas.   The free-education policy will continue together with  other financial assistance. Further budgetary support will  be provided for construction and upgrading of  new and  existing school facilities and equipment, including the  rehabilitation of  schools damaged by Cyclone Winston.   Early childhood education (ECE) is continually being  improved as these formative years play a vital role in  shaping social, emotional and learning outcomes for the  future. To achieve universal access to early childhood  education, an ECE centre will be attached to each  primary school. Grants will continue to be provided  for facility upgrades, development of  new centres and  improving the quality of  ECE teachers.  The provision of  grant funding to three major universities  has improved tertiary education infrastructure and  facilities as well as the quality of  teaching and learning.  Tertiary education scholarships and the loan scheme  have also increased access and affordability for all tertiary  students. The Toppers scholarship initiative will continue  to be aligned to medium-term priority areas for socio- economic development.   Government has increased investment in trade and  vocational skills with establishment of  technical colleges  around the country. The focus on skills development and  meeting future industry needs will continue to be a key  priority.  The curriculum will continually be reviewed and  strengthened to achieve national objectives. There are  unacceptable rates of  obesity-related illnesses and NCDs  in adults, youth suicide, drug and alcohol misuse, teenage  pregnancy, and gender-based violence and sexual violence  against women and girls. Incorporating contemporary  thematic areas in educational curriculum such as cultural  diversity, gender, nutrition, respectful relationships, drugs  and alcohol, climate change and the environment will  enrich students’ understanding of  wider social issues.   A digital literacy programme has been introduced  to encourage teachers and students to benefit from   e-learning. This initiative will be expanded and rolled out  to the entire education system in a phased approach.  A safe and inclusive learning environment will be  promoted. Education for persons with special needs  will continue to be promoted through grants to specials  schools. Health and wellness programmes will continue.    5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  36   Goal, Policies and Strategies  Goal: Quality education for all.

Maternal- and infant-mortality rates have  declined. Primary health care is well established,  with major improvements in secondary health care.  Substantial investments have been made in construction  and upgrading of  hospitals, health centres and nursing  stations. Medical services have been decentralised to  ensure convenience and easy access. More doctors and  nurses have been recruited and are well remunerated.  The doctor-to-patient ratio is improving, and funding  for supply for essential drugs and consumables has been  increased.   In the next 5 years, more investments will be made to  upgrade and expand existing divisional hospitals to  provide more beds and better facilities. New sub-divisional  hospitals will be constructed and existing ones upgraded.  New health centres will be constructed with proper  services and equipment. Government will ensure that  every health centre is provided with a full-time doctor. In  addition a new National Kidney Research and Treatment  Centre will be constructed that will act as a national hub  for treatment and prevention of  kidney disease, and to  provide patients the most economical access to treatment  of  kidney disease.  Funding will be channelled towards purchase of  more  equipment, drugs and consumables. The procurement  process and supply-chain management will be streamlined   to ensure that adequate supplies of  medicines and  consumables are available at all times. Education  and information will be provided to men and women  regarding family planning, and equal-parenting initiatives  will be promoted.  Hiring of  skilled healthcare workers will continue to  ensure that the ratio of  doctors, nurses and midwives  per 1,000 people is increased to internationally accepted  levels.   To assist those low and middle-income Fijians, the free  medicine scheme will continue.    Strategies will be pursued to tackle NCDs in the country.  Changes in lifestyle, healthy diets and physical activity  are crucial for preventive health care and prevention of   NCDs. A multi-sectoral approach through better health  education, production and adequate supply of  fresh  fruits and vegetables, and promotional and awareness  campaigns will be further enhanced to address this issue.  Collaboration and partnership with the private sector,  NGOs and development partners will be pursued.    Early detection and preventive measures will be  strengthened to address communicable diseases like HIV/ AIDS and tuberculosis. Physical and sexual violence  against women and children will be addressed as Fiji  practitioners will adhere to processes of  referral and  evidence preservation to support women and increase the  rate of  perpetrator accountability.  Adherence to international standards of  tertiary health  care will be pursued as a major initiative to ensure that  Fijians are provided with advanced tertiary care. Tax  incentives to entice private sector investment in this area  were introduced in the 2016-2017 National Budget.  Government will explore further opportunities for public  investment in this area.    5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  40   Goal, Policies and Strategies   Goal: Access to quality health facilities necessary to good health, and to health care services, including repro- ductive health care.

Extreme poverty and hunger do not exist in Fiji due to  the availability of  agricultural and fisheries products and  the existence of  a sharing culture. Income poverty is also  on a declining trend. Spending power and basic living  standards have been secured for all Fijians through the  provision of  free water, electricity, education, medicine  and health services; the bus-fare subsidy; housing  assistance; and social protection initiatives such as food  vouchers and the social pension scheme. Opportunities  for income generation and better employment also have   raised income levels and standards of  living in the country.   Over the next 5 years, the government will ensure that  every Fijian is provided with the basic amenities of  life.  Social inclusion programmes such as the poverty benefit  scheme, welfare graduation programme and social  pension scheme will be maintained. Targeted assistance  will be provided to the vulnerable, including children  living in poverty, children in orphanages and foster care,  people with disabilities and special needs, and the elderly.   A major focus in the years ahead will be to support  MSMEs and other self-employment initiatives to  ensure all Fijians have a stable source of  income. Major  government initiatives will ensure that the guarantee of   socio-economic rights in the Constitution is realised. This  will empower Fijians to become self-reliant. Government  will ensure that prosperity is shared and all development is  inclusive.    5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  50   Goal, Policies and Strategies  Goal: A socially inclusive Fiji and empowered Fijians.  POLICIES STRATEGIES  Promote a caring  environment where  everyone is safe and  protected.   y Strengthen data gathering for baseline studies and analyses of  the needs of  children, elderly, people with  disabilities and assessments of  poverty.  yReview state social protection systems for the protection and care of  vulnerable groups.  yReview and, if  needed, enhance education, employment, trade, fiscal and other government policies as  they impact vulnerable groups and social empowerment programmes.  y Implement, monitor and review legislation relating to the principles and provisions of  the Convention  on the Rights of  the Child, Convention on the Rights of  Older Persons, Convention on the Rights of   Persons with Disability and other relevant international instruments.  yEncourage in-family support for the elderly.  Improve the lives of   vulnerable people  (elderly, children and  those with special  needs).   y Strengthen empowerment programmes to build capacity among vulnerable groups and create access to  productive resources to facilitate migration from welfare to workfare.  yContinue to engage with faith based organisations and NGOs in promoting family values and social  cohesion.  y Promote greater integration and participation of  vulnerable people in decision-making and community  affairs.  y Increase labour force participation and self-employment of  older persons and those with special needs.  y Provision of  post-traumatic counselling services for the vulnerable groups after natural disasters including  the identification and mapping of  communities that are most vulnerable to disasters.

The poverty gap is the mean shortfall from the poverty lines (counting the non-poor as having zero shortfalls) as a percentage of  the poverty lines. This measure  reflects the depth of  poverty as well as its incidence.  15. According to the 2008-2009 HIES, the Poverty Gap is 3.1% of  GDP.    5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  52   3.1.8 YOUTH AND SPORTS  DEVELOPMENT  “Empowering youth to be agents  of  change and promoting sports for  development”  YOUTH DEVELOPMENT  Fiji is a young country with around 62 percent of  the  population below the age of  35. Effective engagement  of  youth in the economy, society and the political sphere  will stimulate growth and development. Government  will ensure that educational, employment and leadership  opportunities are provided to young Fijians. This  is a cross-cutting issue that has been also addressed  throughout other thematic areas.   In the next 5 years, initiatives will be strengthened for  training, empowerment and awareness programmes  for youth in areas such as entrepreneurship, leadership,  climate change and sexual health awareness. Financial  support will continue to be made available for voluntary  organisations in these areas.   Support will be provided for the establishment of   MSMEs for rural and urban youth. This will create self- employment opportunities and develop entrepreneurial  skills. The National Employment Centre will continue to  provide the “one-stop shop” service to assist employment  seekers to find jobs.  Initiatives that empower youth and encourage their  participation in national policy development will continue,  such as the International Youth Exchange Programme,  National Youth Conference and Youth Parliament  initiative.    SPORTS DEVELOPMENT  Sports has played a key role in building social cohesion  and has improved Fiji’s image globally. It has also  supported improvements in health and well-being and  generated employment opportunities for many Fijians.  Remittance inflows from Fijian sports people overseas  have been a good source of  foreign exchange earnings  and income support for many families.     There is a huge potential to harness our sporting prowess  and transform sports into a major income-generating  sector. Over the next 5 years, emphasis will be placed  on developing elite sportspersons and modernising and  building new state-of-the-art facilities. Support services  associated with the professional development of  sports  will be strengthened. This includes sports education and  the development of  qualified sports trainers and coaches.  Sports psychology, sports science and sports medicine  will also be part of  the tertiary curriculum. An increased  participation in sports by all Fijians will contribute to  reducing our increasing levels of  NCDs and obesity.    Fiji will bid to host major regional and international  sporting events, including the 2023 Pacific Games and  2026 Commonwealth Games. Government will continue  to invest in the upgrading and maintenance of  sporting  infrastructure and facilities to raise them to international  standards. Such investments will strengthen Fiji’s  attractiveness as a host for future international events and  encourage sports tourism.   A National Sports Academy will be established to  support the development of  future sportspersons. Sports  development will include talent identification, specialised  training, exposure to specialised coaching and training  methods, and management of  sports injuries and dietary  programmes.

Their potential needs to be fully harnessed for the  benefit of  the entire nation. Government will provide  equal opportunities for all, including the participation of   women in education, leadership, and overall economic  development, and will continue its strong efforts to  eliminate violence against women. Past programmes have  managed to attain gender parity for students. Female  representation in Parliament increased at the last election  and is now one of  the highest in the Pacific region.  Around 58 percent of  SOEs have women representation  at board level.  In the labour market, women account for over 40 percent  of  salary earners and 30 percent of  wage earners. Equal  opportunities in education, health and other social  services will raise women’s participation in the workforce.  With legislative changes such as the introduction of  the  Domestic Violence Act, provisions in the Constitution  and the reestablishment of  the Elimination of  Violence  Against Women (EVAW) Task Force, government is  working towards providing positive and innovative  approaches to achieving gender equality and to  eliminating discrimination and violence against women.    This Plan will provide women experiencing gender-based  violence with access to greater help.  Effective access to  health services, specialist advocacy and counselling, police  protection and the justice system will be strengthened.   Prevention of  gender-based violence will be a priority for  government, and police, the NGO partners and donor  agencies will continue to work in close partnership.  As  a signatory to the Convention on the Elimination of  All  Forms of  Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and  the Beijing Declaration and Platform of  Action in 1995,  Fiji is dedicated to continue its commitment to ensure  that women are included prominently in the development  process.   In line with SDG 5, (Gender equality and empowerment  of  women), women’s participation in leadership and  decision-making at all levels will be increased through  strategies that generate greater economic participation,  recognition of  domestic workers, and elimination of   discrimination due the importance of  the biological  reproductive role of  women. Government will support the  freedom of  all women to participate in any profession they  choose. Accordingly, policies will focus on encouraging  shared decision-making in relationships, especially as  they relate to family planning, child care, economic  independence and choices of  paid work.    Fiji will value women as an important resource and asset  and recognise their right to enjoy a life free from violence  and to access the entitlements and privileges guaranteed     5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  56   under our Constitution unencumbered by discrimination,  culture or oppressive religious interpretation.   Government will continue to work with regional partners  and civil society (including faith-based organisations)  in the empowerment and development of  women.  Resources will be provided to women’s groups to support  income-generating projects. The National Women’s  Expo, sponsored by government, will continue to focus on  marketing products produced by women for the local and  international market.  Over the Plan period, government will create a gender- fair society that protects and promotes the rights of   women. This will be realised through the implementation  of  the Women’s Plan of  Action and the National Gender  Policy over the next five years.  Goal, Policies and Strategies  Goal: Empowering women to reach their full development potential.

Fiji’s rich cultural heritage,  ranging from language, food, festivals, rituals, arts and  traditions, holds intrinsic value for both present and  future generations. This heritage will be safeguarded and  promoted.   The National Culture Policy and National Culture and  Education Strategy set the platform for protection and  preservation of  both tangible and intangible cultural  heritage. The ongoing cultural mapping programme and  framework for gathering cultural statistics will be a key  initiative to gather information on traditional knowledge   and heritage. This will also support the mainstreaming of   culture in educational curriculum.    The use of  local culture in the tourism industry will both  protect and promote our cultural heritage. This includes  cultural performances and traditional arts and craft made  by local artisans that will be promoted through the “Fijian  Crafted” campaign.  The nation’s vast documentary will be preserved in  accordance with archival conservation practices and  made available to all Fijians. A monetary valuation of  this  heritage will also be undertaken.   The upgrade of  Fiji Museum and the National Library  housed within the National Archives will greatly  contribute to the preservation of  Fiji’s heritage. The  positive steps already undertaken to produce authentic  heritage merchandise will be scaled up to provide genuine,  culturally appropriate and iconic goods to tourists in an  effort to boost the economic spin-off from Fiji’s cultural  and documentary heritage.    Cultural heritage sites and places will also be protected as  part of  our unique biodiversity and used sustainably for  national development.

Preserving this system  warrants a strong commitment to upholding the rule of   law and national security. The Fijian Constitution will be  protected and defended at all times.  Apart from the traditional security challenges, focus will  also be placed on protecting Fijians from environmental  risks and natural disasters, transnational crimes (human  and drug trafficking), food and nutrition security and  public health risks and financial and cybercrime.   The Police Force will be strengthened to ensure security  and effective crime prevention. Resources will channelled  towards recruitment and training, provision of  vehicles  and equipment, and decentralisation of  services for   quick and effective response. Programmes to promote  community engagement and public awareness will be  pursued.   Border security will be maintained through improved  coordination and ensuring availability of  adequate  resources. Fiji will continue implementation of  its  National Security Strategy and support for UN  Peacekeeping operations.   Government will continue its efforts to further improve  access to justice. Correctional services and rehabilitation  of  inmates for re-integration of  inmates into society  will continue. This will help maintain the current low  recidivism rate by providing inmates with opportunities  to learn skills for income generation and through other  personal support.  Expanding legal services to improve access to justice for  all Fijians has been a key priority. Provision of  resources  will continue for legal aid services, court sittings in rural  and outer islands, and the greater decentralisation of   services.

We already have the major foundations  and enabling environment, and game-changing strategic  interventions will allow us to build much further over the  next 5 years.   Connectivity, both within and to the outside world, will  be enhanced. Investments will build digital connectivity,  and new and better technologies will be adopted for  productivity improvement and better service delivery.  The ICT sector will be harnessed for job creation and  efficiency gains and to raise the overall standard of  living.   The business environment will be improved to further  reduce the cost of  doing business and support private  sector investments in the country. Manufacturing  and service sectors will be supported and new growth  sectors will be nurtured and harnessed. Niche-product  development and areas of  comparative advantage will be  incentivised and further developed. MSME development  will be strengthened for job creation and income  generation.   Urban development with better services and development  of  new cities, towns and growth centres will be pursued.  Equal attention will also be paid to growing the rural   economy, providing better public services and  creating  many more opportunities for income and employment.   Resource-based sectors will be developed with a major  focus on value addition, efficiency gains and raising  overall production. The tourism industry will be expanded  with a focus on increasing source markets and also  meeting the developing and diverse needs of  tourists.  Trade will be promoted and regional and multilateral  partnerships will be enhanced.  3.2.1 MODERNISING LAND  TRANSPORT  “Access to transportation through an  efficient and sustainable transport  network”  In transforming Fiji, a modern, safe and well-connected  road infrastructure is necessary. The government has  already embarked on modernising the infrastructure with  substantial funding to improve our roads, bridges, jetties,  streetlights and footpaths over recent years.   Existing trunk roads have been upgraded and expanded  and new roads have been constructed in rural and  maritime areas. Fijians are now more connected and  enjoy improved road quality. Roads connecting major  centres have also been modernised to international  standards. This includes the four-lane projects connecting     5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  68   Nausori Airport to Suva and Nadi Airport to Denarau.  In the next 5 years, more investments will be made to  further improve our road network. Existing roads will be  upgraded and sealed. Options are being explored for a  four-lane project in the Nadi-to-Lautoka corridor. The  upgrading and rehabilitation programme for bridges and  jetties will be pursued on a bigger scale.   A major street lighting programme is being undertaken  to replace all faulty streetlights and install new ones with  LED lights in both urban and rural areas. This includes  installation of  streetlights at major junctions; in front  of  villages, settlements, schools, hospitals and health  centres; at shopping centres along the Queens Road and  Kings Road; and along the Labasa to Savusavu corridor.  Streetlights will also be installed in urban and peri-urban  areas of  the greater Suva area.  Government will install traffic lights at junctions, develop  roundabouts and re-design some of  the existing high- traffic roads to ease traffic congestion and make our roads  safer.   Construction of  footpaths will be continued in populated  urban and peri-urban areas including industrial areas and  residential subdivisions.  Resources will be allocated to develop rural and maritime- island roads and other unsealed roads throughout Fiji.  Irish crossings, suspension bridges, rural jetties, waiting  sheds and foot crossings will be upgraded and constructed.  This will support rural agriculture and other industries,  assist in transportation of  students, improve access to  markets and help sustain livelihoods.  To reduce damage to the road network, more  weighbridges will be constructed to ensure that shippers  comply with the weight limits on our roads and bridges.   Emission standards and energy efficiency for transport  will be a key priority. The replacement of  existing  uneconomical vehicles with hybrid and electric vehicles  will be supported. Fuel savings through the use of  biofuel,  liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and liquefied natural gas  (LNG) in land transport will be supported, as will be the  use of  cycling lanes.

The private sector plays a lead role in  providing domestic shipping services, including both  passenger ferries and freight services. Over the past years,  the number of  vessels has increased and the frequency of   services has improved.   Government in the next 5 years will ensure improved inter  island transportation in the maritime region. Investments  will be undertaken for construction and upgrade of  jetties,  waiting sheds, slipways, navigational aids like lighthouses  and beacon piles, and assistance for purchase of  smaller  boats for inter-island connectivity. Funding will also be  channelled towards developing small-boat landings in the  maritime regions and other coastal areas.   Incentives for private sector investments in new ships   and equipment will continue, together with subsidies  for services to uneconomical routes under the franchise  scheme. Government will also continuously review the  subsidy rate, passenger fares and freight charges in line  with cost structures. More investments will be undertaken  in the acquisition of  new vessels to boost Government  Shipping Services’ fleet (GSS), to support development  projects and for passenger transportation to the maritime  islands.   Education and training of  seafarers and development  of  other skilled personnel needed by the industry will be  strengthened through provision of  scholarships and review  of  the training module by the Fiji Maritime Academy.

Our location is also ideal to be a  regional and international air and sea transport hub as  well as provide a feeder network to service other hubs.  As such, modernising and expanding Fiji’s airports and  seaports and provision of  efficient services will continue in  partnership with relevant agencies.  The Nadi International Airport has been modernised  with the upgrade of  the terminal to international level,  pavement rehabilitation and other development works.  This has created a new image of  Fiji’s main international  gateway. There are now plans to construct a second  international terminal and an upgraded domestic  terminal.     Upgrade works for the Nausori International Airport  terminal and runway will also be undertaken to  continually raise standards and facilities. Government  is also exploring options for development of  a new  international airport in Vanua Levu that will support  our vibrant tourism industry and international passenger  movements. Preliminary works have already started,  with site identification underway. To facilitate this huge  investment by Airports Fiji Limited, Government will  provide the necessary infrastructure support.   Fiji Airways has also been undertaking major investments  in renewing its fleet through both outright purchases and  leasing arrangements. This will continue and will ensure  that our national air carrier offers passengers a well- maintained and efficient aircraft fleet. These additional  aircrafts will support plans to increase the number of   available seats across all markets.   Apart from this, government will assist Fiji Airways in  exploring and establishing new routes across the globe.   SEA CONNECTIVITY  Fiji’s seaports provide the major gateway for container  and cargo movement and more recently for passenger  movements with the growth in cruise tourism. Recently,  government has partnered with the private sector for the  management of  Fiji’s ports and cargo terminals. This is to     FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2021  83  ensure increased efficiency in port services. International  best practices have been embraced, and plans have been  developed to modernise port infrastructure.  For Fiji to be a regional and international hub, it is  necessary to improve cargo-volume handling for imports,  exports and transhipments. Investments will be made  to raise berthing capacity and water depth, improve  port efficiency, reduce turnaround time, adopt modern  technology (communications and information technology),  and make supporting industries and services available,  with reasonable charges levied.  The Suva and Lautoka ports have been upgraded to  better facilitate container movement. Modern cargo- handling machinery has been introduced, leading to  improvements in service delivery and gains in efficiency.  With increasing trade flows and cargo movements,  expansion of  berthing facilities and cargo storage is  needed.     A long-term Ports Master Plan with a 7-year  implementation plan is currently being developed to  determine the current state and scope of  international  port operations. Government is exploring options for  development of  a new international seaport in Vanua  Levu and the possibility of  relocating cargo services from  the Suva Wharf. An initial feasibility study for the port in  Vanua Levu has been undertaken, with work underway  for technical, economic and environmental impact  assessment and detailed design work.     There are also opportunities to expand Fiji Ships & Heavy  Industries Limited’s (FSHIL) core business, such as in  slipping, ship repairs, refit, refurbishments and heavy  industries and engineering works. Partnerships between  government and the private sector will be pursued to  support the company in expanding its services in these  areas.    5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  84   Goal, Policies and Strategies  Goal: Enhancing Fiji’s status as a vibrant and modern regional and international hub for people and  cargo movement  POLICIES STRATEGIES  Improve Nadi’s position as the  nation’s main gateway.   yComplete upgrade and modernisation of  Nadi International Airport.  yUpgrade current terminal to include transit lounges and other services.  yConstruct Terminal 2 and additional flight gates.   yUpgrade current runways.  yConstruction of  international transit hotel near Nadi Airport.  yOngoing modernisation of  the Fiji Airways fleet and the introduction of  new international  destinations.

Government is continuously  working towards improving the enabling environment for  the private sector to thrive and expand. Tax rates have  been reduced substantially, registration and licensing  requirements are being streamlined, the new Companies  Act has been enacted, business-opening hours have been  relaxed, private sector participation in strategic areas  is being pursued and supportive infrastructure is being  developed. All this is contributing to reducing the overall  cost of  doing business in Fiji.  In the next 5 years, further improvements will be made  to support business activity. The policy and regulatory  framework for investment will be reviewed to entice more  investment. Government is working with the International  Finance Corporation (IFC) on the review of  the  Investment Policy and legislation. The implementation of   the single-window clearance platform for tier 1 agencies  will be strengthened and tier 2 agencies will be expedited.  Government has engaged Singapore Cooperation  Enterprise to provide technical assistance to improve the  ease of  doing business.  Approvals processes for regulatory agencies in the  provision of  services such as registration, land-use  administration, development control, environmental  protection, employment relations and tax administration  will be enhanced through e-government.  Land-use administration will be improved through  digitisation of  the Titles Office and development of  the  national land register. This will also include better access  to accurate geospatial land-use information.  Development permission and building approvals are also  important aspects of  the business regulatory framework.  In this regard, the Regulation of  Building Permits Act  2017 has been passed and will provide a fast-track and  streamlined process to enhance the existing building  permits approvals process. The Town Planning Act and  the Sub-division of  Land Act are currently under review.   Tax administration will be further improved through  development of  the National Tax Information System  (NTIS), opening new Fiji Revenue & Customs Services  (FRCS) offices around Fiji and streamlining processes to  improve efficiency and consistency in tax administration.  The competition policy framework will be enhanced  to promote greater self-regulation and compliance and  reduce restrictive trade practices.   A PPP policy framework will be adopted to support  private-sector investment in major national infrastructure  projects and other strategic areas. The Public Enterprises  Act 1996 will be reviewed to support reorganisation  processes and increase private-sector participation.    5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  88   Goal, Policies and Strategies  Goal: A sound regulatory environment for inclusive and sustainable private sector development POLICIES STRATEGIES  Enhance land use  administration.   yCapacity building to develop the Fiji Geospatial Information System, National Land Bank and National  Land Register.  y Support development of  iTaukei and State land to improve access for productive purposes, including  identification of  land for deposit in the Land Bank through public awareness.  y Strengthen administration of  lease processes.

In the next 5 years, interventions  will focus on improving the institutional setting, access to  finance, business incubation and training and connecting  MSMEs to markets.   A MSME council has been established to provide policy  direction and leadership to enable and facilitate strategies  for the development of  MSMEs in the country. A Central  Coordinating Agency will be established to develop,  implement, monitor and evaluate MSME development  in collaboration with various stakeholders. The primary  focus will be on coordinating financing, facilitating  business training, mentoring, advisory and incubation,  and data-collection support.  Government will continue and further expand financial  assistance provided under the Micro and Small Business  Grant (MSBG) scheme, SME credit guarantee, and  subsidies through the Fiji Development Bank (FDB) and   continue to encourage the financial sector to provide  loans to MSMEs. Government will also launch the Young  Entrepreneurship Scheme (YES), which will provide  immediate assistance in the form of  grants to qualified  young and budding entrepreneurs, who have bankable  ideas/projects which financial institutions are not willing  to support due to lack of  collaterals.  A ‘Roadside Stalls Project’ will be piloted to provide  vendors along the highway in the areas outside of   municipalities with standardized stalls to sell their  produce. This project will not only improve the standards,  presentation and hygiene of  their produce, but also assist  to gradually mainstream these vendors into the formal  sector.   A Secured Transactions Framework is being drafted  that will allow for the use of  movable property such as  equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, equities, crops  and livestock as collateral for accessing loans. This will  ease the access of  MSMEs to the formal financial sector.  To guide the operations of  microfinance service providers,  a legal and regulatory framework will be developed.  A database will be established to register MSMEs to  ensure availability of  reliable data that will assist in  policymaking. More funding and other resources will be  channelled towards business incubation, skills training and  other support services.    5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  92   Goal, Policies and Strategies  Goal: Promoting entrepreneurial culture through sustainable micro, small and medium enterprises POLICIES STRATEGIES  Reform of  MSME  business regulatory  environment.   yEstablishment of  a National MSME Council.  yEstablishment of  a new MSME Central Coordinating Agency.  yReview the legislative and strategic framework for MSMEs in line with the recommendations of  the  Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP).  yReview of  Fiji Development Bank.  yReview of  current data sources on MSMEs and establishment of  new MSME database.

The  elimination of  fiscal duty on raw materials, zero duty  on plant and machinery, low corporate taxes, tax free  regions and other fiscal incentives have been provided by  Government to support manufacturing and commerce.  Apart from this, the Fijian Made-Buy Fijian campaign has  augured well for the promotion of  locally manufactured  products, both within Fiji and internationally.   Government’s focus in the next 5 years is to develop  Fiji as a manufacturing hub of  the Pacific. Our large  educated workforce, competitive wage rates, and attractive  business environment provide the enabling environment  for the manufacturing sector to thrive. The Fijian Trade  Policy Framework identifies the manufacturing sector as  a key sector that will lead to broadening of  the export  base through the promotion of  value addition and  diversification.   Investments will be supported for competitive high- value-added industries with an emphasis on agro- based manufacturing and niche products for export  development. Foreign direct investment will be  encouraged in a number of  new industries. Government  will develop specialised economic zones built on the  “plug and play” concept with tailor made incentives to  attract investments in the services and manufacturing  industries. In this regard, the Wairabetia Economic Zone,   in the Western Division, will be the first such specialised  economic zone. Joint ventures between foreign and local  investors and other PPP modalities will be encouraged,  with a key focus on technology transfer.   To meet the skills requirements of  the manufacturing  sector, specialised training and skill development will  be provided. The required skills will be developed in  collaboration with the technical colleges and tertiary  institutions. The apprenticeship programme will also be  strengthened.     5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  94   Goal, Policies and Strategies  Goal: Building sustainable and globally competitive manufacturing and commerce.

Fiji has a relatively well-developed financial sector  comprising commercial banks, licensed credit institutions,  insurance companies, non-bank financial institutions,  a superannuation fund and the stock exchange. The  financial system has been well regulated by the Reserve  Bank of  Fiji.   In the next 5 years, more emphasis will be placed on  improving financial literacy, financial inclusion, improving  access to finance, integrated digital-payment systems,  access to insurance services, capital market development,  and establishing the legal framework for regulation of   credit unions and moneylenders.    5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  96   Goal, Policies and Strategies  Goal: A deep, competitive and stable financial system POLICIES STRATEGIES  Improve financial literacy.  yReview and monitor financial education programs for primary and secondary schools.  y Introduce financial literacy programs for tertiary students, low-income groups, and rural and  marginalised communities.  yEncourage a savings culture amongst youths.  y Improve coordination of  adult financial education training programs between government, the  private sector and development partners.

This is  projected to increase to around 56 percent by 2021. To  create vibrant and sustainable urban centres, government  in the next 5 years will focus on better urban development  strategies, the identification and development of  future  growth centres, extension of  town boundaries, urban  waste management, beautification, disaster planning  and response, upgrading and relocation of  informal  settlements, better traffic management and provision of   basic services.    The Urban Policy Action Plan 2007 will be reviewed with  a view to undertaking institutional reforms. Spatial plans  and miniature models will be developed to guide long- term development in all urban centres. Areas identified  for new-town development include Navua, Korovou,  Nabouwalu, Keiyasi, Vunidawa, and Seaqaqa. The  City and Town Planning Scheme will be reviewed and  town boundaries will be extended to enable provision of   municipal services.  Nature and recreation parks, gardens and walkways will  be developed to beautify towns and cities and also ensure  balance between urban expansion, nature and quality of   living.   Consideration will be given to the establishment of  a  Waste Management Authority to provide more efficient,   effective and financially viable waste-management services  to municipal councils. Waste recycling and transfer  stations will also be developed in strategic areas around  the country.   All new urban development projects will need to comply  with guidelines to ensure resilience to climatic hazards  and natural disasters. Structural integrity and climate  and disaster-proof  designs will be key aspects of  future  projects, together with early-warning systems, disaster- response plans, inter-agency coordination and enhanced  disaster-response capacity.   A special Smart City Programme shall be developed for  the Towns and Cities to ensure that the towns are cities  adapt to global modern urban management practices.  Smart City is expected to see that town and city centres  promote green growth initiatives including green energy,  effective and environmentally friendly transport systems,  security for inhabitants, green building construction,  technology advancement and new techniques for solid- waste management—all for the purpose of  promoting a  clean and green environment.   Sister-city arrangements shall be formed to drive the  agenda at the town and city level. Sister-city arrangements  are seen as a way to drive economic and green growth  within our township centres and to foster technical  advancement of  town and city councils. Ministry of  Local  Government and Housing has been working with councils  to establish sister-city relations with overseas counterparts.  This year two sister-city relationships have been formed,  one for Suva and one for Lautoka City.    FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2021  99  Goal, Policies and Strategies  Goal: Creating vibrant and environmentally sustainable urban centres. POLICIES STRATEGIES  Strengthen urban  management and  administration of  town  planning at municipal  level.   yReview status of  Urban Policy Action Plan to determine achievements and areas for future work.  The outcome of  the review will guide the relevant institutional changes needed to improve urban  management.  yUpdate all town-planning schemes to ensure they reflect the current state on the ground. This will  provide a better basis to develop long-term spatial plans.   yDevelop spatial plans with associated 20-year miniature models for all urban centres. The  participation of  all stakeholders within the municipality will be required to agree on the long-term  vision for each urban centre. The development of  the miniature models can be outsourced.  yDevelop a programme to support the capacity of  all municipal councils to effectively administer  town-planning responsibilities. This will include stronger enforcement and adherence to the town- planning schemes and spatial plans that will be developed.  yUpdate town-planning schemes of  small towns. Take the opportunity to adopt technology and  urban management practices used successfully in towns abroad but adapted to suit the local context.  Develop functional linkages between small towns and surrounding rural areas. These linkages to be  part of  the long-term development plan for the Division.  Strengthen long-term  planning for identification  of  growth centres and  their development into  vibrant urban centres.   y Identify areas for future growth in line with the development plans of  each Division.  y Identify potential industries to support development and viability of  growth centres in each relevant  area through private-public partnerships.  yContinue with the identification and extension of  town boundaries that will ensure standardisation  of  building structures, creation of  employment opportunities and bring social services to the people.  Create an environment  that fosters resource  efficiency and effective  management practices by  individual households and  corporate bodies within  urban centres.   y Incentivise households and businesses to invest in renewable energy and adopt energy efficiency  practices and technology including provision for subsidies.  yDevelop and legislate energy efficiency standards for new buildings. All new buildings should have  an energy conservation plan before they are approved.  y Introduce a rating system based on energy efficiency level of  buildings (both existing and new)  relative to legislated standards. Achievement of  certain standards will earn certification and receive  benefits from government. Start with voluntary assessment then move to mandatory assessment 10  years after standards have been adopted.  yExamine options for effective and efficient rainwater harvesting systems within urban centres. The  recommended solutions for each urban centre to be integrated into Municipal plans.  y Incentivise waste management processes, including controlling the type of  packaging material  entering the country and recycling.  yReview institutional arrangements for waste management with a view to identifying the best model  that can deliver an efficient, effective and financially viable waste management operation. This  includes undertaking a feasibility study for a Waste Management Authority proposed in the Green  Growth Framework. In the interim, the Central Government will provide support to local municipal  councils to effectively manage waste disposal.  Include vulnerability  assessments, and climate  change and natural  hazards impact projections  in infrastructure and  urban planning.   yUndertake climate change modelling on all urban centres and develop hazard maps for all urban  centres.  y Incorporate climate change adaptation and disaster risk management into town planning schemes.  y Infrastructure designs to incorporate building resilience to disasters.  y Strengthen coastal boundaries of  urban centres through running a competition on design for coastal  development of  main urban central business districts that not only support natural biodiversity but  also build resilience and protect urban infrastructure. The winning design to be adopted as a model  in the spatial plan for an urban centre. For this plan period, the focus will be on Suva.  yEnsure disaster risk reduction and disaster management response plans are developed for all urban  centres. These plans should address issues such as early warning systems, inter-agency coordination  and the disaster response capacity of  key agencies.  yBuild partnerships between the community, private sector and municipal councils to collectively  address climate change and disaster risk management challenges in urban centres.  y Improve knowledge and understanding at all levels of  municipal governance of  the hazard maps  relevant to their respective jurisdictions.  yEstablish a National Platform for Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management where  stakeholders can interact and better coordinate resources.  yUndertake awareness on climate change adaptation and strengthen disaster management at  community level through the dissemination of  user-friendly brochures, public debates, social media  and other multimedia sources.  y Implement a mangrove revitalization program.    5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  100   Programmes and Projects  PROGRAMME  ANNUAL TARGET TOTAL   OUTPUT   EXPECTED  LEAD   AGENCIES2017-2018 2018-2019 2019-2020 2020-2021 2021-2022  New or  revised  legislation  3 (Town Planning Act, Subdivision of  Lands Act,  and Local Government Act)  3 MLGH  Town  Planning  Schemes  2  Levuka, Nadi  1  Nausori  1  Labasa  3  Sigatoka,  Nabouwalu,  Navua  2  Savusavu,  Levuka  9 MLG  Urban Centre  Miniature  Models  3  Suva, Lautoka,  Nadi  3  Nausori,  Labasa,  Nasinu  3  Sigatoka, Ba,  Lami  9 MLG and  Municipal  Councils  Improvement  of  final  disposal sites   1  Labasa  1  Sigatoka  1  Savusavu  1  Levuka  1  Rakiraki  5 Municipal  Council and  MoEn  Waste  Management  in Municipal  Councils  1  Nasinu  1  Nadi  1  Nausori  1  Labasa  4 Municipal  Council and  MoEn  New Growth  Centres  6 (Navua, Korovou, Nabouwalu, Keiyasi, Vunidawa, and Seaqaqa.) 6 MLG and  FEA, WAF,  NFA and  FRA  Hazard maps  of  urban areas  20 20 MLG and  DOL   Suva Coastal  development  plan  1 1 Suva City  Council  Municipal Councils Investment Projects: Suva 1 2 1 1 5 Suva City   Council Lami 2 1 3 Lami Town   Council Sigatoka 2 1 3 Sigatoka   Town  Council  Nadi 1 1 2 Nadi Town  Council  Ba 1 1 2 Ba Town  Council  MSBG 1 1 2 Tavua Town  Council  Rakiraki 1 1 Rakiraki  Town  Council  Nausori 2 1 3 Nausori  Town  Council  Nasinu 1 1 1 3 Nasinu  Town  Council  Levuka 5 5 Levuka  Town  Council  Labasa 1 1 Labasa  Town  Council    FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2021  101 PROGRAMME  ANNUAL TARGET TOTAL   OUTPUT   EXPECTED  LEAD   AGENCIES2017-2018 2018-2019 2019-2020 2020-2021 2021-2022  Savusavu 1 1 2 Savusavu  Town  Council  MoEn: Ministry of  Environment; DOL: Department of  Lands; MLG: Ministry of  Local Government; FEA: Fiji Electricity Authority; FRA: Fiji Roads Authority; MLGH:  Ministry of  Local Government and Housing; NFA: National Fire Authority; WAF: Water Authority of  Fiji.

Because this is  a cross-cutting issue, other thematic areas also address  the development of  rural and maritime areas. Recent  years have witnessed substantial government investment  in the development of  rural infrastructure, provision  of  education and health services, rural electrification,  access to water, income-generating opportunities, better  communications and transportation.   Over the next 5 years, these investments will continue  in a more integrated manner. Divisional development  plans will be developed in consultation with the relevant  communities and other stakeholders for consideration for  funding support by government.   Strategies will be implemented to improve production and  better facilitate linkages between the agriculture sector  and the market. This will assist in better organising rural  farmers through cluster farming, provision of  extension  services, farm-access roads, irrigation, mechanisation,  marketing support and export development. The role of   the Agriculture Marketing Authority will be strengthened  to provide effective marketing support without crowding  out the private sector.  For disaster-risk management in rural and maritime areas,  government has identified 830 vulnerable communities  at risk from climate-related events to be relocated. Out of   this, 48 communities in urgent need of  relocation would  be supported through government funding with assistance  from development partners.   As part of  its disaster-response and rehabilitation policy,  the government is identifying and constructing evacuation  centres that are compliant with the building code.  Community-based adaptation measures in rural and  maritime regions will also be prioritised. These include  the construction of  sea walls, watershed management,  river dredging and drainage, and riverbank protection.  There will be equal access by all to the factors of   agricultural production. This policy will pay particular  attention to the gender differences in access to and  repayment of  credit, the beneficiaries of  land purchase,  land titling, public amenities, extension services and  technology. The policy will consider the disadvantaged  position of  the most vulnerable women in rural areas.

In preparation for  the phasing out of  preferential access to the EU, industry  reforms have been undertaken to depoliticise the industry,  improve milling efficiency and increase cane production.  The Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) 5 year Strategic Action  Plan lays out a vision that supports the transition towards  a modern and vibrant industry. The objective of  the  Action Plan is to raise sugarcane production to around  3.9 million tonnes to match the crushing capacity of  the  mills, which is estimated at around 4.2 million tons per  annum32. The industry is currently producing around 1.6  million tonnes of  cane. Cane replanting over the past five  years has been badly affected by natural disasters and  adverse climatic conditions.   To support adaptation to climate change, Government  will invest in improving farm drainage infrastructure and  irrigation to control water run-off and saltwater intrusion.  Through the Sugar Research Institute of  Fiji (SRIF), FSC  will develop improved cane varieties to improve resilience  of  crops and production systems to climate change.  In the next five years, the government will support FSC  and farmers to raise cane production to 3 million tonnes  each year. Existing programmes on farm access roads,  cane replanting and fertiliser subsidy will continue to  ensure that production costs remain stable. In addition,  FSC will invest in establishing its own farms. Such an  investment will lead to an increase in the adoption of   mechanisation within the industry.   32.    According to FSC records this target has been achieved 9 times over the 135 years history of  the company.

Source: Ministry of  Sugar.    5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  108   3.2.12 NON SUGAR AGRICULTURE  ‘‘Competitive, sustainable and value- adding agriculture”  The agriculture sector provides an important source  of  livelihood, food and nutrition security, income and  employment. Government is focused on promoting  self-sufficiency in the production and export of  those  agricultural products where Fiji has a competitive  advantage.  In the next 5 years, key interventions will be pursued  to increase production of  commodities under bilateral  quarantine agreements (eggplant, okra, pawpaw, chillies,  and breadfruit), as well as rice, taro, cassava, fruits and  vegetables, kava, organic products, livestock and dairy  products.   Commodity plans for each product will be developed  or reviewed. These plans will set targets and map out  clear strategies to be implemented over the Plan period.  Government will support initiatives for crop replanting,  supplying agro inputs, extension services and training for  young farmers, relevant crop-oriented research, provision  of  high-yielding and climate-resilient seeds and crop  varieties, and better land-use planning. Apart from these  initiatives, the commodity plans will provide directions for  cluster farming, contract farming, and access to finance  and labour requirements.   Mechanisation and new technologies will be adopted  through government support and through private sector  partnerships in areas of  hydroponics, livestock and dairy,  organic farming, and processing of  agricultural products   (ginger, rice, fresh fruits and vegetables) and fruit drinks.     These initiatives will boost large-scale production. They  will also help knowledge transfer, help build expertise, and  attract investment and access to markets. Small farms will  also be assisted to graduate to semi-commercial status.   The Agricultural Marketing Authority (AMA) will be  strengthened to provide effective marketing support to  farmers in the rural and outer islands, while avoiding  crowding out private sector participation. Stronger links  will be forged between farms and markets to create  greater synergy between the agricultural sector and the  tourism industry.  For export development, we will continue to capitalise  on our favourable trade and quarantine arrangements  that allow exports of  agricultural produce to Australia,  New Zealand, the US, Europe, Canada, China and  neighbouring Pacific Island countries. Opportunities to  expand Fiji’s exports for sale in mainstream supermarket  chains overseas will also be pursued in the future.    FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2021  109  Goal, Policies and Strategies  Goal: Competitive, sustainable and value-adding agriculture POLICIES STRATEGIES  Continue  broad-based  support to  agriculture as  a key driver  to economic  growth and  poverty  alleviation.   y Strengthen research and development through a review and restructure of  the Research and Extension Services  Division.   yReview the role and effectiveness of  AMA in supporting the marketing of  agro-produce, particularly for  smallholder farms.  yDevelop a modern agricultural statistical database to better support decision-making.  yUndertake an Agriculture Census Survey by 2019.  yAdoption and implementation of  Livestock Sector Strategy.  y Formulation and adoption of  a National Land Use Plan.  yEnactment of  the Land and Water Resources Management Bill.  y Strengthen links and synergy between the agricultural sector and the tourism industry to promote locally grown  foods.   yDevelop effective synergy between the Fiji Crops and Livestock Council and major industry players to drive  efficiency, quality assurance and establishment of  standards.  yDevelopment of  tailor-made incentives and financial packages for smallholder farmers and incentivise  investment into value addition and larger commercial agriculture ventures.  y Provide stimulus for agricultural commodities’ marketing both for domestic and export markets.   yEstablish and implement a programme to graduate farmers from subsistence to semi-commercial to full  commercial farming.  yEstablish farmer cooperatives and promote cluster arrangements to raise synergy amongst farmers.  y Improve production and productivity of  the agriculture sector through increased mechanisation.  yReview agriculture curriculum at the Fiji National University (FNU) to identify practical components and  pathways into commercial agriculture.  y Institutionalise a system of  farmer training that encourages a new generation of  farmers to receive relevant  hands-on training as has been successfully demonstrated by the Tutu Training Centre.  y Formulation and endorsement of  the national seed policy.  yEstablish a local seed industry to ensure strategic availability of  seed and other planting material.

FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2021  113  3.2.13 FISHERIES  “Sustainably managed fisheries  resources”  The fisheries industry is one of  Fiji’s key resource-based  sectors. The sector consists of  commercial offshore fishing,  inshore fisheries, bêche-de-mer, aquarium fish, reef  fish,  seaweed, black pearls, aquaculture and other aquatic- based products.   The private sector has been the lead player in the fishing  industry, with government providing the regulatory and  resource-management oversight and pursuing adherence  to regional and international commitments. Government  has also supported the industry in the diversification of   export markets, trade facilitation, product research and  development, conducive fiscal and tax environment and  infrastructure.  The government is endeavouring to address several sector- development challenges, including falling fish stocks,  slow growth in aquaculture, finding ways to add value  to fisheries resources, and the negative effects of  climate  change. The National Fisheries Policy that will be finalised  soon will guide the management and development of   sustainable fisheries within the offshore, inshore, coastal  and aquaculture sub-sectors.  The Offshore Fisheries Decree 2014 and the Offshore  Fisheries Management Regulations 2014 will continue  to guide the development and sustainable management  of  the tuna fishery as well as the overall offshore fisheries   sector. Monitoring and enforcement will be strengthened  to minimise illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.  The Government is devising a distribution model to  provide financial assistance to domestic fishing companies  through the Tuna Stabilisation Fund. To obtain premium  prices in export markets, certification for sustainable  harvesting practices will continue and will be periodically  monitored and reviewed.    The inshore fisheries sector will be sustainably managed  through the further establishment of  Marine Protected  Areas (MPA) and other measures to provide for better  catch management. The issue of  permits and licences for  traditional fishing rights of  Qoliqoli (Customary Fishing  Rights Area) is currently under review in consultation with  relevant stakeholders. Government, in collaboration with  its partners, will continue to support the revitalisation and  conservation of  mangroves and corals. To ensure better  management of  coastal and inshore fisheries, a reliable  data-gathering framework will be established to track the  level of  catch and fish stock on a regular basis.   In light of  the increasing demand for fisheries product,  private sector investments will be supported in  aquaculture projects through tax incentives, provision  of  juvenile fry and post-larva stocks, and research  and extension services. The government will continue  investment in the development of  a multispecies hatchery.   Value addition of  fish products will also be supported and  promoted.     5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  114   Goal, Policies and Strategies  Goal: Sustainably managed fisheries resources.

Sustainable forest-management  practices will continue for the wood growing and  processing industry to flourish.   An increased effort will be placed on plantation  development. The Government has been the key player  in forest-plantation management, with the private sector  involved in harvesting and timber processing. Moving  forward, private sector involvement in forest-plantation  development and management will be increased through  long-term leasing arrangements and appropriate  technical support. A National Plantation Policy will be  introduced to provide guidelines for setting up private- sector plantations and their operations as well as a Fire  Management Strategic Plan to address the threat of  forest  fires to standing stock.  The Government will support reforestation of  native  and exotic forests, and Fiji’s forest area, which is  protected under long-term conservation initiatives, will  be increased further. More areas will be identified under  the Fiji REDD+35 programme to protect our forests  and at the same time generate financial benefits under  carbon-trading mechanisms. This will also support  Fiji’s commitment to reduce carbon emissions. A new  framework has been adopted for the harvesting of  native  forests. Framework guidelines set specific diameter limits  by wood species, frequency of  wood species logged and  the standing volume of  a forest.   The excellent quality of  the country’s timber and wood  products is well-known in international markets, and  Fiji is also known to have the world’s largest non-native  mahogany stock in the world. Strategies will be put in  place to capture better returns from greater value addition  by incorporating more down-stream processing.  An important engine of  growth for the forestry sector will  be local micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs)  such as wood carvers and traditional handicraft artisans.  Support will continue to be given to the development of   small-to-medium cottage industries through the timber  utilisation and research division within the Ministry of   Forests.   Fiji also has potential for growth in wood bio-energy.  Private sector partnerships will continue to be supported  in this area.  Goal, Policies and Strategies  Goal:  Sustainable management and development of forestry resources. POLICIES STRATEGIES  Strengthen  sustainable forest  management.   y Strengthen efforts on forest conservation, sustainable forest harvesting practices and climate change mitigation  and adaptation.  yLong-term leasing mechanism(s) to support forest conservation, forest concessions and plantation leases.

Mining activities are expected to increase in the near  future, with eight mining leases currently being monitored  and 78 exploratory licenses being issued. Apart from  mineral exploration, these licences include offshore  oil exploration and geothermal exploration to support  renewable energy production.   Government will ensure sustainable mining practices and  ecological balance together with equitable sharing of   revenue amongst investors, landowners and the State.  The Mining Act, policies and institutional framework for  mining and quarrying and the monitoring and evaluation   of  operations will be revised and updated for better  oversight in areas such as Occupational Health and Safety  (OHS) and environmental safeguards.   Monitoring the environmental impact of  mining  and quarrying activities will be strengthened. The  responsibilities of  the Environment Unit within the  Ministry of  Land and Mineral Resources have been  broadened to include the assessment and monitoring  of  river-gravel extraction, fine-sand dredging, and all  foreshore development leases and licenses. Environmental  impact assessments, compliance monitoring, consultations  and rehabilitation work will also be part of  the expanded  role of  the unit.  Investigation of  potential groundwater sites will continue  in order to increase production and access to sustainable,  clean and safe drinking water. More boreholes will be  drilled and linked to water reticulation systems supplied  to households. The mining department will purchase a  drill rig in 2017/18. Local laboratories will be upgraded  to undertake water-quality testing and geochemical  analysis so that samples do not need to be sent overseas  for analysis.  36.

Over the last few years, our accommodation services have  been continually improving, with the number of  rooms  and beds increasing. Airline services have improved with  increased fleet and capacity for Fiji Airways, new direct  flights and increased frequency. With our pristine natural  environment, top-class hospitality services, improved air  connectivity, competitive Fijian dollar, effective marketing  and cultural diversity and heritage, there is more potential  to be realised. By 2021, tourism earnings are expected to  increase to around $2.2 billion.  The Fijian Tourism 2021 (Fijian Tourism Development  Plan 2017-2021) sets out the following priority areas to  achieve the goal of  total earnings of  $2.2 billion:   y Driving demand for Fiji’s tourism brand;   y Increasing the value of  Fiji’s tourism products;   y Facilitating and promoting domestic and foreign     investment;   y Investing in tourism-related infrastructure;   y Strengthening linkages to the tourism industry;   y Ensuring continued sustainable development of  the    tourism industry;   y Building a conducive and updated legal framework;   y Enhancing Risk Management; and   y Measuring the performance of  Fiji’s tourism industry.  In the next 5 years, Fiji will expand its tourism industry  to niche segments, such as sports tourism, cruise tourism,  wedding and honeymoon tourism, hosting of  conferences  and entertainment events, wellness tourism, and  adventure tourism. The Fijian Government will continue  to bring international events such as rugby competitions,  golf  tournaments, sailing regattas and formal conferences  and meetings to Fiji. This will not only attract visitors  during off-peak seasons, but also promote Fiji in foreign  markets that would otherwise require large marketing  outlays.  The Fijian Government, in partnership with the private  sector, is also exploring the possibility of  developing  large production studios, securing specialised equipment  for hire by foreign crews, nurturing local acting and  production talent and continuing to offer attractive tax  rebates for production of  films and television shows in Fiji.  This will also promote Fiji as a tourism destination.   Apart from supporting large-scale hotel development and  related facilities, micro, small and medium enterprises  (MSMEs) in the tourism sector will continue to be  supported. Other niche activities, such as dolphin and  whale watching, village tours, river rafting and zip lining,  snorkelling and boating, eco-tourism and promoting  Fiji’s cultural and heritage sites will support MSMEs  and local communities. MSMEs will also be provided  training, mentoring, incubation and other business  development support services through the MSME Central  Coordinating Agency.  Market linkages that enable the supply of  local  agricultural and fisheries produce to the tourism industry  will be facilitated and developed. Manufacturing of  high- end niche products such as natural body products, exotic  herbs and spices, local confectionaries, local fruit juices,  handicrafts and packed organic goods will be promoted.  Retail-sector development that provides unique shopping  experiences and promotes the Fijian Made-Buy Fijian  Campaign will also continue to be supported.   Urban centres will be developed with urban gardens,  parks, seaside walkways, cultural and heritage sculptures,  art installations and museums to entice visitors to explore  urban and suburban areas. This will particularly benefit  cruise tourism, which has been flourishing in recent years.  To further support this form of  tourism, our wharves and  jetties will be modernised and upgraded.   Government will continue to provide a marketing grant  to Tourism Fiji. In order to capitalise on its position as  the transportation hub, Fiji will participate in initiatives  to market the Pacific as a tourism destination that would  benefit Fiji and the region.  In addition, the Tourism Satellite Accounts (TSA) will be  prepared by the Fijian Bureau of  Statistics on a two-year  interval to accurately measure the economic contribution  of  the tourism industry and at the same time identify  areas of  strategic intervention where the industry can  expand further.

In this regard, Fiji is a member of  the  World Trade Organisation (WTO) and party to a number  of  trade agreements such as Pacific Islands Countries  Trade Agreement (PICTA), Melanesian Spearhead Group  (MSG) Trade Agreement, South Pacific Regional Trade  and Economic Cooperation Agreement (SPARTECA)  and Interim Economic Partnership Agreement (IEPA).  Upon the expiration of  the South Pacific Regional Trade  and Economic Cooperation Agreement-Textiles, Clothing  and Footwear Scheme (SPARTECA-TCF) in 2014, Fiji  qualified for trade benefits under Australia’s Developing  Country (DC) Preferences Scheme.  Under the WTO, Fiji has recently ratified the WTO  Trade Facilitation Agreement, which is expected to  increase efficiency and effectiveness of  trade facilitation  agencies in Fiji.  Fiji will continue to engage with Pacific Agreement   on Closer Economic Relations (PACER) Plus parties  and push for commencement of  negotiation on the  Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA)  with the European Union, which has been suspended for  3 years. Fiji continues its policy to seek beneficial trade  and political relationships with new and non-traditional  partners and is engaged in discussions with China on a  bilateral trade arrangement.  The Interim Economic Partnership Agreement between  Fiji/Papua New Guinea and the European Union (EU)  will be mirrored with the United Kingdom, in light of   Britain’s exit from the EU. Furthermore, discussions will  commence on improving the provisions of  IEPA for better  market access and conditions.  The Fijian Trade Policy Framework guides Fiji’s  engagement in future trade agreements to capitalise  on Fiji’s position as the hub of  the Pacific. The Trade  Policy Framework determines how to connect all the dots  and addresses our production capacity, and supply-side  constraints. It is about all stakeholders working together  towards the ultimate goal of  increasing exports for Fijian  made products and services.  Export development will be supported through raising  competitiveness, diversification and value addition under  the National Export Strategy (NES) in priority sectors.  With the increase in flight connectivity and cargo traffic,   38. World Travel and Tourism Council, 2016, Travel and Tourism Economic Impact Analysis - Fiji, London, United Kingdom.  39.

South Pacific Tourism Organisation, Pacific Cruise Market Research and Intelligence Project    FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2021  127  new opportunities for trade between Fiji and Europe,  the USA, Singapore, and other Asian countries will be  developed.   Trade promotion and facilitation will be pursued  through our trade commissions based in key markets,  in collaboration with relevant domestic stakeholders.  Customs procedures, biosecurity inspections and port  services will be further streamlined and improved to  reduce red tape.   Tariff policy reviews will be consistent with our economic  development aspirations and priorities, taking into  account the potential risks to revenue, industrial growth,  employment and social conditions and the facilitation of   private sector adjustment.  Government will seek to improve Fiji’s trading position  and competitiveness through training, research and  institution-building and continue to seek access to Aid  for Trade from development partners to assist in building  trade capacity and infrastructure.   INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS  Fiji’s foreign policy is guided by our Constitution to  best serve the interests of  the people of  Fiji, recognising  universally accepted principles and rules of  international  law and treaties to which Fiji is a party.   Pacific regionalism will be promoted and strengthened  based on equality and genuine partnership. A level   platform for dialogue and consensus building will be  promoted on critical development issues for all Pacific  Island countries.  Fiji acknowledges and aims to strengthen regional  dialogue and consensus-building through the Pacific  Island Development Forum (PIDF). The Forum promotes  regional cooperation in pursuit of  home-grown solutions  to address sustainable development challenges faced by  Pacific Small Island States, including the adoption and  mainstreaming of  the Green Growth Framework for Fiji.  Similarly, this commitment will also be pursued through  the MSG.   Within the global community, Fiji is a member of   the United Nations and its specialised agencies, the  International Monetary Fund, World Bank group, the  Asian Development Bank, the European Investment  Bank and the World Trade Organization. Fiji supports  an inclusive and participatory approach to sustainable  development and recognises that development partnership  and cooperation should be guided by the United Nations  2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  Fiji will strengthen its regional standing through South- South Cooperation, as a development partner in the  region promoting cooperation to enhance regional  integration and active cooperation in addressing common  regional issues at both regional and international fora.  Goal, Policies and Strategies  Goal: Expanding trade base and economic engagement in the global community POLICIES STRATEGIES  Improve Fiji’s  overall trade  performance  through  a more  competitive  economy and  thereby help  establish Fiji  as the modern  hub of  the  Pacific.   y Facilitate the engagement of  Fiji in multilateral, regional and bilateral trade agreements/arrangements.  y Secure and maintain improved market access into the regional and international markets.  y Promote and enhance the competitiveness of  Fijian products and services in the international market.  y Facilitate the efficient flow of  trade through compliance with the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement and  successful implementation of  single window clearance.  y Support the improvement of  trade related infrastructure.  y Provide trade or market information to traders and the business community.   yCreate conditions for sustained increase in investment and the increase in total factor productivity.  yAssist domestic firms to increase their levels of  efficiency and competitiveness.  y Stimulate and encourage value-addition activities through research and development.  y Strengthen capacities of  trade support institutions particularly those directly engaged with trade policy, customs,  standards, trade facilitation, competition, consumer protection and provisions of  trade –related information.    5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  128   Programmes and Projects  PROGRAMME  ANNUAL TARGET TOTAL OUTPUT   EXPECTED  LEAD   AGENCIES2017-2018 2018-2019 2019-2020 2020-2021 2021-  2022  Market  Access:  Alternative  markets for  sugar  At least  1 new or  alternative  market for  sugar   1 new market  for sugar  MoS,  MITT  Trade  negotiations:  Comprehensive  EPA,  PACER Plus,  Melanesian  Free Trade  Agreement,  revision of   PICTA trade  in goods rules  of  origin,  enhancement  of  the United  States GSP  scheme and  preferential  trade  arrangement  with China  Finalisation of   IEPA with the  UK 41  MITT  Trade  Facilitation   Compliance  with the  WTO  Trade  Facilitation  Agreement.

FIVE YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN 2017-2021  129  3.2.18 INFORMATION AND  COMMUNICATION  TECHNOLOGY  “Universal access to information and  competitive telecommunication services  delivered on a secure platform”  Information and communication technology (ICT) has  transformed the lives of  people by raising productivity  and growth, creating more employment, improving  connectivity between urban and rural areas, enhancing  service delivery and promoting innovation.   Fiji has a competitive edge in the region because of  our  access to the Southern Cross Cable fibre optic network  (SCCN), which provides fast (240Gbps), direct and secure  connectivity with Australia, New Zealand, and the USA  and reduces reliance on satellite capacity, which can  be congested and costly. Our telecommunications and  internet capabilities have seen marked improvements, with  95 percent of  the country connected through wire and  wireless network.   Fiji has also developed the region’s first national  broadband policy. Mobile phone penetration and mobile  broadband access have increased with the extension of   3G and 4G network coverage. Government services are        being provided on the digital platform, and Community  Telecentres have been developed.   The fibre optic cable project between Viti Levu and  Vanua Levu via the Samoa-Fiji submarine cable is  currently underway and will address bandwidth capacity  constraints and make internet more accessible to all  Fijians. Other planned fibre optic cable projects will be  pursued through private sector partnerships.  Competition will be enhanced in broadband internet  services by making communication infrastructure  available to multiple users under reasonable terms and  conditions.  The Telecommunication Authority of  Fiji (TAF) will  regularly survey areas to be a “Declared Universal Service  Area”, which is a prerequisite for telecommunications  companies to erect network towers in those areas.   Government will adopt strategies to ensure that ICT  infrastructure is climate resilient.   Fiji’s strategic location between Asia and the USA  provides a time-zone business advantage to access East  Asia, the USA, and Europe. With abundant skilled  technical labour, a good English-speaking population,  low costs of  doing business and tax incentives, investment  will be attracted for ICT development in back-office  operations and call centres.    5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  130   Goal, Policies and Strategies  Goal: Universal access to information and competitive telecommunication services delivered on a secure plat- form.  POLICIES STRATEGIES  Improve the  telecommunications  infrastructure.   yDigital Government implementation – make priority government services, particularly Disaster, Recovery  and Rehabilitation accessible online by 2020.  yEnhance competition in broadband internet services, by making the existing fixed line infrastructure  available to multiple users under reasonable terms and conditions i.e. local loop unbundling.  yConsider Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in the construction of  communications infrastructure  (particularly for towers), and landing station infrastructure for connectivity to the Southern Cross Cable  fibre optic network (SCCN). Funds from the universal service obligation fund and the international  inbound call levy can be used for this purpose.  y Fiji Roads Authority (FRA), the Water Authority of  Fiji (WAF), Fiji Electricity Authority (FEA) and  Telecom Fiji Limited (TFL) along with other utility providers to lay fibre optic cables, conduits and  chambers when conducting trenching works during road construction or maintenance.  yComplete the TFL fibre optic cable ring around Viti Levu.  yEstablish a second redundant link from Viti Levu to Vanua Levu through Lomaiviti, to provide resiliency  to Vanua Levu, Taveuni, Levuka, Lakeba and backhaul to other islands.  yEstablish fibre optic connectivity between Viti Levu and Vanua Levu through the Samoa-Fiji submarine  cable.  y Fully implement the ICT Development Policy and National Broadband Policy 2011.   Provide equal access  to ICT.   yExpand the outreach of  the government Community Telecentre Project, where feasible.  y Improve access to computers and assistive devices for visually impaired and the hearing impaired through  targeted tax incentives and subsidies.  yTV broadcasters to provide subtitle services for hearing-impaired viewers.  yReview the National ICT Policy to incorporate relevant aspects of  the National Gender Policy 2014 and  the National Disability Policy.  y Provide subsidies to improve access for disabled people to school and community telecentres e.g.  wheelchair ramps.  Strengthen  the regulatory  framework.   yConsolidate all existing fees for telecommunications operators (e.g. special international call handling levy,  ICT levy, licensing fees, universal service obligation fund, etc.) into a single standard fee.   yConsider establishment of  a new regulatory framework for telecommunications under the multi-sector  regulator model.  yDevelop a cyber-security policy and framework.  Strengthen ICT  capabilities in the  workforce.   y Incentivise the retention of  skilled IT graduates in the workforce.  y Prioritise the use of  ICT based planning and monitoring tools in the public sector.   y Promote the use of  social media to facilitate public consultations during policy formulation.  yEncourage widespread use of  ICT in the public sector to improve work processes, productivity, and  service delivery. For example, paper correspondence will be minimised in favour of  more-efficient  channels, such as email and teleconferencing.  y Increase access to appropriate technologies via technology transfer between bilateral, regional and  international partners.  y Support the widespread use of  ICT to provide localized weather information and forecasts to farmers,  which will improve efficiency and productivity at the farm level.  Promote the use of   “Green” technology.   y Incentivise large-scale FDI in industries that develop environmentally sustainable technology (particularly  in areas such as transportation, renewable energy, manufacturing, and agriculture).   y Incentivise FDI in business process outsourcing.  yDevelop a national framework to promote innovation, research and development (R&D) towards  environmentally sustainable technology.   y Further examine the possibility of  adopting a national identity card.  yEnsure that all imported technologies are consistent with “Green” technology specifications i.e. energy  efficient, low carbon emissions, meet minimum quality standards and safety considerations, discourage  parallel imports, etc.  y Support the installation, operation and maintenance of  adequate national/regional Early Warning  Systems (EWSs) and forecasting infrastructure for hydro meteorological events (such as tropical cyclones,  floods, etc.) and programmes for both monitoring on-going hazards and building resilience for the future.

Timely assessments of  public programmes and services  will allow government to identify any constraints and  address them.  The immediate priority is to ensure effective, efficient  and accountable delivery of  Ministry and Department  outputs, i.e. the delivery of  public services and  implementation of  public programmes and projects under  the 5-year Development Plan and measuring national  development targets, which are aligned to regional and  international indicators like the SDGs.   4.1 NATIONAL OUTCOMES AND  MINISTRY OUTPUTS  Monitoring and evaluation of  the Plan and the 5-year DP  will rely on the standard performance-based monitoring  and evaluation framework focusing on outcomes and  outputs.  National outcomes are the:   y National Development Targets under the 20-Year  Development Plan; and   y Sector goals, policy objectives and key performance  indicators under the 5-year DP.   Outputs are the strategies, programmes and projects for  implementation by line ministries and other implementing  agencies.  Major national development challenges and issues that  are cross-cutting in nature, such as human rights, green  growth, climate change adaptation and disaster risk  management, human resource development, employment  and productivity and poverty alleviation have been  mainstreamed into the various sector goals, policy  objectives, strategies and programmes of  the 5-year  DP. The outputs for each Ministry and Department for  monitoring and evaluation are aligned to relevant sector  goals and national outcomes under the 5-year DP.  4.2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES  The institutional framework for monitoring and  evaluation is described in Table 2.

There will be ongoing periodic monitoring  and evaluation of  implementation progress and  performance results for all programmes and projects  under the 5-year DP identified for implementation  under the National Budget or through other sources  of  funding. There will also be regular review of   priority areas for monitoring and evaluation to  support achievement of  the 20-year Development  Plan.   b. Annual reviews by accountability institutions like  the OAG and PAC will be used for monitoring and  evaluation, with continued focus on implementing  findings of  annual audit reports.  c. Efforts will be made by all government monitoring  and evaluation agencies to streamline reporting  processes for implementing agencies. This will be  pursued by sharing information, relying on internal  reports by implementing agencies whenever possible,  and any other appropriate measures to reduce  reporting requirements.   ii. Monitoring and evaluation of  national performance  and outcomes are an integral part of  the National Budget  process. This involves the collection of  official statistics  and public sector performance management. Monitoring  and evaluation of  National Development Targets will:  a. Commence with existing baseline data for national  outcomes and where necessary baseline data will be  compiled (e.g. national baseline data for the state of   Fiji’s environment needs to be collated);  b. Carry out assessments according to existing  methodology (e.g. Public Sector Investment  Programme - PSIP and Capital Budget Appraisals)  for the provision of  a service, adoption of  a  programme and allocation of  resources. The  evaluation will:  i. Determine viability through assessments of  the  effectiveness and impact of  public services, policy  objectives, strategies, programmes and projects;  and  ii. Identify critical factors that have resulted  in success or failure and possible areas for  improvement.    c. Be incorporated into government’s decision- making machinery, particularly the National Budget;  d. Involve all programme stakeholders, particularly  the general public (increase use of  official statistics to  not only report performance but to support decision  making); and  e. Be regularly reviewed as and when appropriate.  Consideration will be given to monitoring and  evaluation processes, such as consultations with the  public and other national stakeholders and a Mid- Term Review.    4.3 MONITORING AND  EVALUATION TEMPLATE  A Monitoring and Evaluation template for monitoring  of  outputs by Ministries and Departments under the  5-year DP and the national budget is reflected in Table  3. The template is based on the logical framework and  captures sector outputs and planned activities for periodic  monitoring and evaluation.    5-Year and 20-Year National Development Plan  136   Ta bl  e  3:   A nn  ua l W  or k   Pr og  ra m  m e   an d   R ep  or tin  g  Te  m pl  at e  A N  N U  A L   W O  R K   P R  O G  R A  M M  E  A  N D   R EP  O R  TI N  G  T  EM P  LA TE    Pr  oj ec  t T itl  e: Im  pl em  en tin  g  A  ge nc  y:    H ea  d/ Pr  og ra  m m  e/ A  ct iv  ity /S  EG :  Bu dg  et :  An nu  al  W  or k   Pr og  ra m  m e  R ep  or ti  ng  T  em pl  at e  E xp  ec te  d  O  ut pu  t Pl  an ne  d  Ac  ti vi  ti es  T im  ef ra  m e  Po te  nt ia  l  R  is ks  R es  po ns  ib le    Pa  rt y  Pl an  ne d   E xp  en di  tu re  Pr og  re ss   R ep  or t b  y  Im  pl em  en tin  g  A  ge nc  y  St ar  t Fi  ni sh  Q 1  Q 2  Q 3  Q 4  E xp  en di  tu re  Is  th  e  ac  ti vi  ty    on  tr  ac k?

National Development  Target  Quantifiable levels of  indicators that government wants to achieve at a given point  of  time at the national level e.g. annual growth in GDP, income per capita, total investment as a  percentage of  GDP, and the level of  unemployment.  Sector An area of  critical importance to the national economy and society and one of  the areas  into which the activity of  a country is divided. Key issues are captured with relevant  approaches to develop and grow this area to benefit the nation e.g. education, road transport,  energy, fisheries, and national security.  Sector Goal (Outcome) The likely, intended or achieved short to medium-term effect of  sector interventions or  intermediate effects of  programme outputs on clients e.g. improved availability or coverage of   public infrastructure, utilities and services such as farmers’ improved access to markets, more children have  increased access to pre-school programs, more people are inoculated and rural populations have better access  to potable water.  Sector Key  Performance Indicator  The quantitative or qualitative variables that provide a simple and reliable means to  measure achievement, to reflect the changes connected to an intervention, or to help  assess the performance of  an organisation against the stated outcome. An observable and  specific measure that when tracked systematically over time indicates progress towards  a specific target e.g. percentage of  eligible urban families in informal settlements areas housed to a  certifiable level of  accommodation, and percentage of  anaemia among pregnant women.  Sector Target Quantifiable levels of  the indicators that government wants to achieve at a given point of   time at the sector level e.g. 86% of  all children complete secondary school by 2021, all the population  has access to electricity by 2021.  Baseline The first measurement of  an indicator to find out “where we are today” e.g. national  incidence of  poverty of  28.4% in 2015 and average life expectancy of  females at birth of  73.4 years in  2015.  Policy A course, plan or principle of  action adopted or proposed by government to bring about  change and development.  Policy Strategy How the policy will be achieved. The method(s) and, or action(s) that will be employed to  achieve the policy objective e.g. review and update legislation, develop new individual, organisational  and institutional capacity, strengthened dialogue with the private sector, and the introduction of  new  technology.  Programme A planned schedule or portfolio of  multiple projects and associated activities that are  managed and coordinated as one unit with the objective of  achieving an output over a  period of  time e.g. strengthening of  social safety nets including cash transfers, and cultural mapping  programme implemented in 14 provinces.  Programme Output Products and services produced by the programme e.g. kilometres of  road constructed, and  completed and certified sanitation schemes.  Project A piece of  planned work or an activity established to be completed and to deliver specific  measureable outputs in line with predefined time, cost and quality constraints e.g. Nadi  airport modernisation, construction of  sports complex in Vunisea, Kadavu, and enhancement of  integrated  passport issuance system.  Project Activities Tasks personnel undertake to transform programme and project inputs to outputs. Project Inputs Financial, human, and material resources.

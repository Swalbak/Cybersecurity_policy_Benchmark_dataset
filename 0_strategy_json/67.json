At the same time, it serves as a response to postulate 17.3789 of former National Councillor Claude Béglé of 28 September 2017. Foreword Digitalisation is everywhere. It has permeated almost all aspects of our lives and will continue to do so for decades to come. Digital technologies are constantly evolving and there is no telling where they will take us next. But one thing is certain: the new technologies shaping our future offer enormous potential to drive sustainable development and prosperity — here in Switzerland and around the world. We live in a digital age. With social media we can connect with thousands of people at once, wherever they are. The young generation is growing up with smartphones and tablets as a part of everyday life. And while computers have long been used for routine tasks, artificial intelligence is opening up a whole new world of possibilities. Now, as the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, the key role of digital applications has really come to the fore. But digita- lisation also brings certain challenges, not least the vulne- rability of our data in an information society. The frequency and scope of cyberattacks, cybercrime and political manipu- lation in the digital space are growing all the time, as are dependencies and vulnerabilities. The Federal Council recognises the strategic importance of digitalisation. In the 2019-23 legislative programme, digita- lisation takes on new significance and plays a growing role. In the Foreign Policy Strategy 2020—23digitalisation features for the first time as one of four thematic priorities. There are two aspects to the role of digitalisation in government. At one level it is a work tool and a means of simplifying processes, for example in consular services or IT applications. But digitalisation is now also a foreign policy matter, raising a number of important questions. How do we ensure that users can control their data and decide who can access it? How do we maintain Switzerland's leading position in business, innovation and education? How do we strengthen the position of International Geneva as a hub for digital governance? How do we enforce international law and human rights in the digital space? How do we promote a secure and stable digital space and strengthen trust between the different stakeholders? These are all questions that arise in the emerging context of digital foreign policy. In the digital space itself, Switzerland is confidently and independently pursuing its interests and values — the same interests and values it pursues in the physical world, whether on the ground, in the air, at sea or in outer space. Here too the Federal Constitution provides a framework to promote Switzerland’s freedom, independence, security and prosperity, the alleviation of need and poverty in the world, sustainable development, equal opportunities, human rights, democracy and commitment to a peaceful and just international order. We continue to be guided by this in the future to ensure a coherent and effective foreign policy, including in the digital space. The present strategy sets out the various fields of action for the Federal Council's digital foreign policy over the coming years. In the annexes it also provides additional information on the broader context for a deeper understanding of the topic. | hope you enjoy reading it.

It mandates the Federal Council to examine “how Switzerland could become the global epicentre of interna- tional governance in the area of cyberspace”. The postulate also suggests the creation of a type of Geneva Convention for digitalisation and the foundation of a neutral organisation in Geneva, which could be responsible for its implementation. On 8 December 2017, the Federal Council proposed that the postulate be adopted, indicating that the idea of a ‘Geneva Digital Convention’ would be met with great scepticism by most stakeholders and be almost impossible to implement. The Federal Council also announced that it would be willing to issue a report setting out Switzerland’s priorities in the areas of international cybersecurity and digital governance. The National Council adopted the postulate on 15 March 2018 by 113 votes to 78. 1.2 Focus of the strategy Since the postulate was adopted, digitalisation has progressed rapidly, permeating and changing politics, the economy and society as a whole. These digital advances present many opportunities, but also bring with them new challenges and issues. The global COVID-19 crisis has highlighted that while new digital technologies can help us better understand and contain the spread of a pandemic, for example through the use of digital contact tracing, and while they underscore the importance of issues relating to technical standardisation and cross-border cooperation, these technologies also raise a number of questions, for example about application security and data protection. The Federal Council has taken into account the growing significance of digitalisation, having placed greater emphasis on this topic in its legislative programme for 2019-23. The need for the Federal Council’s political agenda to now take advantage of the many opportunities presented by digitali- sation was set out in the corresponding guidelines. Alongside peace and security, prosperity and sustainability, digitalisation is a new thematic foreign policy focus in the Foreign Policy Strategy 2020-23. The Federal Council's ‘Digital Switzerland’ Strategy of September 2020 sets out the guidelines for government action with regard to digitalisation and indicates where and how authorities, business, science, civil society and politics must work together in order to jointly shape the transformation process for the benefit of all. A number of other baseline documents related to digitalisation have been adopted in recent years. These include the National strategy for the protection of Switzerland against cyber risks for 2018-22, the International Cooperation Strategy 2021-24 as well as the measures to strengthen Switzerland's role as a host state during the 2020-23 period.\" In the Federal Council's 2019 Foreign Economic Policy Report, the featured topic was also devoted to ‘Digitalisation and foreign trade’.? Key events have also since taken place on an international level. The UN secretary-general, for example, placed the subject high on the international agenda by convening a High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation to report on the topic. The report, to which former Federal Councillor Doris Leuthard contributed as a panellist, contained key recommen- dations on how to advance global digital cooperation. On 10 June 2020, the UN secretary-general presented a roadmap based on this report, which set out the next practical steps to implement these recommendations. It focuses on improving internet access around the world, greater capacity-building in developing countries, protecting human rights, improving cybersecurity and promoting inclusive governance models.? 1 See Annex 3. 2 See ‘Digitalisation and foreign trade’, featured topic of the Federal Council's 2019 Foreign Economic Policy Report, published 15 January 2020, SR 20.008 (executive summary and featured topic available in English). 3 UN Secretary-General’s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation Background 1 In addition, countries and organisations such as the European Union* have also put into place regulations that impact Switzerland and its foreign policy. This context must be given due consideration. The Federal Council is addressing the fundamental issues raised in postulate 17.3789 on Switzerland's foreign policy positioning as well as the positioning of International Geneva, but is going beyond this in three aspects: firstly, it is integrating the latest developments at an international level, specifically the roadmap presented by the UN secretary-general. Secondly, it is aiming to foster a comprehensive understanding of the opportunities and risks related to digitalisation, which extends beyond the cybersecurity-specific focus. Thirdly, in fulfilment of the postulate, it conceives the report as a thematic follow-up strategy to the Foreign Policy Strategy 2020-23. In accordance with this strategy, Switzerland intends to further develop its digital foreign policy and raise its profile in this regard (objective 4.4). This will be taken into account here. 4 With its European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU has played a global leading role in protecting personal data. The EU is aiming to develop a wide-ranging governance model as part of its data strategy. In a White Paper on Artificial Intelligence (Al), the EU Commission also set out how Al will be used to benefit the European economy, while safeguarding citizens’ rights. The EU's digital strategy and the measures relating to the digital single market and cybersecurity also flow into the EU's regulations. This strategy explains the conceptual understanding of various key notions, describes the international environment, sets out Switzerland’s interests and values in the digital Space as well as its strengths, identifies four action areas for Switzerland's digital foreign policy for the next four years and highlights the opportunities for Switzerland as a country. The Strategy includes a glossary to help better understand the various concepts.

Technology is moving at a rapid pace and it permeates all areas of our lives. However, a common understanding of the most important concepts and terms is necessary and the following definitions are proposed in this strategy: Originally, digitalisation described the technical process for converting analogue information into digital formats. This is now referred to as digitisation. Continual technological devel- opments have resulted in structural changes, new applications and systems, for example the creation of networks or the use of Al. Nowadays, the term digitalisation spans all of these developments, including opportunities for use as well as their social, economic and political impact, for example. In principle, the digital space refers to networks of devices which exchange data with each other. The most frequently used and by far the most global of these networks is the internet. Today, around 50 billion end devices are connected to the internet and according to the UN, 54% of the world’s population has active access to it.° Digital space not only includes networks and devices, but also the relevant actors, various processes and interactions. In the same way as land, sea and air are considered ‘spaces’ — and indeed as outer space has recently in the history of humankind been explored as a new ‘space’ — the digital space is also considered a new dimension which extends beyond national borders. 5 UN secretary-general’s roadmap, p. 5.

Background 3 Switzerland also has interests and values in this new, digital space — these form part of its digital policy and, within that, digital foreign policy, which is a new area of foreign policy for the country. Nevertheless, it is consistent with Switzer- land's aspiration to actively contribute to all policy areas: the protection of its sovereignty, its independence and security, access for its economy to global markets, its commitment to sustainability and a just international order, access for as many sections of the population as possible to opportunities in life and the protection of human rights. As such, there is no change in quality as regards the content of its digital foreign policy; it is much more a continuation of Switzerland's proven approach to protecting its interests and promoting its values in a new ‘space’. Promoting digital governance will play a key role. This represents an important area of digital foreign policy and will allow for the creation of common rules in the digital space and strengthen both institutions and cooperation mecha- nisms. An equally important area of digital foreign policy is cyber- security, Cybersecurity concerns all aspects of security in information and communications technology. This includes all information technologies related to the internet and other similar networks as well as the associated communi- cation, processes, applications and information processed in relation to these. International cooperation between state and non-state actors in the area of cybersecurity aims to maintain and protect an open, free and secure digital space. It can also reduce the risks of cyberattacks between states. The term cyber is mostly used at an international level when discussing issues related to security and confidence-building, while digital has a broader social, economic and political dimension. 4 Background Ultimately, digitalisation is only part of a larger transfor- mation. ‘Digitalisation 2.0’, which is based on new commu- nication technologies and elements such as the internet of things, big data, blockchain, quantum computing and cloud technologies, is already being overshadowed by equally signif- icant innovations in the area of bio and gene technologies. The convergence of digital, bio and physical technologies is often referred to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The potential for change already offered by each of these technologies is amplified when these areas come together and interact. While this strategy is limited to the area of digitalisation, it also makes references to other new technologies. Science diplomacy plays a key role in this. New issues and action areas arise when science, technology and foreign policy come together. Science diplomacy is necessary to help shape digital change. Foreign policy should be based on scientific expertise and evidence (science in diplomacy) and should itself facil- itate scientific collaboration between states and promote it where appropriate (diplomacy for science). At the same time, scientific collaboration can be particularly beneficial politically where there are no established diplomatic channels in place (or where these are insufficient), helping to foster confidence and cooperation (science for diplomacy).® As such, digital foreign policy and science diplomacy are closely related, especially at the multilateral level. 6 See also Switzerland’s International Strategy on Education, Research and Innovation, 2018. 2 Switzerland's digital foreign policy 2.1 Interests and values The main aim of Switzerland’s foreign policy is to promote its interests and values, as set out in the Federal Constitution — in particular in Articles 2, 54 and 101. These interests and values do not change with the emergence of new technologies or the progress of digitalisation. The Swiss foreign policy aim of influencing these issues cannot be limited to the physical space. Switzerland’s interests and values also apply both in and to the digital space. Digital foreign policy is the tool used to safeguard these interests and promote Switzerland's values within the digital space. The Foreign Policy Strategy 2020-23 defines the basic principles for digital foreign policy and sets out the vision of a free, open and secure digital space. It is based on international law and focuses on people and their needs.’ Specifically, the aim is to raise Switzerland’s profile in the area of digital governance, further develop its digital foreign policy and position Interna- tional Geneva as a prime location for discussing digitalisation and technology. Accordingly, this strategy is based on the Foreign Policy Strategy 2020-23 and refines the digital foreign policy guidelines as set out within it. 7 See Annex 3. 2.2 Switzerland’s strengths Thanks to its neutrality and good offices, Switzerland is able to build confidence. This makes it easier for Switzerland to position itself as a bridge-builder in difficult, fragmented environments, including in the digital space. In light of prevailing digital geopolitics, and an increasing trend towards blocbuilding, there is an increasing need for mediators. Switzerland can build on its key successes and proven track record in this regard: in recent decades it has repeatedly managed to bring new impetus to international discussions, for example with the holding of the World Summit on the Infor- mation Society (WSIS) 2003 in Geneva, and subsequently with the reform of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). This organisation assigns internet addresses and until 2016 was under the direct supervision of the US government, which had provoked major political controversy for two decades. The transition of ICANN into a multi-stake- holder model was negotiated under Swiss chairmanship of the Governmental Advisory Committee. Another example is the Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of ICTs in the Context of International Security as mandated by the UN General Assembly (UN OEWG), which Switzerland currently chairs. For the second time, Switzerland also has an expert representative on the Group of Governmental Experts on Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the context of international security (UN GGE). Over 70 countries applied for a seat on this group of 25 experts. These examples show that Switzerland is perceived and valued as a solution-ori- ented, credible and capable partner. Switzerland is also able to benefit from its role as a host state. International Geneva, as the operational platform for imple- menting the 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals, presents Switzerland with a wide range of opportu- nities. Switzerland also plays a leading role in researching new technologies thanks to its federal institutes of technology and other research centres. Many innovative and world-leading technology companies are based in Switzerland; in addition, there is a diverse SME landscape, especially in the field of digital services. Overall, the Swiss financial and business centre has so far responded successfully to the challenges of digitalisation. Furthermore, a number of important international organisa- tions and NGOs involved in the discussion on digital change are also headquartered in the country. The presence of these stakeholders puts Switzerland in a good position to discuss digital issues.® 8 See Annex 5. Switzerland's digital foreign policy 5 3 International environment The following challenges have emerged on an international level: re Geopolitical and authoritarian Legal (un)certainty a eA trends Technological race and concentration of power ea eats The importance of private actors Speed of digital advance ——p Figure 3: The international environment (Source: FDFA). Geopolitical and authoritarian trends The ongoing shifts in global power have resulted in rising political fragmentation. The geopolitical renaissance is also evident in the digital space, creating the risk of networks decoupling from each other, thereby weakening the open, global internet. Deglobalisation trends, also witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic, have in addition encouraged regionalisation in the form of competing economic, devel- opmental and social systems. While the liberal-democratic model continues to be successful, it is coming under increased pressure. Authoritarian trends and models that do not link development and prosperity with individual rights or with political and social pluralism are on the rise in many parts of International environment the world. The misuse of digital technologies, for example to keep governments in power, is also increasing in several countries. In this polarised context, a European approach is gradually emerging in which the economic and social potential of digitalisation should be utilised, while allowing individual rights to be protected to the greatest extent possible. Technological race and concentration of power There are indications that a technological race is under way, particularly in the area of Al.? Given that data is becoming a strategic resource, and thus a key commodity in the digital economy, it now occupies a pivotal role as data linkage can be used to produce faster and more precise forecasts. It therefore has the potential to change existing power struc tures. The increased concentration of data in the hands of a small number of countries or companies also gives rise to new political and economic dependencies. Having equal access to network infrastructures and network speed thus plays an important role in this (net neutrality). Speed of digital advance Digitalisation is proceeding at an exceptional pace like hardly any other process in human history. While it took radio 38 years and television 13 years to reach 50 million users, the internet took just four years. Smartphones have also had a major impact on the world in a single decade. Unlike before, technological achievements often become available all over the world at almost the same time. Developments in areas such as cloud computing, machine learning and automation are moving at a rapid pace: we can expect to see further, sometimes disruptive changes. Experts expect the Fourth Industrial Revolution to not merely surpass previous revolu- tions in terms of speed, but also in terms of scope and the impact it will have on economic, social and political systems. 9 See Switzerland in the World 2028: report from the ‘Switzerland's 2028 Foreign Policy Vision &' working group, 2 July 2019. The importance of private actors Given the commercial nature of the internet, the influence of the private sector has also increased. In many cases, for example, private companies not only provide technical components but also the telecommunication services themselves. The provision of some digital services has brought about a process of concentration. Large corporations based in the United States as well as their Asian competitors have assumed dominant positions and are establishing their own standards. Thanks to their general terms and conditions of use, they are able to influence the everyday lives of billions of users. Politicians in individual countries are barely able to keep up with these developments, which means the private sector, along with civil society and the technical and academic communities, must be involved in all governance issues and in shaping policy. Legal (un)certainty While regulation of the digital space is progressing in various countries and in some cases regionally, the international rules and standards for the digital space remain incomplete. While there are multilateral rules that were largely put in place before digitalisation and still in principle apply in the digital space, there is often uncertainty or disagreement regarding their concrete application, as they are frequently subject to interpretation with regard to specific facts. There are many parallel processes under way for which numerous actors have developed specific rules and standards. This means that there is an overlap between old and new instruments that vary in scope and in terms of the degree to which they are binding. This can result in legal uncertainty and discrimi- natory measures, stifling investment and innovation, and lead to ambiguities over who is responsible for what in the digital space. Powerful countries are asserting their positions ever more bilaterally, and in some cases unilaterally, and inter- national organisations are often not in a position to punish violations of international law. Conflicts of law and legal disputes between countries are likely to increase accordingly in the future. International environment 7 4 Fields of action Based on the environment described above and the afore- mentioned Swiss interests and values in the digital space, it is possible to envisage various fields of action for Switzerland's digital foreign policy. To implement them requires action on the part of all departments as well as increased interdepartmental cooperation. It is necessary to combine both technical and political considerations, minimise risks and take advantage of 4.1 Digital governance A global phenomenon such as digitalisation requires an international set of rules, comprising both legally binding and non-binding instruments. Legally binding instruments include international treaties and customary international law. Examples of non-binding instruments are soft law best practices, technical standards and benchmarks. Globally interconnected to a high degree and with limited power-political opportunities, Switzerland is dependent on international law. With regard to its external economic interests too, it relies on there being legal certainty and a level playing field in the digital space so as to allow free compe- tition to flourish.\"® At a global level, there is general agreement that the rules enshrined in international law also apply in the digital space, in the same way as for trade, the preservation of international security and the protection of human rights. This means that there is no need to completely overhaul the international set of rules: it is more a case of substantiating the existing standards, harmonising them with each other and continuing to develop them. International governance struc tures are essential in this regard so that all key stakeholders are involved in shaping the international set of rules and the cooperation mechanisms. The Federal Council is sceptical of any single all-encompassing and legally binding instrument to regulate the digital space, as is proposed in the postulate. Given the wider international context, it is unlikely that a binding international agreement on cybersecurity will materialise in the foreseeable future. Specif- ically, western nations fear that any new instrument under 10 Inthe area of international business and commercial law, Switzerland works in various forums to further develop the legal framework with regard to the challenges of digitalisation. See ‘Digitalisation and foreign trade’, featured topic of the Federal Council's 2019 Foreign Economic Policy Report, published 15 January 2020, SR 20.008 (executive summary and featured topic available in English). 8 Fields of action opportunities, build on existing strengths and pursue foreign policy initiatives as targeted priorities. As described in the Foreign Policy Strategy 2020-23, coherence will play a major part in this. The following fields of action form the centre of Switzerland's digital foreign policy for the current legislative period: international law could undermine the principle under which currently applicable international law applies in its entirety to the digital space. The idea of a Digital Geneva Convention has therefore yet to receive adequate support either from governments or from the scientific community, business or civil society. In developing the rules and standards, there are a number of challenges. In recent years, a polarisation has become increasingly noticeable within the international community: there are clear differences of opinion between countries that advocate a centralised, state-driven understanding of the digital soace and those in favour of a decentralised model. At the same time, many of the issues are being discussed in different forums, meaning they are addressed in thematic silos. With many newly identified issues where there is potential to adopt a position, for example Al, numerous ad hoc processes have been started to develop rules which are not aligned. There are also questions over the legitimacy of some of these processes as well as a high risk that rules may contradict each other.\" Stakeholders are able to cherry-pick the processes and solutions that benefit them the most (‘forum shopping’), which exacerbates this trend towards fragmentation. For Switzerland, it is important that there are processes and structures in place that enable as many countries as possible to make a substantial contribution in this area. This is a fundamental requirement for finding a fair and legitimate solution that is accepted over the long term. 11. In 2020, the UN identified approximately 160 different ethical Al policies in organisations and in countries around the world Thematic areas 1. Moderate regulation Wherever possible, new rules should not be created, but instead existing rules should be applied to the digital space. Only in cases when gaps are identified in existing inter- national rules should Switzerland support the creation of supplementary or additional rules. This prevents an issue being unnecessarily regulated or over-regulated and also ensures that existing international law is not undermined. A standard applies for as long as it remains in force and is not otherwise amended or supplemented. Switzerland is involved in these processes as a constructive force in order to uphold the practical application of existing standards under international law. It follows the principle of techno- logical neutrality, focusing on regulating the conduct of the various actors and not the technology itself. Switzerland is in favour of a moderate approach which promotes and does not stifle the potential of new technologies, while at the same time counteracting specific risks. . Capacity-building Switzerland supports capacity-building in developing countries in the areas of digital technologies and cyber- security. So that countries are able to implement the standards and rules that are developed and their citizens and foreign nationals residing on their territory are able to benefit from the advantages that digitalisation brings, they must have the necessary capacities, which include both the ability to develop strategies and policies as well as specific technical expertise. In this regard Switzerland works closely with multilateral partners such as the devel- opment banks. 3. International Geneva In line with its Foreign Policy Strategy 2020-23, the Federal Council aims to position Switzerland and specif- ically International Geneva as a leading centre for debate on digitalisation and technology. It is working to attract institutional pillars of any future digital governance archi- tecture to Geneva and to strengthen existing institutions, such as the Secretariat of the UN Internet Governance Forum (IGF). With CERN, International Geneva played a major role in initiating the development of the internet. The Geneva Internet Platform (GIP) provides various actors with a key platform to expand their expertise in digital issues and thus promote targeted political dialogue on the subject. The aim is to further strengthen the GIP’s position in implementing the UN secretary-general’s roadmap. A multi-stakeholder approach should be followed so that the scientific community, business, civil society and technical experts are involved in the digital governance process alongside governments. International Geneva has already launched ‘ecosystems’ involving a number of actors covering various issues and is well positioned in this regard. The aim is to further build on this advantage.’ . Science diplomacy It is becoming ever more important for regulatory bodies and developers of technology to exchange information. Particularly in international governance forums, the latter are still insufficiently represented by reason of historical processes and structures. In establishing the Geneva Science and Diplomacy Anticipator (GESDA), the Federal Council is specifically promoting a dialogue between scientific and diplomatic experts on the social challenges posed by new technologies, in particular in the area of digitalisation. The FDFA also supports initiatives such as the Geneva Science-Policy Interface (GSPI), which is headquar- tered in Geneva and promotes cooperation between the city’s universities and international actors. 12 See Annex 5. 4.2 Prosperity and sustainable development Digitalisation opens up new opportunities particularly for export-oriented, resource-poor countries, which are therefore dependent on innovation, such as Switzerland. The aim is for Switzerland to be one of the most competitive business and research locations in the world. As a highly developed and globally integrated economy, Switzerland can also benefit from the opportunities that digitalisation opens up in foreign markets as well as access to high-quality digital services. Digitalisation is increasingly shaping global supply chains, in which the Swiss economy is highly integrated. Harmonised international rules, for example on cross-border data flows, play a key role in ensuring that these supply chains operate smoothly and that goods and services are traded with as little discrimination as possible. It is equally important that personal data and intellectual property are properly protected and that companies and infrastructures are protected against cyberattacks and industrial espionage. Ultimately the aim is to achieve standards in the areas of data protection and security that are as globally effective as possible. Regional approaches to the regulation of the digital space, in particular at a European level, also play a significant role for Switzerland, which has an interest in ensuring that divergent standards do not create barriers to trade. Alongside data flows, access to big data is becoming increasingly relevant for research and innovation. It is therefore essential to put in place trans- parent structures for the use and forwarding of data to enable the development of innovative applications and increase added value. Being able to rapidly exchange information and data facilitates scientific, economic and social innovations, which can be applied in various areas. This makes a key contribution to the universal implementation of the 2030 Agenda and helps make it possible to measure progress towards achieving the Sustainable Devel- opment Goals. To realise the 2030 Agenda, it is also necessary to have a broad-functioning digital network which provides access to as many users as possible as well as equal access to data as a key commodity for digital innovation. Cross-border data traffic should be as unfettered as possible. Digitalisation has the potential to bring about fundamental economic and social change, which led to it being defined as one of the priorities in the IC Strategy 2021-24. Digital technology is relevant to development in two respects: Firstly, digital tools are used as part of the IC projects and programmes to better achieve the development goals more efficiently and quickly. Digital data and applications are driving development-related and humanitarian innovation across the globe. This focuses on the benefits for people and their needs in order to achieve the goals set out in the IC Strategy 2021-24 and the 2030 Agenda. The FDFA’s commitment to exploiting the full potential of new technologies in combating poverty is brought together in its Tech4Good approach. 10 Fields of action Secondly, it relates to the digital transformation of partner countries so that they can make use of digitalisation in their economies, societies and administrations for the benefit of their entire resident population. There are various challenges in this regard: for example, digitalisation can result in disruptive technological leaps, which above all increase the probability of automation of routine tasks, posing a threat to jobs in those areas. At the same time, however, such changes can lead to new employment opportunities. Factors such as a lack of access to the internet, information and technologies, high costs or inadequate skills to make use of the possible applications prevent many people in developing countries from successfully using these technologies. According to the UN, only 19% of people in the least developed countries currently have access to the internet (in developed countries, this figure is 87%).'? The main obstacle in this regard is still the high cost of mobile and telecommunications, which is why the UN is calling for increased cooperation with investors. As part of the IC strategy, it is ultimately necessary to improve people's skills in these locations so they can make use of the applications related to development. Unequal access to the internet also carries a risk that social and economic inequality will grow further, both within and between countries (the digital divide) — which will impede development potential. A gender gap is emerging particularly in the least developed countries but also in middle-income nations: compared to men, 43% fewer women in the least developed countries have access to the internet.'4 Switzerland is working with the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the OECD and the regional development banks to ensure that full use is made of the opportunities offered by new technologies. Switzerland benefits from exchanging knowledge with these organisations on digitalisation. In addition to potential in the development sector, techno- logical progress has always had a significant impact on the environment. The same is true for digitalisation. Although there are risks associated with increased resource or energy consumption, digitalisation also offers new possibilities for environmental monitoring, resource distribution and sustainable shaping of the economy. 13. UN secretary-general’s roadmap, p. 6. 14 UN secretary-general’s roadmap, p. 11., and OHCHR HRBDT Submission Thematic areas 1. Cross-border data flows and digital trade The way the digital economy is regulated is changing rapidly and unevenly across the world, at national and regional levels. It is therefore of paramount importance to develop common minimum standards that provide as level a playing tield as possible for all market participants. Switzerland is therefore committed to the negotiations that began in May 2019 on a plurilateral initiative to clarify and supplement WTO rules governing digital trade. The objective of the negotiations is to promote digital trade by avoiding unnec essary barriers to trade and unjustified protectionism, while at the same time developing common basic principles for domestic regulation. Within the framework of the Council of Europe, Switzerland has also actively promoted the modernisation of its data protection convention. . Reliable data spaces Switzerland depends on being able to access high-quality data in order to develop innovative applications and build its reputation as a place to carry out research. At present, much of this data is in the hands of a limited number of actors, which hampers innovation and free competition. Switzerland is therefore committed to creating reliable, decentralised data spaces at the international level. The aim is to help shape innovative models for the data economy, generate high-quality data and data spaces, and to make these accessible to Swiss actors (see also the section on digital self-determination). . Fintech Digital financial technology and currencies hold great potential for Switzerland as a financial centre and business location. They are becoming more important not only with respect to international cooperation. They contribute to the competitiveness of the Swiss financial centre and strengthen its role in the global economy. They can also be used to attract larger sections of the population into the banking system, helping to reduce the informal sector. In future, for example, cost-effective services based on blockchain or distributed ledger technology could be offered that allow economic migrants to transfer money more easily back to their families in their home countries. Innovative financial technologies and services also provide SMEs with easier access to finance. Moreover, new financing models can actually strengthen the competitiveness of SMEs and start- ups. With its expertise in this area, Switzerland is working to exploit the full potential of such applications while keeping risks to a minimum. Taxation of the digital economy is ultimately an important focus area for the OECD, and Switzerland plays an active part in its work in this regard, aiming to ensure that, as a rule, taxation continues to take place where the value added is generated. 4. Use of innovative technologies for sustainable development/Tech4Good Switzerland makes use of digital applications to promote prosperity and sustainable development, and in the area of sustainable finance, it is strengthening its position as a leading location in the use of digital technologies. There are significant application possibilities in the field of interna- tional cooperation: Fintech solutions can allow smallholder farmers in remote areas, for example, to transfer money using their mobile phones, while digital applications can also increase political participation and make public admin- istration more efficient, transparent and user-friendly. In developing countries, SMEs can be better integrated into international value chains and trading systems thanks to digitalisation processes. Data from satellites or drones can be used to forecast natural disasters more precisely and improve the calculations underlying crop insurance. In the area of peacebuilding, big data analysis can help identify conflict situations at an early stage, while digitali- sation enables humanitarian aid providers to save lives and reduce suffering more quickly and efficiently. During crises, people’s needs can be identified and responded to more quickly and precisely. Moreover, digital technologies can make it easier to search for missing persons. Switzerland intends to further raise its profile by facilitating the creation of secure, reliable data storage and through the Humani- tarian Data and Trust Initiative aimed at data responsibility in humanitarian action. . Availability and compatibility of data Switzerland is committed to closer cooperation between the private and public sectors in order to standardise data sets and interfaces and make data more usable. It also promotes the reliability, compatibility and comparability of data. Precise and timely information is essential in shaping effective, fact-based international policy across all areas, such as peace and security, sustainable development and humanitarian aid. 4.3 Cybersecurity Cyberespionage, attacks on critical infrastructure, digital crime, disinformation and propaganda are on the rise, with cyberattacks having caused more than USD 45 billion of damage worldwide in 2018.'\"° The increased dependency of society, businesses and individuals on digital technology makes us more vulnerable to these attacks. This means an additional security risk for Switzerland, its citizens, its insti- tutions and the services they provide as well as companies and organisations based here. This vulnerability also reduces people’s trust in these networks. States are increasingly trying to impose rights of control over what was actually intended to be a global network, which limits its openness and reduces trust in it. The digital space is increasingly becoming a field for military operations, with its globally connected nature, the complexity and anonymity of the internet, and the constant increase in the number of users also raising the risk of criminal activ- ities. Highly innovative countries such as Switzerland are disproportionately affected by these risks as well as industrial espionage. An increase in intelligence-related cyberactivities ultimately leads to the risk of political processes being influ- enced. The potential for these attacks alone can undermine general trust in networks and, consequently, in the political and economic structures of a country. These trends are accentuated in light of increasing geopolitical tensions. 15 Cyber Incident & Breach Trends Report 20184 12 Fields of action For countries such as Switzerland, it is not an option to close themselves off from the global network, simply for reasons of size and competitiveness. This means that cybersecurity concerns Switzerland in two respects: firstly, to guarantee the physical and data security of its citizens — both in Switzerland and abroad — its institutions, companies and organisations; and secondly, to safeguard and provide access to an internet that is as open, free and secure as possible. The National strategy for the protection of Switzerland against cyber risks for 2018-22 contains measures for prevention, for coping with incidents, for improving resilience to cyber risks and for strengthening international cooperation. Thematic areas 1. Specification of standards under international law Switzerland intends to step up its cybersecurity and specify standards under international law. In 2015, the UN GGE developed eleven voluntary norms of responsible state behaviour in the digital space, which supplement existing international law. Switzerland is in favour of international law being fully recognised, observed and enforced in the digital space. It is making clarifications regarding the specific application of the rules at a national level and in cooperation with other states. International humanitarian law will also continue to apply. With its humanitarian tradition, Switzerland is well positioned to make a credible contribution towards the specification of the applicable rules in the digital space. This includes seeking to work more closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on the protection of civilians in the digital space during armed conflicts. . Inclusion of private actors At a global level, there is no consensus on mandatory standards of conduct in the digital space, which is detrimental to cybersecurity. States cannot guarantee the security, freedom and stability of the digital space on their own; private-sector actors play a prominent role in this regard with their products and _ services. Switzerland is therefore in favour of a multi-stakeholder approach. At the start of 2018, it launched the Geneva Dialogue on Responsible Behaviour in Cyberspace and is now working on building a broadly diversified dialogue between companies around the world. The aim of this is to establish best practices in the area of product resilience, for example. In doing so, Switzerland is filling a void as there was previously no global dialogue on this subject. 3. Confidence-building measures Confidence-building measures help promote transparency and cooperation between states so as to avoid any potential misunderstandings or escalations in the digital space. One example of this is the exchange of information concerning forthcoming or current cyber-operations. Thanks to its neutrality and its history as a location for peace talks, Switzerland is able to play a key role in imple- menting confidence-building measures in the digital space. To facilitate the implementation of the current measures, it can draw on experiences gained at a regional level, for example within the Organization for Security and Co-op- eration in Europe (OSCE). The list of measures developed by the OSCE, to which Switzerland made a significant contribution, was approved by all 57 participating states. . Good offices There are many opportunities for Switzerland in the area of good offices. As Switzerland is not a member of the EU or NATO, it is able to bring its experience and credibility from the offline world into the online world. It must strengthen or build up the competencies required for this purpose. International Geneva plays a key role in this regard. Given the increasing trend towards bloc-building and digital geopolitics, there is a need for mediators who are able to build confidence and put in place a framework of trust for discussing cybersecurity. In terms of peacebuilding, Switzerland promotes the development and responsible use of digital technologies (‘peacetech’). %, 4 s = y ay ay 8 x ms pS, ae x 8 ¢ es os 2 SB gee abs os 8 ers ea Pak ee ery Eo, ee ee ai £6 PF PICTPP SQ, Gnrrn SI OATAa rryys I Ao SS Baa RAR aka bb Wek AE SS Bd 4 ats = eS Pp e 5, Digitalisation is changing the way our societies interact: whether banking transactions, mobility, shopping, education, sport or social contact, digital applications have become an integral part of peopie’s everyday lives. Alongside the positive benefits that this change brings, more and more personal cata is being collected, which is used in a variety of ways. It is often not clear exactly what happens to this data, and communities and society benefit little from the insights and econamic value that this cata could provide. Human rights are equally valid in both the physica! and digital worlds: they apply without Geographical restrictions both ontine and offfine. Specifically, they protect people’s privacy and freedom of expression. These individual rights therefore also include the protectian of individuals against the misuse of digital data. They ensure free communication in the digital Space and quarantee the right to freely form opinions in the run-up to elections anc votes, for example. The use of digital technologies accentuates the differences in values between states with different requiatory traditions. Authoritarian trends are on the rise in many areas of the world, with governments making increased use of digital tools to restrict fundamental individual freecioms. This may include the widespread use of facial recognition for surveillance purposes or to control the behaviour of a population. In turn, other systems operate in a barely regulated environment, which enables private companies to collect, analyse or sell personal user data without any restrictions. Given the increasingly competitive marketplace, these companies have a limited interest in informing users - regarcless of their nationality or the region they live in — about how thelr data is used, and can make it difficult or impossible for them ta have any contro! over It. Fhere is an increasing risk that the data collected is being misused or misinterpreted without their knowledge. 14 Fields of action br ow ne . q tr en t % o Y o w s o n e ? z a I r o n s cd *s, % ed po et a, re g o s ws , The Federal Council sets out the priorities of its agenda for the 2019-23 legislative period in three guiding princi- ples and 18 objectives. > For the first time, the topic of digitalisation was included in one of the guiding principles: “Switzerland will secure its sustained prosperity and utilise the opportunities of digitalisation.” > The topic of digitalisation is also incorporated in four ob- jectives: e Objective 2: “The federal government will perform its state activities efficiently and digitally where possible.” e Objective 3: “Switzerland will ensure optimal and stable economic conditions that encourage innovation in the digital age, and will support the domestic workTorce.” e Objective 5: “Switzerland will remain at the forefront of education, research and innovation and will utilise the opportunities of digitalisation.” e Objective 18: “The federal government will counter cyber risks, and support and implement measures to protect citizens and critical infrastructures.” > The topic of digitalisation has thus been upgraded in relation to the legislative programme for 2015-19. The Swiss parliament added an additional objective to the 16 objectives for the legislative period: “Switzerland will en- sure favourable conditions so that digitalisation can help safeguard and increase prosperity.” 22 Annex 3: Conceptual basis Digital Switzerland strategy of 11 September 2020 (link &) > Switzerland's strategic goals for the digital space have been regularly updated — and adapted to reflect increas- ing digitalisation — since the first Federal Council strategy for an information society back in 1998. > The current Federal Council Digital Switzerland strategy of September 2020 sets out the federal government's principles and key objectives of its national and interna- tional commitment. The principles are: e To put people at the centre e To provide room for development e To facilitate structural change e To create networked transformation processes The key objectives are: ¢ To enable equal participation of all and strengthen solidarity e To ensure security, trust and transparency e To further strengthen people’s digital empowerment and self-determination e To ensure added value, growth and prosperity e To reduce the environmental footprint and energy con- sumption ‘International engagement’ is one of nine fields of action. The Federal Council states that in a thematic follow-up strategy to the FPS 2020-23 it will explain the concept of digital foreign policy, specify the corresponding FPS guidelines and define the individual foreign policy fields of action. Foreign Policy Strategy 2020-23 of 29 January 2020 (link &) > In accordance with the legislative programme, the Federal Council defined digitalisation as one of four thematic focus areas of Swiss foreign policy: “Switzerland will raise its profile in global efforts to con- solidate digital governance. It will further develop its digital foreign policy and position Geneva as a leading location for debate on digitalisation and technology. In its digital foreign policy, it advocates the inclusion of all relevant stakeholders. It will contribute to finding new solutions and pursue the goal of an open and secure dig- ital soace which is based on international law and which revolves around people and their needs.” > On this point, it set out five objectives: e Objective 1: “Switzerland will bring together actors from all stakeholder groups to clarify responsibilities in the digital space and to develop new governance models. It will play a key role as a bridge-builder in the implementa- tion of the recommendations of the UN Secretary-Gen- eral’s High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation.” e Objective 2: “Switzerland will advocate appropriate framework conditions in a global digitalisation and data policy that promote access to and use of data for social and economic development. Democratic self-determina- tion, the rule of law and respect for human rights must continue to be guaranteed. For this purpose, Switzerland will establish an international network to promote digital self-determination. It will further develop its cooperation with the EU and utilise the opportunities of a common European data space and a digital single market.” Objective 3: “Switzerland will promote the role of Ge- neva as a hub for global digital and technology policy. It will strengthen existing forums, such as the Geneva In- ternet Platform, the GESDA foundation and the Geneva Dialogue. It will also step up cooperation with research institutes in other cantons.” e Objective 4: “Switzerland will enhance its digital di- plomacy profile. It will support international confi- dence-building to minimise risks. The principle of ‘law before power’ also applies in the virtual world, which is why Switzerland is supporting initiatives to clarify the application of intertional law in cyberspace.” e Objective 5: “Switzerland will support developing coun- tries in the use of new technologies and in handling the associated risks. It is committed to reducing the negative environmental impacts of commodities extraction and will promote the use of new technologies to prevent hu- manitarian crises. It will create the necessary vehicles to promote humanitarian innovation at all levels. In collabo- ration with selected partners such as the ICRC, it will de- velop a framework to protect digital humanitarian data.” National strategy of 18 April 2018 for the protection of Switzerland against cyber risks (NCS) for the period 2018-22 (link 4) > The strategy builds on the first NCS (2012-17) and supple- ments it with new measures so that it reflects the current threat level. It was drawn up in collaboration with busi- nesses, cantonal authorities and universities and forms the basis of the collective efforts needed to reduce cyber risks. > The NCS states that Switzerland is committed to interna- tional cooperation to increase cybersecurity, promoting dialogue on cybersecurity policy, participating actively in international expert bodies,and cultivating exchange with other states and international organisations to optimally safeguard Swiss interests. > Three measures are set out in the sphere of action ‘Active positioning of Switzerland in international cybersecurity policy’: e Measure 1: “Active shaping of and participation in processes of foreign cybersecurity policy.” e Measure 2: “International cooperation to build and expand cybersecurity capacities.” e Measure 3: “Bilateral political consultations and multilat- eral dialogues on foreign cybersecurity policy.” ‘Digitalisation and foreign trade’, featured topic of the Federal Council’s 2019 Foreign Economic Policy Report, published 15 January 2020 (link 4) > The Federal Council highlights the effects of digitalisation on the international economy, in particular on cross-border value chains, as well as the pressure placed on the global trading system to adapt. > Furthermore, the Federal Council sets out the fields of ac tion in foreign economic policy and trade diplomacy at the multilateral and bilateral levels, and underscores the impor- tance of regulatory interoperability with important trading partners. > For the Federal Council, the overriding goal is to exploit the potential of increased productivity in the digital age as an important driver of economic growth and to ensure the highest possible labour force participation and high-quality jobs.

(link &) Annex 3: Conceptual basis Annex 4: International rules and standards The existing international rules and standards for the digital space International rules and standards for the digital space already exist. They comprise various instruments, many of which were established before digitalisation. Others have been developed more recently specifically for issues related to the digital space. They can be split into five levels: > Atthe highest level are the provisions of general inter- national law. These include customary international law (e.g. the rules on state jurisdiction such as the territorial principle). They also include the major multilateral treaties (e.g. the UN charter, WTO agreements on trade in goods and services, human rights treaties or — in the case of armed conflicts — international humanitarian law). Finally, they also include general legal principles (e.g. good faith). All these general provisions of international law also apply in the digital space. > In addition to these general provisions, there are also numerous specific international agreements. On the one hand there are a large number of treaties and agree- ments which were drawn up before digitalisation, but which are relevant to the digital space. Bilateral mutual legal assistance treaties are one example. Among other things, they regulate the conditions and procedures by which Swiss prosecution authorities can access evidence obtained abroad. In principle, this also applies to digital data. On the other hand, there are agreements which deal with a specific aspect of the digital space. One ex- ample is Convention 108 of the Council of Europe for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Pro- cessing of Personal Data. > Decrees adopted by states and organisations can also have international significance in the digital space, e.g. the US CLOUD Act and the EU’s General Data Protec tion Regulation. While they are not applicable de jure for States like Switzerland, they may have de facto relevance. > Soft law instruments also already exist, mainly estab- lished for issues specifically relating to the digital space. One example are the reports of the UN Governmental Group of Experts, which adopted a set of non-legal- ly-binding guidelines to promote responsible state behav- iour in the digital space. > In terms of best practices, benchmarking and tech- nical standards, there are many instruments that gen- erally contain specific legally non-binding regulations for the digital space. One example would be ISO standards, which set standards for the necessary digital infrastruc ture. This five-level body of international rules and standards for the digital space can be illustrated as follows: General international law Specific international agreements in a given area Decrees adopted by states or organisations with de facto international relevance Soft law Best practices, benchmarking, technical standards Challenges in the application of these rules and standards There are three key challenges in the application of the existing international rules and standards: > The first challenge is the application of international law provisions that were established before dig- italisation to the digital space. This applies to both general provisions and to specific agreements. For exam- ple, there are no clear territorial boundaries in the digital space. Application of the territorial principle is therefore a challenge, as several territories may be affected by a behaviour in the digital soace and various states could thus claim regulatory authority. At the same time, it must be possible to separate state competences in the digital space. In the context of mutual legal assistance treaties, it is often unclear whether the location where the data is stored is relevant, or the location where the technology company holding the data is incorporated. The custom- ary contractually-agreed points of contact and processes for accessing evidence obtained abroad may face limita- tions in this respect. Clarification is thus often needed regarding how the provisions of customary international law should be applied under the special conditions of the digital space. Annex 4: International rules and standards 25 29 The second challenge is that it is not only states that are present in the digital space, but aso numerous new players, which means that large parts of the in- frastructure of the digital space are operated by private companies. This raises questions about precisely which provisions of the international bady of rules - which was largely established for states ~ these actors are subject to, and where they themselves can help shape these rules and standards. The third challenge fies in linking up the various levels of the international body of rules so they contain coherent and predictable requiations for all actors. This particularly apolies to the linking of technical standards to legal requirements: if legal requirements cannot be imple- mented in the digital space owing to contrary technical Standards, these requirements are simply empty words. This is therefore also about implementing the internation- al rules and standards. Annex 4: International rules and standards Important ongoing processes to clarify and further develop the international rules and standards Given the stated challenges in implementing the international rules and standards, they need to be clarified and developed by sub-area. This should bring greater iegal certainty for all parties. Such clarification and development processes apply to all levels of the international body of rules. Key examples of ongoing processes to clarity and develop the international rules and standards are: 3% WTO e-commerce negotiations: 82 WTO member States nave been conclucting pluriateral talks since 2019 with a view to developing specific e-commerce requia- tions, > CECB/G26 project on taxation of the digital econo- my: in 2019, the OECD publisned a work prograrame on the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy. The guidelines are designed to apply to the en- tire digital econory. > Open-ended Working Group (OEWG) 2019-20/UN Group of Governmental Experts (UN-GGE} 2019-21: Both UN working groups are looking at current develap- ments in the field of cyoersecurity. Part of the UN-GGE rnandate is to develop national positions on international law for the final report in 2021. % Development of an international convention on cy- bercrime: The UN General Assembly has planned nego- tiations with the goal of developing an international con- vention on cybercrime. The preliminary work commenced surnmer 2020. % Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons {CCW}: Group of Governmental Experts on Lethal Au- tonomous Weapons Systems. in light of technological developments and the use of Al tor military purposes, for a number of years the CCW has been acdressing legal, poliical, military, technical and ethical issues, as weil as the need for regulations with regard to the use of force oy (partially} autonomous weapon systems in armed con- flicts. ~> Council of Europe Ad-hoc Committee on Artificial intelligence: The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe decided to set up an intergovernmental expert committee to review the feasibility of 2 legal framework for the development, cesign and application of artificial intelligence based on human rights, democracy and the rule of law. Below is an extract of key actors, forums and processes in the telds outlined in the strategy. Covernance Global forums and processes UN World Summit on the Information Society / WSIS process Fhe UN World Summit on the information Society (WSIS) was held in two phases, in 2003 in Geneva and in 2005 in Tunis, during which the international community was able to agree on an initial comprehensive UN vision for dealing with digital technology. Switzerland played a key role in shaping both WSIS meetings and helped to promote acceptance with respect to the involvement of business, science and civil society in digital governance. The UN Working Group on Internet Governance (2004-05), whose secretariat was headed by a Swiss national, was likewise instrumental in this respect. The WSIS follow-up process is primarily supported by the annual WSIS Forum in Geneva (organised by the Inter- national Telecommunication Union (ITU), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and supported by Switzerland) as well as the United Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Devel- opment (UN CSTD), in which Switzerland will have a seat until 2024. Evaluations of the WSIS outcomes are conducted on a periodic basis, with the most recent having taken place in 2015 (WS1S+10) anc the next planned for 2025 (WS1S420). UN Internet Governance Forum / IGF (secretariat in Geneva} The annual IGF is the most important outcome of the WSIS oracess. if is open to all interested parties and is now the world’s largest global muiti-stakencider dialogue platform on issues relating to digitalisation, ranging frorn technical, economic and regulatory topics to subjects such as cyberse- curity, the handling of social and traditional media, human rights and development aspects. The IGF secretariat is based in Geneva and the preparatory meetings for the annual IGF are also held in Geneva. The IGF itself is held on an annual basis at different locations around the world. switzerland has helped in shaping the oottorn-up structure of the IGF anc played a key role in the successful launch of the IGF with its initial funding. After the IGF fell inta a state of crisis from 2015, suffering a decline in terms of both rnarnmentum and importance, Switzerland stepped in as host country in 2017 and contributed ta the IGF’s revitalisation. The IGF is now well positioned once more. Over the years, the number of participants has increased from around 7,000 initially to almost 5,000 (IGF Berlin 2019}. The IGF mandate has to be extended within the context of the WSIS evalua- tions. Since the first IGF, which took place in Athens in 2006, a number of national and regional IGF structures, now totalling more than 100, nave spontaneously been established. The largest initiative after the giobal 1GF is the European Dialogue on internet Governance (EuroDlG), which was launched in 2008 with the involvernent of Switzerland. Since 2015, switzerland nas also been home to the Swiss 1GF, which is coordinated by the Federal Office of Communications (OFCOM). Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes 27 High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation and UN secretary-general’s roadmap On the initistive of Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates and private stakeholders, the UN secretary-general launched the High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation (HLP} in 2018. The panel’s final report, which was presented in 2019, contains five recommendations for improving global digital cooperation, including the use of the digital transformatian for the achievament of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals 2030 Agenda}, consolidating existing efforts aimed at securing the digital snace anc further developing digital governance architecture, Switzerland anc International Geneva played a key role in the content of the work performed by the KLP. The panel was co-financed py Switzerland, the secretariat was jointly based in New York and Geneva and the director of the Geneva Internet Platform acted as co-head of the secretariat. One of the two official meetings of the HLP took place in Geneva. Former Federal Councillor Doris Leuthard was one of the panel’s 22 members and as head of the working group on the principles, functions and mechanisms of digital cooper- ation and governance she played a key role in shaping the corresponding recommendations. Fallowing the publication of the panel's report, a follow-up process lasting arounc one year was cornmenced, during which the recommendations were discussed further as part of roundtable discussions. Switzerland was involved in several of these. Based on the feedback from this consultation process, the UN secretary-general presented his Roadmap for Digital Cooperation at the start of June, outlining the next practical steps. Focus areas include improved access to the internet and public digital goods (data, open-source software, etc), greater capacity-bullding in developing countries, protection of human nghts, the strengthening of cybersecurity and the promotion of inclusive governance models. In his roadmap, the UN secretary-genera! also announced the appointment of a ‘tech envoy’ for 2021. 28 Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes European Union / EU Digitalisation is a key area of the EU Commission’s work programme. In its communication of 19 February 2020, the Carnamission set out its guidelines and objectives for Europe's digital future: (} @ digital stratecy that contains the key measures of the EU; (2) a data strategy that should ensure the free movement of data; (3) a White Paper on Artificial intelligence (Al) that aims to increase quality and trust in dealing with Ai. Accarding to this, the existing opportu- nities presented by digitalisation snould de better utilised in future in order to make the EU a leading global pravicier of corresponding technologies and services (keyword: strategic autonomy) as weil as a standard-setter. On the domestic front, the EU wishes to exploit the economic and social potential offered by digitalisation, thus allowing the single rnarket to generate greater growth and prosperity. The Commission has already comrnunicated that in future it also wants to make market access, both in the area of data and Al products, dependent on whether the legal basis with respect to data protection is considered equivalent to EU regulations. As a European country, Switzerland also follows a digitall- sation palicy that aims to allow for the economic and social potential of technologies to be tapped, while at the sarne time respecting individual rights to the greatest possible extent. For Switzerland, a strengthening of these values, aspecially at a muittateral level, would be important. Located at the heart of Europe, Geneva aims to be the leading global hub for the development of digital governance. World Economic Forum (Geneva) The World Economic Forum, which is based in Geneva, also deals with various topics related to digital governance. it brings together expertise from the realms of politics, business and civil society through publications, forums and oraject wark. The Forum also has an important role to play in putting issues on the global agenda. In the area of digitali- sation, arnong other things, it examines questions relating to internet access (e.g. Global information Technology Report), digital cormmerce, cybercrime, cybersecurity, the impact of digitalisation on society and the world of work as weil as support for states in developing Al strategies. in 2016, the Forum opened the Centre for the Fourth industrial Revolution in San Francisco, which is dedicated to promoting global dialogue about the impact of scientific and technological changes on society and the economy woridwide. In 2019, the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) concluded a mernorandum of understanding with the Forum, which also foresees greater cooperation in the area of digitalisation. The World Economic Forum Centre for Cybersecurity is an observer at the Geneva Dialogue on Responsible Behaviour in Cyberspace. Global support mechanisms Geneva Internet Platform / DiploFoundation (Geneva) The Geneva internet Platform (GIP) serves as a neutral infor- ration and discussion platform on all aspects of digita governance and organises briefings and capacity building courses. ft was launched in 2104 by the FDFA and OFCOM in cooperation with DiptoFoundation, an NGO set up by Malta and Switzerland. The Canton of Geneva is also involved in the Steering group. The GIP recarts on events, trends, findings and decisions in ail subject areas of digital Governance and organises reguiar briefings. It thus helps, in particular, small and developing countries in better understanding the opportunities anc challenges presented by digitalisation and becoming involved in the global debate. The GIP also plays an important rale as an instrument and platform for the strengthening of interdisciplinary cooperation between the Geneva-based stakeholders, such as the international organisations. The GIP and DiploFoundation also organise courses for employees of the Federal Administration. Within the context of the roadmap, there is the potential for the GIP to take on an enhanced role as a so-called “help desk”. Geneva Science and Diplomacy Anticipator / GESDA (Geneva} On 1 January 2020, the Geneva Science and Diplomacy Anticpator foundation, which was founded by the Federal Council and the City and Canton of Geneva, commenced its work. Its objective is to make use of scientific expertise in order to adcrass the opportunities and risks associated with technological progress at a political level. Its role is to create a common language anc common goals between stakeholders from a range of different backgrounds and to transform them into effective coalitions that bring together actors from the scientific and business communities and from civil society. GESDA is currently in its 36-rmonth pilot phase and is focusing on the development of an acadernic and a ciplomatic forum that should ensure mutual exchanges between the different subject areas. There is also an impact fund that is to be used to finance specific project activities. In this respect, GESDA is already currently sugporting the International Digital Health & Al Research Collaborative project, which is active in Al for health and is led by Amandeep Gill, former co-director of the High-level Pane! on Digital Cooperation. 4 Geneva-based centre for science diplomacy in the area of conflict modeling is also to be initiated together with ETH Zurich, the University of Geneva and international partners. Swiss Digital Initiative / SDI (Geneva) The SDI is a Geneva-based private foundation that aims to ancourage companies around the world to adopt ethical codes of conduct. It was launched on 2 September 2019 at the first Swiss Global Digital Summit in Geneva with the participation of major national and international companies. The SD! aims to bring about a voluntary commitment to ethical standards and conduct such as transparency, respan- sibility, non-discrimination and explanatory power, which are stil only partly institutionalised. To this enc, it also wants to develop instruments that make this voluntary cornmitmert measurable for users. The SDI is under the patronage of Federal Councillor Uell Maurer. The foundation is chaired by former Federal Councillor Daris Leuthard. Federal Chancellor Walter Thurnnerr is an ad personam member of the Foundation Board. Institutions of higher education and universities (Switzerland) Switzerland's institutions of higher education and universities olay an important role in contributing scientific and technical axpertise to different political processes. The federal institutes of technology are involved in different projects in Interna- tional Geneva, including coaperatian with !Os and the private sector as part of preparations for the World Data Forum. The Swiss Federal institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) also organises the Applied Machine Learning Days, which pravice important expertise for many Geneva-based stakeholders. At the University of Geneva and the Graduate Institute, issues relating to digital governance are an important part af aducation and research activities. The Graduate Institute aiso operates the platform for societal transformations, which deals with the social impact of new technologies. The Inter- national Digital Health & Al Research Collaborative (-DAIR} project is aiso based at the Graduate Institute. These are just some examples. BO ice ) Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes Prosperity and sustainable development Technical standardisation / communication logic International Telecommunication Union / ITU (Geneva} The International Telecommunication Union (TU) is a specialised agency of the United Nations responsible for issues relating to inforrnation and communication technal- ogies. With its three sectors (standards, radio communication and development), the [TU promotes the development and coordination of global technical standards, coordinates the joint use of the radio-frequency spectrum worldwide and works to improve the telecornmunications infrastructure in developing countries. As a member of the ITU Council, Switzeriand 3s involved in technical study groups, working groups on political issues related to the internet and the coordination of the European position within the ITU. Swiizeriand also supports a better understanding of the opportunities and risks presented by the internet of things, 5G mobile technology and artificial intelligence. The Standardisation Sector of the ITU (TU-T) is oarticu- larly important for the further develoornent of technical standards. For years, Switzerland has chaired ITU-T Study Group 13, which develoos standards for future mobile networks, including cloud computing. The ITU has recently been playing an increasingly significant international role in the field of Al. The Al for Good Global Surnmit, organised by the {TU Gogether with the UNDP and UNESCO} since 2017, brings together Ai experts from governments, industry and civ saciety each year in order to develop ideas for Al apolica- tions tor the achievernent of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. In 2079, Switzerland (FDFA and OFCOM) entered into a partnership with the ITU to further strengthen the summit. Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers / ICANN (office in Geneva) The orivate Californian institution ICANN is responsible for the global allocation of domain narnes anc IP ad¢lresses. ft was Originally under the supervision of the US government. Following two and a half years of intensive negotiations, the Cecision-making and accountability mechanisms, incuding the possibilities to exert influence, were reorganised. During this period, Switzerland chaired the ICANN Governmental Advisory Committee and therefore played a major role in ansuring that the governments were ultimately able to agree on a compromise for a new self-governance mode! acceptable to all. In arder to promote cantact with governments and international organisations, Switzerland supported ICANN tn opening an office in Geneva. 39 Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes CERN (Geneva) The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN} was established in 1954, has 23 members and operates the world’s jargest particle physics laboratory. its main function is to provide the infrastructures necessary far research. For this purpose, a large computer installation used to store and analyse data from experiments is located at the rain site in Meyrin. As the researchers require remote access to these tacitties, CERN has developed important digital applications in parallel to its own work that are now benefiting the general oublic, for example the World Wide Web (WWW), Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and the Hypertext Transter Protocol (HTTP). By addressing practical problems and thanks to its existing expertise, CERN plays an irnpoartant role in developments tn the fleld of data processing. With the devel- opment of the Large Hadron Collider, tor example, owing to the huge arnounts of data to be processed, a system that accesses free server capacities worldwide anc thus processes data on a decentralised basis was developed. This approach now underpins the widespread use of cloud computing. international Organization for Standardization / ISO (Geneva) iSO, which has existed since 1947 is an international stand- ards-setting body that comprises representatives from various national standards organisations. Many of the international standarcs and relatecl cocuments developed by ISO cover aspects that relate to information anc commu- nication technologies (CT) with a view to ensuring their quality, security anc reliability. These include, for example: information security, sensor networks, cloud computing services and devices, cloud cata management, virtua! orivate networks, future networks, unidue identification for the internet of things, digital signatures, health informatics and software management. United Nations Economic Commission for Europe / UNECE and UN CEFACT (Geneva) The UNECE is one of the five regional commissions that report to the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). it cornprises 56 member states (primarily from Europe) and aims to promote economic cooperation and integration between them. In the area of digitalisation, the UNECE's Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN CEFACT) has an important role to play as a foca! point for recommendations and standards for electronic commerce. It has a global rnembership with experts from governments, intergovernmental organisations and the private sector. CEFACT also performs a range of activities in the area of ICT for develanment. An example here is the development of a joint environmental information system throughout the UNECE region. in particular, the role played by the UNECE in the standardisation and interoperability of intelligent transport systems and autonomous vehicies should also be mentioned. This stems from the UNECE’s long-standing role as secretariat for multilateral agreements and conventions in the area of road transport fe.g. the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic). Internet Engineering Task Force / IETF The lETF is a US-based organisation that develops and promotes open arid voluntary internet standards, especially those that make up the internet Protocol. it plays an irmoortant role in the further development of the architecture tor the protecols and procedures usec by the internet. it has no formal membership list and instead comprises voluntary developers. However, their work Is generally financed by their employers or sponsors. The JETF began as an institution sponsored by the US gavernment but has been under the auspices of the Internet Society since 1993. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers / TREE Fhe IEEE is a US-based association of engineers who work together on the development of industry standards, including in connection with !C7T-relevant topics such as wireless communication. in addition to developing standards, the EEE also organises events and publishes scientific publications on various aspects of computer sciences, including security and data protection. European Telecommunications Standards Institute / ETSI The ETS! is a non-profit organisation set up at the initiative of the European Commission that develops standards for information and communication technologies. Some of the specific areas in which the ETS! develops standards include the following: broadband, cybersecurity, cloud computing, internet of things, transition to IPv6, next generation protocols and smart cities. In adcition to tts work on the deveicoment of standards, the institute has also published white papers. International Electrotechnical commission / TEC (Geneva} The IEC is an international standardisation organisation that develops and publishes stancarcs for ail electrical, electronic and related technologies - electrical engineering. Several technical cornmittees deal with the internet of things (oT), including, for example: standardisation in the fields of sensor networks, portable technologies, smart cites and smart grids. Atongside the development of standards, the IEC has also oublished white papers, roadmaps containing recommenda- tions and other resources relating to loT-related topics. The IEC is headed by Philipp Metzger, former director of OFCOM. European Computer Manufacturers’ Association / ECMA (Geneva} Eoma iS a standardisation organisation for information and communication systems. It was founded in 19617 with the objective of standardising computer systems in| Europe. Mernabership is open to companies around the world that oraduce, market or develop computer or cornmunication systems. Facebook, Google and Microsoft, among others, are members of Ecma. EPFL and ETH Zurich are not-for-protit members, Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes 31 Cross-border data flows World Trade Organization / WTO (Geneva) The WTO is an intergovernmental organisation that provides a central legal and institutional framework for establishing and maintaining global rules for digital trade over the longer term. The most important agreements are the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which deals with trace in qaods, the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Within this frarnework, the WTO deals with various issues relating to internet governance and digital policy, including e-coramerce, arbitration, the liberalisation of telecommunications markets and trade in telecommunications services. Its basic principles of non-discrimination (most-fa- voured nation and national treatment) and transparency aiso apply to the digitalisecl economy. The WTO dispute settlement bodies have already examined issues relating to trade in digital services in light of WTO Jegislation and issued binding judgements. Nevertheless, numerous questions regarding the application of existing rules to digital barriers to trade remain open or disputed, especially owing to the often political nature of the national rules behind them. Since May 2019, 82 WTO members have therefore been negotiating clarfications and additions to the WTO rules on digital trade as part of a pluri- lateral initiative. The objective of the negotiations is to pramote digital trade by avoiding unnecessary barriers to trade and unjustified protectionisms, while at the sarne tire developing common basic principles for domestic requlation (e.g. locall- sation). The starting point is formed by the existing standards in bilateral and regional free trade agreements. Switzerland is actively participating in the negotiations. The negotiating group, which represents around 90% of worid trade, has the potential to establish rules with a Global impact. Oxganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development / GECD The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Devel- opment (OECD) is made up of 36 member states. its work focuses on improving market-based policies, which should comtripute to the general well-being of the population. it promotes agreements between the members states, including guidelines and standards, and encourages policy discussions with its scientific publications (outlooks, annual overviews and commarative statistics). As part of the OECD’s Going Digital Initiative, cross-thematic Knowledge on the digital transfor- mation is to be developed. This includes the analysis of issues related to digital trade, including the significance of market openness in the digital age, the impact of the regulation of cross-border data transmission and how diaital security can be enhanced in line with market principles. In a first step, this work can lead to precursors for common recommendations (best practices) and prornote a coherent and comprehensive policy approach for the digital transformation. The standards can, for example, be incorporated in the negotiations within the WTO or free trade agreements. 32 Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes The OECD also plays an important role in the area of AY in autumn 2078, it set up a group of experts in which Switzerland was represented. The group developed a Council Recommendation that contains five general principles for the responsible use of Alas well as five specific recommendations for governments. The OECD Council Recammendation was adopted by the OECD member states (inciuding Switzerland} and a mumber of other countries in spring 2019. The OECD is also in the process of establishing an Al Policy Observatory, which is likewise supported by Switzerland. European Free Trade Association / EFTA (Geneva} in the past, Switzerland has negotiated various texts on e-commerce within the context of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and bilaterally as part of free trade agreements. The most recent text dates from 2017 and was concluded between the EFTA states and Turkey. In the course of 2079, the EFTA member states decided to commence work on a new EFTA model text on e-commerce for future tree trade negotiations. A draft has therefore been drawn up on the basis of known text elements at several working group meetings. While this craft has not yet been completed, it already contains the key elernents trom the paint of view of the EFTA memiber states and should be finalised in 2020. The EFTA e-commerce model text will contain numerous new elements that are now standard for e-commerce texts in trade agreements, including provisions on cross-border data flows anc the disclosure of source codes, for example. Access, applications and sustainable development World Bank The World Bank is an international financial institution that issues loans and grants to the governments of poorer countries in order to pursue capital projects. Switzerland joined the World Bank in 1992. The World Bank’s work programrne in the ICT sector focuses on cybersecurity, the expansion of access to fast, affordable internet and the development of reliable online platforms that encourace improved service provision anc good governance. For example, Switzerland Is supporting the Warld Bank's Govlech partnership programme to promote the use of new technologies in the public sector. Ht aims ta improve the transparency, accountability and efficiency of public administrations and thus to contribute to better public services and the combating of corruption. SMEs, in particular, benefit from the digitalisation of public services. The digitahsation of the custorns system promotes trade, while technological applications contrioute to simplifying the foundation of new companies anc market access. United Nations Development Programme / UNDP The UNDP is a UN agency that works to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality. The UNDP also supports ICT devel- opment activities and helps the UN member states in creating a favourable environment for economic and social growth through the use of ICT. The UNDP is one of the UN specialised agencies that was appointed as part of the WSIS process to pursue specific WSIS lines of action in the areas of capacity-ouilding and e-government as well as to create a favourable environment. For Switzerland, the UNDP is a partner within the framework of the Core Government Functions programme (promotion of @-governance as a means of achieving better governance) as well as the fintech Cialoque programme. United Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Development / UN CSTD (Geneva) The UN CSTD is a subsiciary body of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). The CSTD was established by the UN General Assernbly in 1993 in order to examine specific science and technology issues for devel- opment: ranging from access to technologies to their appil- cations (e.g. health, clirnate change, more inclusive financial systems, smart cities). Following the WSIS meeting, the CSTD has been supporting progress in the implementation of the orocess at a regional and international level and is preparing corresponding draft resolutions for ECOSOC. The UNCTAD secretariat in Geneva provides substantive support to the CSTD. The CSTD comprises 43 members (each elected for four years) and meets annually. Switzerland has been an active member since 2006 and is currently elected until 2024. Broadband Commission (Geneva} The Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development was established in 2010 as a joint initiative of the ITU and UNESCO in order to promote internet access (especially broadbanc networks} and reduce the digital divide. The Broadband Comrnission primarily performs advocacy work (reports, studies, recommendations) for the introduction of standards and guidelines for the establishment of oroacband networks in developing countries, the development of digital skills (education and capacity building} ameonc ail population groups and, specifically, for reducing the digital divide between the gencers. The Broadband Commission is also increasingly addressing the significance of internet access as a driver of sustainable growth and development. Its work therefore also includes issues such as digital health and the relationship between ICTs and climate change. Fintech dialogue platform (Geneva) The global dialogue platiorm on fintech, which was launched in 2020 by the UNDP, Switzerland and Kenya, airns to ensure that the rules and practices relating to the digitalisation of the financial system also take account of its impact on sustainable development. Together with stakeholders from develaning countries and international organisations, such as the World Bank and the Warid Economic Forum, criteria, standards and norms are to be developed that incorporate the goais of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes 35 Task Force on Digital Financing of the UN secretary-general In 2018, the UN secretary-general launched a Task Force on Digital Financing in order to explore the potential of financial innovations, new technologies anc digitalisation for bringing about broader access to financial resources for the achievement of the SDGs and to minimise risks in the process. The task force will submit its report with recommendations to the UN secretary-general during the course of 2020. Libra Association (Geneva) The Liora Association, initiated by Facebook, comprises several private sector and civil society organisations seeking to promote a global online currency called Libra. The Libra payrnent system is based on blockchain technology. United Nations Conference on Trade and Development / UNCTAD (Geneva} The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) is part of the UN secretariat. its objective is to maximise developing countries’ trade, investment and Cevelopment opportunities and to promote their efforts to Integrate into the world economy. ft conducts research, produces political analyses and data collections and provides technical assistance to developing countries. In the digital fleic, tL supports developing countries in drawing up e-corn- merce legislation, building capacities, for example for the production of underlying statistics for ICT policies, promoting the use of technology in the economy (in order to oridge the gender-specific digital divide, it primarily supports female entrepreneurs} and helping countries to develop appropriate consumer protection leg:siation. International Trade Centre / ITC (Geneva) The !TC is a multilateral organisation which has a joint mandate from the WTO and UNCTAD to contribute to sustainability goals. In the area of e-commerce, it primarily supports SMEs in acquiring the required skills. It has developed an e-solu- tions programme which provides companies with access to a plattorm of shared technologies and services, including access to international payment solutions and logistics. A virtual marketplace project aims to strengthen the capabilities of SMEs so that they can effectively utilise new technologies in order to improve their visibility on international markets. The centre also offers e-learning programmes and produces publications related to e-commerce. 34 Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes UN World Data Forum The UN Worle Data Forum was established following the report ‘A World that Counts’ by the UN secretary-general’s independent Expert Advisory Group on the Data Revolution for Sustainable Develoomenrt (2014). it acts as a olatform for cooperation between different stakeholders from the areas of data science, information technology and civil society. The first World Data Forum was held in South Africa in 2017, while the second took place in the United Arab Emirates in 2018. Switzerland will be the host country for the third forum, which was scheduled for auturnn 2020 in Bern and will now likely be held in 2621. The question of how digital data Gnciuding big data) can be used for development is playing an increasingly important role. Switzerland has launched a series of events leading up to the forum, entitled Road to Bern. In Geneva, it has supported a process in this context which should allow for cooperation between international organisations as weil a5 private stakeholders and facibtate the sharing of data for sustainable develooment. This also includes questions relating to collection, data protection, security and interpretation. international Committee of the Red Cross / IGRC (Geneva) The work of the ICRC focuses on responding to emergency Situations and promoting respect for international humani- tarian law anc its implementation in national leqislation. Digttalisation is important in different ways here. On the one hand, support provided to population groups in need can be mace rnore efficient through the use of digital toais, tor example the use of facial recognition software when searching for missing persons. Especially in conflict zones where the ICRC is active, snecial care must be taken to ensure that personal data is not stolen and misused. For this reason, the ICRC is at the forefront of efforts to find technical and oolitical solutions that prioritise data protection anc thus the protection of individuals. In addition, the ICRC is the quardian of international nurnanitarian law and promotes adherence to the four Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols. The use of weapons is a focus area here and in this respect the ICRC also devotes itself to Issues relating to cyberwarfare anc the use of autonamous weapon systems (which must be in accordance with international humani- tarian law). Switzerland works closely with the ICRC. Among other things, the Humanitarian Data and Trust initiative Gee saction 4} was launched together with the ICRC and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). International Labour Organization / ILO (Geneva) The ILQ’s mandate is to promote social and economic justice by defining international labour standards. Digital devel- opments will have a major impact on the world of work. The enhancement and partial replacement of human work processes by robotics, Al and the internet of things are creating new work structures, but also a risk of rising unemployment. In order for digital technalagies to be used profitably, social systems such as the education system, social dialogue between amployers and eraployees and the principles based upon this, such as worker protection, must be guaranteed. With its work in the area of the Future of Work and the Centenary Declaration of 2019, which gives priority to the effects of technological developments on work processes, the ILO has an important role to play in the structuring and promotion of a socially sustainable digital economy. World Intellectual Property Organization / WIPO (Geneva} WIPO is a specialised agency of the United Nations which airns to lead the development of a balanced and effective inter- national intellectual property system that enables innovation and creativity for the benefit of all. In the area of digital governance, WIPO has lang been addressing issues relating to the protection of trademarks as part of the cornain name system. To this end, it has set up a dispute resolution service with ICANN for the registration of domain names. WIPO is active in the field of diattalisation and has undertaken various initiatives, in particular the development of digital toals and services such as the digital time stamp WIPO PROOF, presentations in committees, research and events (e.g. within the framework of WSIS ancl IGF conterences). World Health Organization / WHO (Geneva} The WHO js a specialised agency of the United Nations that is responsible for international public health. Digital health is one of the WHO's focus areas. This is largely understood to refer to the use of ICT to improve health. Several resolutions of the General Assembly nave focused on issues such as the standardisation of health data to allow for better analyses, the use of the top-level domain ‘health’ (question of the credibility of mectcal information provided online) and the online aclver- tising and distribution of medical devices (protection against counterfeits, etc). A Global Observatory for eHealth airns to support member states with information and guidelines on eHealth practices and standards. United Nations Children’s Fund / UNICEF The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) is an organi- sation that is responsible for the provision of hurnanitarian and development assistance to children worldwide. With its Innocenti research centre, it is dedicated to identifying and researching opportunities and risks for the implementation of children’s rights, including in the digital domain. Together with the London Schoo! of Economics and EU Kids Online, it has launched the Globai Kids Onkne initiative in order to further explore the understanding of the risks and oppor- tunities presented by the internet for children. Following the report of the High-level Panel for Digital Cooperation, UNICEF is working to develop a platiorm for digital public goods. United Nations Environment Programme / UNEP The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) promotes the implementation of sustainability in the environmental field. It assesses global, regional and national environmental trends, develops international and national environmental instruments and works to strengthen the relevant institu- tions. The increasing use of ICT presents both opportunities and challenges in the area of environmental orotection. Digitalisation is therefore becoming increasingly important tor the UNEP. In performing its work, it focuses on devel- oping strategies and instruments in order to support the ICT sector with innavations and facilitate environmental sustain- ablity efforts. The initiatives of the UNEP also revoive around improved data analyses (e.g. on climate change) as well as global supply chains and electronic waste. The UNEP has a iaading role in the WSIS action lines on the environment. World Meteorological Organization / WMO (Geneva) The WMO fs a specialised agency of the United Nations. Among other things, % allows for the consolidation of enormous amounts of global weather and climate data. {ts work covers numerous areas in which ICTs are used as tools for the management of climate-related challenges. in the area of urban developrnent, the agency promotes resilient cities through the development of integrated urban weather, environmental and climate services. it also researches the use of technologies for meteorological and environmental ahser- vations and data collection, the reduction of natural hazards and disaster risks as well as the transmission of forecasts, warnings and public alerts. The WMO operates the Warld Weather Information Service, which uses the internet and digital technologies in order to make weather information oublicly available in a user-friendly manner. Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes 35 Cybersecurity UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security / UN GGE (New York and Geneva) Fhe UN GGE convened by the UN General Assembly discusses standards for responsible state behaviour as well as the valicity and application of international law in the digital space. Until now, there have been five such expert groups (in different compositions), three of which adopted consensus reports (2010, 2013 and 2015). Within these, the experts agreed that international law in its entirety is applicable in the digital space and that the principles of international nurnan- itarian law alsa apply here. The 2015 repart also contained Ji voluntary standards for responsible state behaviour that contripute to the promotion of international cybersecurity. The UN General Assembly supported each of these reports. Since 2016-17, Switzerland has been able to play an active role in the expert group. The current process should be concluded with a report to the UN General Assembly in 2021. Open-Ended Working Group / UN OEWG In addition to the UN GGE, a new UN body — the OEWG — has been meeting since September 2019 on the initiative of Russia on the topic of international cybersecurity. Uniike the UN GGE, participation is open to all states and it also provides for cansultations with the scientific community, the private sector and civil society. The UN QEWG also nas a broader mandate than the UN GGE and provides for very fundamental ciscussions on perceived challenges. As the chairing country, Switzeriand is also closely involved in this process. in its role as chair, Switzerland is concerned to ensure that the content is consistent with the discussions in the UN GGE. The work of the UN GEWG was scheduled to be completed for the UN General Assembly in 2020, but is likely to be delayed owing to the coronavirus crisis. Group of Governmental Experts on Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (Geneva) In order to acidress the issues relating to newly emercing technologies in the areas of lethal autonormous weapon systems (LAWS), a group of government experts (UN GGE on LAWS) was established for the first time in 2013 within the framework of the states parties to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW). The group is open to all States Parties to the CCW. The issues discussed include, among others, the promotion of a cornmon understanding of the concept of LAWS, possible challenges for interna- tional humanitarian law, the human element in the use of lethal force (aspects of human-machine interaction}, passible military iraplications of the technologies and the management 36 Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes of humanitarian and international securty challenges arising from them. The group will continue its work in order to oresent potential recommendations on autonomous weapon systems within the framework of the Convention at the Sixth Review Conference in 2021. Cybersecurity package/strategy of the European Union On 13 September 2017, the European Commission published a cybersecurity package with which Europe’s critical infrastructure should be better protected and its digital self-assertion vis-a-vis other regions of the world should be promoted. In implementing this, the Cybersecurity Act antered into force in June 2019, providing for two relevant innovations: 7) the strengthening of the mandate of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA): 2) the introduction of an EU-wide certification frarnework for the cybersecurity of products, services and processes in the area of ICT. A further important element of the EU strategy in the area of cybersecurity is the cybersanctions regime for the imposition of restrictive measures in response to cyber- attacks, wnicn was adopted by the Council of the EU on 17 May 2019. The EU wil in future also invest even more in the development of its own cybersecurity capacities. This includes the planned creation of an EU cybersecurity competence centre (The European Cybersecurity industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre) as well as a network of national cornpetence centres. These are to be managed oy the planned Digital Europe Programme (DEP} and financed using funds of the DEP and the EU research orogramme Horizon Europe. Developments at EU level are being closely followed with respect to their impact on Switzerland and with a view to potential participation opportunities. With respect to the planned EU-wide certification programme for ICT products, tt will be especially important to avoid any barriers to market access for Swiss ICT companies. in the case of the EU cyber-sanctions regime, it is currently being examined whether an adoption based on the Swiss Embargo Act would be possible in principle. Ultimately, Switzerland aims to participate in the DEP and Horizon Europe, although it is still open as ta whether anc under what conditians third countries wit be proviced with access to activities in the area of cybersecurity. Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe / OSCE At a regional level, the Organization for Security and Co-op- eration in Europe (OSCE) plays an important role. in 20433 and 2016, it acopted a catalogue of 16 confidence-ouilding measures in the fleid of cybersecurity. It is the first agreement of this kind anywhere in the world. The measures aim to reduce the risks posecl by new information and communi- cation technologies and to improve transparency among OSCE members. Since the beginning of this process, Switzerland has contributed with smecific substantial proposals. It played a decisive role in the development of the confidence-bulicing measures and is continuing its commitment during their implementation. Geneva Dialogue on Responsible Behaviour in Cyberspace (Geneva) In order to acivance the global consensus on binding behav- ioural norms and responsibilities in the digital space, the FDFA launched the Geneva Dialogue on Responsible Behaviour in Cyberspace at the beginning of 2018. The dialogue uses Inter- national Geneva as 4 platform to create greater clarity with respect to the responsibility of states, business, science and civil society in the digital domain. The first results were recorded in a report in 2019. At present, the dialogue is being pursued further between a number of leacing global companies with the Geneva DiploFoundation with the objective of identitying shared industry best practices in the area of product safety. A first package is expected to be ready at the end of 2020. Participants in the dialogue include, among others, ABB, Cisco, Huawei, Kaspersky, Microsoft, Siamens, SwissRe and UBS. As part of the Geneva Dialogue, Switzerland aiso held an expert governmental legal experts. Working Party on Security and Privacy in the Digital Economy (WP SPDE) of the OFCD Fhe OECD Working Party on Security and Privacy in the Digital Economy airs to develop international orinciples and guidelines for policy measures aimed at reducing the cyber- secunty risks of cigittal products, without stifling innovation or reducing the opportunities presented by digitalisation. it is expected that such quidelines will be develoned by 2021. By means of reports to be prepared in advance, the basis for the development of an CECD Recommendation ts to be created. The FDFA represents Switzerland in this working group. Work on cybersecurity at the International Telecommunication Union in Geneva (ITU} The ITU has been working on a Global Cyoersecurity Agenda since 2007. The agenca includes support in the area of cyber- crime, technical measures for the establishment of security standards, the development of organisational structures and national capacities. A process is currently under way to update the agenda, but this is highly controversial. In this dossier, the FDFA is working together with the OFCOM, which has the lead role. United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research / UNIDIR (Geneva} UNIDIR is an autonomous institution within the UN that conducts research in the area of disarmament anc security. Within the cyber domain, UNIDIR organises conferences and WOrKSNOpS and conducts its own research in order to help countries better understand the associated new challenges. The institute acts as an expert adviser to the UN GGE and organises an annual Cyber Stability Conference. Within the framework of its programme on newly emercing security issues, UNIDIR is examining issues in relation to the use of new technologies (such as machine learning, artificial intelli- gence, robotics and computing) as a means of warfare. Global Forum on Cyber Expertise / GFCE The Global Forurn on Cyber Expertise (GFCE) is a multi-stake- holder comrnunity of more than 115 members and partners trom all regions of the world that has set itself the goal of strengthening cyber capacities and expertise at a global level, The GFCE aims to be a pragmatic, action-oriented and flexible olatfarm for international cooperation and to reduce overlaps in the cyber capacity-building ecosystem. Switzerland has been a member of the GFCE since 2015 and is invalved in several projects. Geneva Centre for Security Policy / GCSP As part of its programme for newly emerging security challenges, the GCSP has a cybersecurity cluster that covers educational and training activities as well as political analyses and events. The cluster also provides a platform far dialogue and exchanges on cyber challenges between experts from the public, private anc civil society sectors. Many of the activities of the GCSP fall under the category of capacity-building. For example, the annual Cyber 9/12 Student Challenge held at the GCSP brings together students from Europe, the Middle East, India and the United States in Geneva. Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes 37 Geneva Centre for Security Sector Governance / DCAF As part of its work to improve governance within the security sector, DCAF also looks at issues relating to cyoersecurity. Various publications developed by DCAF address aspects such as vulnerabilities in the digital soace and how they can be tackled at a national and international level, and challenges posed by demographic governance in the area of cybersecurity, cyberwarfare etc. DCAF also organises evants and activities for capacity development in the fleid of cyber- security. iCT4Peace (Geneva} ICT4Peace is an international! foundation that focuses on capacity-building anc policy cooperation (strategy papers, recommendations, facilitaton. it was founded by former ambassador Danie! Stauffacher. Its objective is to promote a peaceful digital space through international negotiations with governments, compames and non-state stakeholders. It also promotes the use of ICT within the context of humanitarian or conflict-related crisis management and works to combat the use of the internet for terrorist purposes. CyberPeace Institute (Geneva) The CyberPeace Institute was launched by Microsoft, Mastercard and the Hewlett Foundation in 2079. ft aims to promote the stability of the digital space. Using technical expertise, it aims to shec light on cyberattacks, making the information ouolicly accessible in arder to draw attention to weaknesses and the possibility of attacks. If also prarnotes the exchange of knowledge between cifferent players through the organisation of expert panels. Center for Digital Trust / C4DT The Center tor Digital Trust (C4DT), which is based at the Swiss Federal Instrtute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), brings together 712 founding members, 34 laboratories, civil society and political stakeholders in order ta advance contidence-building technologies on the basis of the latest research. 38 Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes Spamhaus (Geneva) The Spamhaus Project is an international non-profit organ- isation. tts work focuses on tracking spam and providing real-time threat information. Sparnhaus also tracks other cyber threats such as phisning, malware and botnets. !t maintains several real-time threat block ists that protect more than two billion user mailboxes and block the vast majority of spam anc malware messages sent on the internet. The organisation also publishes updated statistics on a regular basis. The data produced by the organisation is used by many internet service oroviders, email service providers, cornpanies, universities, governments and military networks. Spamhaus also supports law enforcement authorities in their investigations into spam, ootnets and rnalware operations. Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence / CODCOE in May 2019, the Federal Council decided that Switzerland would participate in the CCDCOE in Tallinn. The CCDCOE seeks to increase research and training cooperation in the areas of cyber defence and cybersecurity. The NATO-accreciited centre of excellence is financed by 25 countries. Countries partici- pating in the Partnership for Peace, including Switzerland, can participate as ‘contributing partners’. Through this cooper- ation, Switzerland gains access, in particular, to knowledge and information as well as the various research and training activities of the CCDCOE. Switzerlanc can also secand one or two civilian or military experts. Cyber-Defence Campus (Thun) The Cyber- Defence Campus (CYD Campus}, founced in 2019, forms the link between the federal government, industry and science in research, development and training for cyber defence. New research developments and technologies are transiated into proofs of concept and prototypes for the Swiss Armed Forces and other federal offices. The CYD Camous also works closely with ETH Zuricn and EPFL, and is rapre- sented at both university locations. In addition, :t maintains a network with universities and colleges ail over Switzerland, to respond to various cyber security questions. The CYD Campus is the federal government's centre of excellence for research in the field of cyber defence and maintains partnerships and cooperation with similar international institutions worldwide. Digital self-determination Human Rights Council (Geneva) Fhe UN Human Rights Council (HRC) plays a Gacisive role in protecting anc prornoting human rights in the digital age. The HRC is an intergavernmental body whose mandate is to strengthen the promotion and protection of human rights around the world and to address human rights violations and recommendations for compliance with these rghts. The council is made up of 47 mernber states elected by the UN General Assembly. Freedom of expression, the protection of privacy online anc the protection of human rights in light of the emergence of new technologies are issues dealt with by the HRC. They have been addressed in resolutions adopted by the HRC as well as in the reports of special rapporteurs appointed by rt. Switzerland was most recently a member of the HRC between 2015 and 2018 and also participates actively in the processes as an observer state. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights / OHCHR (Geneva) The Office of the High Commissioner for Hurnan Rights (OHCHR) is a department of the United Nations Secretariat that is committed to the promotion and protection of human ngnts. The office coardinates humans rights activities across the entire UN system. In the area of cigitalisation, it looks at, among other things, how digitalsation impacts privacy and freeclam of expression and at content published online that affacts the rights of the individual. The office also looks at issues relating to the prevention and combating of extremism online. At the request of the Hurnan Rights Council, the office can draw up reports. For example, it has prepared a report on the prevention and cornbating of violent online extremism. More recently, the High Commissioner for Human Rights has also addressed the issue of fake news and its impact on freedom of expression online. Furthermore, the QHCHR is currently developing guidelines for the application of the UN's Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights in the area of new technologies (B-Tech). Switzerland provides financial support for this work. Council of Europe For years, the Council of Europe has played a pioneering role in rnany areas of digital governance. It involves business, science and civil society in the work performed by its expert groups and uses forums such as the IGF and EuroDiG in a targeted rnanner in order to promote multi-stakeholder cooperation with the objective of ceveloping specific solutions. The Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of individuals with regared to Automatic Processing of Personal Data, which was drawn up in 1981 and updated in 2018, has been the omly binding international agreernent on data orotection issues over the last almost 40 years and has influ- anced national legislation in this area far beyond Europe. It has been adopted by Parliament in June 2020. Switzerland chaired the Advisory Committee on the Convention for many years. The Convention on Cybercrime (also referred to as the Budapest Convention) has governed the harmonisation of criminal law and criminal procedures since 2007. t has now been signed by more than 20 non-members of the Council of Europe anc has influenced corresponding legisiation in mare than 100 countries. in September 2019, the Cornmittee of Ministers set up the Ad hoc Committee on Artificial intelligance (CAHA} to investigate the feasibdity of and apnroaches to a legal framework for the development, design and application of AL. Switzerland is represented on the committee. Over recent decades, the Steering Committee on Media and information (CDMS}) has developed a wide range of sott-iaw instruments aimed at strengthening democracy, the rule of law and freedom of expression, the orotection of privacy and other human rights, and a functioning media system in the digital warld. Switzerland has been an influential member of the CDMS! for years, has headed various expert groups and held the chair of the CDMS! in 2018/2079. Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes 39 United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization / UNESCO The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is a UN specialised agency that seeks to contribute to sustainable development ane interculturel dialogue through ecucation, science, culture, communication and inforrnation. In the digital field, tt conducts activities to promote freeclam of expression aniine, multilingualism in the digital space, digital teracy anc other issues that should bridge the digita! divide at a non-infrastructural level. {t is committed to open ICT standards and open licences (such as open access) in order to expand universal access to infor- mation and Knowledge; it runs the Institute for Information Technologies in Education for this purpose. It is also one of the UN organisations that drives the WSIS process and as such participates in the annual WSIS and IGF. In addition, along with the TU, itwas a founder of the Broadband Cornmission. In the area of Al, UNESCO is playing an increasingly important role. Together with the People’s Republic of China, it organised the International conference on Artificial intelli- gence and Education in soring 2019. During the conference, the Beijing Consensus on Artificial intelligence and Education was adopted. Together with the UNESCO member states, the director-general is encouraged to develop guidelines and resources for the use of Al in education and called to establish an ‘At for Education’ platform. UNESCO also looks at the ethical dirnensions of AL. in 2019, its working group on ethics and Al presentecl a preliminary stucly that recom- mends a standard-setting instrument in this area. A craft text for a recommendation is to be presented to the Genera Conference in 2021. Switzerland is participating actively in the interim consultations on the working group's text. Switzerland also supports UNESCO's work as a member of the information For Ail Programme for the promotion of free access to digital media and content as well as to support the quality of journalisrn and the safety of media professionals. Humanitarian Data and Trust Initiative (HDT The Humanitarian Data and Trust initiative (HDT is a long-term diplomatic initiative of Switzerland, the ICRC anc the OCHA Centre for Hurnanitarian Data that aims to ensure the protection and responsible handing of humanitarian cata. With its three pillars of Policy & Dialogue, Research & Development and Education & Outreach, the HDT! combines technological knowledge with evidence-based policy recorn- mendations, which it channels into concerted action by states, humanitarian organisations and academic institutions. Its air is to ensure the optimal use of the great potentia offered by digital technalogies in the humanitarian field and to minimise the associated risks. With the help of this joint initiative, further states and humanitarian organisations are to be won over for this objective. 40 Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes Kofi Annan Foundation (Geneva} The Kofi Annan Foundation is an independent, non-profit organisation whose activities are chiefly focused on achieving better governance. The topic of digitalisation is becoming increasingly important for the foundation. in January, the Kofi Annan Commission on Elections and Democracy in the Digital Age presented its report, thereby bringing digital issues further to the fore of the founcation’s wark. switzerland works together with the Kofi Annan Foundation in country-specitic contexts in order to promote the intearity of elections. international Parliamentary Union (Geneva) in line with its objective of developing strong and democratic parliaments, the IPU supports parliaments in budding up their ability to make effective use of ICT in order to promote efficency, effectiveness and transparency. The iPU has also been mandated by its member states to build capacities for parliamentary committees that monitor compliance with the right to orivacy and individual freedoms in the digital environment, internet Society (Geneva office) The Internet Society is am American non-profit organisation established by the co-founder of the internet Vint Cerf, which aims to “ensure and sustain an open developrnent, use and evolution of the internet for the benefit of all users throughout the world”. It primarily deals with technical standards of the internet, which should allow free access to the greatest possible extent (e.g. decentralised systems). The internet Society is arganisec in regional ‘chapters’ with a total of arounc 70,000 mernbers; it has two main offices (in the United States and in Geneva). The Public Interest Registry, a subsidiary of the Internet Society, operates the three top-level domain names Corg, .ngo and .ong}, which are primarily used by non-orotit, non-governmental organisations. The lETF (see above) also works under the auspices of the Internet Society. Access Now / RightsCon Access Now is an NGO that is active in the fleld of digital human rights. lt acts as a global organisation with severa! offices around the world (in New York, Wasningten DC, Brussels, San José, Manila and Tunis). In addition to advacacy and the cevelopment of political guidelines, :ts activities also induce the provision of technical support, for example as part of a helpline for activists, journalists and human rights defenders on the issue of internet safety. Switzerland is Supporting an Access Now project aimed at preventing internet shutdowns within the context of elections. Since 2071, Access Now has organised the annual RightsCon conference, which with almast 3,000 participants from around 4120 countries Gn 2019) is one of the most important miulti-stakeholder forums on the issue of human rights in the cigital age. Switzerland participates actively in RightsCan. Freedom Online Coalition In October 20179, Switzerland joined the Freedorn Oniine Coalition, a group of more than 30 states set up in 2011 at the initiative of the Netherlands that works to promote democracy and human rights on the internet. The right to privacy anc the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful asseroly and free association are of particular importance within this context. Annex Cc 2 : Key stakeholders, forums and processes 41 Switzerland should be in a position to become the global centre for digital governance Submitted by: BEGLE CLAUDE, CVP parliamentary group Christian Dernocratic People’s Party of Switzerland Opposed by: TUENA MAURO Suomitted on: 78.09.2017 Suormitted to: National Council Consultation status: Accepted Text submitted The Federal Council has been tasked with examining how Switzerland could become the global centre for cyberspace governance. The first objective is to work towards creating a Geneva Convention on digitalisation containing principles governing the peaceful use of cyberspace. Second, a neutral organisation similar to the ICRC should be set up in order to ensure that these principles are applied. Third, the aim should also be to establish the headquarters of this organisation in Geneva. Such a project would be fully in line with Switzerland’s engagement at international level. lt is vital that Switzeriand position itself clearly on this issue as soon as possible. Rationale Fhe European Union (EU) and North Atlantic Treaty Organi- zation (NATO) have been cooperating on digital governance since 2010. The development of the internet has created a new space: cyberspace. In this arena, a cyberattack can bring a country to its knees. No state can pretend that it is able to protect itself against such attacks on its own. That is why international cyberspace governance must be established. 42 Annex 6: Postulate 17.3789 in so doing, the following is to be avoided: * the development of a climate of mistrust resulting in a cy- ber arms race, or fragmentation of the internet if individual States rasort to putting sovereignty first; * states attacking other states: @ states attacking critical businesses, tech campanies or criti- cal public services such as healthcare. States must commit to: ® drawing atterition to gaps in security rather than exploiting thern (fo avoid a repeat WannacCry incident whereby the NSA used its knowledge of the security gap for ts own purposes): ® protecting citizens in the virtual world (only states can en- sure such protection). The following ideas are also to be advocated: * that cialogue and coordination are essential: @ that states are responsible for any cyberactivity taking place on their territory, which therefore requires the estab- lishment of an international arbitration panel to identify the perpetrators of cyoerattacks: ® that the objective of national armed forces is to defend, not escalate conflict. A similar proposal was set out in the 2015 report of the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE) on Developments in the Field of Information anc Telecom- munications in the Context of International Security. An FU-NATO agreement signed in February 2016 provides for the exchange of best practice in preventing, detecting and defence against cyberattacks. Without state-level involvernent however, the recormrmen- dations of the GGE remain a dead letter. The internet must remain a public good. Timeline 45.12.2017 ~ National Council Opposed.

At the same time, it serves as a response   to postulate 17.3789 of former National Councillor Claude Béglé of   28 September 2017.      Foreword   Digitalisation is everywhere. It has permeated almost all   aspects of our lives and will continue to do so for decades   to come. Digital technologies are constantly evolving and   there is no telling where they will take us next. But one   thing is certain: the new technologies shaping our future   offer enormous potential to drive sustainable development   and prosperity — here in Switzerland and around the world.   We live in a digital age. With social media we can connect   with thousands of people at once, wherever they are. The   young generation is growing up with smartphones and   tablets as a part of everyday life. And while computers have   long been used for routine tasks, artificial intelligence is   opening up a whole new world of possibilities. Now, as the   world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, the key role   of digital applications has really come to the fore. But digita-   lisation also brings certain challenges, not least the vulne-   rability of our data in an information society. The frequency   and scope of cyberattacks, cybercrime and political manipu-   lation in the digital space are growing all the time, as are   dependencies and vulnerabilities.   The Federal Council recognises the strategic importance of   digitalisation. In the 2019-23 legislative programme, digita-   lisation takes on new significance and plays a growing role.   In the Foreign Policy Strategy 2020—23digitalisation features   for the first time as one of four thematic priorities.   There are two aspects to the role of digitalisation in   government. At one level it is a work tool and a means of   simplifying processes, for example in consular services or IT   applications. But digitalisation is now also a foreign policy   matter, raising a number of important questions. How do   we ensure that users can control their data and decide who   can access it? How do we maintain Switzerland's leading   position in business, innovation and education? How do we   strengthen the position of International Geneva as a hub for   digital governance? How do we enforce international law   and human rights in the digital space? How do we promote   a secure and stable digital space and strengthen trust   between the different stakeholders? These are all questions   that arise in the emerging context of digital foreign policy.       In the digital space itself, Switzerland is confidently and   independently pursuing its interests and values — the   same interests and values it pursues in the physical world,   whether on the ground, in the air, at sea or in outer space.   Here too the Federal Constitution provides a framework to   promote Switzerland’s freedom, independence, security   and prosperity, the alleviation of need and poverty in the   world, sustainable development, equal opportunities,   human rights, democracy and commitment to a peaceful   and just international order. We continue to be guided by   this in the future to ensure a coherent and effective foreign   policy, including in the digital space.   The present strategy sets out the various fields of action for   the Federal Council's digital foreign policy over the coming   years. In the annexes it also provides additional information   on the broader context for a deeper understanding of the   topic.   | hope you enjoy reading it.

It mandates the Federal Council to examine “how   Switzerland could become the global epicentre of interna-   tional governance in the area of cyberspace”. The postulate   also suggests the creation of a type of Geneva Convention for   digitalisation and the foundation of a neutral organisation in   Geneva, which could be responsible for its implementation.   On 8 December 2017, the Federal Council proposed that the   postulate be adopted, indicating that the idea of a ‘Geneva   Digital Convention’ would be met with great scepticism by   most stakeholders and be almost impossible to implement.   The Federal Council also announced that it would be willing   to issue a report setting out Switzerland’s priorities in the   areas of international cybersecurity and digital governance.   The National Council adopted the postulate on 15 March   2018 by 113 votes to 78.   1.2 Focus of the strategy  Since the postulate was adopted, digitalisation has progressed   rapidly, permeating and changing politics, the economy and   society as a whole. These digital advances present many   opportunities, but also bring with them new challenges and   issues. The global COVID-19 crisis has highlighted that while   new digital technologies can help us better understand and   contain the spread of a pandemic, for example through the   use of digital contact tracing, and while they underscore the   importance of issues relating to technical standardisation and   cross-border cooperation, these technologies also raise a   number of questions, for example about application security   and data protection.   The Federal Council has taken into account the growing   significance of digitalisation, having placed greater emphasis   on this topic in its legislative programme for 2019-23. The   need for the Federal Council’s political agenda to now take   advantage of the many opportunities presented by digitali-   sation was set out in the corresponding guidelines. Alongside   peace and security, prosperity and sustainability, digitalisation   is a new thematic foreign policy focus in the Foreign Policy   Strategy 2020-23. The Federal Council's ‘Digital Switzerland’   Strategy of September 2020 sets out the guidelines for   government action with regard to digitalisation and indicates   where and how authorities, business, science, civil society   and politics must work together in order to jointly shape the   transformation process for the benefit of all. A number of   other baseline documents related to digitalisation have been   adopted in recent years. These include the National strategy   for the protection of Switzerland against cyber risks for   2018-22, the International Cooperation Strategy 2021-24   as well as the measures to strengthen Switzerland's role   as a host state during the 2020-23 period.\" In the Federal   Council's 2019 Foreign Economic Policy Report, the featured   topic was also devoted to ‘Digitalisation and foreign trade’.?   Key events have also since taken place on an international   level. The UN secretary-general, for example, placed the   subject high on the international agenda by convening a   High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation to report on the   topic. The report, to which former Federal Councillor Doris   Leuthard contributed as a panellist, contained key recommen-   dations on how to advance global digital cooperation. On 10   June 2020, the UN secretary-general presented a roadmap   based on this report, which set out the next practical steps to   implement these recommendations. It focuses on improving   internet access around the world, greater capacity-building   in developing countries, protecting human rights, improving   cybersecurity and promoting inclusive governance models.?   1 See Annex 3.   2 See ‘Digitalisation and foreign trade’, featured topic of the Federal Council's   2019 Foreign Economic Policy Report, published 15 January 2020, SR 20.008   (executive summary and featured topic available in English).   3 UN Secretary-General’s Roadmap for Digital Cooperation   Background 1    In addition, countries and organisations such as the European   Union* have also put into place regulations that impact   Switzerland and its foreign policy.   This context must be given due consideration. The Federal   Council is addressing the fundamental issues raised in   postulate 17.3789 on Switzerland's foreign policy positioning   as well as the positioning of International Geneva, but is   going beyond this in three aspects: firstly, it is integrating the   latest developments at an international level, specifically the   roadmap presented by the UN secretary-general. Secondly,   it is aiming to foster a comprehensive understanding of the   opportunities and risks related to digitalisation, which extends   beyond the cybersecurity-specific focus. Thirdly, in fulfilment   of the postulate, it conceives the report as a thematic   follow-up strategy to the Foreign Policy Strategy 2020-23. In   accordance with this strategy, Switzerland intends to further   develop its digital foreign policy and raise its profile in this   regard (objective 4.4). This will be taken into account here.   4 With its European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU has   played a global leading role in protecting personal data. The EU is aiming   to develop a wide-ranging governance model as part of its data strategy. In   a White Paper on Artificial Intelligence (Al), the EU Commission also set out   how Al will be used to benefit the European economy, while safeguarding   citizens’ rights. The EU's digital strategy and the measures relating to the   digital single market and cybersecurity also flow into the EU's regulations.       This strategy explains the conceptual understanding of   various key notions, describes the international environment,   sets out Switzerland’s interests and values in the digital   Space as well as its strengths, identifies four action areas for   Switzerland's digital foreign policy for the next four years and   highlights the opportunities for Switzerland as a country. The   Strategy includes a glossary to help better understand the   various concepts.

Technology is moving at a rapid pace   and it permeates all areas of our lives. However, a common   understanding of the most important concepts and terms is   necessary and the following definitions are proposed in this   strategy:   Originally, digitalisation described the technical process for   converting analogue information into digital formats. This is   now referred to as digitisation. Continual technological devel-   opments have resulted in structural changes, new applications   and systems, for example the creation of networks or the use   of Al. Nowadays, the term digitalisation spans all of these   developments, including opportunities for use as well as their   social, economic and political impact, for example.   In principle, the digital space refers to networks of devices   which exchange data with each other. The most frequently   used and by far the most global of these networks is the   internet. Today, around 50 billion end devices are connected   to the internet and according to the UN, 54% of the world’s   population has active access to it.° Digital space not only   includes networks and devices, but also the relevant actors,   various processes and interactions. In the same way as land,   sea and air are considered ‘spaces’ — and indeed as outer   space has recently in the history of humankind been explored   as a new ‘space’ — the digital space is also considered a new   dimension which extends beyond national borders.   5 UN secretary-general’s roadmap, p. 5.

Background 3    Switzerland also has interests and values in this new, digital   space — these form part of its digital policy and, within that,   digital foreign policy, which is a new area of foreign policy   for the country. Nevertheless, it is consistent with Switzer-   land's aspiration to actively contribute to all policy areas: the   protection of its sovereignty, its independence and security,   access for its economy to global markets, its commitment   to sustainability and a just international order, access for as   many sections of the population as possible to opportunities   in life and the protection of human rights. As such, there is no   change in quality as regards the content of its digital foreign   policy; it is much more a continuation of Switzerland's proven   approach to protecting its interests and promoting its values   in a new ‘space’.   Promoting digital governance will play a key role. This   represents an important area of digital foreign policy and will   allow for the creation of common rules in the digital space   and strengthen both institutions and cooperation mecha-   nisms.   An equally important area of digital foreign policy is cyber-   security, Cybersecurity concerns all aspects of security in   information and communications technology. This includes   all information technologies related to the internet and   other similar networks as well as the associated communi-   cation, processes, applications and information processed in   relation to these. International cooperation between state   and non-state actors in the area of cybersecurity aims to   maintain and protect an open, free and secure digital space.   It can also reduce the risks of cyberattacks between states.   The term cyber is mostly used at an international level when   discussing issues related to security and confidence-building,   while digital has a broader social, economic and political   dimension.   4 Background   Ultimately, digitalisation is only part of a larger transfor-   mation. ‘Digitalisation 2.0’, which is based on new commu-   nication technologies and elements such as the internet of   things, big data, blockchain, quantum computing and cloud   technologies, is already being overshadowed by equally signif-   icant innovations in the area of bio and gene technologies.   The convergence of digital, bio and physical technologies   is often referred to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution.   The potential for change already offered by each of these   technologies is amplified when these areas come together   and interact.   While this strategy is limited to the area of digitalisation, it   also makes references to other new technologies. Science   diplomacy plays a key role in this. New issues and action   areas arise when science, technology and foreign policy come   together. Science diplomacy is necessary to help shape digital   change. Foreign policy should be based on scientific expertise   and evidence (science in diplomacy) and should itself facil-   itate scientific collaboration between states and promote it   where appropriate (diplomacy for science). At the same time,   scientific collaboration can be particularly beneficial politically   where there are no established diplomatic channels in place   (or where these are insufficient), helping to foster confidence   and cooperation (science for diplomacy).® As such, digital   foreign policy and science diplomacy are closely related,   especially at the multilateral level.   6 See also Switzerland’s International Strategy on Education, Research and   Innovation, 2018.    2 Switzerland's digital foreign  policy   2.1 Interests and values   The main aim of Switzerland’s foreign policy is to promote its   interests and values, as set out in the Federal Constitution — in   particular in Articles 2, 54 and 101. These interests and values   do not change with the emergence of new technologies or the   progress of digitalisation.   The Swiss foreign policy aim of influencing these issues cannot   be limited to the physical space. Switzerland’s interests and   values also apply both in and to the digital space. Digital foreign   policy is the tool used to safeguard these interests and promote   Switzerland's values within the digital space.   The Foreign Policy Strategy 2020-23 defines the basic principles   for digital foreign policy and sets out the vision of a free, open   and secure digital space. It is based on international law and   focuses on people and their needs.’ Specifically, the aim is to   raise Switzerland’s profile in the area of digital governance,   further develop its digital foreign policy and position Interna-   tional Geneva as a prime location for discussing digitalisation   and technology. Accordingly, this strategy is based on the   Foreign Policy Strategy 2020-23 and refines the digital foreign   policy guidelines as set out within it.   7 See Annex 3.   2.2 Switzerland’s strengths  Thanks to its neutrality and good offices, Switzerland is able   to build confidence. This makes it easier for Switzerland to   position itself as a bridge-builder in difficult, fragmented   environments, including in the digital space. In light of   prevailing digital geopolitics, and an increasing trend towards   blocbuilding, there is an increasing need for mediators.   Switzerland can build on its key successes and proven track   record in this regard: in recent decades it has repeatedly   managed to bring new impetus to international discussions, for   example with the holding of the World Summit on the Infor-   mation Society (WSIS) 2003 in Geneva, and subsequently with   the reform of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and   Numbers (ICANN). This organisation assigns internet addresses   and until 2016 was under the direct supervision of the US   government, which had provoked major political controversy   for two decades. The transition of ICANN into a multi-stake-   holder model was negotiated under Swiss chairmanship of the   Governmental Advisory Committee. Another example is the   Open-Ended Working Group on Developments in the Field   of ICTs in the Context of International Security as mandated   by the UN General Assembly (UN OEWG), which Switzerland   currently chairs. For the second time, Switzerland also has an   expert representative on the Group of Governmental Experts   on Advancing responsible State behaviour in cyberspace in the   context of international security (UN GGE). Over 70 countries   applied for a seat on this group of 25 experts. These examples   show that Switzerland is perceived and valued as a solution-ori-   ented, credible and capable partner.   Switzerland is also able to benefit from its role as a host state.   International Geneva, as the operational platform for imple-   menting the 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development   Goals, presents Switzerland with a wide range of opportu-   nities. Switzerland also plays a leading role in researching new   technologies thanks to its federal institutes of technology and   other research centres. Many innovative and world-leading   technology companies are based in Switzerland; in addition,   there is a diverse SME landscape, especially in the field of digital   services. Overall, the Swiss financial and business centre has so   far responded successfully to the challenges of digitalisation.   Furthermore, a number of important international organisa-   tions and NGOs involved in the discussion on digital change   are also headquartered in the country. The presence of these   stakeholders puts Switzerland in a good position to discuss   digital issues.®   8 See Annex 5.   Switzerland's digital foreign policy 5    3 International environment   The following challenges have emerged   on an international level: re            Geopolitical  and authoritarian         Legal (un)certainty   a eA   trends       Technological race  and concentration   of power   ea       eats  The importance  of private actors         Speed of  digital advance   ——p   Figure 3: The international environment (Source: FDFA).   Geopolitical and authoritarian trends   The ongoing shifts in global power have resulted in rising   political fragmentation. The geopolitical renaissance is also   evident in the digital space, creating the risk of networks   decoupling from each other, thereby weakening the open,   global internet. Deglobalisation trends, also witnessed   during the COVID-19 pandemic, have in addition encouraged   regionalisation in the form of competing economic, devel-   opmental and social systems. While the liberal-democratic   model continues to be successful, it is coming under increased   pressure. Authoritarian trends and models that do not link   development and prosperity with individual rights or with   political and social pluralism are on the rise in many parts of   International environment   the world. The misuse of digital technologies, for example   to keep governments in power, is also increasing in several   countries. In this polarised context, a European approach is   gradually emerging in which the economic and social potential   of digitalisation should be utilised, while allowing individual   rights to be protected to the greatest extent possible.    Technological race and  concentration of power   There are indications that a technological race is under way,   particularly in the area of Al.? Given that data is becoming a   strategic resource, and thus a key commodity in the digital   economy, it now occupies a pivotal role as data linkage can   be used to produce faster and more precise forecasts. It   therefore has the potential to change existing power struc   tures. The increased concentration of data in the hands of a   small number of countries or companies also gives rise to new   political and economic dependencies. Having equal access to   network infrastructures and network speed thus plays an   important role in this (net neutrality).   Speed of digital advance   Digitalisation is proceeding at an exceptional pace like hardly   any other process in human history. While it took radio 38   years and television 13 years to reach 50 million users, the   internet took just four years. Smartphones have also had a   major impact on the world in a single decade. Unlike before,   technological achievements often become available all over   the world at almost the same time. Developments in areas   such as cloud computing, machine learning and automation   are moving at a rapid pace: we can expect to see further,   sometimes disruptive changes. Experts expect the Fourth   Industrial Revolution to not merely surpass previous revolu-   tions in terms of speed, but also in terms of scope and the   impact it will have on economic, social and political systems.   9 See Switzerland in the World 2028: report from the ‘Switzerland's 2028   Foreign Policy Vision &' working group, 2 July 2019.   The importance of private actors   Given the commercial nature of the internet, the influence   of the private sector has also increased. In many cases, for   example, private companies not only provide technical   components but also the telecommunication services   themselves. The provision of some digital services has brought   about a process of concentration. Large corporations based   in the United States as well as their Asian competitors have   assumed dominant positions and are establishing their own   standards. Thanks to their general terms and conditions of   use, they are able to influence the everyday lives of billions   of users. Politicians in individual countries are barely able to   keep up with these developments, which means the private   sector, along with civil society and the technical and academic   communities, must be involved in all governance issues and   in shaping policy.   Legal (un)certainty   While regulation of the digital space is progressing in various   countries and in some cases regionally, the international rules   and standards for the digital space remain incomplete. While   there are multilateral rules that were largely put in place   before digitalisation and still in principle apply in the digital   space, there is often uncertainty or disagreement regarding   their concrete application, as they are frequently subject to   interpretation with regard to specific facts. There are many   parallel processes under way for which numerous actors   have developed specific rules and standards. This means   that there is an overlap between old and new instruments   that vary in scope and in terms of the degree to which they   are binding. This can result in legal uncertainty and discrimi-   natory measures, stifling investment and innovation, and lead   to ambiguities over who is responsible for what in the digital   space. Powerful countries are asserting their positions ever   more bilaterally, and in some cases unilaterally, and inter-   national organisations are often not in a position to punish   violations of international law. Conflicts of law and legal   disputes between countries are likely to increase accordingly   in the future.   International environment 7    4 Fields of action   Based on the environment described above and the afore-   mentioned Swiss interests and values in the digital space, it is   possible to envisage various fields of action for Switzerland's   digital foreign policy. To implement them requires action on the   part of all departments as well as increased interdepartmental   cooperation. It is necessary to combine both technical and   political considerations, minimise risks and take advantage of   4.1 Digital governance  A global phenomenon such as digitalisation requires an   international set of rules, comprising both legally binding   and non-binding instruments. Legally binding instruments   include international treaties and customary international   law. Examples of non-binding instruments are soft law best   practices, technical standards and benchmarks.   Globally interconnected to a high degree and with limited   power-political opportunities, Switzerland is dependent   on international law. With regard to its external economic   interests too, it relies on there being legal certainty and a level   playing field in the digital space so as to allow free compe-   tition to flourish.\"® At a global level, there is general agreement   that the rules enshrined in international law also apply in the   digital space, in the same way as for trade, the preservation   of international security and the protection of human rights.   This means that there is no need to completely overhaul the   international set of rules: it is more a case of substantiating   the existing standards, harmonising them with each other and   continuing to develop them. International governance struc   tures are essential in this regard so that all key stakeholders   are involved in shaping the international set of rules and the   cooperation mechanisms.   The Federal Council is sceptical of any single all-encompassing   and legally binding instrument to regulate the digital space,   as is proposed in the postulate. Given the wider international   context, it is unlikely that a binding international agreement on   cybersecurity will materialise in the foreseeable future. Specif-   ically, western nations fear that any new instrument under   10 Inthe area of international business and commercial law, Switzerland works   in various forums to further develop the legal framework with regard to   the challenges of digitalisation. See ‘Digitalisation and foreign trade’,   featured topic of the Federal Council's 2019 Foreign Economic Policy Report,   published 15 January 2020, SR 20.008 (executive summary and featured topic   available in English).   8 Fields of action   opportunities, build on existing strengths and pursue foreign   policy initiatives as targeted priorities. As described in the   Foreign Policy Strategy 2020-23, coherence will play a major   part in this.   The following fields of action form the centre of Switzerland's   digital foreign policy for the current legislative period:   international law could undermine the principle under which   currently applicable international law applies in its entirety to   the digital space. The idea of a Digital Geneva Convention   has therefore yet to receive adequate support either from   governments or from the scientific community, business or   civil society.   In developing the rules and standards, there are a number   of challenges. In recent years, a polarisation has become   increasingly noticeable within the international community:   there are clear differences of opinion between countries that   advocate a centralised, state-driven understanding of the   digital soace and those in favour of a decentralised model.   At the same time, many of the issues are being discussed in   different forums, meaning they are addressed in thematic silos.   With many newly identified issues where there is potential to   adopt a position, for example Al, numerous ad hoc processes   have been started to develop rules which are not aligned.   There are also questions over the legitimacy of some of these   processes as well as a high risk that rules may contradict each   other.\" Stakeholders are able to cherry-pick the processes and   solutions that benefit them the most (‘forum shopping’), which   exacerbates this trend towards fragmentation. For Switzerland,   it is important that there are processes and structures in place   that enable as many countries as possible to make a substantial   contribution in this area. This is a fundamental requirement for   finding a fair and legitimate solution that is accepted over the   long term.   11. In 2020, the UN identified approximately 160 different ethical Al policies in   organisations and in countries around the world..    Thematic areas   1. Moderate regulation   Wherever possible, new rules should not be created, but   instead existing rules should be applied to the digital space.   Only in cases when gaps are identified in existing inter-   national rules should Switzerland support the creation of   supplementary or additional rules. This prevents an issue   being unnecessarily regulated or over-regulated and also   ensures that existing international law is not undermined.   A standard applies for as long as it remains in force and is   not otherwise amended or supplemented. Switzerland is   involved in these processes as a constructive force in order   to uphold the practical application of existing standards   under international law. It follows the principle of techno-   logical neutrality, focusing on regulating the conduct of the   various actors and not the technology itself. Switzerland is   in favour of a moderate approach which promotes and   does not stifle the potential of new technologies, while at   the same time counteracting specific risks.   . Capacity-building   Switzerland supports capacity-building in developing   countries in the areas of digital technologies and cyber-   security. So that countries are able to implement the   standards and rules that are developed and their citizens   and foreign nationals residing on their territory are able   to benefit from the advantages that digitalisation brings,   they must have the necessary capacities, which include   both the ability to develop strategies and policies as well   as specific technical expertise. In this regard Switzerland   works closely with multilateral partners such as the devel-   opment banks.   3. International Geneva   In line with its Foreign Policy Strategy 2020-23, the   Federal Council aims to position Switzerland and specif-   ically International Geneva as a leading centre for debate   on digitalisation and technology. It is working to attract   institutional pillars of any future digital governance archi-   tecture to Geneva and to strengthen existing institutions,   such as the Secretariat of the UN Internet Governance   Forum (IGF). With CERN, International Geneva played a   major role in initiating the development of the internet.   The Geneva Internet Platform (GIP) provides various actors   with a key platform to expand their expertise in digital   issues and thus promote targeted political dialogue on the   subject. The aim is to further strengthen the GIP’s position   in implementing the UN secretary-general’s roadmap.   A multi-stakeholder approach should be followed so   that the scientific community, business, civil society and   technical experts are involved in the digital governance   process alongside governments. International Geneva   has already launched ‘ecosystems’ involving a number of   actors covering various issues and is well positioned in this   regard. The aim is to further build on this advantage.’   . Science diplomacy   It is becoming ever more important for regulatory bodies   and developers of technology to exchange information.   Particularly in international governance forums, the latter   are still insufficiently represented by reason of historical   processes and structures. In establishing the Geneva   Science and Diplomacy Anticipator (GESDA), the Federal   Council is specifically promoting a dialogue between   scientific and diplomatic experts on the social challenges   posed by new technologies, in particular in the area of   digitalisation. The FDFA also supports initiatives such as the   Geneva Science-Policy Interface (GSPI), which is headquar-   tered in Geneva and promotes cooperation between the   city’s universities and international actors.   12 See Annex 5.    4.2 Prosperity and sustainable development  Digitalisation opens up new opportunities particularly for   export-oriented, resource-poor countries, which are therefore   dependent on innovation, such as Switzerland. The aim is for   Switzerland to be one of the most competitive business and   research locations in the world. As a highly developed and   globally integrated economy, Switzerland can also benefit from   the opportunities that digitalisation opens up in foreign markets   as well as access to high-quality digital services. Digitalisation   is increasingly shaping global supply chains, in which the Swiss   economy is highly integrated. Harmonised international rules, for   example on cross-border data flows, play a key role in ensuring   that these supply chains operate smoothly and that goods and   services are traded with as little discrimination as possible. It is   equally important that personal data and intellectual property   are properly protected and that companies and infrastructures   are protected against cyberattacks and industrial espionage.   Ultimately the aim is to achieve standards in the areas of data   protection and security that are as globally effective as possible.   Regional approaches to the regulation of the digital space, in   particular at a European level, also play a significant role for   Switzerland, which has an interest in ensuring that divergent   standards do not create barriers to trade. Alongside data flows,   access to big data is becoming increasingly relevant for research   and innovation. It is therefore essential to put in place trans-   parent structures for the use and forwarding of data to enable   the development of innovative applications and increase added   value.   Being able to rapidly exchange information and data facilitates   scientific, economic and social innovations, which can be applied   in various areas. This makes a key contribution to the universal   implementation of the 2030 Agenda and helps make it possible   to measure progress towards achieving the Sustainable Devel-   opment Goals. To realise the 2030 Agenda, it is also necessary   to have a broad-functioning digital network which provides   access to as many users as possible as well as equal access to   data as a key commodity for digital innovation. Cross-border   data traffic should be as unfettered as possible.   Digitalisation has the potential to bring about fundamental   economic and social change, which led to it being defined as one   of the priorities in the IC Strategy 2021-24. Digital technology is   relevant to development in two respects:   Firstly, digital tools are used as part of the IC projects and   programmes to better achieve the development goals more   efficiently and quickly. Digital data and applications are driving   development-related and humanitarian innovation across the   globe. This focuses on the benefits for people and their needs   in order to achieve the goals set out in the IC Strategy 2021-24   and the 2030 Agenda. The FDFA’s commitment to exploiting   the full potential of new technologies in combating poverty is   brought together in its Tech4Good approach.   10 Fields of action   Secondly, it relates to the digital transformation of partner   countries so that they can make use of digitalisation in their   economies, societies and administrations for the benefit of   their entire resident population. There are various challenges   in this regard: for example, digitalisation can result in disruptive   technological leaps, which above all increase the probability of   automation of routine tasks, posing a threat to jobs in those   areas. At the same time, however, such changes can lead to   new employment opportunities. Factors such as a lack of   access to the internet, information and technologies, high costs   or inadequate skills to make use of the possible applications   prevent many people in developing countries from successfully   using these technologies. According to the UN, only 19% of   people in the least developed countries currently have access to   the internet (in developed countries, this figure is 87%).'? The   main obstacle in this regard is still the high cost of mobile and   telecommunications, which is why the UN is calling for increased   cooperation with investors.   As part of the IC strategy, it is ultimately necessary to improve   people's skills in these locations so they can make use of the   applications related to development. Unequal access to the   internet also carries a risk that social and economic inequality   will grow further, both within and between countries (the digital   divide) — which will impede development potential. A gender   gap is emerging particularly in the least developed countries but   also in middle-income nations: compared to men, 43% fewer   women in the least developed countries have access to the   internet.'4   Switzerland is working with the World Bank, the International   Monetary Fund, the OECD and the regional development banks   to ensure that full use is made of the opportunities offered   by new technologies. Switzerland benefits from exchanging   knowledge with these organisations on digitalisation.   In addition to potential in the development sector, techno-   logical progress has always had a significant impact on the   environment. The same is true for digitalisation. Although   there are risks associated with increased resource or energy   consumption, digitalisation also offers new possibilities for   environmental monitoring, resource distribution and sustainable   shaping of the economy.   13. UN secretary-general’s roadmap, p. 6.   14 UN secretary-general’s roadmap, p. 11., and OHCHR HRBDT Submission    Thematic areas   1. Cross-border data flows and digital trade   The way the digital economy is regulated is changing rapidly   and unevenly across the world, at national and regional   levels. It is therefore of paramount importance to develop   common minimum standards that provide as level a playing   tield as possible for all market participants. Switzerland is   therefore committed to the negotiations that began in May   2019 on a plurilateral initiative to clarify and supplement   WTO rules governing digital trade. The objective of the   negotiations is to promote digital trade by avoiding unnec   essary barriers to trade and unjustified protectionism, while   at the same time developing common basic principles for   domestic regulation. Within the framework of the Council   of Europe, Switzerland has also actively promoted the   modernisation of its data protection convention.   . Reliable data spaces   Switzerland depends on being able to access high-quality   data in order to develop innovative applications and build   its reputation as a place to carry out research. At present,   much of this data is in the hands of a limited number of   actors, which hampers innovation and free competition.   Switzerland is therefore committed to creating reliable,   decentralised data spaces at the international level. The   aim is to help shape innovative models for the data   economy, generate high-quality data and data spaces,   and to make these accessible to Swiss actors (see also the   section on digital self-determination).   . Fintech   Digital financial technology and currencies hold great   potential for Switzerland as a financial centre and business   location. They are becoming more important not only with   respect to international cooperation. They contribute to the   competitiveness of the Swiss financial centre and strengthen   its role in the global economy. They can also be used to   attract larger sections of the population into the banking   system, helping to reduce the informal sector. In future,   for example, cost-effective services based on blockchain or   distributed ledger technology could be offered that allow   economic migrants to transfer money more easily back to   their families in their home countries. Innovative financial   technologies and services also provide SMEs with easier   access to finance. Moreover, new financing models can   actually strengthen the competitiveness of SMEs and start-   ups. With its expertise in this area, Switzerland is working   to exploit the full potential of such applications while   keeping risks to a minimum. Taxation of the digital economy   is ultimately an important focus area for the OECD, and   Switzerland plays an active part in its work in this regard,   aiming to ensure that, as a rule, taxation continues to take   place where the value added is generated.   4. Use of innovative technologies for sustainable   development/Tech4Good   Switzerland makes use of digital applications to promote   prosperity and sustainable development, and in the area   of sustainable finance, it is strengthening its position as a   leading location in the use of digital technologies. There   are significant application possibilities in the field of interna-   tional cooperation: Fintech solutions can allow smallholder   farmers in remote areas, for example, to transfer money   using their mobile phones, while digital applications can   also increase political participation and make public admin-   istration more efficient, transparent and user-friendly. In   developing countries, SMEs can be better integrated into   international value chains and trading systems thanks to   digitalisation processes. Data from satellites or drones   can be used to forecast natural disasters more precisely   and improve the calculations underlying crop insurance.   In the area of peacebuilding, big data analysis can help   identify conflict situations at an early stage, while digitali-   sation enables humanitarian aid providers to save lives and   reduce suffering more quickly and efficiently. During crises,   people’s needs can be identified and responded to more   quickly and precisely. Moreover, digital technologies can   make it easier to search for missing persons. Switzerland   intends to further raise its profile by facilitating the creation   of secure, reliable data storage and through the Humani-   tarian Data and Trust Initiative aimed at data responsibility   in humanitarian action.   . Availability and compatibility of data   Switzerland is committed to closer cooperation between   the private and public sectors in order to standardise data   sets and interfaces and make data more usable. It also   promotes the reliability, compatibility and comparability of   data. Precise and timely information is essential in shaping   effective, fact-based international policy across all areas,   such as peace and security, sustainable development and   humanitarian aid.    4.3 Cybersecurity  Cyberespionage, attacks on critical infrastructure, digital   crime, disinformation and propaganda are on the rise, with   cyberattacks having caused more than USD 45 billion of   damage worldwide in 2018.'\"° The increased dependency   of society, businesses and individuals on digital technology   makes us more vulnerable to these attacks. This means an   additional security risk for Switzerland, its citizens, its insti-   tutions and the services they provide as well as companies   and organisations based here. This vulnerability also reduces   people’s trust in these networks. States are increasingly trying   to impose rights of control over what was actually intended   to be a global network, which limits its openness and reduces   trust in it.   The digital space is increasingly becoming a field for military   operations, with its globally connected nature, the complexity   and anonymity of the internet, and the constant increase in   the number of users also raising the risk of criminal activ-   ities. Highly innovative countries such as Switzerland are   disproportionately affected by these risks as well as industrial   espionage. An increase in intelligence-related cyberactivities   ultimately leads to the risk of political processes being influ-   enced. The potential for these attacks alone can undermine   general trust in networks and, consequently, in the political   and economic structures of a country. These trends are   accentuated in light of increasing geopolitical tensions.   15 Cyber Incident & Breach Trends Report 20184   12 Fields of action   For countries such as Switzerland, it is not an option to close   themselves off from the global network, simply for reasons   of size and competitiveness. This means that cybersecurity   concerns Switzerland in two respects: firstly, to guarantee the   physical and data security of its citizens — both in Switzerland   and abroad — its institutions, companies and organisations;   and secondly, to safeguard and provide access to an internet   that is as open, free and secure as possible. The National   strategy for the protection of Switzerland against cyber risks   for 2018-22 contains measures for prevention, for coping   with incidents, for improving resilience to cyber risks and for   strengthening international cooperation.    Thematic areas   1. Specification of standards under international law   Switzerland intends to step up its cybersecurity and specify   standards under international law. In 2015, the UN GGE   developed eleven voluntary norms of responsible state   behaviour in the digital space, which supplement existing   international law. Switzerland is in favour of international   law being fully recognised, observed and enforced in   the digital space. It is making clarifications regarding the   specific application of the rules at a national level and in   cooperation with other states. International humanitarian   law will also continue to apply. With its humanitarian   tradition, Switzerland is well positioned to make a credible   contribution towards the specification of the applicable   rules in the digital space. This includes seeking to work   more closely with the International Committee of the Red   Cross (ICRC) on the protection of civilians in the digital   space during armed conflicts.   . Inclusion of private actors   At a global level, there is no consensus on mandatory   standards of conduct in the digital space, which is   detrimental to cybersecurity. States cannot guarantee   the security, freedom and stability of the digital space   on their own; private-sector actors play a prominent   role in this regard with their products and _ services.   Switzerland is therefore in favour of a multi-stakeholder   approach. At the start of 2018, it launched the Geneva   Dialogue on Responsible Behaviour in Cyberspace and is   now working on building a broadly diversified dialogue   between companies around the world. The aim of this is   to establish best practices in the area of product resilience,   for example. In doing so, Switzerland is filling a void as   there was previously no global dialogue on this subject.   3. Confidence-building measures   Confidence-building measures help promote transparency   and cooperation between states so as to avoid any   potential misunderstandings or escalations in the digital   space. One example of this is the exchange of information   concerning forthcoming or current cyber-operations.   Thanks to its neutrality and its history as a location for   peace talks, Switzerland is able to play a key role in imple-   menting confidence-building measures in the digital space.   To facilitate the implementation of the current measures,   it can draw on experiences gained at a regional level, for   example within the Organization for Security and Co-op-   eration in Europe (OSCE). The list of measures developed   by the OSCE, to which Switzerland made a significant   contribution, was approved by all 57 participating states.   . Good offices   There are many opportunities for Switzerland in the area of   good offices. As Switzerland is not a member of the EU or   NATO, it is able to bring its experience and credibility from   the offline world into the online world. It must strengthen   or build up the competencies required for this purpose.   International Geneva plays a key role in this regard. Given   the increasing trend towards bloc-building and digital   geopolitics, there is a need for mediators who are able   to build confidence and put in place a framework of trust   for discussing cybersecurity. In terms of peacebuilding,   Switzerland promotes the development and responsible   use of digital technologies (‘peacetech’).    %, 4 s = y ay ay 8 x ms pS, ae x 8 ¢ < >  es os 2 SB gee abs os 8 ers ea Pak ee ery Eo, ee ee  ai £6 PF PICTPP SQ, Gnrrn SI OATAa rryys I   Ao SS Baa RAR aka bb Wek AE SS Bd 4  ats = eS Pp e 5,   Digitalisation is changing the way our societies interact:   whether banking transactions, mobility, shopping, education,   sport or social contact, digital applications have become an   integral part of peopie’s everyday lives. Alongside the positive   benefits that this change brings, more and more personal   cata is being collected, which is used in a variety of ways.   It is often not clear exactly what happens to this data, and   communities and society benefit little from the insights and   econamic value that this cata could provide.   Human rights are equally valid in both the physica! and digital   worlds: they apply without Geographical restrictions both   ontine and offfine. Specifically, they protect people’s privacy   and freedom of expression. These individual rights therefore   also include the protectian of individuals against the misuse   of digital data. They ensure free communication in the digital   Space and quarantee the right to freely form opinions in the   run-up to elections anc votes, for example.   The use of digital technologies accentuates the differences   in values between states with different requiatory traditions.   Authoritarian trends are on the rise in many areas of the world,   with governments making increased use of digital tools to   restrict fundamental individual freecioms. This may include the   widespread use of facial recognition for surveillance purposes   or to control the behaviour of a population. In turn, other   systems operate in a barely regulated environment, which   enables private companies to collect, analyse or sell personal   user data without any restrictions. Given the increasingly   competitive marketplace, these companies have a limited   interest in informing users - regarcless of their nationality or   the region they live in — about how thelr data is used, and can   make it difficult or impossible for them ta have any contro!   over It. Fhere is an increasing risk that the data collected is   being misused or misinterpreted without their knowledge.   14 Fields of action   br ow  ne    .  q   tr en  t % o   Y o w  s   o n e ?    z a I r o n s    cd    *s,  %   ed    po et  a,  re   g o s    ws ,   <4    pe rl    From a Swiss perspective, technological progress cannot be   an end in itself, but must primarily focus on people, their   rights and freedoms, and thus their self-determination. This   means individuals having access to the data that has been   collected about them, being able to understand the relevance   and value of this cata, and being able to manage how the   data is used to a large extent themselves. Participating in   the digital world should no longer mean individuals have to   relinquish control over their own cata. For this to be the case,   there is a need for new, decentralised structures, which allow   individuals to actively manage the digital transformation.   individuals can cecide how to hancle their data themselves,   this will ultimately bud confidence in a sustainable data   society and allow for the creation of trustworthy data spaces.    Thematic areas   1. Swiss Cloud   Many organisations headquartered in Switzerland work   with highly confidential data, for example relating to   people in conflict zones, as is the case at the ICRC. In   April 2020, the Federal Council commissioned a study to   clarify matters in relation to a potential Swiss cloud. Such a   cloud could reduce the reliance on international providers   and guarantee legal security over the handling of data   stored in this cloud. A cloud service shaped by Swiss legal   principles could be used by Swiss citizens, institutions and   companies as well as international organisations based   here.   . Protection of individual freedom   Key aspects of the IC strategy include supporting reliable   information channels and protecting social norms on the   internet. Switzerland is committed to media freedom and   supports projects aimed at creating codes of conduct for   political parties relating to the use of social media and   combating fake news and political manipulation. It works   to ensure that individual rights are not breached as a result   of disproportionate state intervention, for example turning   off the internet. In this regard, Switzerland supports inter-   national efforts to improve understanding of the rule of   law and principles of democracy in the area of digitali-   sation.   3. Promotion of digital self-determination   To achieve a better balance between the economy, society   and the individual within the context of digitalisation and   to support the creation of an inclusive data economy,   Switzerland is committed to digital self-determination, It   intends to increase trust that data is being handled respon-   sibly. On an international level, Switzerland is reliant on   other states having a very similar understanding of values   that is based on democracy and the rule of law. The aim   is to create an international network and to play a role in   developing reliable cross-border data spaces. A network is   also to be established at national level and both networks   will contribute to a report on the feasibility of reliable data   rooms based on digital self-determination. According to   the 2020 Digital Switzerland strategy, this should be in   place by the end of 2021.   _ Al   Al offers significant opportunities for science, the economy   and society, but also poses new risks, such as Opaque or   discriminatory decision-making or a human not having final   responsibility for a decision. At present, there are numerous   projects under way that are focused on the future interna-   tional regulation of Al. Switzerland will support moderate   regulation, which promotes the use of Al, but also   counteracts specific risks. With regard to the military use   of Al, it is committed to upholding existing international   humanitarian law.'°   16 See the ‘Challenges of Artificial Intelligence’ report of the   interdepartmental working group of December 2019.    ~ g™X\\ &. = « s &   $ A cgqust RW. ght ag oe ies og oa eget, og adhe ag SR gh AR A.

Close   collaboration between various government agencies 1s Crucial   ror states. In Switzerland, this type of whole-of-government   approach can also be extended through the use of direct   democracy instruments — Le. the involvernent of actors   trom the private sector, civil society and the technical and   academic community in political decision-making - towards   a whole-of-Switzerland approach.   The conditions for this are good. With its universities,   other research facilities and innovative private companies,   Switzeriand ofters a stable anc favourable environment and   is at the forefront in the development of digital applications   and technologies. The country is armong the top countries   worldwide in terms of the number of Al start-ups per capita.   It is home to major international cornpanies tor which cigital-   isation is erther part of their core business or is increasingly   important — from finance to pharmaceuticals to engineering.   Added to this, there is an increasing number of innovatian   parks and clusters with 4 hvely start-up scene, such as Crypto   Valley around Zug and the newly launched Trust Valley in   the west of Switzerland. Utilising potential synergies wil   strengthen Switzerland's position as a digital hub.   International Geneva already plays a key role in global digital   poticy. Several key organisations in this area are based in   Geneva as the operational hub of the UN system, such as   the Secretariat of the UN Internet Governance Forum (IGF),   the International Telecommunication Union (TU), the inter-   national Organization tor Standardization (ISO), the inter-   national Electrotechnical Commission (EC) and the World   Economic Forum (WEF). Besides this digital chister, cigitall-   Sation also affects other traditional issues covered by inter-   national Geneva and has an impact on the work of other   international organisations, such as the Worid Trade Organ-   ization (WTO), the UN Human Rights Council and the ICRC.   Claser networking of these various actors can strengthen   Geneva’s role as a hub for addressing digital policy issues.   Institutions based in Geneva benefit from clase liaison with   experts, a broacdi range of conferences anc conventions, and   a solid higher education enviranment. The more expertise   there is in the ecasystem, the more Geneva and Switzerland   will attract other actors. For example, the Libra Associatian   and the Cyber Peace institute ~ which is jointly funded by   several US companies — have recently been set up in Geneva.   16 Opportunities for Switzerland as a digita leovernance hub   in the longer term, these clevelopments should be bolstered   by establishing stronger links to leading tech locations,   including through the swissnex network, which is interna-   tionally recognised.   Promoting Switzerland as a location for governance will   reguire accompanying infrastructure measures, which the   Federal Council set out in its dispatch of 20 February 2019   on measures to strengthen Switzerland’s role as a host state   during the 2020-23 period. Local stakeholders must be given   the opportunity to maximise the potential of digitalisation. {t   is therefore in Switzerlanc’s interest that the data handled by   Swiss-based international organisations is safely anc securely   stored in Switzerland. This wil not only deliver a practical   competitive edge compared with other potential nost states,   out is also cansistent with Switzerland's fundamental efforts   to combine security and hurnan rights in the digital space.   implementation of the UN Secretary-General’s Roadmap   tor Digital Cooperation also offers new opportunities. This   pioneering international document features a multi-stake-   holder approach, which ts one of Switzerland's core concerns.   it is now important to further strengthen Geneva’s digital   ecosystem, which already plays a vital role. For exarnple,   Geneva-based organisations and institutions play a key part   in each of the eight areas for action outhned in the roadmap.   Specitic ideas for the future include the UN secretary-general’s   olanned appointment of a UN special envoy on technology   (tech envoy’), establishing an international Al centre, impie-   renting digital heipdesks, fostering dialogue with investors   under the auspices of the UN to extend internet access to   around 40% of the world’s population, and strengthening   the IGF secretariat in Geneva.    = ees ‘* *  = = \"gh ABE, ote FQ SE eT Ee,   . s . . 8   Digitalisation is transforming society, business anc our daily   lives ~ but also international politics, as Gemonstrated in   this strategy. Switzerland seeks to promote its interests and   values not only in the physical world but also in the digital   space. Swiss foreign policy formulation must therefore also   extend to the virtual world.   Switzeriand has an outstanding reputation and tangible   Strengths through its proven role as a bridge-builder, its   innovative economy, cutting-edge research and its position   as @ leading centre for education, as well as International   Geneva — the epicentre of international governance. Through   its digital foreign palicy, Switzerland now seeks to tackle the   challenges outlined in this strategy and, above all, seize the   opportunities.   As illustratect in this strategy, Switzerland intends to do so   by strengthening digital governance, clarifying the standards   under international law, uthising digitalisation to drive   international cooperation and the 2030 Agenda, balstering   cybersecurity, promoting cigttal self-determination and   strengthening the role of Geneva as a digital hub. The Foreign   Policy Strategy 2020-23 establishes cigitalisation as a new   and forward-looking area of foreign policy. Over the next   four years the Federal Counci will thus pursue and promote   Switzerlana’s digital foreign policy objectives as set out in this   digital foreign policy strategy.

Switzerland recognises the 2030   Agenda as an important orientation framework. While it is   not a legally binding framework, it is a means of setting policy   objectives and forming opinions, both for domestic and for   foreign policy. It also serves as a frame of reference for digital   foreign policy (see ‘Digital foreign policy’).   Artificial intelligence: Al is a technology that combines data,   algorithms and computing power.'”   Big data: Big data are extremely large data sets that are too   large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data processing   software.   Bilateralism: When foreign policy issues are discussed or   negotiated between two parties, we talk about bilateralism. If   there are more than two parties involved, we talk about multi-   lateralism (see ‘Multilateralism’).   Blockchain: The term ‘blockchain’ refers to decentralised   collaborative data management. Multiple copies of the data   are stored on the computers of a decentralised network. A   transaction is carried out without a central authority managing   the account. The transactions are grouped in blocks and stored   unalterably.   Cloud computing: This involves the provision of IT infrastruc   tures, in particular storage, processing power and software,   via a computer network without having to be installed on the   local computer.   Coherence: This term denotes the greatest possible   consistency and coordination between a country’s different   policy areas.   Cybersecurity: Cybersecurity concerns all aspects of security   in information and communications technology. This includes   all information technology associated with the internet and   comparable networks, and incorporates communication,   applications, processes and information processed on this   basis. International cooperation between state and non-state   actors in the area of cybersecurity aims to develop and protect   an open, free and stable cyberspace. It can also reduce the   risks of cyberattacks between states.   17. See also ‘Artificial Intelligence’ guidelines of December 2019.   Data: In information technology and data processing, data   are understood to be representations of information (usually in   digital format) that can be read and processed (by a machine).   Data protection: The protection of personal data from   misuse, often in conjunction with privacy protection.   Digital divide: This describes inequalities in access to, and use   of, digital technologies.   Digital foreign policy: This term refers to the design and   implementation of foreign policy (i.e. safeguarding interests   and promoting values) in the digital space (see ‘Foreign policy’,   ‘Digital space’).   Digital governance: This refers to the establishment, shaping   and consolidation of institutional and regulatory systems and   of mechanisms for international cooperation in the digital   space (see ‘Global governance’, ‘Digital space’).   Digital self-determination: The individual should be at the   heart of digitalisation. They should be able to control and use   their data, and decide who can access it. This approach also   guarantees fundamental values such as privacy and freedom of   choice in the digital space (see ‘Data protection’). High-quality   data spaces should therefore be established, which offer social   benefits and reinforce democratic values.   Digital space: This term refers to the entire physical and virtual   Space that is opened up or permeated by digitalisation (see   ‘Digitalisation). The digital space refers not only to systems, but   also to actors and processes.   Digital technologies: These are devices, programmes or   infrastructure that enable information to be digitally processed,   stored or transmitted.   Digitalisation: The process of digitalisation involves the   integration of digital technologies in society, government and   business. Digitalisation comprises a broad range of digital appli-   cations, such as new communication technologies, robotics,   cloud computing, big data analysis, artificial intelligence and   the internet of things.   Facial recognition: A facial recognition system is a technology   capable of identifying or verifying the identity of a person on   the basis of a digital image or video frame.   Fake news: This refers to false stories that are soread with the   intent of misleading or manipulating. Such content can quickly   reach a wide audience on social media.   Annex 2: Glossary 19    Fintech: This term is cerived from financial technology and   comprises innovations in the fleld of tinancial services that   result in new financial instruments, services or business rnodels,   €.g. blockchain,   Foreign policy: Foreign policy shapes the relations of a   state with other states and international organisations and   Sateguards a state’s interests abroad. In Switzerland, the   entire Federal Council is responsible for foreign palicy. The   Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) is responsible for   coordinating foreign policy and ensuring coherence with other   cepartments (see ‘Coherence’.   Geneva Conventions: The four Geneva Conventions of   1949 and their two Additional Protecals of 1977, as well as   the Additional Protocol of 2005, form the core of international   humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts (see ‘Interna-   tional humanitarian law’}. Amang other things, they protect   peopie who are not or are no longer taking part in hostilities   and govern the conduct of war.   Giobal governance: This term refers to the development   of an institutional and requiatory system and of mechanisms   for international cooperation to tackle global problems and   cross-border matters. It involves the UN system, international   organisations, state- and non-state actors and regional organ-   isations. Switzerland plays a key role in this and International   Geneva is one of the key centres (see ‘international Geneva’).   Good offices: This is an umbrella term to describe the efforts   of a third party to peacefully settle a conflict between two or   more states.   Host state: This term describes a country that hosts foreign   representations (embassies, missions, consulates) or interna-   tional organisations. Switzerland -- ancl Geneva in particular   (see ‘International Geneva’) - hosts a multitude of interna-   tlonal organisations.   international cooperation GC}: international cooperation   comprises the activities of hurnanitarian aid, develoormert   cooperation and peacebuilding.   international Geneva: Geneva js the heart of the multilateral   system and the location of the UN's European neaciquarters.   Thirty-eight international organisations, programmes anc   funds, as well as 779 states and 750 NGOs are represented   there. International Geneva provides 45,000 jobs and   contributes more than 17% to the GDP of the canton (1%   of Swiss GDP). Around 3,300 international conferences are   held in Geneva every year, the main themes of which are: 1)   peace, security, disarmament; 2) humanitarian aid and inter-   national humanitarian law, human rights, migration; 3) labour,   economy, trace, science, telecommunication; 4) health; 5) the   environment and sustainable development.   20 Annex 2: Glossary   internet governance: Iniernet governance is the devel-   opment and application of shared principles, norms, rules,   decision-making proceclures, and programmes that shape the   evolution and use of the internet (see ‘Global governance’).   international humanitarian law: International hurmani-   tarian law governs the concuct of hostilities and protects the   victims of armed conflicts. Ht applies in all international and   non-international armed conflicts, regardless of the legitimacy   or cause of the use of force.   international law: International law is the result of collab-   oration between states and requiates how they coexist.   t underpins peace and security and aims to ensure the   orotection and well-being of persons. international law   comprises different areas, such as the prohibition of the use   of force, human rights, protection of individuals Guring armed   conflicts (see ‘International hurnanitarian law’}, prevention   and prosecution of war crimes, crimes against humanity,   genocide, transnational organised crime and terrorism. it also   regulates other areas, such as the environment, trade, devel-   opment, telecomrnunications and transport. On account of   the sovereignty of states, international law only applies for   each state insofar as it has agreed to adopt certain interna-   tional obligations. This exciudes mandatory international law,   which comprises basic standards that no state may override,   such as the prohibition of genocide. International law also   applies in the digital soace (see ‘Digital space’).   Human rights: Hurnan rights are inherent and inalienable   rights that all people enjoy without distinction by virtue   of their being human. They are crucial to the protection of   human dignity, physical ancl psychological integrity and are an   important foundation for the development of every individual.   They are the basis of the peaceful coexistence of nations. They   are guarantors of a saciety based on the obligation to respect   the nghts of the individual. They apply in both international   relations and domestic policy, but aiso at the place of residence   of every individual and in the digital space. Human rights are   universal, indivisible and interrelated. Every state is obliged to   respect, protect and implement human rights.   Multtateralism: Multilateralism is when issues of public   interest are discussed anc negotiated between more than two   States (see also ‘Bilateralism’).   Multi-stakeholder approach: This refers to the idea that as   many relevant stakeholders as possible should be involved in   decisions and regulatory efforts.    Rule of law: The rule of law refers to the supremacy of law   aver the rule of might. At nationa! level, the fundamental   objective of the rule of law is to safequard the primacy of the   law at all levels of government and to protect the associated   freedom of citizens. in terms of foreign policy, the rule of law   is crucial to international peace and security, economic and   social progress, development and the protection of human   rights and treedorns. it is primarily achieved by strengthening   international law, which guarantees political stability anct the   rellability of international relations (see ‘International law’).   Science diplomacy: This terrns refers to, for example, the use   of scientific collaboration oetween states to address common   problems and to develop international partnerships. At the   interface between science, technology and foreign policy,   articulating issues and objectives from a scientific perspective   can support contidence-bullding and stimulate both bilateral   and miultilateral discussions. Science ciplornacy is also an   important approach in digttal foreign policy, especially at the   muttlatera! level.   Social media: Sacial media enables users to participate in   social networking, and to share content via digital media. it   allows users not only to consume, but also to create their own   content.   Sustainability: Switzerland pramotes sustainable devel-   opment on the basis of the Federal Constitution. It uses the   definition formulated by the Brundtland Commission in 1987   as “develooment that meets the needs of the present without   compromising the ability of future generations to meet their   awn needs.” The principle was substantiated in the 17 goals of   the 2030 Agenda in 2015 (see ‘2030 Agenda’).   Tech4Good: This term refers to the use of digital technol-   ogies within the framewark of international cooperation (see   ‘International cooperation ((C)). Digital technologies and   technical innovations offer many opportunities to improve   living conditions worldwide. Switzerland promotes thei use in   international cooperation in order to deliver an the sustainable   development goals more quickly or in a more broad-based   and cost-effective manner For example, new technologies   can help allevate need and poverty, tackle global challenges   such as climate change, and contribute to better governance.   New technologies also involve risks, which is why Switzerland   combines tts innovation transfer with training measures, for   example.   Annex 2: Glossary 21    Annex 3: Conceptual basis   Dispatch of 29 January 2020  on the legislative programme  for 2019-23 (de/fr/it) (link 4)   > The Federal Council sets out the priorities of its agenda   for the 2019-23 legislative period in three guiding princi-   ples and 18 objectives.   > For the first time, the topic of digitalisation was included   in one of the guiding principles: “Switzerland will secure   its sustained prosperity and utilise the opportunities of   digitalisation.”   > The topic of digitalisation is also incorporated in four ob-   jectives:   e Objective 2: “The federal government will perform its   state activities efficiently and digitally where possible.”   e Objective 3: “Switzerland will ensure optimal and stable   economic conditions that encourage innovation in the   digital age, and will support the domestic workTorce.”   e Objective 5: “Switzerland will remain at the forefront of   education, research and innovation and will utilise the   opportunities of digitalisation.”   e Objective 18: “The federal government will counter   cyber risks, and support and implement measures to   protect citizens and critical infrastructures.”   > The topic of digitalisation has thus been upgraded in   relation to the legislative programme for 2015-19. The   Swiss parliament added an additional objective to the 16   objectives for the legislative period: “Switzerland will en-   sure favourable conditions so that digitalisation can help   safeguard and increase prosperity.”   22 Annex 3: Conceptual basis   Digital Switzerland strategy of  11 September 2020 (link &)   > Switzerland's strategic goals for the digital space have   been regularly updated — and adapted to reflect increas-   ing digitalisation — since the first Federal Council strategy   for an information society back in 1998.   > The current Federal Council Digital Switzerland strategy   of September 2020 sets out the federal government's   principles and key objectives of its national and interna-   tional commitment.   The principles are:   e To put people at the centre   e To provide room for development   e To facilitate structural change   e To create networked transformation processes   The key objectives are:   ¢ To enable equal participation of all and strengthen solidarity   e To ensure security, trust and transparency   e To further strengthen people’s digital empowerment and   self-determination   e To ensure added value, growth and prosperity   e To reduce the environmental footprint and energy con-   sumption   ‘International engagement’ is one of nine fields of action. The   Federal Council states that in a thematic follow-up strategy to   the FPS 2020-23 it will explain the concept of digital foreign   policy, specify the corresponding FPS guidelines and define   the individual foreign policy fields of action.    Foreign Policy Strategy 2020-23  of 29 January 2020 (link &)   > In accordance with the legislative programme, the   Federal Council defined digitalisation as one of   four thematic focus areas of Swiss foreign policy:   “Switzerland will raise its profile in global efforts to con-   solidate digital governance. It will further develop its   digital foreign policy and position Geneva as a leading   location for debate on digitalisation and technology. In   its digital foreign policy, it advocates the inclusion of all   relevant stakeholders. It will contribute to finding new   solutions and pursue the goal of an open and secure dig-   ital soace which is based on international law and which   revolves around people and their needs.”   > On this point, it set out five objectives:   e Objective 1: “Switzerland will bring together actors from   all stakeholder groups to clarify responsibilities in the   digital space and to develop new governance models. It   will play a key role as a bridge-builder in the implementa-   tion of the recommendations of the UN Secretary-Gen-   eral’s High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation.”   e Objective 2: “Switzerland will advocate appropriate   framework conditions in a global digitalisation and data   policy that promote access to and use of data for social   and economic development. Democratic self-determina-   tion, the rule of law and respect for human rights must   continue to be guaranteed. For this purpose, Switzerland   will establish an international network to promote digital   self-determination. It will further develop its cooperation   with the EU and utilise the opportunities of a common   European data space and a digital single market.”   Objective 3: “Switzerland will promote the role of Ge-   neva as a hub for global digital and technology policy. It   will strengthen existing forums, such as the Geneva In-   ternet Platform, the GESDA foundation and the Geneva   Dialogue. It will also step up cooperation with research   institutes in other cantons.”   e Objective 4: “Switzerland will enhance its digital di-   plomacy profile. It will support international confi-   dence-building to minimise risks. The principle of ‘law   before power’ also applies in the virtual world, which   is why Switzerland is supporting initiatives to clarify the   application of intertional law in cyberspace.”   e Objective 5: “Switzerland will support developing coun-   tries in the use of new technologies and in handling the   associated risks. It is committed to reducing the negative   environmental impacts of commodities extraction and   will promote the use of new technologies to prevent hu-   manitarian crises. It will create the necessary vehicles to   promote humanitarian innovation at all levels. In collabo-   ration with selected partners such as the ICRC, it will de-   velop a framework to protect digital humanitarian data.”   National strategy of 18 April 2018 for the  protection of Switzerland against cyber  risks (NCS) for the period 2018-22 (link 4)   > The strategy builds on the first NCS (2012-17) and supple-   ments it with new measures so that it reflects the current   threat level. It was drawn up in collaboration with busi-   nesses, cantonal authorities and universities and forms the   basis of the collective efforts needed to reduce cyber risks.   > The NCS states that Switzerland is committed to interna-   tional cooperation to increase cybersecurity, promoting   dialogue on cybersecurity policy, participating actively in   international expert bodies,and cultivating exchange with   other states and international organisations to optimally   safeguard Swiss interests.   > Three measures are set out in the sphere of action ‘Active   positioning of Switzerland in international cybersecurity   policy’:   e Measure 1: “Active shaping of and participation in   processes of foreign cybersecurity policy.”   e Measure 2: “International cooperation to build and   expand cybersecurity capacities.”   e Measure 3: “Bilateral political consultations and multilat-   eral dialogues on foreign cybersecurity policy.”   ‘Digitalisation and foreign trade’,  featured topic of the Federal Council’s  2019 Foreign Economic Policy Report,  published 15 January 2020 (link 4)   > The Federal Council highlights the effects of digitalisation   on the international economy, in particular on cross-border   value chains, as well as the pressure placed on the global   trading system to adapt.   > Furthermore, the Federal Council sets out the fields of ac   tion in foreign economic policy and trade diplomacy at the   multilateral and bilateral levels, and underscores the impor-   tance of regulatory interoperability with important trading   partners.   > For the Federal Council, the overriding goal is to exploit the   potential of increased productivity in the digital age as an   important driver of economic growth and to ensure the   highest possible labour force participation and high-quality   jobs.

They can be split into five levels:   > Atthe highest level are the provisions of general inter-   national law. These include customary international law   (e.g. the rules on state jurisdiction such as the territorial   principle). They also include the major multilateral treaties   (e.g. the UN charter, WTO agreements on trade in goods   and services, human rights treaties or — in the case of   armed conflicts — international humanitarian law). Finally,   they also include general legal principles (e.g. good faith).   All these general provisions of international law also apply   in the digital space.   > In addition to these general provisions, there are also   numerous specific international agreements. On the   one hand there are a large number of treaties and agree-   ments which were drawn up before digitalisation, but   which are relevant to the digital space. Bilateral mutual   legal assistance treaties are one example. Among other   things, they regulate the conditions and procedures by   which Swiss prosecution authorities can access evidence   obtained abroad. In principle, this also applies to digital   data. On the other hand, there are agreements which   deal with a specific aspect of the digital space. One ex-   ample is Convention 108 of the Council of Europe for the   Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Pro-   cessing of Personal Data.   > Decrees adopted by states and organisations can also   have international significance in the digital space, e.g.   the US CLOUD Act and the EU’s General Data Protec   tion Regulation. While they are not applicable de jure for   States like Switzerland, they may have de facto relevance.   > Soft law instruments also already exist, mainly estab-   lished for issues specifically relating to the digital space.   One example are the reports of the UN Governmental   Group of Experts, which adopted a set of non-legal-   ly-binding guidelines to promote responsible state behav-   iour in the digital space.   > In terms of best practices, benchmarking and tech-   nical standards, there are many instruments that gen-   erally contain specific legally non-binding regulations for   the digital space. One example would be ISO standards,   which set standards for the necessary digital infrastruc   ture.   This five-level body of international rules and standards   for the digital space can be illustrated as follows:   General international law       Specific international agreements in a given area   Decrees adopted by states or organisations with de facto   international relevance   Soft law   Best practices, benchmarking, technical standards   Challenges in the application  of these rules and standards   There are three key challenges in the application of the   existing international rules and standards:   > The first challenge is the application of international   law provisions that were established before dig-   italisation to the digital space. This applies to both   general provisions and to specific agreements. For exam-   ple, there are no clear territorial boundaries in the digital   space. Application of the territorial principle is therefore   a challenge, as several territories may be affected by a   behaviour in the digital soace and various states could   thus claim regulatory authority. At the same time, it must   be possible to separate state competences in the digital   space. In the context of mutual legal assistance treaties,   it is often unclear whether the location where the data is   stored is relevant, or the location where the technology   company holding the data is incorporated. The custom-   ary contractually-agreed points of contact and processes   for accessing evidence obtained abroad may face limita-   tions in this respect. Clarification is thus often needed   regarding how the provisions of customary international   law should be applied under the special conditions of the   digital space.   Annex 4: International rules and standards 25    <p   —>   29   The second challenge is that it is not only states that   are present in the digital space, but aso numerous   new players, which means that large parts of the in-   frastructure of the digital space are operated by private   companies. This raises questions about precisely which   provisions of the international bady of rules - which was   largely established for states ~ these actors are subject to,   and where they themselves can help shape these rules   and standards.   The third challenge fies in linking up the various levels of   the international body of rules so they contain coherent   and predictable requiations for all actors. This particularly   apolies to the linking of technical standards to legal   requirements: if legal requirements cannot be imple-   mented in the digital space owing to contrary technical   Standards, these requirements are simply empty words.   This is therefore also about implementing the internation-   al rules and standards.   Annex 4: International rules and standards   Important ongoing processes to  clarify and further develop the  international rules and standards   Given the stated challenges in implementing the international   rules and standards, they need to be clarified and developed   by sub-area. This should bring greater iegal certainty for all   parties. Such clarification and development processes   apply to all levels of the international body of rules.   Key examples of ongoing processes to clarity and develop   the international rules and standards are:   3% WTO e-commerce negotiations: 82 WTO member   States nave been conclucting pluriateral talks since 2019   with a view to developing specific e-commerce requia-   tions,   > CECB/G26 project on taxation of the digital econo-   my: in 2019, the OECD publisned a work prograrame on   the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the   economy. The guidelines are designed to apply to the en-   tire digital econory.   > Open-ended Working Group (OEWG) 2019-20/UN   Group of Governmental Experts (UN-GGE} 2019-21:   Both UN working groups are looking at current develap-   ments in the field of cyoersecurity. Part of the UN-GGE   rnandate is to develop national positions on international   law for the final report in 2021.   % Development of an international convention on cy-   bercrime: The UN General Assembly has planned nego-   tiations with the goal of developing an international con-   vention on cybercrime.

Below is an extract of key actors, forums and processes in the   telds outlined in the strategy.   Covernance   Global forums and processes   UN World Summit on the Information   Society / WSIS process   Fhe UN World Summit on the information Society (WSIS)   was held in two phases, in 2003 in Geneva and in 2005 in   Tunis, during which the international community was able to   agree on an initial comprehensive UN vision for dealing with   digital technology. Switzerland played a key role in shaping   both WSIS meetings and helped to promote acceptance   with respect to the involvement of business, science and   civil society in digital governance. The UN Working Group   on Internet Governance (2004-05), whose secretariat was   headed by a Swiss national, was likewise instrumental in this   respect. The WSIS follow-up process is primarily supported   by the annual WSIS Forum in Geneva (organised by the Inter-   national Telecommunication Union (ITU), United Nations   Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO),   United Nations Conference on Trade and Development   (UNCTAD) and United Nations Development Programme   (UNDP) and supported by Switzerland) as well as the United   Nations Commission on Science and Technology for Devel-   opment (UN CSTD), in which Switzerland will have a seat   until 2024. Evaluations of the WSIS outcomes are conducted   on a periodic basis, with the most recent having taken place   in 2015 (WS1S+10) anc the next planned for 2025 (WS1S420).   UN Internet Governance Forum /  IGF (secretariat in Geneva}   The annual IGF is the most important outcome of the WSIS   oracess. if is open to all interested parties and is now the   world’s largest global muiti-stakencider dialogue platform   on issues relating to digitalisation, ranging frorn technical,   economic and regulatory topics to subjects such as cyberse-   curity, the handling of social and traditional media, human   rights and development aspects. The IGF secretariat is based   in Geneva and the preparatory meetings for the annual IGF   are also held in Geneva. The IGF itself is held on an annual   basis at different locations around the world.   switzerland has helped in shaping the oottorn-up structure   of the IGF anc played a key role in the successful launch   of the IGF with its initial funding. After the IGF fell inta a   state of crisis from 2015, suffering a decline in terms of both   rnarnmentum and importance, Switzerland stepped in as host   country in 2017 and contributed ta the IGF’s revitalisation.   The IGF is now well positioned once more. Over the years,   the number of participants has increased from around 7,000   initially to almost 5,000 (IGF Berlin 2019}. The IGF mandate   has to be extended within the context of the WSIS evalua-   tions.   Since the first IGF, which took place in Athens in 2006, a   number of national and regional IGF structures, now totalling   more than 100, nave spontaneously been established. The   largest initiative after the giobal 1GF is the European Dialogue   on internet Governance (EuroDlG), which was launched   in 2008 with the involvernent of Switzerland. Since 2015,   switzerland nas also been home to the Swiss 1GF, which   is coordinated by the Federal Office of Communications   (OFCOM).   Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes 27    High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation   and UN secretary-general’s roadmap   On the initistive of Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates   and private stakeholders, the UN secretary-general launched   the High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation (HLP} in 2018.   The panel’s final report, which was presented in 2019,   contains five recommendations for improving global digital   cooperation, including the use of the digital transformatian   for the achievament of the UN's Sustainable Development   Goals 2030 Agenda}, consolidating existing efforts aimed   at securing the digital snace anc further developing digital   governance architecture,   Switzerland anc International Geneva played a key role in the   content of the work performed by the KLP. The panel was   co-financed py Switzerland, the secretariat was jointly based   in New York and Geneva and the director of the Geneva   Internet Platform acted as co-head of the secretariat. One of   the two official meetings of the HLP took place in Geneva.   Former Federal Councillor Doris Leuthard was one of the   panel’s 22 members and as head of the working group on   the principles, functions and mechanisms of digital cooper-   ation and governance she played a key role in shaping the   corresponding recommendations.   Fallowing the publication of the panel's report, a follow-up   process lasting arounc one year was cornmenced, during   which the recommendations were discussed further as part of   roundtable discussions. Switzerland was involved in several of   these. Based on the feedback from this consultation process,   the UN secretary-general presented his Roadmap for Digital   Cooperation at the start of June, outlining the next practical   steps. Focus areas include improved access to the internet   and public digital goods (data, open-source software, etc),   greater capacity-bullding in developing countries, protection   of human nghts, the strengthening of cybersecurity and the   promotion of inclusive governance models. In his roadmap,   the UN secretary-genera! also announced the appointment   of a ‘tech envoy’ for 2021.   28 Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes   European Union / EU   Digitalisation is a key area of the EU Commission’s work   programme. In its communication of 19 February 2020, the   Carnamission set out its guidelines and objectives for Europe's   digital future: (} @ digital stratecy that contains the key   measures of the EU; (2) a data strategy that should ensure   the free movement of data; (3) a White Paper on Artificial   intelligence (Al) that aims to increase quality and trust in   dealing with Ai. Accarding to this, the existing opportu-   nities presented by digitalisation snould de better utilised in   future in order to make the EU a leading global pravicier of   corresponding technologies and services (keyword: strategic   autonomy) as weil as a standard-setter. On the domestic   front, the EU wishes to exploit the economic and social   potential offered by digitalisation, thus allowing the single   rnarket to generate greater growth and prosperity. The   Commission has already comrnunicated that in future it also   wants to make market access, both in the area of data and Al   products, dependent on whether the legal basis with respect   to data protection is considered equivalent to EU regulations.   As a European country, Switzerland also follows a digitall-   sation palicy that aims to allow for the economic and social   potential of technologies to be tapped, while at the sarne   time respecting individual rights to the greatest possible   extent. For Switzerland, a strengthening of these values,   aspecially at a muittateral level, would be important. Located   at the heart of Europe, Geneva aims to be the leading global   hub for the development of digital governance.   World Economic Forum (Geneva)   The World Economic Forum, which is based in Geneva,   also deals with various topics related to digital governance.   it brings together expertise from the realms of politics,   business and civil society through publications, forums and   oraject wark. The Forum also has an important role to play   in putting issues on the global agenda. In the area of digitali-   sation, arnong other things, it examines questions relating to   internet access (e.g. Global information Technology Report),   digital cormmerce, cybercrime, cybersecurity, the impact of   digitalisation on society and the world of work as weil as   support for states in developing Al strategies. in 2016, the   Forum opened the Centre for the Fourth industrial Revolution   in San Francisco, which is dedicated to promoting global   dialogue about the impact of scientific and technological   changes on society and the economy woridwide. In 2019,   the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) concluded   a mernorandum of understanding with the Forum, which   also foresees greater cooperation in the area of digitalisation.   The World Economic Forum Centre for Cybersecurity is an   observer at the Geneva Dialogue on Responsible Behaviour   in Cyberspace.    Global support mechanisms   Geneva Internet Platform /   DiploFoundation (Geneva)   The Geneva internet Platform (GIP) serves as a neutral infor-   ration and discussion platform on all aspects of digita   governance and organises briefings and capacity building   courses. ft was launched in 2104 by the FDFA and OFCOM in   cooperation with DiptoFoundation, an NGO set up by Malta   and Switzerland. The Canton of Geneva is also involved in the   Steering group. The GIP recarts on events, trends, findings   and decisions in ail subject areas of digital Governance   and organises reguiar briefings. It thus helps, in particular,   small and developing countries in better understanding the   opportunities anc challenges presented by digitalisation   and becoming involved in the global debate. The GIP also   plays an important rale as an instrument and platform for   the strengthening of interdisciplinary cooperation between   the Geneva-based stakeholders, such as the international   organisations. The GIP and DiploFoundation also organise   courses for employees of the Federal Administration. Within   the context of the roadmap, there is the potential for the GIP   to take on an enhanced role as a so-called “help desk”.   Geneva Science and Diplomacy  Anticipator / GESDA (Geneva}   On 1 January 2020, the Geneva Science and Diplomacy   Anticpator foundation, which was founded by the Federal   Council and the City and Canton of Geneva, commenced its   work. Its objective is to make use of scientific expertise in   order to adcrass the opportunities and risks associated with   technological progress at a political level. Its role is to create a   common language anc common goals between stakeholders   from a range of different backgrounds and to transform them   into effective coalitions that bring together actors from the   scientific and business communities and from civil society.   GESDA is currently in its 36-rmonth pilot phase and is focusing   on the development of an acadernic and a ciplomatic forum   that should ensure mutual exchanges between the different   subject areas. There is also an impact fund that is to be used   to finance specific project activities. In this respect, GESDA is   already currently sugporting the International Digital Health   & Al Research Collaborative project, which is active in Al for   health and is led by Amandeep Gill, former co-director of   the High-level Pane! on Digital Cooperation. 4 Geneva-based   centre for science diplomacy in the area of conflict modeling   is also to be initiated together with ETH Zurich, the University   of Geneva and international partners.   Swiss Digital Initiative / SDI (Geneva)   The SDI is a Geneva-based private foundation that aims to   ancourage companies around the world to adopt ethical   codes of conduct. It was launched on 2 September 2019   at the first Swiss Global Digital Summit in Geneva with the   participation of major national and international companies.   The SD! aims to bring about a voluntary commitment to   ethical standards and conduct such as transparency, respan-   sibility, non-discrimination and explanatory power, which are   stil only partly institutionalised. To this enc, it also wants to   develop instruments that make this voluntary cornmitmert   measurable for users. The SDI is under the patronage of   Federal Councillor Uell Maurer. The foundation is chaired by   former Federal Councillor Daris Leuthard. Federal Chancellor   Walter Thurnnerr is an ad personam member of the   Foundation Board.   Institutions of higher education  and universities (Switzerland)   Switzerland's institutions of higher education and universities   olay an important role in contributing scientific and technical   axpertise to different political processes. The federal institutes   of technology are involved in different projects in Interna-   tional Geneva, including coaperatian with !Os and the private   sector as part of preparations for the World Data Forum. The   Swiss Federal institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) also   organises the Applied Machine Learning Days, which pravice   important expertise for many Geneva-based stakeholders.   At the University of Geneva and the Graduate Institute,   issues relating to digital governance are an important part af   aducation and research activities. The Graduate Institute aiso   operates the platform for societal transformations, which   deals with the social impact of new technologies. The Inter-   national Digital Health & Al Research Collaborative (-DAIR}   project is aiso based at the Graduate Institute. These are just   some examples.   BO    ice ) Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes    Prosperity and sustainable development   Technical standardisation /  communication logic   International Telecommunication   Union / ITU (Geneva}   The International Telecommunication Union (TU) is a   specialised agency of the United Nations responsible for   issues relating to inforrnation and communication technal-   ogies. With its three sectors (standards, radio communication   and development), the [TU promotes the development and   coordination of global technical standards, coordinates the   joint use of the radio-frequency spectrum worldwide and   works to improve the telecornmunications infrastructure   in developing countries. As a member of the ITU Council,   Switzeriand 3s involved in technical study groups, working   groups on political issues related to the internet and the   coordination of the European position within the ITU.   Swiizeriand also supports a better understanding of the   opportunities and risks presented by the internet of things,   5G mobile technology and artificial intelligence.   The Standardisation Sector of the ITU (TU-T) is oarticu-   larly important for the further develoornent of technical   standards. For years, Switzerland has chaired ITU-T Study   Group 13, which develoos standards for future mobile   networks, including cloud computing. The ITU has recently   been playing an increasingly significant international role in   the field of Al. The Al for Good Global Surnmit, organised by   the {TU Gogether with the UNDP and UNESCO} since 2017,   brings together Ai experts from governments, industry and   civ saciety each year in order to develop ideas for Al apolica-   tions tor the achievernent of the UN Sustainable Development   Goals. In 2079, Switzerland (FDFA and OFCOM) entered into   a partnership with the ITU to further strengthen the summit.   Internet Corporation for Assigned Names  and Numbers / ICANN (office in Geneva)   The orivate Californian institution ICANN is responsible for   the global allocation of domain narnes anc IP ad¢lresses. ft   was Originally under the supervision of the US government.   Following two and a half years of intensive negotiations, the   Cecision-making and accountability mechanisms, incuding   the possibilities to exert influence, were reorganised. During   this period, Switzerland chaired the ICANN Governmental   Advisory Committee and therefore played a major role in   ansuring that the governments were ultimately able to agree   on a compromise for a new self-governance mode! acceptable   to all. In arder to promote cantact with governments and   international organisations, Switzerland supported ICANN tn   opening an office in Geneva.   39 Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes   CERN (Geneva)   The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN}   was established in 1954, has 23 members and operates the   world’s jargest particle physics laboratory. its main function   is to provide the infrastructures necessary far research. For   this purpose, a large computer installation used to store and   analyse data from experiments is located at the rain site in   Meyrin. As the researchers require remote access to these   tacitties, CERN has developed important digital applications   in parallel to its own work that are now benefiting the general   oublic, for example the World Wide Web (WWW), Hypertext   Markup Language (HTML) and the Hypertext Transter   Protocol (HTTP). By addressing practical problems and thanks   to its existing expertise, CERN plays an irnpoartant role in   developments tn the fleld of data processing. With the devel-   opment of the Large Hadron Collider, tor example, owing to   the huge arnounts of data to be processed, a system that   accesses free server capacities worldwide anc thus processes   data on a decentralised basis was developed. This approach   now underpins the widespread use of cloud computing.   international Organization for   Standardization / ISO (Geneva)   iSO, which has existed since 1947 is an international stand-   ards-setting body that comprises representatives from   various national standards organisations. Many of the   international standarcs and relatecl cocuments developed   by ISO cover aspects that relate to information anc commu-   nication technologies (CT) with a view to ensuring their   quality, security anc reliability. These include, for example:   information security, sensor networks, cloud computing   services and devices, cloud cata management, virtua! orivate   networks, future networks, unidue identification for the   internet of things, digital signatures, health informatics and   software management.    United Nations Economic Commission for   Europe / UNECE and UN CEFACT (Geneva)   The UNECE is one of the five regional commissions that   report to the United Nations Economic and Social Council   (ECOSOC). it cornprises 56 member states (primarily from   Europe) and aims to promote economic cooperation and   integration between them. In the area of digitalisation, the   UNECE's Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business   (UN CEFACT) has an important role to play as a foca! point for   recommendations and standards for electronic commerce. It   has a global rnembership with experts from governments,   intergovernmental organisations and the private sector.   CEFACT also performs a range of activities in the area of   ICT for develanment. An example here is the development   of a joint environmental information system throughout the   UNECE region. in particular, the role played by the UNECE   in the standardisation and interoperability of intelligent   transport systems and autonomous vehicies should also be   mentioned. This stems from the UNECE’s long-standing role   as secretariat for multilateral agreements and conventions in   the area of road transport fe.g. the Vienna Convention on   Road Traffic).   Internet Engineering Task Force / IETF   The lETF is a US-based organisation that develops and   promotes open arid voluntary internet standards, especially   those that make up the internet Protocol. it plays an   irmoortant role in the further development of the architecture   tor the protecols and procedures usec by the internet. it has   no formal membership list and instead comprises voluntary   developers. However, their work Is generally financed by   their employers or sponsors. The JETF began as an institution   sponsored by the US gavernment but has been under the   auspices of the Internet Society since 1993.   Institute of Electrical and   Electronics Engineers / TREE   Fhe IEEE is a US-based association of engineers who work   together on the development of industry standards, including   in connection with !C7T-relevant topics such as wireless   communication. in addition to developing standards, the EEE   also organises events and publishes scientific publications on   various aspects of computer sciences, including security and   data protection.   European Telecommunications   Standards Institute / ETSI   The ETS! is a non-profit organisation set up at the initiative   of the European Commission that develops standards for   information and communication technologies. Some of the   specific areas in which the ETS! develops standards include   the following: broadband, cybersecurity, cloud computing,   internet of things, transition to IPv6, next generation protocols   and smart cities. In adcition to tts work on the deveicoment   of standards, the institute has also published white papers.   International Electrotechnical   commission / TEC (Geneva}   The IEC is an international standardisation organisation that   develops and publishes stancarcs for ail electrical, electronic   and related technologies - electrical engineering. Several   technical cornmittees deal with the internet of things (oT),   including, for example: standardisation in the fields of sensor   networks, portable technologies, smart cites and smart grids.   Atongside the development of standards, the IEC has also   oublished white papers, roadmaps containing recommenda-   tions and other resources relating to loT-related topics. The   IEC is headed by Philipp Metzger, former director of OFCOM.   European Computer Manufacturers’  Association / ECMA (Geneva}   Eoma iS a standardisation organisation for information and   communication systems. It was founded in 19617 with the   objective of standardising computer systems in| Europe.   Mernabership is open to companies around the world that   oraduce, market or develop computer or cornmunication   systems. Facebook, Google and Microsoft, among others,   are members of Ecma. EPFL and ETH Zurich are not-for-protit   members,   Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes 31    Cross-border data flows   World Trade Organization / WTO (Geneva)   The WTO is an intergovernmental organisation that provides a   central legal and institutional framework for establishing and   maintaining global rules for digital trade over the longer term.   The most important agreements are the General Agreement   on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which deals with trace in qaods,   the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and the   Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property   Rights (TRIPS). Within this frarnework, the WTO deals with   various issues relating to internet governance and digital   policy, including e-coramerce, arbitration, the liberalisation of   telecommunications markets and trade in telecommunications   services. Its basic principles of non-discrimination (most-fa-   voured nation and national treatment) and transparency aiso   apply to the digitalisecl economy. The WTO dispute settlement   bodies have already examined issues relating to trade in   digital services in light of WTO Jegislation and issued binding   judgements. Nevertheless, numerous questions regarding the   application of existing rules to digital barriers to trade remain   open or disputed, especially owing to the often political nature   of the national rules behind them. Since May 2019, 82 WTO   members have therefore been negotiating clarfications and   additions to the WTO rules on digital trade as part of a pluri-   lateral initiative. The objective of the negotiations is to pramote   digital trade by avoiding unnecessary barriers to trade and   unjustified protectionisms, while at the sarne tire developing   common basic principles for domestic requlation (e.g. locall-   sation). The starting point is formed by the existing standards   in bilateral and regional free trade agreements. Switzerland   is actively participating in the negotiations. The negotiating   group, which represents around 90% of worid trade, has the   potential to establish rules with a Global impact.   Oxganisation for Economic Co-operation  and Development / GECD   The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Devel-   opment (OECD) is made up of 36 member states. its work   focuses on improving market-based policies, which should   comtripute to the general well-being of the population. it   promotes agreements between the members states, including   guidelines and standards, and encourages policy discussions   with its scientific publications (outlooks, annual overviews and   commarative statistics). As part of the OECD’s Going Digital   Initiative, cross-thematic Knowledge on the digital transfor-   mation is to be developed. This includes the analysis of issues   related to digital trade, including the significance of market   openness in the digital age, the impact of the regulation of   cross-border data transmission and how diaital security can   be enhanced in line with market principles. In a first step, this   work can lead to precursors for common recommendations   (best practices) and prornote a coherent and comprehensive   policy approach for the digital transformation. The standards   can, for example, be incorporated in the negotiations within   the WTO or free trade agreements.   32 Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes   The OECD also plays an important role in the area of   AY in autumn 2078, it set up a group of experts in which   Switzerland was represented. The group developed a Council   Recommendation that contains five general principles for the   responsible use of Alas well as five specific recommendations   for governments. The OECD Council Recammendation was   adopted by the OECD member states (inciuding Switzerland}   and a mumber of other countries in spring 2019. The OECD is   also in the process of establishing an Al Policy Observatory,   which is likewise supported by Switzerland.   European Free Trade Association / EFTA (Geneva}   in the past, Switzerland has negotiated various texts on   e-commerce within the context of the European Free Trade   Association (EFTA) and bilaterally as part of free trade   agreements. The most recent text dates from 2017 and was   concluded between the EFTA states and Turkey. In the course   of 2079, the EFTA member states decided to commence   work on a new EFTA model text on e-commerce for future   tree trade negotiations. A draft has therefore been drawn   up on the basis of known text elements at several working   group meetings. While this craft has not yet been completed,   it already contains the key elernents trom the paint of view   of the EFTA memiber states and should be finalised in 2020.   The EFTA e-commerce model text will contain numerous   new elements that are now standard for e-commerce texts in   trade agreements, including provisions on cross-border data   flows anc the disclosure of source codes, for example.    Access, applications and  sustainable development   World Bank   The World Bank is an international financial institution that   issues loans and grants to the governments of poorer countries   in order to pursue capital projects. Switzerland joined the   World Bank in 1992. The World Bank’s work programrne in the   ICT sector focuses on cybersecurity, the expansion of access to   fast, affordable internet and the development of reliable online   platforms that encourace improved service provision anc good   governance. For example, Switzerland Is supporting the Warld   Bank's Govlech partnership programme to promote the use   of new technologies in the public sector. Ht aims ta improve   the transparency, accountability and efficiency of public   administrations and thus to contribute to better public services   and the combating of corruption. SMEs, in particular, benefit   from the digitalisation of public services. The digitahsation   of the custorns system promotes trade, while technological   applications contrioute to simplifying the foundation of new   companies anc market access.   United Nations Development Programme / UNDP   The UNDP is a UN agency that works to eradicate poverty   and reduce inequality. The UNDP also supports ICT devel-   opment activities and helps the UN member states in   creating a favourable environment for economic and social   growth through the use of ICT. The UNDP is one of the   UN specialised agencies that was appointed as part of the   WSIS process to pursue specific WSIS lines of action in the   areas of capacity-ouilding and e-government as well as to   create a favourable environment. For Switzerland, the UNDP   is a partner within the framework of the Core Government   Functions programme (promotion of @-governance as a   means of achieving better governance) as well as the fintech   Cialoque programme.   United Nations Commission on Science and   Technology for Development / UN CSTD (Geneva)   The UN CSTD is a subsiciary body of the United Nations   Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). The CSTD was   established by the UN General Assernbly in 1993 in order   to examine specific science and technology issues for devel-   opment: ranging from access to technologies to their appil-   cations (e.g. health, clirnate change, more inclusive financial   systems, smart cities). Following the WSIS meeting, the CSTD   has been supporting progress in the implementation of the   orocess at a regional and international level and is preparing   corresponding draft resolutions for ECOSOC. The UNCTAD   secretariat in Geneva provides substantive support to the   CSTD. The CSTD comprises 43 members (each elected for   four years) and meets annually. Switzerland has been an   active member since 2006 and is currently elected until 2024.   Broadband Commission (Geneva}   The Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development   was established in 2010 as a joint initiative of the ITU and   UNESCO in order to promote internet access (especially   broadbanc networks} and reduce the digital divide. The   Broadband Comrnission primarily performs advocacy work   (reports, studies, recommendations) for the introduction of   standards and guidelines for the establishment of oroacband   networks in developing countries, the development of digital   skills (education and capacity building} ameonc ail population   groups and, specifically, for reducing the digital divide   between the gencers. The Broadband Commission is also   increasingly addressing the significance of internet access   as a driver of sustainable growth and development. Its work   therefore also includes issues such as digital health and the   relationship between ICTs and climate change.   Fintech dialogue platform (Geneva)   The global dialogue platiorm on fintech, which was launched   in 2020 by the UNDP, Switzerland and Kenya, airns to ensure   that the rules and practices relating to the digitalisation of the   financial system also take account of its impact on sustainable   development. Together with stakeholders from develaning   countries and international organisations, such as the World   Bank and the Warid Economic Forum, criteria, standards and   norms are to be developed that incorporate the goais of the   2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.   Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes 35    Task Force on Digital Financing of   the UN secretary-general   In 2018, the UN secretary-general launched a Task Force   on Digital Financing in order to explore the potential of   financial innovations, new technologies anc digitalisation for   bringing about broader access to financial resources for the   achievement of the SDGs and to minimise risks in the process.   The task force will submit its report with recommendations to   the UN secretary-general during the course of 2020.   Libra Association (Geneva)   The Liora Association, initiated by Facebook, comprises   several private sector and civil society organisations seeking   to promote a global online currency called Libra. The Libra   payrnent system is based on blockchain technology.   United Nations Conference on Trade and   Development / UNCTAD (Geneva}   The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development   (UNCTAD) is part of the UN secretariat. its objective is   to maximise developing countries’ trade, investment and   Cevelopment opportunities and to promote their efforts   to Integrate into the world economy. ft conducts research,   produces political analyses and data collections and provides   technical assistance to developing countries. In the digital   fleic, tL supports developing countries in drawing up e-corn-   merce legislation, building capacities, for example for the   production of underlying statistics for ICT policies, promoting   the use of technology in the economy (in order to oridge   the gender-specific digital divide, it primarily supports female   entrepreneurs} and helping countries to develop appropriate   consumer protection leg:siation.   International Trade Centre / ITC (Geneva)   The !TC is a multilateral organisation which has a joint mandate   from the WTO and UNCTAD to contribute to sustainability   goals. In the area of e-commerce, it primarily supports SMEs   in acquiring the required skills. It has developed an e-solu-   tions programme which provides companies with access to   a plattorm of shared technologies and services, including   access to international payment solutions and logistics. A   virtual marketplace project aims to strengthen the capabilities   of SMEs so that they can effectively utilise new technologies   in order to improve their visibility on international markets.   The centre also offers e-learning programmes and produces   publications related to e-commerce.   34 Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes   UN World Data Forum   The UN Worle Data Forum was established following the   report ‘A World that Counts’ by the UN secretary-general’s   independent Expert Advisory Group on the Data Revolution   for Sustainable Develoomenrt (2014). it acts as a olatform for   cooperation between different stakeholders from the areas   of data science, information technology and civil society.   The first World Data Forum was held in South Africa in 2017,   while the second took place in the United Arab Emirates in   2018. Switzerland will be the host country for the third forum,   which was scheduled for auturnn 2020 in Bern and will now   likely be held in 2621. The question of how digital data   Gnciuding big data) can be used for development is playing   an increasingly important role. Switzerland has launched a   series of events leading up to the forum, entitled Road to   Bern. In Geneva, it has supported a process in this context   which should allow for cooperation between international   organisations as weil a5 private stakeholders and facibtate   the sharing of data for sustainable develooment. This also   includes questions relating to collection, data protection,   security and interpretation.   international Committee of the  Red Cross / IGRC (Geneva)   The work of the ICRC focuses on responding to emergency   Situations and promoting respect for international humani-   tarian law anc its implementation in national leqislation.   Digttalisation is important in different ways here. On the   one hand, support provided to population groups in need   can be mace rnore efficient through the use of digital toais,   tor example the use of facial recognition software when   searching for missing persons. Especially in conflict zones   where the ICRC is active, snecial care must be taken to ensure   that personal data is not stolen and misused. For this reason,   the ICRC is at the forefront of efforts to find technical and   oolitical solutions that prioritise data protection anc thus the   protection of individuals. In addition, the ICRC is the quardian   of international nurnanitarian law and promotes adherence   to the four Geneva Conventions and their Additional   Protocols. The use of weapons is a focus area here and in   this respect the ICRC also devotes itself to Issues relating to   cyberwarfare anc the use of autonamous weapon systems   (which must be in accordance with international humani-   tarian law). Switzerland works closely with the ICRC. Among   other things, the Humanitarian Data and Trust initiative Gee   saction 4} was launched together with the ICRC and the   United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian   Affairs (OCHA).    International Labour Organization / ILO (Geneva)   The ILQ’s mandate is to promote social and economic justice   by defining international labour standards. Digital devel-   opments will have a major impact on the world of work.   The enhancement and partial replacement of human work   processes by robotics, Al and the internet of things are creating   new work structures, but also a risk of rising unemployment.   In order for digital technalagies to be used profitably, social   systems such as the education system, social dialogue between   amployers and eraployees and the principles based upon this,   such as worker protection, must be guaranteed. With its   work in the area of the Future of Work and the Centenary   Declaration of 2019, which gives priority to the effects of   technological developments on work processes, the ILO has   an important role to play in the structuring and promotion of a   socially sustainable digital economy.   World Intellectual Property   Organization / WIPO (Geneva}   WIPO is a specialised agency of the United Nations which airns   to lead the development of a balanced and effective inter-   national intellectual property system that enables innovation   and creativity for the benefit of all. In the area of digital   governance, WIPO has lang been addressing issues relating   to the protection of trademarks as part of the cornain name   system. To this end, it has set up a dispute resolution service   with ICANN for the registration of domain names.   WIPO is active in the field of diattalisation and has undertaken   various initiatives, in particular the development of digital toals   and services such as the digital time stamp WIPO PROOF,   presentations in committees, research and events (e.g. within   the framework of WSIS ancl IGF conterences).   World Health Organization / WHO (Geneva}   The WHO js a specialised agency of the United Nations that   is responsible for international public health. Digital health is   one of the WHO's focus areas. This is largely understood to   refer to the use of ICT to improve health. Several resolutions   of the General Assembly nave focused on issues such as the   standardisation of health data to allow for better analyses, the   use of the top-level domain ‘health’ (question of the credibility   of mectcal information provided online) and the online aclver-   tising and distribution of medical devices (protection against   counterfeits, etc). A Global Observatory for eHealth airns to   support member states with information and guidelines on   eHealth practices and standards.   United Nations Children’s Fund / UNICEF   The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) is an organi-   sation that is responsible for the provision of hurnanitarian   and development assistance to children worldwide. With its   Innocenti research centre, it is dedicated to identifying and   researching opportunities and risks for the implementation   of children’s rights, including in the digital domain. Together   with the London Schoo! of Economics and EU Kids Online,   it has launched the Globai Kids Onkne initiative in order to   further explore the understanding of the risks and oppor-   tunities presented by the internet for children. Following   the report of the High-level Panel for Digital Cooperation,   UNICEF is working to develop a platiorm for digital public   goods.   United Nations Environment Programme / UNEP   The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) promotes   the implementation of sustainability in the environmental   field. It assesses global, regional and national environmental   trends, develops international and national environmental   instruments and works to strengthen the relevant institu-   tions. The increasing use of ICT presents both opportunities   and challenges in the area of environmental orotection.   Digitalisation is therefore becoming increasingly important   tor the UNEP. In performing its work, it focuses on devel-   oping strategies and instruments in order to support the ICT   sector with innavations and facilitate environmental sustain-   ablity efforts. The initiatives of the UNEP also revoive around   improved data analyses (e.g. on climate change) as well as   global supply chains and electronic waste. The UNEP has a   iaading role in the WSIS action lines on the environment.   World Meteorological Organization  / WMO (Geneva)   The WMO fs a specialised agency of the United Nations.   Among other things, % allows for the consolidation of   enormous amounts of global weather and climate data. {ts   work covers numerous areas in which ICTs are used as tools   for the management of climate-related challenges. in the   area of urban developrnent, the agency promotes resilient   cities through the development of integrated urban weather,   environmental and climate services. it also researches the use   of technologies for meteorological and environmental ahser-   vations and data collection, the reduction of natural hazards   and disaster risks as well as the transmission of forecasts,   warnings and public alerts. The WMO operates the Warld   Weather Information Service, which uses the internet and   digital technologies in order to make weather information   oublicly available in a user-friendly manner.   Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes 35    Cybersecurity   UN Group of Governmental Experts  on Developments in the Field of   information and Telecommunications  in the Context of International Security   / UN GGE (New York and Geneva)   Fhe UN GGE convened by the UN General Assembly   discusses standards for responsible state behaviour as well as   the valicity and application of international law in the digital   space. Until now, there have been five such expert groups (in   different compositions), three of which adopted consensus   reports (2010, 2013 and 2015). Within these, the experts   agreed that international law in its entirety is applicable in the   digital space and that the principles of international nurnan-   itarian law alsa apply here. The 2015 repart also contained   Ji voluntary standards for responsible state behaviour that   contripute to the promotion of international cybersecurity.   The UN General Assembly supported each of these reports.   Since 2016-17, Switzerland has been able to play an active   role in the expert group. The current process should be   concluded with a report to the UN General Assembly in 2021.   Open-Ended Working Group / UN OEWG   In addition to the UN GGE, a new UN body — the OEWG —   has been meeting since September 2019 on the initiative of   Russia on the topic of international cybersecurity. Uniike the   UN GGE, participation is open to all states and it also provides   for cansultations with the scientific community, the private   sector and civil society. The UN QEWG also nas a broader   mandate than the UN GGE and provides for very fundamental   ciscussions on perceived challenges. As the chairing country,   Switzeriand is also closely involved in this process. in its role   as chair, Switzerland is concerned to ensure that the content   is consistent with the discussions in the UN GGE. The work   of the UN GEWG was scheduled to be completed for the UN   General Assembly in 2020, but is likely to be delayed owing   to the coronavirus crisis.   Group of Governmental Experts on Lethal  Autonomous Weapon Systems (Geneva)   In order to acidress the issues relating to newly emercing   technologies in the areas of lethal autonormous weapon   systems (LAWS), a group of government experts (UN GGE   on LAWS) was established for the first time in 2013 within   the framework of the states parties to the Convention on   Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW). The group is open to   all States Parties to the CCW. The issues discussed include,   among others, the promotion of a cornmon understanding   of the concept of LAWS, possible challenges for interna-   tional humanitarian law, the human element in the use of   lethal force (aspects of human-machine interaction}, passible   military iraplications of the technologies and the management   36 Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes   of humanitarian and international securty challenges arising   from them. The group will continue its work in order to   oresent potential recommendations on autonomous weapon   systems within the framework of the Convention at the Sixth   Review Conference in 2021.   Cybersecurity package/strategy  of the European Union   On 13 September 2017, the European Commission published   a cybersecurity package with which Europe’s critical   infrastructure should be better protected and its digital   self-assertion vis-a-vis other regions of the world should   be promoted. In implementing this, the Cybersecurity Act   antered into force in June 2019, providing for two relevant   innovations: 7) the strengthening of the mandate of the   European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA): 2) the   introduction of an EU-wide certification frarnework for the   cybersecurity of products, services and processes in the area   of ICT. A further important element of the EU strategy in   the area of cybersecurity is the cybersanctions regime for   the imposition of restrictive measures in response to cyber-   attacks, wnicn was adopted by the Council of the EU on   17 May 2019. The EU wil in future also invest even more   in the development of its own cybersecurity capacities.   This includes the planned creation of an EU cybersecurity   competence centre (The European Cybersecurity industrial,   Technology and Research Competence Centre) as well as a   network of national cornpetence centres. These are to be   managed oy the planned Digital Europe Programme (DEP}   and financed using funds of the DEP and the EU research   orogramme Horizon Europe.   Developments at EU level are being closely followed with   respect to their impact on Switzerland and with a view to   potential participation opportunities. With respect to the   planned EU-wide certification programme for ICT products,   tt will be especially important to avoid any barriers to   market access for Swiss ICT companies. in the case of the   EU cyber-sanctions regime, it is currently being examined   whether an adoption based on the Swiss Embargo Act   would be possible in principle. Ultimately, Switzerland aims   to participate in the DEP and Horizon Europe, although it   is still open as ta whether anc under what conditians third   countries wit be proviced with access to activities in the area   of cybersecurity.    Organization for Security and  Co-operation in Europe / OSCE   At a regional level, the Organization for Security and Co-op-   eration in Europe (OSCE) plays an important role. in 20433   and 2016, it acopted a catalogue of 16 confidence-ouilding   measures in the fleid of cybersecurity. It is the first agreement   of this kind anywhere in the world. The measures aim to   reduce the risks posecl by new information and communi-   cation technologies and to improve transparency among OSCE   members. Since the beginning of this process, Switzerland   has contributed with smecific substantial proposals. It played   a decisive role in the development of the confidence-bulicing   measures and is continuing its commitment during their   implementation.   Geneva Dialogue on Responsible  Behaviour in Cyberspace (Geneva)   In order to acivance the global consensus on binding behav-   ioural norms and responsibilities in the digital space, the FDFA   launched the Geneva Dialogue on Responsible Behaviour in   Cyberspace at the beginning of 2018. The dialogue uses Inter-   national Geneva as 4 platform to create greater clarity with   respect to the responsibility of states, business, science and civil   society in the digital domain. The first results were recorded in   a report in 2019. At present, the dialogue is being pursued   further between a number of leacing global companies with   the Geneva DiploFoundation with the objective of identitying   shared industry best practices in the area of product safety.   A first package is expected to be ready at the end of 2020.   Participants in the dialogue include, among others, ABB, Cisco,   Huawei, Kaspersky, Microsoft, Siamens, SwissRe and UBS. As   part of the Geneva Dialogue, Switzerland aiso held an expert   governmental legal experts.   Working Party on Security and Privacy in the   Digital Economy (WP SPDE) of the OFCD   Fhe OECD Working Party on Security and Privacy in the   Digital Economy airs to develop international orinciples and   guidelines for policy measures aimed at reducing the cyber-   secunty risks of cigittal products, without stifling innovation   or reducing the opportunities presented by digitalisation. it is   expected that such quidelines will be develoned by 2021. By   means of reports to be prepared in advance, the basis for the   development of an CECD Recommendation ts to be created.   The FDFA represents Switzerland in this working group.   Work on cybersecurity at the International  Telecommunication Union in Geneva (ITU}   The ITU has been working on a Global Cyoersecurity Agenda   since 2007. The agenca includes support in the area of cyber-   crime, technical measures for the establishment of security   standards, the development of organisational structures and   national capacities. A process is currently under way to update   the agenda, but this is highly controversial. In this dossier, the   FDFA is working together with the OFCOM, which has the   lead role.   United Nations Institute for Disarmament   Research / UNIDIR (Geneva}   UNIDIR is an autonomous institution within the UN that   conducts research in the area of disarmament anc security.

The institute acts as an expert adviser to the UN GGE and   organises an annual Cyber Stability Conference. Within the   framework of its programme on newly emercing security   issues, UNIDIR is examining issues in relation to the use of   new technologies (such as machine learning, artificial intelli-   gence, robotics and computing) as a means of warfare.   Global Forum on Cyber Expertise / GFCE   The Global Forurn on Cyber Expertise (GFCE) is a multi-stake-   holder comrnunity of more than 115 members and partners   trom all regions of the world that has set itself the goal of   strengthening cyber capacities and expertise at a global level,   The GFCE aims to be a pragmatic, action-oriented and flexible   olatfarm for international cooperation and to reduce overlaps   in the cyber capacity-building ecosystem. Switzerland has   been a member of the GFCE since 2015 and is invalved in   several projects.   Geneva Centre for Security Policy / GCSP   As part of its programme for newly emerging security   challenges, the GCSP has a cybersecurity cluster that covers   educational and training activities as well as political analyses   and events. The cluster also provides a platform far dialogue   and exchanges on cyber challenges between experts from the   public, private anc civil society sectors. Many of the activities   of the GCSP fall under the category of capacity-building. For   example, the annual Cyber 9/12 Student Challenge held at   the GCSP brings together students from Europe, the Middle   East, India and the United States in Geneva.   Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes 37    Geneva Centre for Security Sector   Governance / DCAF   As part of its work to improve governance within the security   sector, DCAF also looks at issues relating to cyoersecurity.   Various publications developed by DCAF address aspects   such as vulnerabilities in the digital soace and how they   can be tackled at a national and international level, and   challenges posed by demographic governance in the area of   cybersecurity, cyberwarfare etc. DCAF also organises evants   and activities for capacity development in the fleid of cyber-   security.   iCT4Peace (Geneva}   ICT4Peace is an international! foundation that focuses on   capacity-building anc policy cooperation (strategy papers,   recommendations, facilitaton. it was founded by former   ambassador Danie! Stauffacher. Its objective is to promote a   peaceful digital space through international negotiations with   governments, compames and non-state stakeholders. It also   promotes the use of ICT within the context of humanitarian   or conflict-related crisis management and works to combat   the use of the internet for terrorist purposes.   CyberPeace Institute (Geneva)   The CyberPeace Institute was launched by Microsoft,   Mastercard and the Hewlett Foundation in 2079. ft aims to   promote the stability of the digital space. Using technical   expertise, it aims to shec light on cyberattacks, making the   information ouolicly accessible in arder to draw attention to   weaknesses and the possibility of attacks.

The office also looks at   issues relating to the prevention and combating of extremism   online. At the request of the Hurnan Rights Council, the office   can draw up reports. For example, it has prepared a report on   the prevention and cornbating of violent online extremism.   More recently, the High Commissioner for Human Rights   has also addressed the issue of fake news and its impact   on freedom of expression online. Furthermore, the QHCHR   is currently developing guidelines for the application of the   UN's Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights in   the area of new technologies (B-Tech). Switzerland provides   financial support for this work.   Council of Europe   For years, the Council of Europe has played a pioneering role in   rnany areas of digital governance. It involves business, science   and civil society in the work performed by its expert groups   and uses forums such as the IGF and EuroDiG in a targeted   rnanner in order to promote multi-stakeholder cooperation   with the objective of ceveloping specific solutions.   The Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of   individuals with regared to Automatic Processing of Personal   Data, which was drawn up in 1981 and updated in 2018,   has been the omly binding international agreernent on data   orotection issues over the last almost 40 years and has influ-   anced national legislation in this area far beyond Europe. It   has been adopted by Parliament in June 2020. Switzerland   chaired the Advisory Committee on the Convention for many   years.   The Convention on Cybercrime (also referred to as the   Budapest Convention) has governed the harmonisation of   criminal law and criminal procedures since 2007. t has now   been signed by more than 20 non-members of the Council of   Europe anc has influenced corresponding legisiation in mare   than 100 countries.   in September 2019, the Cornmittee of Ministers set up   the Ad hoc Committee on Artificial intelligance (CAHA}   to investigate the feasibdity of and apnroaches to a legal   framework for the development, design and application of   AL. Switzerland is represented on the committee.   Over recent decades, the Steering Committee on Media and   information (CDMS}) has developed a wide range of sott-iaw   instruments aimed at strengthening democracy, the rule of   law and freedom of expression, the orotection of privacy and   other human rights, and a functioning media system in the   digital warld. Switzerland has been an influential member of   the CDMS! for years, has headed various expert groups and   held the chair of the CDMS! in 2018/2079.

In the digital field, tt conducts activities to   promote freeclam of expression aniine, multilingualism in   the digital space, digital teracy anc other issues that should   bridge the digita! divide at a non-infrastructural level. {t is   committed to open ICT standards and open licences (such   as open access) in order to expand universal access to infor-   mation and Knowledge; it runs the Institute for Information   Technologies in Education for this purpose. It is also one of   the UN organisations that drives the WSIS process and as such   participates in the annual WSIS and IGF. In addition, along   with the TU, itwas a founder of the Broadband Cornmission.   In the area of Al, UNESCO is playing an increasingly   important role. Together with the People’s Republic of China,   it organised the International conference on Artificial intelli-   gence and Education in soring 2019. During the conference,   the Beijing Consensus on Artificial intelligence and Education   was adopted. Together with the UNESCO member states,   the director-general is encouraged to develop guidelines   and resources for the use of Al in education and called to   establish an ‘At for Education’ platform. UNESCO also looks   at the ethical dirnensions of AL. in 2019, its working group   on ethics and Al presentecl a preliminary stucly that recom-   mends a standard-setting instrument in this area. A craft   text for a recommendation is to be presented to the Genera   Conference in 2021. Switzerland is participating actively in   the interim consultations on the working group's text.   Switzerland also supports UNESCO's work as a member of   the information For Ail Programme for the promotion of free   access to digital media and content as well as to support the   quality of journalisrn and the safety of media professionals.   Humanitarian Data and Trust Initiative (HDT   The Humanitarian Data and Trust initiative (HDT is a   long-term diplomatic initiative of Switzerland, the ICRC anc   the OCHA Centre for Hurnanitarian Data that aims to ensure   the protection and responsible handing of humanitarian   cata. With its three pillars of Policy & Dialogue, Research &   Development and Education & Outreach, the HDT! combines   technological knowledge with evidence-based policy recorn-   mendations, which it channels into concerted action by   states, humanitarian organisations and academic institutions.   Its air is to ensure the optimal use of the great potentia   offered by digital technalogies in the humanitarian field and   to minimise the associated risks. With the help of this joint   initiative, further states and humanitarian organisations are   to be won over for this objective.   40 Annex 5: Key stakeholders, forums and processes   Kofi Annan Foundation (Geneva}   The Kofi Annan Foundation is an independent, non-profit   organisation whose activities are chiefly focused on achieving   better governance. The topic of digitalisation is becoming   increasingly important for the foundation. in January,   the Kofi Annan Commission on Elections and Democracy   in the Digital Age presented its report, thereby bringing   digital issues further to the fore of the founcation’s wark.   switzerland works together with the Kofi Annan Foundation   in country-specitic contexts in order to promote the intearity   of elections.   international Parliamentary Union (Geneva)   in line with its objective of developing strong and democratic   parliaments, the IPU supports parliaments in budding up   their ability to make effective use of ICT in order to promote   efficency, effectiveness and transparency. The iPU has also   been mandated by its member states to build capacities for   parliamentary committees that monitor compliance with   the right to orivacy and individual freedoms in the digital   environment,   internet Society (Geneva office)   The Internet Society is am American non-profit organisation   established by the co-founder of the internet Vint Cerf,   which aims to “ensure and sustain an open developrnent,   use and evolution of the internet for the benefit of all users   throughout the world”. It primarily deals with technical   standards of the internet, which should allow free access to   the greatest possible extent (e.g. decentralised systems). The   internet Society is arganisec in regional ‘chapters’ with a total   of arounc 70,000 mernbers; it has two main offices (in the   United States and in Geneva). The Public Interest Registry, a   subsidiary of the Internet Society, operates the three top-level   domain names Corg, .ngo and .ong}, which are primarily used   by non-orotit, non-governmental organisations. The lETF (see   above) also works under the auspices of the Internet Society.    Access Now / RightsCon   Access Now is an NGO that is active in the fleld of digital   human rights. lt acts as a global organisation with severa!   offices around the world (in New York, Wasningten DC,   Brussels, San José, Manila and Tunis). In addition to advacacy   and the cevelopment of political guidelines, :ts activities also   induce the provision of technical support, for example as   part of a helpline for activists, journalists and human rights   defenders on the issue of internet safety. Switzerland is   Supporting an Access Now project aimed at preventing   internet shutdowns within the context of elections.   Since 2071, Access Now has organised the annual RightsCon   conference, which with almast 3,000 participants from   around 4120 countries Gn 2019) is one of the most important   miulti-stakeholder forums on the issue of human rights in the   cigital age. Switzerland participates actively in RightsCan.   Freedom Online Coalition   In October 20179, Switzerland joined the Freedorn Oniine   Coalition, a group of more than 30 states set up in 2011   at the initiative of the Netherlands that works to promote   democracy and human rights on the internet. The right to   privacy anc the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful   asseroly and free association are of particular importance   within this context.   Annex Cc  2 : Key stakeholders, forums and processes 41        Switzerland should be in a position to become the   global centre for digital governance   Submitted by: BEGLE CLAUDE, CVP parliamentary group  Christian Dernocratic People’s Party of Switzerland   Opposed by: TUENA MAURO   Suomitted on: 78.09.2017   Suormitted to: National Council   Consultation status: Accepted   Text submitted   The Federal Council has been tasked with examining how   Switzerland could become the global centre for cyberspace   governance. The first objective is to work towards creating   a Geneva Convention on digitalisation containing principles   governing the peaceful use of cyberspace. Second, a neutral   organisation similar to the ICRC should be set up in order to   ensure that these principles are applied. Third, the aim should   also be to establish the headquarters of this organisation in   Geneva.   Such a project would be fully in line with Switzerland’s   engagement at international level. lt is vital that Switzeriand   position itself clearly on this issue as soon as possible.   Rationale   Fhe European Union (EU) and North Atlantic Treaty Organi-   zation (NATO) have been cooperating on digital governance   since 2010. The development of the internet has created a   new space: cyberspace. In this arena, a cyberattack can bring   a country to its knees. No state can pretend that it is able to   protect itself against such attacks on its own.   That is why international cyberspace governance must be   established.   42 Annex 6: Postulate 17.3789   in so doing, the following is to be avoided:   * the development of a climate of mistrust resulting in a cy-   ber arms race, or fragmentation of the internet if individual   States rasort to putting sovereignty first;   * states attacking other states:   @ states attacking critical businesses, tech campanies or criti-   cal public services such as healthcare.   States must commit to:   ® drawing atterition to gaps in security rather than exploiting   thern (fo avoid a repeat WannacCry incident whereby the   NSA used its knowledge of the security gap for ts own   purposes):   ® protecting citizens in the virtual world (only states can en-   sure such protection).   The following ideas are also to be advocated:   * that cialogue and coordination are essential:   @ that states are responsible for any cyberactivity taking   place on their territory, which therefore requires the estab-   lishment of an international arbitration panel to identify the   perpetrators of cyoerattacks:   ® that the objective of national armed forces is to defend, not   escalate conflict.   A similar proposal was set out in the 2015 report of the   United Nations Group of Governmental Experts (UN GGE)   on Developments in the Field of Information anc Telecom-   munications in the Context of International Security. An   FU-NATO agreement signed in February 2016 provides for   the exchange of best practice in preventing, detecting and   defence against cyberattacks.   Without state-level involvernent however, the recormrmen-   dations of the GGE remain a dead letter. The internet must   remain a public good.   Timeline   45.12.2017 ~ National Council   Opposed.

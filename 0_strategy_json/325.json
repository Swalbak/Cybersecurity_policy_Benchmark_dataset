Every organization, citizen, and resident of Bahrain is connected to the internet which enables everyday activities, innovation, and growth. By using and connecting to the internet, risks will emerge in the form of cybercrime, destruction, espionage, and vandalism. The best means for addressing cyber threats is to develop a comprehensive National Cyber Security Strategy. Bahrain's National Cyber Security Strategy is leading the efforts for improving Cybersecurity through over a period of four years. The strategy is organized into five pillars that support the cyber security needs of the Kingdom, which are strong and resilient cyber defenses, effective cyber security governance and standards, building a cyber aware nation, collective defense through partnership and cooperation, and cyber workforce development. This strategy makes cyber security a national priority and addresses the needs of critical national infrastructure (CNI) sectors. The CNI sectors are represented by the financial sector, Government sector, Healthcare sector, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector, Transportation sector, Gas, Electricity, and Oil (GEO) sector, and Critical Industry (CI) sector. The NCSC will contribute to consulting cybersecurity experts and stakeholders to ensure the collection of valuable observations and suggestions to improve the national strategy for cybersecurity. In addition, NCSC will continue to provide workshops for each vital sector and national conferences within the Kingdom of Bahrain to ensure effective communication with cybersecurity experts and stakeholders. Moreover, NCSC will contribute to the evaluation of progress against the objectives of the National Cyber Security Strategy. NCSC will monitor and evaluate the progress in achieving the national strategic goals and take corrective measures for national initiatives and projects as required. Vision This strategy will provide the platform for a Secure and Trusted Cyberspace in Bahrain. A comprehensive National Cyber Security Strategy is necessary to harness the full capability A comprehensive National Cyber Security Strategy is necessary to harness the full capability of Bahrain's people, businesses, and government in an organized and effective fashion to properly address cyber security. This strategy provides an ambitious vision and decisive set of objectives to address cyber security across the Kingdom. The scope of the strategy is broad and encompasses Bahrain's government, CNI sectors, private companies, regional and international partners, and the whole of Bahrain's population. The strategy is organized around the five pillars, each of which provides an essential component required to achieve the ultimate vision. This strategy also includes sector-specific discussions that address the unique needs, key objectives, and responsibilities of CNI sectors. The end result is a comprehensive plan to dramatically improve the Kingdom's cyber security over the next four years. Five Pillars for a Cyber-Secure Kingdom The national cyber security strategy is made of the following five mutually supporting pillars that together comprehensively support the Kingdom's cyber security needs. Each pillar represents a significant focus area and line of effort that provides an essential component required to achieve the ultimate vision which leads to a cohesive and comprehensive framework for creating a secure and trusted cyberspace for the Kingdom. Pillar 1: Strong and Resilient Cyber Defenses The first pillar in the national strategy aims to raise cyber security readiness, as well as protect systems and networks in the institutions of CNI sectors. This is accomplished by developing modern and advanced security systems that enhance mechanisms to address and detect potential cyber-attacks and threats in a comprehensive and accurate manner. This pillar includes the following strategic objectives: Protecting critical national infrastructure: Adopting a comprehensive methodology to achieve the necessary cyber protection by defining cyber security requirements, taking into account all factors related to the infrastructure of critical institutions, identifying and analyzing risks, preparing and implementing security controls, and conducting continuous tests, in order to ensure proactivity in confronting threats and protecting electronic systems and services. Enhancing response to cyber incidents: providing mechanisms to respond to cyber incidents to assist the institutions of vital national sectors in confronting and containing cyber attacks and ensuring a rapid return to normal operations while minimizing negative impacts. Raising cyber security readiness in vital institutions: Preparing programs and plans to confront electronic threats and attacks at the level of vital sectors and at the national level, developing scenarios for potential threats and implementing practical exercises for plans in order to enhance the level of readiness of institutions in vital sectors. Pillar 2: Effective Cyber Security Governance and Standards This pillar provides a governance framework for setting and enforcing cyber security standards, controls, and procedures. In addition, ensure that CNI institutes support the adoption of risk management and adhere to the standards and controls for managing and protecting sensitive information and systems. This strategy implements requirements for strong cyber security leadership in organizations to provide individual accountability. This pillar includes the following strategic objectives: Applying risk management at the national level: applying the concept of risk management in the institutions of vital sectors to reduce cyber risks by conducting risk management operations, which include identifying assets belonging to critical infrastructure institutions, defining risks, evaluating risks, and working to reduce and limit them, as well as ending control and monitoring risks to provide maximum safety. Developing cyber controls, policies and supporting the compliance process: Developing cyber controls and policies at the national level, setting up mechanisms that support the process of their application, and defining procedures to ensure the compliance of the concerned authorities with the controls and policies, with the aim of enhancing the protection of the systems and services of institutions and companies, with a focus on the institutions of vital sectors. Developing effective cyber leaders: Developing guidelines aimed at defining the importance and role of effective leadership in the field of cyber security and preparing programs that seek to raise the level of knowledge of institutional and partnership leaders to support cyber security programs and develop their human cadres. Pillar 3: Building a Cyber Aware Nation The third pillar is concerned with raising the level of awareness in Cyber security among all individuals in the Kingdom of Bahrain, by creating awareness campaigns and programs to ensure that all individuals gain appropriate knowledge about cyber security. By raising cyber security awareness, individuals will have the ability to distinguish between misinformation and disinformation. The strategy targets all individuals, including students at all study levels, workers in all fields, and non-workers. This pillar includes the following strategic objectives: Raising awareness in the field of cybersecurity at the national level: working to spread awareness of cybersecurity and building an informed public in the Kingdom of Bahrain by implementing awareness and education campaigns and programs targeting various segments of society, making everyone a contributor to strengthening cybersecurity at the national level.

Introduction In this National Cybersecurity Strategy, one can find the government’s vision and ob- jectives regarding the state of cybersecurity in Icelandic society, along with indicators and emphases related to achieving defined objectives. This strategy replaces an older strategy from 2015. Open consultation on the draft strategy (White Book) and an evaluation of the state of play in cybersecurity issues (Green Book) took place in the process of developing this strategy. This strategy is endorsed by the Minister pursuant to Act no. 78/2019 on the Cyber and Data Security of Critical Infrastructure. The strategy is also part of the government’s Electronic Communications Plan.1 With the emphases in mind, the strategy forms a basis for actions in the field of cy- bersecurity that are presented in a separate action plan. The various ministries and institutions handle the elaboration of actions based on the strategy and their imple- mentation as appropriate. The strategy presents indicators for assessing the success of actions. The strategy shall be reviewed at intervals of no more than three years, taking into account the level of success based on the strategy’s defined indicators. 1 The cybersecurity strategy was endorsed by the Minister for Transport and Local Government in November 2021. Subsequent to the transfer of cybersecurity issues to the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Inno- vation in February 2022, the strategy was reissued. The strategy now covers the years 2022-2037 and has been endorsed by the Minister. Icelandic National Cybersecurity Strategy 2022–2037 February 2022 5 1.1 The Cyberspace Information technology and a range of digital solutions exist in almost all sectors of society. Widely, in our daily activities, information technology has come to play a crucial role, and a wide range of services depend on its use. However, while society relies increasingly on digital solutions, weaknesses can still be found in the underlying technology. This situation has arisen, not least because of the Internet. These developments generally bring about better living standards and prosperity, but they can also have negative effects. New opportunities emerge, but so do threats. One could even maintain that it is impossible to achieve the objectives of economic and social gains through the use of digital solutions if actions to respond to cybersecurity threats are excluded from the equation. The Internet offers great opportunities for Icelandic society. Emphasis on cybersecu- rity is a fundamental prerequisite for utilising these opportunities. This emphasis de- mands active participation and cooperation among the public administration, industry and the public. Cybersecurity issues encompass the whole of society, which makes it important to harness the power of all concerned. When dealing with cybersecurity, one must adopt cross-discipline values and consider diversity and inclusion for those concerned, e.g., regarding education, gender, age and cultural background. Cybersecurity has developed from being a technological issue to a cross-discipline issue requiring extensive cooperation. International cooperation is a prerequisite for progress in this field, and many opportunities for advancements demand the use of foreign experts in Iceland to keep abreast of international trends. Emphasis on cyber- security not only returns less likelihood of damage but also provides opportunities for advancement, such as in cybersecurity technology and cybersecurity service, which is a fast-growing sector abroad. Successful implementation of cybersecurity actions by the authorities will lead to improved cybersecurity status in the country and increased public cybersecurity awareness and opportunities to participate in offering services in this field. February 2022 6 2. LAW ENFORCEMENT, SECURITY AND DEFENCE The legal and regulatory environment must be strengthened at a national level and cross-border level in accordance with international requirements and indicators. Particular attention must be paid to protecting children on the Internet. The manner in which cybersecurity and information security challenges related to security and defence are to be handled must be better defined. 3. ORGANISATION AND COOPERATION Cooperation within public administration and with industry must be strengthened and formalised so that division of tasks and responsibility is clear. Effective coopera- tion between official parties in the field of cybersecurity response must be ensured. 1. COMPETENCE AND CAPABILITIES Competence and capabilities must be augmented by strengthening awareness, edu- cation, research and development. The capabilities of the authorities and industry to combat cyber-attacks and to minimise damage must be strengthened. Both national and international knowledge and opportunities must be used. 1.2 Key Dimensions Icelandic National Cybersecurity Strategy 2022–2037 February 2022 7 Cybersecurity relates to the security of digital services and solutions and their secure application in cyberspace. Solutions and methodologies in cybersecurity are used to combat cybersecurity threats2 which can become cybersecurity incidents if they are realised. Cybercrimes are either committed by using the Internet or are directed at the Internet and in a cyber-attack, the Internet is used to damage the functionality of computer systems or to enable unauthorised access to them. It must be kept in mind that nor- mal use of digital solutions and the Internet to commit crimes, such as selling illegal products or services, or abuse or bullying, are also considered cybercrimes. 2. Cybersecurity 2 Other threats related to information systems can entail social or economic factors such as discrimination or loss of income through automation of jobs, which is a manifestation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. February 2022 8 Icelandic National Cybersecurity Strategy 2022–2037 Cybersecurity incidents can also be attributed to people or systems without being a cybercrime, such as through breakdowns, maintenance or mistakes, negligence or mis- conduct. Cybersecurity incidents can also result from natural events. Cybersecurity incidents can lead to irretrievable damage and considerably weaken trust in digital solu- tions and the Internet, thus inhibiting positive development and the progress it brings. To ensure security in the use of digital solutions, measures should be in place to pro- tect the confidentiality of data as appropriate in each instance, to ensure the integrity of data and systems, and the availability of data and systems in the manner intended by owners or responsible parties. Persistent and increased cyber threats are directed at these fundamental factors in the cybersecurity of digital solutions. However, the security of using these solutions can be increased with the appropriate defences, knowledge and behaviour. When assessing the security of digital solutions, one considers whether the risk in- herent in their use is acceptable. On the other hand, one considers resilience, such as whether response time to combat negative consequences of a cybersecurity incident is adequate. The assessment also relates to how quickly a service can be restored, even if the service is provided in a different manner. Cybercrime has become a part of organised crime. In this respect, attempts are in- creasingly made to find and use legal and jurisdictional uncertainty or to create an ethical quandary. Continued technical development will create previously unknown threats that render obsolete and useless those solutions and methods currently in use. In this way, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity ENISA has defined arti- ficial intelligence and the use of quantum computers as the main cybersecurity chal- lenges for the coming years. Furthermore, increased use of digital solutions for abuse and violence calls for a focus on protecting vulnerable groups, particularly children. Icelandic National Cybersecurity Strategy 2022–2037 February 2022 9 3.1 Vision 3. Icelandic National Cybersecurity Strategy Icelanders enjoy security on the Internet based on strong security culture, reliable cybersecurity and law enforcement, active cooperation, national and international, and comprehensive legislation that supports innovation and progress in Internet service. The vision for Iceland’s cybersecurity is as follows: February 2022 10 This means, among other things, that Icelanders should enjoy the most secure envi- ronment on the Internet as possible, which they can trust and where human rights and personal data protection are respected, along with freedom of action, economic gains and progress. Secure information technology and secure Internet service shall be es- sential pillars of prosperity in Iceland, based on robust cooperation and supported by a strong culture of security, active international collaboration and robust legislation. Society is furthermore well prepared to deal with cybercrimes, cyber-attacks, espio- nage and abuse of personal and business information, both with its capabilities and with international cooperation of cybersecurity teams, the police and security and defence cooperation. 3.2 Objectives There are two cybersecurity objectives: 2. SECURE INTERNET ENVIRONMENT Stronger law enforcement on the Internet and a legal and regulatory framework in line with international standards will create trust in responding to inappropriate Internet behaviour. Emphasis will be placed on protecting children on the Internet. Security infrastructure, risk assessment and resilience of critical infrastructures will be strengthened and response capability to threats in the fields of security and defence will be increased. 1. EXCEPTIONAL COMPETENCE AND UTILISATION OF CYBERSECURITY TECHNOLOGY Knowledge and competence will be enhanced with increased emphasis on information to the public, education, research, development and international cooperation. The ability to avoid, respond to and minimise damage from cyber-attacks will be increased with the use of technology, international remedies, and the best available solutions. Icelandic National Cybersecurity Strategy 2022–2037 February 2022 11 Status according to the ITU3 index on capacity development Status assessment according to Oxford Model4 with respect to basic aspects of the objective 60% >90% 9 of 32 aspects reach at least the stage “Established” 32 of 32 aspects reach at least the stage “Established” Status 2021 Status 2026 3 See: 4 According to the Oxford University model ( each aspect of cybersecurity capacity is categorised into five distinct and defined stages of maturity. The medium stage of “Established“ is used here as a reference. Results of actions will be measured and assessed against the indicators specified for each objective. 3.2.1 Exceptional Competence and Utilisation of Cybersecurity Technology Robust cybersecurity culture is based on awareness of risks inherent in the use of the Internet, on risk assessment and prioritisation of actions according to these factors. To build the appropriate competence and utilisation of cybersecurity technology, a key requirement is an access to effective and varied education, which targets differing needs, and there should be active participation in research. This is the basis for inno- vation and secure utilisation in the future. Indicators Objectives Robust cybersecurity culture and awareness Secure digital service and innovation Effective response to incidents Effective education, research and development Stronger law enforcement, defence and national security Robust infrastructure, technology and legal and regulatory framework Exceptional competence and utilisation of cyber- security technology Secure Internet environment Each objective is divided into two factors, as shown in the following figure: February 2022 12 Main Emphases Factors that can erode trust in the Internet and the services provided should be combatted. Awareness-raising and cybersecurity education programmes will be increased with the emphasis on appropriate education for the most vulnerable groups. News media and social media shall be used in a targeted manner. Understanding of the importance of protecting personal data in digital ser- vice shall be enhanced. Accessible reporting mechanisms shall be available to report cybersecurity crimes. Increase the supply and accessibility of appropriate cybersecurity education and training for various groups nationally and in international cooperation. Particular attention shall be paid to the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises in both rural and urban areas, among other things keeping in mind ENISA guidelines in this respect. Research and innovation built on a clear policy will be strengthened, among other things, in international cooperation and international cluster cooper- ation. Software and service shall meet increasing security demands and shall be in accordance with international security standards and criteria. More stringent security requirements shall be made in procurements and development of software and all kinds of services in the field of digital solutions. Guidelines shall be prepared to support this. Clear criteria should be defined for the pub- lic sector for procurement, development and service through digital solutions. Reliable and secure solutions shall be in place for eIDs and trust services. The cybersecurity market for service and hardware shall be strengthened nationally and for export. Cybersecurity service and equipment shall be based on clear criteria and accreditation as appropriate, including with respect to security management. Particular attention shall be paid to threats and security challenges inherent in outsourcing and the use of purchased services (including use of cloud ser- vices), for example, with respect to jurisdiction, supply chain and ownership. a d b e c f g h i j k Icelandic National Cybersecurity Strategy 2022–2037 February 2022 13 3.2.2 Secure Cyber Environment Icelanders rely on a comprehensive cybersecurity infrastructure to be in place, which can efficiently respond to cybersecurity incidents that could threaten national secu- rity, critical infrastructures and the rights of individuals. Particular emphasis shall be placed on protecting the vulnerable, particularly children. The rapid development of cybersecurity issues and the ever-changing landscape require legal and regulatory framework that supports the protection of individuals, the private sector and society as a whole. This is followed up with law enforcement, including appropriate societal cooperation. Indicators 5 See 6 According to the Oxford University model ( each aspect of cybersecurity capacity is categorised into five distinct and defined stages of maturity. The medium stage of “Established“ is here used as a reference. Status according to the ITU’s5 index with respect to legal, technical and organisational measures Status assessment according to Oxford model6 with respect to basic factors of the objective 86% >90% 14 of 30 aspects reach at least the stage “Established” 30 of 30 aspects reach at least the stage “Established” Status 2021 Status 2026 February 2022 14 Main Emphases The legal and regulatory framework fulfils international criteria and expecta- tions, making it possible to tackle abuse and criminal use of the Internet in a manner equivalent to that in our neighbouring countries. This includes an as- sessment of how well the conditions of the Budapest Convention are fulfilled and that defences against authentication and data theft are present. Powerful security organisation is supported based on risk assessment of the appropriate infrastructure and strengthening resilience. Security organisation of critical infrastructure reflects best practice with respect to guidelines of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA. Insider threats are also considered. Protection of children against abuse on the Internet will be ensured with pol- icy, clear legislation and responsible implementation and monitoring. Other groups that may need additional protection will also be considered similarly. Cooperation between law enforcement, the private sector and other stake- holders against cybercrime will be strengthened, as will active participation in international cooperation in this field. Monitoring of reliability and resilience will be increased for critical infrastruc- tures and systems of the public and private sectors. The development and operation of management systems for the security of information based on international standards will be encouraged. Cybersecurity will be made an appropriate part of civil security and of foreign affairs, security and defence. The police, prosecutors, courts and administrative institutions shall have the capacity to deal with offences related to the Internet and the international cooperation this may require. Regulatory bodies and response systems shall be capable of responding to serious cybersecurity incidents that can threaten the rights of individuals, critical infrastructures and society as a whole. Analysis of cybersecurity threats will be strengthened, and the dissemination of threat assessments shall be organised. Threat assessment shall be pub- lished at regular intervals. Efficient organisation shall be in place to facilitate responsible notifications of breaches in network and software systems and digital service. The Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IS) shall be the point of contact for the dis- semination of reliable information on cyber vulnerabilities. a d b e c f g h i j k Icelandic National Cybersecurity Strategy 2022–2037 February 2022 15 3.3 Cooperation An important factor, and in fact the prerequisite for achieving the strategy’s objec- tives, is to further strengthen and structure cooperation within public administration, with industry and with the public, with a clear division of roles and responsibility. Active coordination between official players must be ensured. Wide-reaching consul- tation, coordination and cooperation on cybersecurity creates not only the necessary security of future digital solutions but also the foundation for profitable industry and service. February 2022 16 Main Emphases Cooperation and coordination in cybersecurity-related matters will be strengthened within public administration and the industry, based on a clear division of roles, including issues related to the protection of children and revolutionary new technology, such as the IoT, artificial intelligence and quantum computers. Active coordination between players in public administration shall be en- sured with respect to the cybersecurity of their digital services. A platform shall be developed for wide-reaching cooperation between public administration, the private sector and other stakeholders, among other things, issues related to the dissemination of information and roles of various actors. The government and the private sector shall work together, among other things, on advising on matters related to cybersecurity and information security. Emphasis is placed on diversity and inclusion, as cybersecurity is for all, and everyone should be enabled to participate. Particular attention shall be paid to increased participation of women in this respect. Cybersecurity knowledge and culture will be strengthened and made more varied by facilitating the involvement of immigrants with appropriate educa- tion, experience and international contact networks. Defences and protective measures shall take into account fluid, international cooperation in the fields of cybersecurity and defence. Coordination with civil protection infrastructure will be increased, among other things, through increased consultation across ministries and institu- tions, and with industry, through increased cooperation and exercises. Increased participation: In international cooperation on cybersecurity, including in membership of boards and committees with such cooperation on their agendas. In international cooperation on cybersecurity education, in cooperation between universities, such as by receiving foreign teachers to Iceland and encouraging Icelandic students to study cybersecurity abroad. In cybersecurity awareness initiatives, including competitions for young people. In international research and development projects, among other things, based on cluster cooperation. a b d e c f g h i ii iii iv Icelandic National Cybersecurity Strategy 2022–2037 February 2022 17 3.4 Impact on Icelandic Society 3.4.1 International Cybersecurity issues have no borders, and Iceland is an active participant in interna- tional cooperation, among other things, on education, research, projects and coordi- nation of public administration. Such cooperation will allow Iceland to be among the leaders in securely using digital technology. Iceland’s active participation in international collaborative projects will enable the development of outstanding cybersecurity competence and knowledge. Such com- petence and knowledge can, among other things, be used in the field of innovation and development of digital service and cybersecurity and increase opportunities for a competitive advantage. Certain aspects of cybersecurity are part of security and defence in Iceland and they strengthen Icelandic participation in international defence and security operations. With a robust legal and regulatory framework against cybercrime and the ability to respond to them, one can avoid Iceland being considered easy target in the digital world. Iceland’s digital reputation will furthermore improve, its competitiveness will increase and make the country a more feasible investment option. February 2022 18 3.4.2 Regional With increased coordination in cybersecurity between public bodies, municipalities can fully utilise the opportunities of digital technology and simultaneously provide cit- izens and legal entities with more efficient and improved services, e.g. remote health services, with adequate security regardless of location. With cooperation between municipalities, one can significantly improve the use of limited resources in the field of cybersecurity, which is based on increasingly broad knowledge and experience. Empha- sis on small and medium-sized companies across the whole country levels the playing field for companies while simultaneously facilitating e.g. location independent jobs. 3.4.3 Private Sector Cybersecurity issues are a joint task of the private sector and government, with an em- phasis on strengthening the use of digital technology based on a robust cybersecurity foundation. Public trust in digital solutions, and thus their use, is likely to grow with increased cooperation and cybersecurity. The requirements of the private sector for cutting-edge cybersecurity competence are on a steadily upward trajectory, as they are fundamental to being able to introduce digital solutions in any sector. Variety in education and training in cybersecurity at all levels of education and working life will enable the positive development of knowledge and competence necessary in both Iceland and international competition. Improvements in law enforcement on the Internet will also open more accessible channels for small and medium companies in urban and rural areas to notify infringe- ments, invoke the law and seek advice. 3.4.4 The Public Greater cooperation allows society to strengthen cybersecurity development, thus enabling the public to utilise the wide range of opportunities in digital solutions. The role of government is in preventative action and in response in the face of danger. In this manner, public trust will grow in the country’s cybersecurity and digital service. Awareness raising and education can help the public better understand its responsi- bility when using the Internet. Emphasis on variety and solidarity will direct the focus on the possibility for everyone to enjoy cybersecurity for all and on active participa- tion of all in creating this. Special attention is paid to the needs of specific groups, e.g. children and cooperation with senior citizens. Improvements in law enforcement on the Internet will also open more accessible channels for the public to notify infringe- ments and invoke the law. Everyone should feel in practice that law and rights are also protected on the Internet.

Introduction  In this National Cybersecurity Strategy, one can find the government’s vision and ob- jectives regarding the state of cybersecurity in Icelandic society, along with indicators  and emphases related to achieving defined objectives.  This strategy replaces an older strategy from 2015. Open consultation on the draft  strategy (White Book) and an evaluation of the state of play in cybersecurity issues  (Green Book) took place in the process of developing this strategy. This strategy is  endorsed by the Minister pursuant to Act no. 78/2019 on the Cyber and Data Security  of Critical Infrastructure. The strategy is also part of the government’s Electronic  Communications Plan.1  With the emphases in mind, the strategy forms a basis for actions in the field of cy- bersecurity that are presented in a separate action plan. The various ministries and  institutions handle the elaboration of actions based on the strategy and their imple- mentation as appropriate. The strategy presents indicators for assessing the success  of actions.  The strategy shall be reviewed at intervals of no more than three years, taking into  account the level of success based on the strategy’s defined indicators.  1 The cybersecurity strategy was endorsed by the Minister for Transport and Local Government in November  2021. Subsequent to the transfer of cybersecurity issues to the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Inno- vation in February 2022, the strategy was reissued. The strategy now covers the years 2022-2037 and has been  endorsed by the Minister.

Research and innovation built on a clear policy will be strengthened, among  other things, in international cooperation and international cluster cooper- ation.  Software and service shall meet increasing security demands and shall be in  accordance with international security standards and criteria. More stringent  security requirements shall be made in procurements and development of  software and all kinds of services in the field of digital solutions. Guidelines  shall be prepared to support this. Clear criteria should be defined for the pub- lic sector for procurement, development and service through digital solutions.  Reliable and secure solutions shall be in place for eIDs and trust services.  The cybersecurity market for service and hardware shall be strengthened  nationally and for export. Cybersecurity service and equipment shall be based  on clear criteria and accreditation as appropriate, including with respect to  security management.  Particular attention shall be paid to threats and security challenges inherent  in outsourcing and the use of purchased services (including use of cloud ser- vices), for example, with respect to jurisdiction, supply chain and ownership.  a  d  b  e  c  f  g  h  i  j  k    Icelandic National Cybersecurity Strategy 2022–2037 February 2022  13  3.2.2 Secure Cyber Environment  Icelanders rely on a comprehensive cybersecurity infrastructure to be in place, which  can efficiently respond to cybersecurity incidents that could threaten national secu- rity, critical infrastructures and the rights of individuals. Particular emphasis shall be  placed on protecting the vulnerable, particularly children.  The rapid development of cybersecurity issues and the ever-changing landscape  require legal and regulatory framework that supports the protection of individuals,  the private sector and society as a whole. This is followed up with law enforcement,  including appropriate societal cooperation.  Indicators  5 See https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Pages/global-cybersecurity-index.aspx 6 According to the Oxford University model (https://gcscc.ox.ac.uk/the-cmm#/), each aspect of cybersecurity  capacity is categorised into five distinct and defined stages of maturity. The medium stage of “Established“ is here  used as a reference.   Status according to the ITU’s5 index  with respect to legal, technical and   organisational measures  Status assessment according to  Oxford model6 with respect to  basic factors of the objective  86% >90%  14 of 30 aspects  reach at least the   stage “Established”  30 of 30 aspects  reach at least the   stage “Established”  Status 2021 Status 2026  https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Pages/global-cybersecurity-index.aspx   February 2022  14  Main Emphases  The legal and regulatory framework fulfils international criteria and expecta- tions, making it possible to tackle abuse and criminal use of the Internet in a  manner equivalent to that in our neighbouring countries. This includes an as- sessment of how well the conditions of the Budapest Convention are fulfilled  and that defences against authentication and data theft are present.  Powerful security organisation is supported based on risk assessment of the  appropriate infrastructure and strengthening resilience.  Security organisation of critical infrastructure reflects best practice with  respect to guidelines of the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, ENISA.  Insider threats are also considered.  Protection of children against abuse on the Internet will be ensured with pol- icy, clear legislation and responsible implementation and monitoring. Other  groups that may need additional protection will also be considered similarly.  Cooperation between law enforcement, the private sector and other stake- holders against cybercrime will be strengthened, as will active participation  in international cooperation in this field.  Monitoring of reliability and resilience will be increased for critical infrastruc- tures and systems of the public and private sectors. The development and  operation of management systems for the security of information based on  international standards will be encouraged.  Cybersecurity will be made an appropriate part of civil security and of foreign  affairs, security and defence.  The police, prosecutors, courts and administrative institutions shall have the  capacity to deal with offences related to the Internet and the international  cooperation this may require.  Regulatory bodies and response systems shall be capable of responding to  serious cybersecurity incidents that can threaten the rights of individuals,  critical infrastructures and society as a whole.  Analysis of cybersecurity threats will be strengthened, and the dissemination  of threat assessments shall be organised. Threat assessment shall be pub- lished at regular intervals.  Efficient organisation shall be in place to facilitate responsible notifications of  breaches in network and software systems and digital service. The Computer  Emergency Response Team (CERT-IS) shall be the point of contact for the dis- semination of reliable information on cyber vulnerabilities.  a  d  b  e  c  f  g  h  i  j  k    Icelandic National Cybersecurity Strategy 2022–2037 February 2022  15  3.3 Cooperation An important factor, and in fact the prerequisite for achieving the strategy’s objec- tives, is to further strengthen and structure cooperation within public administration,  with industry and with the public, with a clear division of roles and responsibility.  Active coordination between official players must be ensured. Wide-reaching consul- tation, coordination and cooperation on cybersecurity creates not only the necessary  security of future digital solutions but also the foundation for profitable industry and  service.    February 2022  16  Main Emphases  Cooperation and coordination in cybersecurity-related matters will be  strengthened within public administration and the industry, based on a  clear division of roles, including issues related to the protection of children  and revolutionary new technology, such as the IoT, artificial intelligence and  quantum computers.  Active coordination between players in public administration shall be en- sured with respect to the cybersecurity of their digital services.   A platform shall be developed for wide-reaching cooperation between public  administration, the private sector and other stakeholders, among other things,  issues related to the dissemination of information and roles of various actors.  The government and the private sector shall work together, among other things,  on advising on matters related to cybersecurity and information security.  Emphasis is placed on diversity and inclusion, as cybersecurity is for all, and  everyone should be enabled to participate. Particular attention shall be paid  to increased participation of women in this respect.   Cybersecurity knowledge and culture will be strengthened and made more  varied by facilitating the involvement of immigrants with appropriate educa- tion, experience and international contact networks.  Defences and protective measures shall take into account fluid, international  cooperation in the fields of cybersecurity and defence.   Coordination with civil protection infrastructure will be increased, among  other things, through increased consultation across ministries and institu- tions, and with industry, through increased cooperation and exercises.  Increased participation:  In international cooperation on cybersecurity, including in membership  of boards and committees with such cooperation on their agendas.  In international cooperation on cybersecurity education, in cooperation  between universities, such as by receiving foreign teachers to Iceland  and encouraging Icelandic students to study cybersecurity abroad.   In cybersecurity awareness initiatives, including competitions for  young people.  In international research and development projects, among other  things, based on cluster cooperation.  a  b  d  e  c  f  g  h  i  ii  iii  iv    Icelandic National Cybersecurity Strategy 2022–2037 February 2022  17  3.4 Impact on Icelandic Society   3.4.1 International Cybersecurity issues have no borders, and Iceland is an active participant in interna- tional cooperation, among other things, on education, research, projects and coordi- nation of public administration. Such cooperation will allow Iceland to be among the  leaders in securely using digital technology.  Iceland’s active participation in international collaborative projects will enable the  development of outstanding cybersecurity competence and knowledge. Such com- petence and knowledge can, among other things, be used in the field of innovation  and development of digital service and cybersecurity and increase opportunities for  a competitive advantage.  Certain aspects of cybersecurity are part of security and defence in Iceland and they  strengthen Icelandic participation in international defence and security operations.  With a robust legal and regulatory framework against cybercrime and the ability to  respond to them, one can avoid Iceland being considered easy target in the digital  world. Iceland’s digital reputation will furthermore improve, its competitiveness will  increase and make the country a more feasible investment option.    February 2022  18  3.4.2 Regional With increased coordination in cybersecurity between public bodies, municipalities  can fully utilise the opportunities of digital technology and simultaneously provide cit- izens and legal entities with more efficient and improved services, e.g. remote health  services, with adequate security regardless of location. With cooperation between  municipalities, one can significantly improve the use of limited resources in the field of  cybersecurity, which is based on increasingly broad knowledge and experience. Empha- sis on small and medium-sized companies across the whole country levels the playing  field for companies while simultaneously facilitating e.g. location independent jobs.  3.4.3 Private Sector Cybersecurity issues are a joint task of the private sector and government, with an em- phasis on strengthening the use of digital technology based on a robust cybersecurity  foundation. Public trust in digital solutions, and thus their use, is likely to grow with  increased cooperation and cybersecurity.  The requirements of the private sector for cutting-edge cybersecurity competence are  on a steadily upward trajectory, as they are fundamental to being able to introduce  digital solutions in any sector. Variety in education and training in cybersecurity at all  levels of education and working life will enable the positive development of knowledge  and competence necessary in both Iceland and international competition.  Improvements in law enforcement on the Internet will also open more accessible  channels for small and medium companies in urban and rural areas to notify infringe- ments, invoke the law and seek advice.  3.4.4 The Public Greater cooperation allows society to strengthen cybersecurity development, thus  enabling the public to utilise the wide range of opportunities in digital solutions. The  role of government is in preventative action and in response in the face of danger. In  this manner, public trust will grow in the country’s cybersecurity and digital service.  Awareness raising and education can help the public better understand its responsi- bility when using the Internet. Emphasis on variety and solidarity will direct the focus  on the possibility for everyone to enjoy cybersecurity for all and on active participa- tion of all in creating this. Special attention is paid to the needs of specific groups, e.g.  children and cooperation with senior citizens. Improvements in law enforcement on  the Internet will also open more accessible channels for the public to notify infringe- ments and invoke the law.  Everyone should feel in practice that law and rights are also protected on the Internet.

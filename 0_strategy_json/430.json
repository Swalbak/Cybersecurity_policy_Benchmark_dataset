VIGuide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy It is a pleasure to present – on behalf of the partners involved – the National Cybersecurity Strategy Guide, aimed at providing an aggregated and harmonised set of principles and good practices on the development, establishment and implementation of national cybersecurity strategies. Facilitated by ITU, twelve partners from the public and private sectors, academia and civil society agreed to share their experience, knowledge and expertise, producing a Guide that gathers existing know-how from the participating organisations as well as providing references to complementary publications, in order to ease access to available resources. Over the last two decades, billions of people around the world have benefited from the exponential growth and rapid adoption of information and communications technologies, and the associated economic and social opportunities. We are witnessing a digital revolution that is profoundly transforming our societies. Cybersecurity is a fundamental factor in achieving socio-economic development. Yet, only seventy-six1 countries around the world have, publicly available, national cybersecurity strategies. It is therefore imperative to boost efforts to produce them. As the title suggests, the objective of the Guide is to instigate strategic thinking and help national leaders and policy-makers to develop, establish and implement national cybersecurity strategies. I am confident that the National Cybersecurity Strategy Guide will serve as a useful tool for all stakeholders with cybersecurity responsibilities. I would personally like to express my gratitude to the partners, for their continuous, invaluable support and commitment in making this project a great success as a concrete example of a successful multistakeholder collaboration.

It is the result of a unique, collaborative and equitable multi-stakeholder effort, which taps into the knowledge, experience and expertise of many organisations in the field of national cybersecurity strategies and policies. Specifically, this Guide has been produced by twelve partners from public and private sectors, as well as and academia and civil society. The partners came together with an appreciation of the need to strengthen cooperation and coordination across the international community on cybersecurity capacity-building. The objective of this effort is to support national leaders and policy-makers in the development of defensive responses to cyber-threats, in the form of a National Cybersecurity Strategy, and in thinking strategically about cybersecurity, cyber-preparedness, response and resilience, building confidence and security in the use of information and communications technologies (ICTs). The National Cybersecurity Strategy Guide was developed through an iterative approach, which sought to reach agreement through consensus-building. It is based on existing resources and aims to facilitate its use by national stakeholders. Wherever possible, the relevant sources and tools used to develop each set of recommendations are listed in the Reference section to encourage their broader use. Cybersecurity is a foundational element underpinning the achievement of socio-economic objectives of modern economies. The hope is that the resulting National Cybersecurity Strategy Guide can serve as a useful tool to all stakeholders, including national policy-makers, legislators and regulators, with cybersecurity responsibilities. In addition, it might have broader applicability, as the concepts introduced can be applied at the regional, or municipal levels, as well as adapted for industry. Preface 6Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 1 Document overview 8Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 1 Document overview 1 Document Overview The purpose of this document is to guide national leaders and policy-makers in the development of a National Cybersecurity Strategy, and in thinking strategically about cybersecurity, cyber-preparedness and resilience. This Guide aims to provide a useful, flexible and user-friendly framework to set the context of a country’s socio-economic vision and current security posture and to assist policy-makers in the development of a Strategy that takes into consideration a country’s specific situation, cultural and societal values, and that encourages the pursuit of secure, resilient, ICT-enhanced and connected societies. The Guide is a unique resource, as it provides a framework that has been agreed on by organisations with demonstrated and diverse experience in this topic area and builds on their prior work in this space. As such, it offers the most comprehensive overview to date of what constitutes successful national cybersecurity strategies. Cybersecurity is a complex challenge that encompasses multiple different governance, policy, operational, technical and legal aspects. This Guide attempts to address, organise and prioritise many of these areas based on existing and well-recognised models, frameworks and other references. The Guide focuses on protecting civilian aspects of cyberspace and as such, it highlights the overarching principles and good practice that need to be considered in the process of drafting, developing and managing a National Cybersecurity Strategy. To this end, the Guide makes a clear distinction between the “process” that will be adopted by countries during the lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy (initiation, stocktaking and analysis, production, implementation, reviews) and the “content”, the actual text that would appear in a National Cybersecurity Strategy document. The Guide does not cover aspects such as the development of defensive or offensive cyber-capabilities by a country’s military, defence forces, or intelligence agencies, even though a number of countries have been developing such capabilities. 1.1 Purpose 1.2 Scope 9Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 1 Document overview In order to provide direction and good practice on “what” should be included in a National Cybersecurity Strategy, as well as on “how” to build, implement and review it, this Guide addresses both elements. The Guide also provides an overview of the core components of what it takes for a country to become cyber-prepared, highlighting the critical aspects that governments should consider when developing their national strategies and implementation plans. Finally, this Guide offers policy-makers a holistic, high-level overview of existing approaches and applications, and a reference to additional and complementary resources that can inform specific national cybersecurity efforts. This Guide has primarily been structured as a resource to help government stakeholders in preparing, drafting and managing their National Cybersecurity Strategy. As such, the content is organised to follow the process and order of a Strategy development: • Section 2 – Introduction: provides an overview of the subject of the Guide with related definitions • Section 3 – Strategy development lifecycle: details the steps in the development of a Strategy and its management during its full lifecycle; • Section 4 – Overarching principles for a Strategy: outlines the cross-cutting, fundamental considerations to be considered during the development of a Strategy; • Section 5 – Focus areas and good practices: identifies the key elements and topics that should be considered during the development of a Strategy; and • Section 6 – Supporting reference materials: provides further pointers to relevant literature that stakeholders can review as part of their drafting effort. In particular, Section 3 addresses the process and aspects related to the development of a National Cybersecurity Strategy (such as preparation, drafting, implementation and long-term sustainability), while Sections 4 and 5 are more focused on the content of a National Cybersecurity Strategy, as they highlight concepts and elements that the document should contain. 1.3 Overall structure and usage of the Guide 10Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 1 Document overview This Guide is first and foremost targeted at policy-makers responsible for developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy. The secondary audience are all the other public and private stakeholders involved in the development and implementation of a Strategy, such as responsible government staff, regulatory authorities, law enforcement, ICT providers, critical infrastructure operators, civil society, academia and research institutions. The Guide could also prove useful to the different stakeholders in the international development community, who provide assistance in cybersecurity. 1.4 Target audience 2 Introduction 12Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2 Introduction Over the last two decades, billions of people around the world have benefited from the exponential growth and rapid adoption of information and communications technologies, and the associated economic and social opportunities. Since its creation, the Internet has evolved from an information-exchange platform to become the backbone of modern business, critical services and infrastructure, social networks, and the global economy as a whole. As a result, national leaders have started to launch digital strategies and to fund projects that increase Internet connectivity and leverage the benefits stemming from the use of ICTs, to stimulate economic growth, to increase productivity and efficiency, to improve service delivery and capacity, to provide access to business and information, to enable e-learning, to enhance workforce skills and to promote good governance. Countries cannot ignore the opportunities associated with becoming connected and participating in the Internet economy. While the reliance of our societies on the digital infrastructure is growing, technology remains inherently vulnerable. The confidentiality, integrity and availability of ICT infrastructure are challenged by rapidly evolving cyber-threats, including electronic fraud, theft of intellectual property and personal identifiable information, disruption of service, and damage or destruction of property. The transformational power of ICTs and the Internet as catalysts for economic growth and social development are at a critical point where citizens’ and national trust and confidence in the use of ICTs are being eroded by cyber-insecurity. To fully realise the potential of technology, states must align their national economic visions with their national security priorities. If the security risks associated with the proliferation of ICT-enabled infrastructure and Internet applications are not appropriately balanced with comprehensive national cybersecurity strategies and resilience plans, countries will be unable to achieve the economic growth and the national security goals they are seeking. In response, nations are developing both offensive and defensive capabilities to defend themselves from illicit and illegal activities in cyberspace and to pre- empt incidents before they can cause harm to their nations. This document will look specifically at defensive responses, particularly in the form of national cybersecurity strategies. 2 Introduction 13Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2 Introduction By developing and implementing a National Cybersecurity Strategy, a nation can improve the security of its digital infrastructure and ultimately contribute to its broader socio-economic aspirations. National leaders need to be strategic about the opportunities offered and the risks posed to their countries by the digital environment; they also need to establish a clear vision of the digital future they wish to create. Several national and international definitions of the term “cybersecurity” exist. For the purpose of this document, the term “cybersecurity” is meant to describe the collection of tools, policies, guidelines, risk management approaches, actions, trainings, best practices, assurance and technologies that can be used to protect the availability, integrity and confidentiality of assets in the connected infrastructures pertaining to government, private organisations and citizens; these assets include connected computing devices, personnel, infrastructure, applications, services, telecommunications systems, and data in the cyber-environment.2 National cybersecurity strategies can take many forms and can go into varying levels of detail, depending on the particular country’s objectives and levels of cyber-readiness. Therefore, there is no established and commonly agreed definition of what constitutes a National Cybersecurity Strategy. Relying on existing research in this area, this document encourages stakeholders to think of a National Cybersecurity Strategy as: • an expression of the vision, high-level objectives, principles and priorities that guide a country in addressing cybersecurity; • an overview of the stakeholders tasked with improving cybersecurity of the nation and their respective roles and responsibilities; and • a description of the steps, programmes and initiatives that a country will undertake to protect its national cyber-infrastructure and, in the process, increase its security and resilience. 2.1 What is cybersecurity 2 Definition adapted from 2.2 Benefits of a National Cybersecurity Strategy and strategy development process 14Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 2 Introduction Setting out the vision, objectives and priorities enables governments to look at cybersecurity holistically across their national digital ecosystem, instead of at a particular sector, objective, or in response to a specific risk – it allows them to be strategic. Priorities for national cybersecurity strategies vary by country, so while the focus for one country may be addressing critical infrastructure-related risks, for others it may be protecting intellectual property, promoting trust in the online environment, or improving cybersecurity awareness of the general public; or a combination of these issues. The need to identify and subsequently prioritise investments and resources is critical to successfully managing risks in an area as all-encompassing as cybersecurity. A National Cybersecurity Strategy also provides the opportunity to align cybersecurity priorities with other ICT-related objectives. Cybersecurity is central to achieving socio-economic objectives of modern economies and the Strategy should reflect how those are supported. This can be done by referencing existing policies that seek to implement a country’s digital or developmental agendas or by assessing how cybersecurity can be incorporated into them. Finally, a National Cybersecurity Strategy development process should translate a government’s vision into coherent and implementable policies that will help it achieve its objectives. This includes not only the steps, programmes and initiatives that should be put in place, but also the resources allocated for those efforts and how these resources should be used. Similarly, the process should identify the metrics that will be used to help ensure that desired outcomes are achieved within set budgets and timelines. 3 Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy 16Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 3 Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy This Section provides an overview of the various phases in the development of a Strategy, which include: • Phase I – Initiation • Phase II – Stocktaking and analysis • Phase III – Production • Phase IV – Implementation • Phase V – Monitoring and evaluation This Section also introduces the key entities that should be involved in the development of the Strategy and highlights other relevant stakeholders that could contribute to the process. This Section ultimately aims to provide the reader with an understanding of the steps to be taken by a nation in order to draft a National Strategy and the possible mechanisms for its implementation according to the nation’s specific needs and requirements, integrating the overarching principles (described in Section 4) and good practice (described in Section 5). This lifecycle, as illustrated in Figure 1, guides users of this document in focusing on strategic thinking about cybersecurity at the national level. 3 Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy 17Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 3 Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy Figure 1 - Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy Decision to issue new Strategy PHASE 5: MONITORING & EVALUATION - Establishing a formal process - Monitoring the progress of the implementation of the Strategy - Evaluating the outcome of the Strategy PHASE 2: STOCKTAKING AND ANALYSIS - Assessing the national cybersecurity landscape - Assessing the cyber-risk landscape PHASE 4: IMPLEMENTATION - Developing the Action Plan - Determining initiatives to be implemented - Allocating human and financial resources for the implementation - Setting timeframes and metrics PHASE 3: PRODUCTION OF THE NATIONAL STRATEGY - Drafting the National Cybersecurity Strategy - Consulting with a broad range of stakeholders - Seeking formal approval - Publishing the Strategy Action Plan National Cybersecurity Strategy Report and Consolidated Repository Adjustments to Action Plan PHASE 1: INITIATION - Identifying the Lead Project Authority - Establishing a Steering Committee - Identifying stakeholders to be involved in the development of the Strategy - Planning the development of the Strategy Strategy Development Plan 18Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 3 Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy In accordance with Sections 4 and 5 of this document, the initiation phase of a National Cybersecurity Strategy provides the foundations for its efficient development. This phase is expected to focus on processes, timelines, and identification of key stakeholders who should be involved in the production of the Strategy. The outcome of this phase is the elaboration of a plan for the development of the Strategy. When foreseen by the country’s governance process, the plan may require the approval of the country’s Executive.3 3.1.1 Identifying the Lead Project Authority In line with the principle of defining clear leadership, roles and resource allocation (Section 4.8), the Strategy development process should be coordinated by a single, competent authority. The Executive should appoint an either pre-existing or newly created public entity, such as a ministry, agency, or a department, to lead the development of the Strategy. This entity, referred to in this document as the Lead Project Authority, should in turn, appoint an individual responsible and accountable for leading the Strategy development process. The Lead Project Authority should be neutral throughout the development process. To this end, it is recommended that this entity be different from the one(s) that will be responsible for the implementation of the Strategy. This or other mechanisms should be adopted to overcome any inherent bias and help avoid intra-governmental competition for resources. 3.1.2 Establishing a Steering Committee The Executive should also establish a Steering Committee to work with the Lead Project Authority in developing the Strategy. It should be empowered to provide guidance, as well as play a role in quality assurance. In addition, it should guarantee the transparency and inclusiveness of the process, in accordance with the principle on clear leadership, roles and resource allocation (Section 4.8). The Steering Committee’s role, set-up and membership should be clearly defined from the outset. As the Steering Committee may need to review sensitive documents, it should be constituted accordingly. It is also important that its membership reflects the various responsibilities given to this body, for instance through seniority of appointments. 3.1 Phase I: Initiation 3 The individual or entity in charge of the decision-making process at the national level. 19Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 3 Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy 3.1.3 Identifying stakeholders to be involved in the development of the Strategy In this step, the Lead Project Authority should identify an initial set of stakeholders to be involved in the development of the Strategy. It should also clarify the roles of the different stakeholders and outline how they will collaborate in order to manage expectations throughout the process. Throughout the process, the Lead Project Authority may need to reach out to additional stakeholders to ensure all pertinent knowledge and expertise is utilised. This would embrace the principle of inclusiveness (Section 4.3), which highlights the importance of cooperation with a range of stakeholders across government, the private sector and civil society. For example, the Lead Project Authority could consider including ICT companies, critical-infrastructure operators, academic experts, and non-governmental organisations working on raising cybersecurity awareness and preparedness, amongst others. Such cooperation mechanism could take the form of an Advisory Committee, that would contribute in providing members to the Steering Committee, as well as be consulted on the various phases. 3.1.4 Planning the development of the Strategy In the final step of the Initiation phase, the Lead Project Authority should prepare a plan for developing the National Cybersecurity Strategy. Once the plan has been drafted, it should be submitted, as applicable, to the Steering Committee and the Executive, for approval, in accordance with the national governance processes. In drafting the plan, the Lead Project Authority should also consider whether the National Cybersecurity Strategy will take the form of legislation or policy, as different options might influence the formal processes that would need to be followed, as well as the timeframe for adoption. The Strategy development plan should identify the major steps and activities, key stakeholders, timelines and resource requirements. It should specify how and when relevant stakeholders will be expected to participate in the development process to contribute input and feedback. It should also identify the human and financial resources needed, and where these could be procured. For example, required expertise could be solicited from intergovernmental organisations, the private sector, academia, or development agencies. Similarly, funding requirements might be addressed through reallocation of dedicated funding streams in existing budgets, or through new funding available from third parties (e.g., international organisations). Particular attention should be placed on securing long-term funding for the full lifecycle of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, including its development, implementation and refinement. For further details on the allocation of resources 20Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 3 Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy for the implementation, please see “Allocating human and financial resources for the implementation” (Section 3.4.3) and for further details on long-term funding, please see “Allocate dedicated budget and resources” (Section 5.1.5). Figure 2 shows possible interactions and distribution of roles between different stakeholders and committees. Further references available on page 55. Figure 2 - Stakeholders Steering Committee Lead Project Authority Consults on Advises Appoints Appoints Contributes Members Plan Risk Profile Stocktaking Consolidation Government’s Executive Advisory Committee 21Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 3 Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy The purpose of this phase is to collect data to assess the national cybersecurity landscape and the current and future cyber-risk landscape to inform the drafting and development of the National Cybersecurity Strategy. The output of this exercise should be a report that provides an overview of the strategic national cybersecurity posture and risk landscapes to be submitted to the Steering Committee. Before beginning the actual production of the text of the Strategy, the Lead Project Authority should carefully analyse and assess the information gathered during the stocktaking phase to ensure that any gaps in cybersecurity capacity are identified and options for addressing them presented. The analysis should result in an assessment of how far the existing policy, regulatory and operational environments meet the stated objectives of the Strategy and highlight where they fall short. Similarly, it should be used to identify specific key issues, such as educational and training gaps. Lastly, the analysis should result in an assessment of all relevant and desirable outcomes for the Strategy, as well as the potential effects and outcomes of means chosen. Further references available on page 55. 3.2.1 Assessing the national cybersecurity landscape For the National Cybersecurity Strategy to be effective, it needs to reflect the cybersecurity posture of the country. To this end, an analysis of the country’s existing cybersecurity strengths and weaknesses should be conducted, and relevant materials and documents should be consulted in collaboration with relevant stakeholders across government, private sector and civil society. This step should embrace the principle of comprehensive approach and tailored priorities (described in Section 4.2). As part of this effort, the Lead Project Authority should identify assets and services critical to the proper functioning of the society and economy, and map existing national laws, regulations, policies, programmes and capacity as they relate to cybersecurity. The Lead Project Authority should also identify existing soft regulatory mechanisms, such as private-public partnerships, and take stock of capabilities that have been developed to address cybersecurity challenges, such as national Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs). Moreover, the roles and responsibilities of existing public agencies with a cybersecurity mandate, such as regulators or data-protection agencies, should be identified and mapped. 3.2 Phase II: Stocktaking and Analysis 22Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 3 Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy Additionally, related data that can inform the country’s cybersecurity posture should be collected. This could include: information on existing national cybersecurity programmes, international initiatives, private sector projects, ICT and cyber-education and skill-development programmes, cyber-R&D initiatives; data on Internet penetration and infection rates, ICT uptake, technology developments; and insights on future ICT and cybersecurity trends and threats. Relevant information provided by the private sector, research institutions and other stakeholder groups should be included in this analysis as well. For developing countries, it is also crucial to map out the collaborative initiatives with development partners to coordinate technical assistance and investments. Finally, the Lead Project Authority should also investigate similar information at the regional and international levels, and examine sector-specific strategies and initiatives. 3.2.2 Assessing the cyber-risk landscape Building on the information collected in the previous step, the Lead Project Authority should assess the risks the nation faces due to digital dependence. This can be achieved through the identification of national digital assets, both public and private, their interdependencies, vulnerabilities and threats, and an estimation of the likelihood and potential impact of a cyber-incident. This effort embraces the principle of risk management and resilience (Section 4.6), which recognises that risk management is critical to fully realising the benefits of the digital environment for socio-economic development. Furthermore, this initial risk assessment can form the basis for future, more specific risk assessments (further information on the Principle of Risk Management and Resilience and how to conduct risk assessments can be found in Section 5.2). The purpose of this phase is to develop the text of the Strategy by engaging key stakeholders from the public sector, private sector and civil society through a series of public consultations and working groups. This broader group of stakeholders, coordinated by the Lead Project Authority, will be responsible for defining the overall vision and scope of the Strategy, setting high-level objectives, taking stock of the current situation (detailed in Phase II), prioritising objectives in terms of impact on society, citizens and the economy, and ensuring the necessary financial resources. As part of this phase, all the cross-cutting principles (Section 4) should be considered and good-practice elements (Section 5) detailed in this Guide should be considered. 3.3 Phase III: Production of the National Cybersecurity Strategy 23Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 3 Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy 3.3.1 Drafting the National Cybersecurity Strategy Once the stocktaking and analysis phase is complete, the Lead Project Authority, in collaboration with the Steering Committee, should initiate the drafting of the Strategy. Dedicated working groups could be created either to focus on specific topics, or to draft different sections of the Strategy. The working groups should follow the processes established in the Initiation Phase, adjusting these as necessary. The Strategy should provide the overall cybersecurity direction for the country; express a clear vision and scope; set objectives to be accomplished within a specific time frame; and prioritise these in terms of impact on society, the economy and infrastructure. Moreover, it should identify possible courses of actions; incentivise implementation efforts; and drive the allocation of required resources to support all these activities. The Strategy may also include some of the findings developed in the Stocktaking and Analysis Phase. Similarly to the step dealing with planning the development of the Strategy, the actual document needs to put forward a clear governance framework (Section 5.1) that defines the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders. This includes the identification of the entity responsible for the management and evaluation of the Strategy, as well as an entity responsible for its overall management and implementation, such as a central authority or a national cybersecurity council. The Strategy also needs to define or confirm the mandate of the different entities responsible for initiating and developing cybersecurity policies and regulations within the country. In addition, it should define the responsibilities and tasks of the entities responsible for collecting threat and vulnerability information, responding to cyber-incidents (e.g., national CERTs), strengthening preparedness and performing crisis management. It should also ensure that it is clear how all of these entities interact with each other and with the central authority. 3.3.2 Consulting with a broad range of stakeholders As mentioned above, engaging stakeholders is crucial for the success of a Strategy. In order to ensure that the final Strategy is based on a shared vision, the draft document should be disseminated across a wide stakeholder group not limited to those who participated in the Strategy development process. This can happen through a variety of engagements, including online consultation, validation workshops, and additional working groups. It is expected that feedback and comments resulting from this process will be used to finalise the Strategy. 3.3.3 Seeking formal approval In the final step of the Strategy development, the Lead Project Authority should ensure that the Strategy is formally adopted by the Executive. This official adoption process will vary by country and be based on how the Strategy is defined in the legislative framework. For example, it could be adopted through a parliamentary procedure or a government decree. 24Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 3 Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy Furthermore, it is pivotal that the Strategy is not only developed with approval from the highest levels of government, but that this commitment continues in its implementation phase. The relevant officials should be held accountable and be supported by both political capital and resources. 3.3.4 Publishing the Strategy The Strategy should be a public document and should be made readily available. Its broad availability will both ensure that the general public is aware of the government’s cybersecurity priorities and objectives, and also support any effort to raise cybersecurity awareness. Should the Strategy be accompanied by an Action Plan, the latter should also indicate additional opportunities for further engagement and cooperation with civil society and the private sector. Further references available on page 55. The Implementation phase is the most important element of the overall National Cybersecurity Strategy lifecycle. A structured approach to implementation, supported by adequate human and financial resources, is critical to the success of the Strategy and needs to be considered as part of its development. The implementation phase is frequently centred on an Action Plan, which guides the various activities envisioned. 3.4.1 Developing the action plan As with the development of the Strategy, its implementation cannot be the sole responsibility of a single authority. Instead, it requires engagement and coordination of a range of different stakeholders across the government, as well as support from civil society and the private sector. The Action Plan, developed in accordance with the principle of clear leadership, roles and resource allocation (Section 4.8), can support the effective implementation of the Strategy. The development of the Action Plan is almost as important as the Plan itself. The process, orchestrated by the Lead Project Authority, should serve as a mechanism to bring the relevant stakeholders together to agree on objectives and outcomes, as well as coordinate efforts and pool resources. 3.4.2 Determining initiatives to be implemented The National Cybersecurity Strategy highlights the government’s objectives and the outcomes they wish to realise across the different focus areas identified. In the Action Plan, the Lead Project Authority should – in coordination with relevant stakeholders – identify the specific initiatives within each focus area that will help meet those objectives. Examples could include organising cybersecurity exercises, 3.4 Phase IV: Implementation 25Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 3 Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy establishing security baselines for critical infrastructures, or setting an incident reporting framework, amongst others. The timeline and effort needed for the implementation of these initiatives should be prioritised in accordance with their criticality to ensure that limited resources are appropriately leveraged. To this end, results and outcomes of Phase II (Stocktaking and analysis) specifically with regards to “Assessing the cyber-risk landscape” (Section 3.2.2) might be considered. 3.4.3 Allocating human and financial resources for the implementation Once the priority initiatives have been identified, the Lead Project Authority should identify specific government entities as owners for each of those initiatives. In turn, these government entities would be responsible and accountable for the implementation of each specific initiative assigned to them and be expected to coordinate their efforts with other relevant stakeholders as part of the implementation process. To ensure these entities can deliver the expected outcomes, the Lead Project Authority should assess whether they have been given an appropriate mandate – legal or otherwise – required for the implementation. The Lead Project Authority should also work with the owners of the specific initiatives to understand what resources are required to accomplish the work. This assessment should incorporate human resources, expertise and funding needs. The Lead Project Authority should then work with the owners to help them identify and secure the required resources in accordance with administrative financial structures of the country. 3.4.4 Setting timeframes and metrics The final critical element of the Action Plan is the development of specific metrics and key performance indicators to assess each of the initiatives undertaken, such as whether the country conducted an awareness campaign on the importance of information sharing, organised and executed a cybersecurity exercise with critical infrastructure sector, or passed a security baseline law. Specific timelines for implementation should also be set. The metrics and key performance indicators should be developed by the Lead Project Authority in partnership with the respective owners. The latter should be encouraged to define and maintain a more detailed set of metrics to facilitate evaluations of the efficiency and effectiveness of the initiatives during and following their completion. Further references available on page 55. 26Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 3 Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy During this phase, a competent authority should devise a formal process to monitor and evaluate the Strategy. In the monitoring phase, the government should ensure that the Strategy is implemented in accordance with its Action Plan. In the evaluation phase, the government and its competent authority should assess whether the Strategy is still relevant in light of the changing risk environment and whether it still reflects the government’s objectives and what adjustments are necessary. 3.5.1 Establishing a formal process To ensure effective monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the Strategy, the government will have to identify an independent entity responsible for monitoring and evaluating the implementation progress and efficiency. The entity should ideally be involved in defining appropriate monitoring and evaluation metrics for the implementation of the Strategy and associated Action Plan and initiatives, which should take place during the Production and Initiation phases. Monitoring and measuring the performance and successful execution of the implementation plan for the Strategy should be part of the governance mechanisms that a country puts in place. Continuous assessment of the implementation plan (i.e. what is going well and what is not) helps inform the Strategy. Good governance mechanisms with regards to the Strategy implementation should also clearly delineate the accountability and responsibility for ensuring successful execution. Establishing metrics or key performance indicators (KPI) by near-term, mid-term and long-term objectives helps reinforce the governance and management mechanisms. Key performance indicators or metrics should be: · Specific – target a specific area for improvement. · Measurable – quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress. · Achievable – state what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources. · Responsible – specify who will do it · Time-related – specify when the result(s) can be achieved. The establishment of baseline metrics will enable better monitoring of actions and highlight areas of potential improvement. Furthermore, the allocation of budgets should match the levels of ambition and complexity of the desired impact. 3.5 Phase V: Monitoring and evaluation 27Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 3 Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy 3.5.2 Monitoring the progress of the implementation of the Strategy The entity responsible for monitoring the progress of implementation of the Strategy should do so in accordance with an agreed upon timeline over the course of the entire lifecycle of the Strategy. The outcome of such monitoring activity (e.g., a report), should note any deviations from the agreed upon timelines and the reasons for any delays, such as priorities shifting, insufficient staffing or resources, etc. This should be done in addition to periodic updates by the owners of the different strands of the implementation of the Strategy to the Lead Project Authority. This approach will ensure that the relevant stakeholders are held accountable to the commitments set; it will also ensure that any challenges to implementation are identified early on. In turn, this would allow the government to either rectify the situation or adapt its plans accordingly based on the lessons learnt in the implementation process. 3.5.3 Evaluating the outcomes of the Strategy In addition to assessing the progress across the agreed upon metrics, it is important to also periodically evaluate the outcomes and compare them with the objectives set. This is critical for understanding whether the objectives of the Strategy are being realised or whether different actions should be considered. As part of this process, the broader risk environment also needs to be regularly re-evaluated to understand whether any external changes are affecting the outcomes of the Strategy. Effectively, this process acts as a light-touch revision of a country’s risk assessment profile. The assessment, together with associated recommendations, should be compiled into a report for the Lead Project Authority, and include ways to update the Action Plan and ensure that it is current and responsive to the changing policy and the risk landscape. Ultimately, the reports produced over the lifecycle of the Strategy should also form the basis for the overall review of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in accordance with the timeline set during the initiation phase. This overarching review should not only consider the progress made and the changes in the external environment, but also re-assess the government’s own priorities and objectives. Further references available on page 55. 28Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 3 Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy 4 Overarching principles 30Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 4 Overarching principles This Section presents nine cross-cutting principles, which taken together can help in the development of a forward-looking and holistic National Cybersecurity Strategy. These principles are applicable to all key focus areas identified in this document. They should be considered in all steps of a National Strategy development process, from the drafting of the National Strategy document to its implementation. The order of these principles reflects a logical narrative rather than an order of importance. The Strategy should set a clear whole-of-government and whole-of-society vision. A Strategy is more likely to be successful when it sets a vision that helps all stakeholders understand what is at stake and why the Strategy is needed (context), what it is to be accomplished (objectives), as well as what it is about and who it impacts (scope). The clearer the vision, the easier it will be for leaders and key stakeholders to ensure a more comprehensive, consistent and coherent approach. A clear vision also facilitates coordination, co-operation and implementation of the Strategy amongst the relevant stakeholders. It should be formulated at a sufficiently high level and consider the dynamic nature of the digital environment. The objectives and implementation timeline of the Strategy should be aligned with this vision. Further references available on page 56. The Strategy should result from an all-encompassing understanding and analysis of the overall digital environment, yet be tailored to the country’s circumstances and prioritised. Cybersecurity is not only a technical challenge but a complex multi-faceted issue, with aspects extending beyond economic and social prosperity into areas such as 4 Overarching Principles 4.1 Vision 4.2 Comprehensive approach and tailored priorities 31Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 4 Overarching principles law enforcement, national and international security, international relations, trade negotiations, sustainable development, etc. It is important to understand all the aspects of cybersecurity and how they interrelate, potentially complementing or competing with each other. Based on this understanding and an analysis of the country’s specific context, priorities can then be defined in line with the objectives and implementation timeline of the Strategy. Priorities will allow for setting up specific objectives and timelines and to allocate the necessary resources. The priorities included in a National Cybersecurity Strategy will vary by country. Some of the cybersecurity topics can be addressed in the same or in separate strategic documents (e.g., digital aspects of national security and defence can be addressed within a national security or defence strategy). Further references available on page 56. The Strategy should be developed with the active participation of all the relevant stakeholders, and it should address their needs and responsibilities. The digital environment has become critical to government, businesses and individuals. These groups face cybersecurity risks and share a level of responsibility in managing them, depending on their role. While it may be a difficult task, identifying and engaging all the relevant stakeholders is essential to the development and successful implementation of a National Cybersecurity Strategy. This will help understand stakeholder needs and their unique knowledge and expertise, thus facilitating cooperation towards achieving the objectives of the Strategy. To foster inclusiveness, the Strategy should be a public document. Further references available on pages 56 and 57. The Strategy should foster economic and social prosperity and maximise the contribution of ICT to sustainable development and social inclusiveness. The digital environment has the potential to expedite economic growth and social progress, to advance key societal values, to improve public-service delivery and capacity, to facilitate international trade, and to promote good governance. 4.4 Economic and Social Prosperity 4.3 Inclusiveness 32Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 4 Overarching principles The increasing reliance on the digital environment for the functioning of societies’ demands increased attention on cybersecurity. However, cybersecurity is not a goal in itself; the Strategy should be aligned with the country’s broader socio-economic objectives and lead to building the trust and confidence necessary to both help realise these objectives as well as protect the country from cyber-threats. Further references available on page 57. The Strategy should respect and be consistent with fundamental values. The Strategy should recognise the fact that rights that people have offline must also be protected online. It should respect universally agreed fundamental rights, including, but not limited to, the ones found in the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as relevant multilateral or regional legal frameworks. Attention should be paid to freedom of expression, privacy of communications and personal-data protection. In particular, the Strategy should avoid facilitating the practice of arbitrary, unjustified or otherwise unlawful surveillance, interception of communications, or processing of personal data. In balancing the needs of the State with those of the individuals, the Strategy should ensure that, where applicable, surveillance, interception of communications and collection of data are conducted within the context of a specific investigation or legal case, authorised by the relevant national authority and on the basis of a public, precise, comprehensive and non-discriminatory legal framework enabling effective oversight, procedural safeguards and remedies. Further references available on pages 57 and 58. The Strategy should enable an efficient management of cybersecurity risks and drive the resilience of the economic and social activities. While the digital environment provides stakeholders with economic and social opportunities, it also exposes them to cybersecurity risk. For example, when organisations use ICT to foster innovation, gain productivity and improve competitiveness, or when governments deploy their services online, cybersecurity incidents can occur, potentially resulting in financial loss, reputational damage, 4.5 Fundamental human rights 4.6 Risk management and resilience 33Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 4 Overarching principles disruption of operations, undermining of innovation, etc. As with other types of risk, cybersecurity risk cannot be entirely eliminated but they can be managed and minimised. To address that challenge, the Strategy should encourage entities to prioritise their cybersecurity investments and to proactively manage risk. Depending on an entity’s risk appetite, a balance has to be maintained between security measures and potential benefits, considering the dynamic nature of the digital environment. The Strategy should also recognise the need for continuous risk management and facilitate a coherent approach across interdependent entities. The focus on risk management will also prepare stakeholders for potential security incidents, ensuring the resilience of economic and societal activity in the country. With that in mind, the Strategy should encourage the adoption of business- continuity measures, which include incident and crisis management, as well as recovery plans. Further references available on page 58. The Strategy should utilise the most appropriate policy instruments available to realise each of its objectives, considering the country’s specific circumstances. The government’s cybersecurity goals will only be achieved if a change in behaviour occurs across all stakeholders involved. In most cases, governments have different levers and policy instruments at their disposal to achieve that outcome. These include legislation, regulation, standardisation, incentive and information-sharing programmes and mechanisms, education programmes, sharing best-practice, setting expected norms of behaviour, and building communities of trust among others. Each of these has its own strengths and weaknesses, comes at differing cost, and brings different results. The best results can be achieved by selecting the most appropriate policy instrument for each individual objective and balancing the use of different tools. Further references available on page 59. 4.7 Appropriate set of policy instruments 34Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 4 Overarching principles The Strategy should be set at the highest level of the government, which will then be responsible for assigning relevant roles and responsibilities and allocating sufficient human and financial resources. Cybersecurity should be promoted and sustained at the highest levels of government. Moreover, to ensure accountability and progress, focal points of individual work streams need to be identified, and all parties involved should have a clear understanding of their respective roles and responsibilities. The Strategy should also allocate the human, financial and material resources necessary for its implementation. This principle needs to guide both the Strategy development process and the elaboration of the action plan for the Strategy. Further references available on page 59. The Strategy should help build a digital environment that citizens and businesses can trust. Building trust in the national digital ecosystem, in which users’ rights and interests are protected and security of data and systems is assured, is essential to realise the full potential of the social, political and economic opportunities offered by the use of ICTs. The Strategy must enable policies, processes and actions at the national level in order to render secure critical services (including e-governance, e-commerce and digital financial transactions, among others) supported by ICTs and utilised by the citizens. Such course of actions would inculcate the principle of trust not only among the general population but also within those public and private organisations that will offer their ICT-related services to citizens. Further references available on page 59. 4.8 Clear leadership, roles, and resource allocation 4.9 Trust environment 5 National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice 36Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 5 National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice Cybersecurity affects many areas of socio- economic development and is influenced by several factors within the national context. Therefore, this Section introduces a set of good-practice elements that can make the Strategy comprehensive and effective, while allowing for tailoring to the national context. These good-practice elements are grouped into distinct focus areas – effectively overarching themes for a National Cybersecurity Strategy. While both the focus areas and the elements have been put forward here as examples of good practice, it is particularly important that the latter are viewed in the national context, as some may not be relevant to a country’s specific situation. Countries should identify and follow the good-practice elements that support their own objectives and priorities in line with the vision defined in their Strategy (Section 4). The order of the individual elements or focus areas below should not be seen as indicating a level of importance or priority. This focus area introduces good-practice elements to be considered for inclusion in the text of the Strategy when addressing the governance structure for national cybersecurity. The Strategy should clearly state the objectives and ambitions the government has in mind for cybersecurity, as well as outline the roles and accountabilities required to ensure its implementation. To that end, the Strategy should identify and empower the competent authority accountable for the execution of the Strategy; establish a mechanism to identify and include the government entities affected by, or responsible for, the implementation of the Strategy; commit to include specific, measurable, attainable, result-based and time-based objectives in the implementation plan for the Strategy; and recognise the need to commit resources (e.g., political will, funding, time and people) to achieve the desired outcomes. 5.1.1 Ensure the highest level of support The Strategy should have the formal endorsement of the highest level of government. This endorsement serves two important purposes. Firstly, it improves the likelihood that sufficient resources will be allocated and that coordination efforts will be successful. Secondly, it signals to the broader national ecosystem how significant the country finds cybersecurity. 5 National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice 5.1 Focus area 1 - Governance 37Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 5 National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice 5.1.2 Establish a competent cybersecurity authority The Strategy should identify a dedicated national-competent cybersecurity authority – a leader (whether an individual or an entity) who is elevated and strongly anchored at the highest level of government to provide direction, to coordinate action, and to monitor the implementation of the Strategy. Such a national competent cybersecurity authority should also act as management entity to define and clarify roles, responsibilities, processes, decision rights, and the tasks required to ensure effective implementation of the Strategy. This includes identifying the stakeholders who will oversee the implementation of the Strategy and establishing performance targets for various ministerial or governmental departments, institutions, or individuals responsible for specific aspects of the Strategy and subsequent action plan. This approach may require additional policy or legal structures to empower them to perform their missions. Given the fact that cybersecurity intersects many different issue areas, it is important to ensure that the national-competent authority has the ability to involve and direct relevant stakeholders. 5.1.3 Ensure intra-government cooperation The Strategy should establish a mechanism to identify and include the government entities affected by or responsible for its implementation. Intra- governmental commitment, coordination and cooperation are core functions of those governmental institutions, needed to ensure that the governance mechanisms (i.e. rules) and resources yield the desired outcomes of the Strategy. Effective communication and coordination ensure that all ministries and government agencies are aware of each other’s respective authorities, missions and tasks. Commitment, however, is about supporting consistent policies over time to ensure that promises in the Strategy are delivered. An example of a coordination mechanism would be conducting periodic meetings that involve all relevant stakeholders in the plans of actions that are to be jointly reviewed. An example of a cooperation mechanism would be the creation of an intra- government task force to address a particular issue. An example of commitment is consistency between the country’s domestic and foreign policy agendas, so that one ministry does not undermine the credibility of another by representing different positions on the same policy issue area. 5.1.4 Ensure inter-sectoral cooperation The Strategy should reflect an understanding of the dependencies that the government has on the private sector and other national stakeholders (and vice-versa) in ensuring cybersecurity. To this end, it should articulate how the government will engage these stakeholders and define their roles and responsibilities. For example, the Strategy should identify a network of authoritative national contact points for critical industries that are essential for the operation and recovery of critical services and infrastructures. 38Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 5 National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice 5.1.5 Allocate dedicated budget and resources The Strategy should specify the allocation of dedicated and appropriate resources for its implementation, maintenance and revision. Sufficient, consistent and continuous funding provides the foundations for an effective national cybersecurity posture. Resources should be defined in terms of money (i.e. dedicated budget), people, material, as well as the relationships and partnerships and continued political commitment and leadership required for successful execution. Resourcing the objectives and tasks within the Strategy should not be viewed as a one-time initiative. Resources can be allocated by task or objective, or by a governmental entity. The government may also consider the establishment of a central budget for cybersecurity, managed by a central cybersecurity governance mechanism. Whether assembling disparate funding sources into a coherent, integrated programme or creating a unified intra-governmental budget, the overall programme should be managed and tracked by milestones to ensure successful implementation of the Strategy. 5.1.6 Develop an implementation plan The Strategy should be accompanied by, or reference, an implementation plan that outlines in greater detail how its strategic objectives will be achieved. Effective implementation plans identify the accountable entity responsible for each task and objective, the resources required to execute them over time (near- term, mid-term, long-term), the processes that will be used, and the outcomes that are expected (Section 3.4 on Initiating Implementation). Further references available on pages 60 and 61. This focus area introduces good practices for addressing cybersecurity through risk management. As stipulated in the Principle of Risk Management and Resilience (Section 4.2), a risk-management approach should be adopted, as cyber-risks cannot be fully eliminated. Rather, ensuring that a country has a good understanding of the risks that it is exposed to allows it to manage these most effectively. In terms of assessing risk, the approach should focus on identifying inter-dependencies and also consider risks arising from dependencies across the national border. The risk-management approach should consider the whole lifecycle, from development or procurement to operation and replacement. It is also important to note that, as cybersecurity threats are extremely dynamic and unpredictable, any risk-management approach should be reviewed regularly. As such, the Strategy should plan for monitoring and evaluation of risk- management activities to ensure continuous improvement. 5.2 Focus area 2 - Risk management in national cybersecurity 39Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 5 National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice 5.2.1 Define a risk-management approach The Strategy should define a coherent approach for risk management to be followed by all government entities and critical-infrastructure operators identified domestically. The approach should result in the identification of key assets and services critical to the proper functioning of the society and economy, threats, and the risks associated with them. The approach should aim to develop a national risk register, securely stored and communicated, to allow government oversight of risks and approaches taken to manage these. The approach should moreover develop a method of prioritisation based on a calculation of the probability of realising the risks and their impact. It should furthermore specify the responsibilities of key entities in each sector regarding the assessment, acceptance and treatment of national-level cybersecurity risks. 5.2.2 Identify a common methodology for managing cybersecurity risk The Strategy should identify a common methodology for managing cybersecurity risks. This will ensure efficiency and consistency across all organisations and facilitate the exchange of risk information across inter-dependent systems. A methodology based on international standards should be favoured as it may reduce costs and yield better interaction with the private sector. The methodology should provide guidance on assigning roles and responsibilities for various aspects of managing risk, such as assessing the threats, valuing assets, implementing and maintaining mitigating measures, and accepting the residual risk. The methodology should include a certification programme to help assess and eventually improve compliance. Importantly, for the procurement and development of infrastructure or services, the risk-management methodology should furthermore provide guidance on minimising risk through secure architecture and design, recognising that security is best achieved where it is an integral part of the design process of a product, process or service (security by design). 5.2.3 Develop sectoral cybersecurity risk profiles The Strategy should call for the use of sectoral risk profiles for cybersecurity. A sectoral risk profile is a quantitative analysis of the types of threats faced. The goal of a risk profile is to provide a less-subjective understanding of risk by assigning numerical values to variables representing different types of threats and the danger they pose. The Strategy should recommend risk profiles to be developed for those sectors that the country considers critical to its society and economy. The use of sectoral risk profiles provides a basis for more specific risk assessments for individual organisations, introduces coherence within and across all sectors nationally, and reduces the resources needed for organisational risk assessments. They should be regularly updated to ensure that they remain current. 40Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 5 National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice 5.2.4 Establishing cybersecurity policies The Strategy should encourage the establishment of cybersecurity policies for critical national entities, such as government authorities and critical infrastructures operators, among others. Such policies, adopted in accordance with the Principle of an Appropriate Set of Policy Instruments (Section 4.7), would cover governance, operational and technical requirements, and instruct stakeholders on their roles and responsibilities, as well as guide or mandate specific approaches to these issues. For example, this could include policies that address cybersecurity in procurement or development, define information-sharing programmes, coordinate vulnerability disclosure, set minimum standards of care, specify security baselines, define certification programmes for compliance, and mandate the reporting of cyber-incidents. A coordinated approach at the national level would lead to more efficient and effective cybersecurity management, as it would harmonise practices and facilitate coordination and interoperability. Further references available on page 61. This focus area provides an overview of good practices that support the establishment and sustainability of effective national capabilities to prevent, detect, mitigate and respond to major cybersecurity incidents, and to improve a country’s overall cyber-resilience. 5.3.1 Establish cyber-incident response capabilities The Strategy should call for the establishment of appropriate national incident- response capabilities to address operational cybersecurity challenges. Often, this capability refers to the establishment of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs), Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) or Computer Incident Response Teams (CIRTs) with national responsibility. Although the specific organisational form of a CERT/CSIRT/CIRT may vary (e.g., national, government, sectoral, etc.), and not every country may have the same needs and resources, these specialised and dedicated teams should provide a set of both proactive and reactive functions, as well as preventive and educational services. Thus, these entities can increase a country’s ability to respond quickly and recover from cyberattacks, as well as improve its resilience against cyber- threats, reducing the possible overall economic and operational impact of nationally significant cyberattacks. 5.3 Focus area 3 - Preparedness and resilience 41Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 5 National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice The Strategy should also identify and develop cooperation mechanisms and communication procedures between national and sectorial incident-response teams (should they exist in the country), as well as with international counterparts. 5.3.2 Establish contingency plans for cybersecurity crisis management The Strategy should call for the development of a national contingency plan for cybersecurity emergencies and crises. The plan should be part of, or aligned with, the overall national contingency plan. A specific plan for critical information infrastructures should also be considered. This national cybersecurity contingency plan should consider the findings from the national risk assessments and any cross-sector dependencies that could affect the continuity of operations of critical infrastructures, as well as any disaster- recovery mechanisms. Moreover, it should provide an overview of the national incident-response mechanisms; as well as highlight how cybersecurity incidents are categorised, based on their impact on critical assets and services. 5.3.3 Promote information-sharing The Strategy should call for the establishment of information-sharing mechanisms to enable the exchange of actionable intelligence and threat information between and amongst the public and private sectors. Formal and informal information-sharing programmes can help foster effective coordination and consistent, accurate and appropriate communications during incident response and recovery activities; facilitate rapid sharing of threat and intelligence information among affected parties and other stakeholders; help improve the understanding of how and which sectors have been targeted; disseminate information on the methods that can be used to defend and mitigate damage on the affected assets; and ultimately reduce vulnerabilities and exposure along with their attendant risks. The Strategy should identify one or more institutional structures (i.e. competent authorities) responsible for transmitting accurate and actionable information among the national cybersecurity community, including the public and private sectors. Information-sharing should be a two-way process. If governments are willing to share the information they retain, their actions will demonstrate to private sector entities that the government is indeed a partner in threat-information sharing, and help ensure that responders are focused on and better prepared to respond to essential threats. 5.3.4 Conduct cybersecurity exercises The Strategy should encourage the organisation and coordination of domestic and international cybersecurity and incident response exercises. These can follow different formats (e.g., simulations or real-time exercises) and target the technical and decision-making audiences. 42Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 5 National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice Cybersecurity exercises and other crisis planning mechanisms can help countries develop the institutional capacity to perform incident response effectively, test crisis-management procedures and communication mechanisms, verify the operational ability of CERTs/CSIRTs/CIRTs to respond under pressure, and help understand any cross-sector dependencies. Similarly, international cybersecurity exercises can help strengthen cyber-incident response capacity among states, understand cross-border dependencies, build confidence and trust between countries, and improve the overall international resilience and preparedness levels. Further references available on pages 62 and 63. This focus area investigates good practice relating to protecting Critical Infrastructures (CIs), and in particular Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs). While there are no universally recognised definitions for the two terms and the governments need to consider which entities and services to include based on their own national risk assessment, for the purpose of this Guide, these terms are defined as follows: • Critical Infrastructures (CI) is a term used to describe assets that are essential to the functioning and security of a society and economy in any given nation; and • Critical Information Infrastructures (CII) are IT and ICT systems that operate key functions of the critical infrastructure of a nation. Alternatively, the concept of essential services may be applied, referring to services, which are essential for the maintenance of critical societal or economic activities. In either case, a few non-exhaustive examples of these services include: energy (electricity, oil and gas), transportation (air, rail, water and road), finance and banking (credit institutions, trading venues and central counterparties), healthcare (healthcare organisations, including hospitals and private clinics), drinking- water supply and distribution, digital and telecommunications (fixed and mobile telephone services and provision of internet infrastructure, such as internet exchange points (IXPs) and domain name service, among others). 5.4 Focus area 4 - Critical Infrastructure services and essential services 43Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 5 National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice 5.4.1 Establish a risk-management approach to protecting critical infrastructures and services The Strategy should address the protection of CIs and CIIs from a risk- management perspective, in accordance with Principle of Risk Management and Resilience (Section 4.6). A detailed risk assessment should guide the identification of national CIs and CIIs and critical services, whose disruption may have a serious impact on the health, safety, security, or economic well-being of citizens, or on the effective functioning of government or the economy. Furthermore, a risk-based approach should also be adopted in identifying and prioritising implementation of programmes and policies designed to protect CIs and CIIs. To facilitate engagement with the private sector, a risk-management approach based on international standards might also be considered. 5.4.2 Adopt a governance model with clear responsibilities The Strategy should at a high level describe the governance structure, roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders for CI and CII protection. As stipulated in the Principle of Clear Leadership, Roles and Resource Allocation (Section 4.8), an effective and efficient CI-protection programme requires that stakeholders have clearly defined roles and responsibilities and establish a coordination mechanism for managing ongoing issues. CIs and CIIs are often not owned or controlled by the government, and CI and CII protection efforts generally exceed the capabilities and mandate of any single agency in a government. Thus, appointing an overall coordinator for CI and CII (cyber-)security, such as an interagency committee, can greatly assist in efforts to protect critical infrastructure. The governance model for CI and CII protection should include the identification of government entities in charge of specific verticals, the responsibilities and accountability of operators of CIs and CIIs, as well as the communication channels and cooperation mechanisms between public and private agencies to ensure the operation and recovery of critical services and infrastructures. 5.4.3 Define minimum cybersecurity baselines The Strategy should either highlight the existing or propose the development of new legislative and regulatory frameworks outlining minimum cybersecurity baselines for CI and CII operators, among others. When developing such baselines, internationally recognised standards and best practices should be considered to ensure better security outcomes and greater efficiencies. Security baselines should be outcomes-focused, articulating what organisations should aim to achieve (e.g., “control logical access to critical resources”), rather than how organisations should implement security (e.g., “utilise two-factor authentication”), which in turn can allow government and industry to benefit 44Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 5 National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice from continuous security improvements. In addition, an outcomes-based approach to the development of these baselines leaves room for sector-specific implementation or “how to” guidance, which allows enterprises the flexibility to regularly update their own guidance to reflect the changing technology and threat environments. 5.4.4 Utilise a wide range of market levers The Strategy should consider a wide range of policies to ensure that all organisations and individuals are indeed incentivised to fulfil their individual cybersecurity responsibilities, commensurate with the risks they face, in accordance with the principle of comprehensive approach and tailored priorities (Section 4.2). Identifying gaps between what the markets can and should drive and what the risk environment requires is a crucial step towards determining when and how to leverage the range of incentives and disincentives available to improve security. To encourage the uptake of cybersecurity standards and practices across CIs and CIIs, the Strategy should indicate that the government will consider a range of policy options and market levers at its disposal. 5.4.5 Establish public-private partnerships The Strategy should encourage the creation of formal public-private partnerships to increase the security of Cis and CIIs. Public-private partnerships are a cornerstone of effectively protecting critical infrastructure and managing security risks in both the short- and long-term. They are essential for boosting trust amongst and between the industry and the government. However, establishing sustainable partnerships requires that all of the participating stakeholders have a clear understanding of the goals of the partnership and the mutual security benefits that stem from working together. Some of the areas could include: coming to an agreement on common cybersecurity baselines, establishing effective coordinating structures and information-sharing processes and protocols, building trust, identifying and exchanging ideas, approaches and best practices for improving security, as well as improving international coordination. Further references available on pages 63 and 64. 45Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 5 National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice Technology and policy considerations can dominate cybersecurity discussions, overlooking the fundamental human element at its core. This Focus Area addresses the challenges related to advancing cybersecurity capacity-building and awareness-raising among government entities, citizens, businesses and other organisations – crucial to enabling a country’s digital economy. Good practices considered in this section include, the establishment of dedicated cybersecurity curricula and awareness-raising programmes, expansion of training schemes and workforce-development programmes, adoption of international certification schemes, and promotion of innovation and research and development (R&D) clusters. 5.5.1 Develop cybersecurity curricula The Strategy should facilitate the development of school curricula with the aim of accelerating cybersecurity skills development and awareness throughout the formal education system. This should include developing dedicated cybersecurity curricula across primary and secondary schools, integrating cybersecurity courses in all computer science and IT programmes in higher education, and creating dedicated cybersecurity degrees and government apprenticeships. Additionally, the school curricula should foster awareness of and stimulate interest in cybersecurity career opportunities. To further the efforts in this space, the government should also consider establishing various incentive schemes, such as scholarships for private education programmes and grants for relevant apprenticeships. 5.5.2 Stimulate skills development and workforce training The Strategy should address the development of cybersecurity training and skills- development schemes for experts and non-experts in both public and private sectors. The effort could include the provision of executive and operational training, formal internships and traineeships, and (national and international) certification of security professionals, based on the needs identified by industry and government. Technical training should be complemented with initiatives focused on risk management. The Strategy should also foster initiatives, which aim to develop dedicated cybersecurity career paths, in particular for the public sector, and incentives to increase the supply of qualified cybersecurity professionals. These should be created in partnership with academia, the private sector and civil society. To address the ongoing gender gap of experts in cybersecurity, a gender-balanced approach that motivates, encourages and facilitates more engagement from women should be considered across all efforts aimed at skills-development and training, ensuring inclusivity in the future. 5.5 Focus area 5 - Capability and capacity building and awareness raising 46Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 5 National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice 5.5.3 Implement a coordinated cybersecurity awareness-raising programme The Strategy should assign responsibility to coordinate cybersecurity awareness campaigns and activities at the national level to a competent authority to ensure resources are streamlined and accountability established. The authority should collaborate with relevant stakeholders to develop and implement cybersecurity awareness programmes focusing on disseminating information about cybersecurity risks and threats, as well as about best practices for countering them. A cybersecurity awareness-raising programme could include awareness-raising campaigns aimed at the general public, children, digitally challenged, consumer- focused education programmes, and awareness-raising initiatives among others, targeted at executives across public and private sectors. 5.5.4 Foster cybersecurity innovation and R&D The Strategy should foster an environment that stimulates basic and applied research in cybersecurity across sectors and various stakeholder groups. Such initiatives include, for example, ensuring that national research efforts support the objectives of the National Cybersecurity Strategy; developing cybersecurity- focused R&D programmes in public research organisations; effective dissemination of new findings, baseline technologies, techniques, processes and tools. Moreover, as part of the Strategy, countries should also seek to establish ties with the international research community in the scientific fields related to cybersecurity, such as computer science, electrical engineering, applied mathematics and cryptography, but also non-technical fields such as social and political sciences, business and management studies and psychology to name a few. The Strategy should look at incentive mechanisms available from grants, procurements, tax credits, competitions and other initiatives that encourage the development of innovative cybersecurity solutions, products and services. Further references available on pages 64 and 65. This focus area covers the development of a legal and regulatory framework to protect society against cybercrime and promote a safe and secure cyber- environment, in accordance with the Principles of Inclusiveness and on Trust Environment (Sections 4.3 and 4.9, respectively). Such a framework could include: the adoption of legislation that defines what constitutes illegal cyber-activity; legal recognition of individual rights and civil liberties; establishment of compliance mechanisms; the building of capacity to enforce the framework; institutionalisation of critical entities; and international cooperation to fight cybercrime. 5.6 Focus area 6 - Legislation and regulation 47Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 5 National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice 5.6.1 Establish cybercrime legislation The Strategy should promote the development of a domestic legal framework that clearly defines what constitutes prohibited cyber-activity, and that aims to reduce online crime. Most often, this capability takes the form of cybercrime legislation, which can be achieved by enacting specific new laws or amending existing ones (e.g., the penal code, laws regulating banking, telecommunications and other sectors). The Strategy should also encourage the creation of a process to monitor the implementation and review of legislation and governance mechanisms, identify gaps and overlapping authorities, and clarify and prioritise areas that require modernisation (e.g., existing laws such as old telecommunication laws). 5.6.2 Recognise and safeguard individual rights and liberties The Strategy should safeguard essential due process rights (in the case of criminal investigations and prosecutions), as well as rights of data protection, including protecting the privacy of personal data (possibly through the development of a data-protection and privacy framework) and freedom of expression, in accordance with the Principle of Fundamental Human Rights (Section 4.5). 5.6.3 Create compliance mechanisms The Strategy should promote the establishment of domestic compliance mechanisms (both enforcement and incentives). These mechanisms should be set in place to prevent, combat and mitigate actions directed against the confidentiality, integrity and availability of ICT systems and infrastructures, and threatening computer data, in accordance with the aforementioned legal framework. They should inter alia cover the particularities of digital investigation, lawful interception of communications and use of electronic evidence. 5.6.4 Promote capacity-building for law enforcement The Strategy should encourage the development of cyber-law-enforcement capacity, including training and education for a range of stakeholders involved in combating cybercrime (e.g., judges, prosecutors, lawyers, law-enforcement officials, forensic specialists and other investigators). Law enforcement should receive specialised training to interpret and apply domestic cybercrime laws (i.e., translate the law into technical notions and vice versa); to effectively detect, deter, investigate and prosecute cybercrime offenses; and to effectively collaborate with industry and international law-enforcement entities (e.g., INTERPOL, Europol) to tackle cybercrime and to boost cybersecurity. This element should take into consideration focus area 5 on Capability and Capacity Building and Awareness Raising (Section 5.5). 48Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 5 National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice 5.6.5 Establish inter-organisational processes The Strategy should identify and recognise the mandates of domestic agencies with the primary authority to ensure compliance with cybercrime legislation, those responsible for protecting critical infrastructures, and those responsible for ensuring that all international cybercrime requirements are being met (e.g., ensure that national laws comply with international treaty obligations) and across judicial lines (e.g., cross-border cooperation) (see also Section 5.1.3 and 5.1.4; and Section 5.6.6). In some legal systems, legislation might be required for the establishment of institutions involved in cybersecurity, such as national CERTs/CIRTs/CSIRTs, or in clarifying the authority of a single agency to coordinate cyber-policy in a country. 5.6.6 Support international cooperation to combat cybercrime The Strategy should demonstrate a commitment to protect society against cybercrime globally, through ratification, where possible and in accordance with the overall national agenda, of international cybercrime agreements or equivalent agreements to fight cybercrime, and through the promotion of coordination mechanisms to address international cybercrime. This may include aligning national laws with international treaty obligations and bilateral agreements, for example by establishing mutual legal assistance, enabling cross-border investigations and prosecutions, handling of digital evidence, and extradition. This element should take into consideration focus area 7 on international cooperation (Section 5.7). Further references available on pages 65 and 66. This focus area emphasises the elements that the Strategy should cover in terms of cybersecurity engagements outside the particular country, both at regional and international levels. Cybersecurity increasingly plays a role in many different areas of international relations, including human rights, economic development, trade, commerce, arms control, security, stability, peace and conflict resolution. The Strategy should therefore recognise the borderless nature of cybersecurity, and highlight the need to cooperate with not only national, but also international stakeholders. International engagements with public and private stakeholders are key to facilitating a constructive dialogue, developing trust and cooperation mechanisms, finding mutually acceptable solutions to common challenges, and creating a global culture of cybersecurity. In accordance with the principle of comprehensive approach and tailored priorities (Section 4.2), regional and international cooperation should be fostered in 5.7 Focus area 7 - International cooperation 49Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 5 National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice harmony with the political, social, cultural and economic layout of the country, as well as its foreign-policy priorities. 5.7.1 Recognise the importance of cybersecurity as a priority of foreign policy The Strategy should express a commitment to international cooperation on cybersecurity and recognise cyber-issues as an integral component of the country’s foreign policy. To this end, it is important to encourage the development and use of competencies and skills focused on cyber-issues (cyber-diplomacy) to complement the traditional methods and processes of diplomacy. The Strategy may also include the development of specific organisational structures and the establishment of some dedicated office or trained personnel whose primary focus is diplomatic engagement on cyber-issues. More specifically, the Strategy should clearly articulate the government’s focus areas and long-term objectives for international cooperation, including which stakeholders (for instance, public, private, regional, global) would be engaged. These might include, for instance, support for establishment of international cybersecurity norms and confidence-building measures, commitment to cybersecurity capacity-building, participation in the development of international cybersecurity standards, as well as joining existing regional and international instruments. This may also require better harmonisation among different governmental players (e.g., head of state and cabinet, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of ICT, Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Defence, etc.) so that the policy position expressed by one domestic player at a negotiating table in the international cybersecurity arena is properly coordinated and aligned with other governmental bodies. 5.7.2 Engage in international discussions The Strategy should identify specific international fora and cooperation mechanisms that the country wishes to join to effectively engage diplomatically on cyber-related issues. These could include regional or global organisations, intergovernmental discussions, public and/or private-sector alliances, as well as established traditional cooperation and collaboration mechanisms that include cybersecurity issues. As the country begins to undertake such engagements, these will likely require the government to develop additional competencies and skills focused on cyber- issues and increase its overall cybersecurity capacity. It is therefore important to effectively prioritise these efforts and allocate adequate resources (personnel and money) to ensure that they deliver concrete results. 50Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy 5 National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice 5.7.3 Promote formal and informal cooperation in cyberspace The Strategy should indicate the operational international-cooperation mechanisms that the country wishes to commit to. The country may wish to engage in formal and informal international endeavours advancing cooperation on, for example, policy and legislative development, law enforcement, incident- response, information- and threat-sharing. Participation in such initiatives could, for example, support better cooperation and exchange of information between relevant authorities on potential threats and vulnerabilities. 5.7.4 Align domestic and international cybersecurity efforts The Strategy should consider existing regional and international cybersecurity initiatives and foster harmonisation and alignment. This would allow the country to leverage existing best practices, as well as to contribute towards cohesion and convergence of cybersecurity approaches. To this end, the Strategy should show the country’s commitment to ensuring consistency between its domestic and foreign-policy agendas by harmonising its national legal framework and policies with its international commitments, and aligning its national cybersecurity approaches with its international efforts. Notable examples of existing international efforts that could be considered as part of the Strategy include, but are not limited to: the work of the United Nations Governmental Group of Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UN GGE), the Organisation of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) on confidence building measures (CBMs) and international norms applicable in cyberspace, the work of the G7 Group’s High-Tech Crime Subgroup, the Council of Europe’s Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, the African Union’s Convention on Cybersecurity, the agreement between the governments of state members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on cooperation in the field of ensuring international information security, the Arab Convention on Combating Information Technology Offences, the ECOWAS Directive on fighting cybercrime, as well as the support of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (NATO CCD COE) for the Tallinn Manuals 1.0 and 2.0.

VIGuide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  It is a pleasure to present – on behalf of the partners involved – the National  Cybersecurity Strategy Guide, aimed at providing an aggregated and  harmonised set of principles and good practices on the development,  establishment and implementation of national cybersecurity strategies.  Facilitated by ITU, twelve partners from the public and private sectors, academia  and civil society agreed to share their experience, knowledge and expertise,  producing a Guide that gathers existing know-how from the participating  organisations as well as providing references to complementary publications, in  order to ease access to available resources.  Over the last two decades, billions of people around the world have  benefited from the exponential growth and rapid adoption of information  and communications technologies, and the associated economic and social  opportunities. We are witnessing a digital revolution that is profoundly  transforming our societies.   Cybersecurity is a fundamental factor in achieving socio-economic  development. Yet, only seventy-six1 countries around the world have, publicly  available, national cybersecurity strategies. It is therefore imperative to boost  efforts to produce them. As the title suggests, the objective of the Guide is  to instigate strategic thinking and help national leaders and policy-makers to  develop, establish and implement national cybersecurity strategies.   I am confident that the National Cybersecurity Strategy Guide will serve as  a useful tool for all stakeholders with cybersecurity responsibilities. I would  personally like to express my gratitude to the partners, for their continuous,  invaluable support and commitment in making this project a great success as a  concrete example of a successful multistakeholder collaboration.

It is the result  of a unique, collaborative and equitable multi-stakeholder effort, which taps into  the knowledge, experience and expertise of many organisations in the field of  national cybersecurity strategies and policies. Specifically, this Guide has been  produced by twelve partners from public and private sectors, as well as and  academia and civil society.   The partners came together with an appreciation of the need to strengthen  cooperation and coordination across the international community on  cybersecurity capacity-building. The objective of this effort is to support  national leaders and policy-makers in the development of defensive responses to  cyber-threats, in the form of a National Cybersecurity Strategy, and in thinking  strategically about cybersecurity, cyber-preparedness, response and resilience,  building confidence and security in the use of information and communications  technologies (ICTs).  The National Cybersecurity Strategy Guide was developed through an iterative  approach, which sought to reach agreement through consensus-building.  It is based on existing resources and aims to facilitate its use by national  stakeholders. Wherever possible, the relevant sources and tools used to develop  each set of recommendations are listed in the Reference section to encourage  their broader use.   Cybersecurity is a foundational element underpinning the achievement  of socio-economic objectives of modern economies. The hope is that the  resulting National Cybersecurity Strategy Guide can serve as a useful tool to all  stakeholders, including national policy-makers, legislators and regulators, with  cybersecurity responsibilities. In addition, it might have broader applicability, as  the concepts introduced can be applied at the regional, or municipal levels, as  well as adapted for industry.  Preface    6Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy    1 Document overview    8Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  1  Document overview  1  Document Overview  The purpose of this document is to guide national leaders and policy-makers  in the development of a National Cybersecurity Strategy, and in thinking  strategically about cybersecurity, cyber-preparedness and resilience.   This Guide aims to provide a useful, flexible and user-friendly framework to   set the context of a country’s socio-economic vision and current security  posture and to assist policy-makers in the development of a Strategy that  takes into consideration a country’s specific situation, cultural and societal  values, and that encourages the pursuit of secure, resilient, ICT-enhanced and  connected societies.   The Guide is a unique resource, as it provides a framework that has been  agreed on by organisations with demonstrated and diverse experience in this  topic area and builds on their prior work in this space. As such, it offers the  most comprehensive overview to date of what constitutes successful national  cybersecurity strategies.  Cybersecurity is a complex challenge that encompasses multiple different  governance, policy, operational, technical and legal aspects. This Guide attempts  to address, organise and prioritise many of these areas based on existing and  well-recognised models, frameworks and other references.  The Guide focuses on protecting civilian aspects of cyberspace and as such,  it highlights the overarching principles and good practice that need to be  considered in the process of drafting, developing and managing a National  Cybersecurity Strategy.   To this end, the Guide makes a clear distinction between the “process” that  will be adopted by countries during the lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity  Strategy (initiation, stocktaking and analysis, production, implementation,  reviews) and the “content”, the actual text that would appear in a National  Cybersecurity Strategy document. The Guide does not cover aspects such as  the development of defensive or offensive cyber-capabilities by a country’s  military, defence forces, or intelligence agencies, even though a number of  countries have been developing such capabilities.  1.1   Purpose   1.2   Scope     9Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  1  Document overview  In order to provide direction and good practice on “what” should be included in  a National Cybersecurity Strategy, as well as on “how” to build, implement and  review it, this Guide addresses both elements.  The Guide also provides an overview of the core components of what it takes  for a country to become cyber-prepared, highlighting the critical aspects that  governments should consider when developing their national strategies and  implementation plans.   Finally, this Guide offers policy-makers a holistic, high-level overview of existing  approaches and applications, and a reference to additional and complementary  resources that can inform specific national cybersecurity efforts.  This Guide has primarily been structured as a resource to help government  stakeholders in preparing, drafting and managing their National Cybersecurity  Strategy. As such, the content is organised to follow the process and order of a  Strategy development:   • Section 2 – Introduction: provides an overview of the subject of the Guide  with related definitions  • Section 3 – Strategy development lifecycle: details the steps in the  development of a Strategy and its management during its full lifecycle;  • Section 4 – Overarching principles for a Strategy: outlines the cross-cutting,  fundamental considerations to be considered during the development of a  Strategy;  • Section 5 – Focus areas and good practices: identifies the key elements and  topics that should be considered during the development of a Strategy; and  • Section 6 – Supporting reference materials: provides further pointers to  relevant literature that stakeholders can review as part of their drafting effort.   In particular, Section 3 addresses the process and aspects related to the  development of a National Cybersecurity Strategy (such as preparation, drafting,  implementation and long-term sustainability), while Sections 4 and 5 are more  focused on the content of a National Cybersecurity Strategy, as they highlight  concepts and elements that the document should contain.  1.3   Overall structure and usage of the Guide    10Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  1  Document overview  This Guide is first and foremost targeted at policy-makers responsible for  developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy. The secondary audience are  all the other public and private stakeholders involved in the development and  implementation of a Strategy, such as responsible government staff, regulatory  authorities, law enforcement, ICT providers, critical infrastructure operators, civil  society, academia and research institutions. The Guide could also prove useful  to the different stakeholders in the international development community, who  provide assistance in cybersecurity.  1.4   Target audience    2 Introduction    12Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  2  Introduction  Over the last two decades, billions of people  around the world have benefited from the  exponential growth and rapid adoption   of information and communications  technologies, and the associated economic  and social opportunities.   Since its creation, the Internet has evolved from an information-exchange platform  to become the backbone of modern business, critical services and infrastructure,  social networks, and the global economy as a whole. As a result, national leaders  have started to launch digital strategies and to fund projects that increase  Internet connectivity and leverage the benefits stemming from the use of ICTs, to  stimulate economic growth, to increase productivity and efficiency, to improve  service delivery and capacity, to provide access to business and information, to  enable e-learning, to enhance workforce skills and to promote good governance.  Countries cannot ignore the opportunities associated with becoming connected  and participating in the Internet economy.   While the reliance of our societies on the digital infrastructure is growing,  technology remains inherently vulnerable. The confidentiality, integrity and  availability of ICT infrastructure are challenged by rapidly evolving cyber-threats,  including electronic fraud, theft of intellectual property and personal identifiable  information, disruption of service, and damage or destruction of property. The  transformational power of ICTs and the Internet as catalysts for economic growth  and social development are at a critical point where citizens’ and national trust  and confidence in the use of ICTs are being eroded by cyber-insecurity.   To fully realise the potential of technology, states must align their national  economic visions with their national security priorities. If the security risks  associated with the proliferation of ICT-enabled infrastructure and Internet  applications are not appropriately balanced with comprehensive national  cybersecurity strategies and resilience plans, countries will be unable to achieve  the economic growth and the national security goals they are seeking.  In response, nations are developing both offensive and defensive capabilities to  defend themselves from illicit and illegal activities in cyberspace and to pre- empt incidents before they can cause harm to their nations. This document  will look specifically at defensive responses, particularly in the form of national  cybersecurity strategies.   2  Introduction    13Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  2  Introduction  By developing and implementing a National Cybersecurity Strategy, a nation can  improve the security of its digital infrastructure and ultimately contribute to its  broader socio-economic aspirations. National leaders need to be strategic about  the opportunities offered and the risks posed to their countries by the digital  environment; they also need to establish a clear vision of the digital future they  wish to create.  Several national and international definitions of the term “cybersecurity” exist.  For the purpose of this document, the term “cybersecurity” is meant to describe  the collection of tools, policies, guidelines, risk management approaches,  actions, trainings, best practices, assurance and technologies that can be used  to protect the availability, integrity and confidentiality of assets in the connected  infrastructures pertaining to government, private organisations and citizens;  these assets include connected computing devices, personnel, infrastructure,  applications, services, telecommunications systems, and data in the   cyber-environment.2  National cybersecurity strategies can take many forms and can go into varying  levels of detail, depending on the particular country’s objectives and levels  of cyber-readiness. Therefore, there is no established and commonly agreed  definition of what constitutes a National Cybersecurity Strategy.  Relying on existing research in this area, this document encourages stakeholders  to think of a National Cybersecurity Strategy as:  • an expression of the vision, high-level objectives, principles and priorities that  guide a country in addressing cybersecurity;   • an overview of the stakeholders tasked with improving cybersecurity of the  nation and their respective roles and responsibilities; and  • a description of the steps, programmes and initiatives that a country will  undertake to protect its national cyber-infrastructure and, in the process,  increase its security and resilience.  2.1   What is cybersecurity   2 Definition adapted from https://www.bcmpedia.org/wiki/Cyber_Security  2.2   Benefits of a National Cybersecurity Strategy and    strategy development process    14Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  2  Introduction  Setting out the vision, objectives and priorities enables governments to look at  cybersecurity holistically across their national digital ecosystem, instead of at a  particular sector, objective, or in response to a specific risk – it allows them to be  strategic. Priorities for national cybersecurity strategies vary by country, so while  the focus for one country may be addressing critical infrastructure-related risks,  for others it may be protecting intellectual property, promoting trust in the online  environment, or improving cybersecurity awareness of the general public; or a  combination of these issues.   The need to identify and subsequently prioritise investments and resources is critical  to successfully managing risks in an area as all-encompassing as cybersecurity.   A National Cybersecurity Strategy also provides the opportunity to align  cybersecurity priorities with other ICT-related objectives. Cybersecurity is central  to achieving socio-economic objectives of modern economies and the Strategy  should reflect how those are supported. This can be done by referencing existing  policies that seek to implement a country’s digital or developmental agendas or  by assessing how cybersecurity can be incorporated into them.   Finally, a National Cybersecurity Strategy development process should translate  a government’s vision into coherent and implementable policies that will help it  achieve its objectives. This includes not only the steps, programmes and initiatives  that should be put in place, but also the resources allocated for those efforts and  how these resources should be used. Similarly, the process should identify the  metrics that will be used to help ensure that desired outcomes are achieved within  set budgets and timelines.    3 Lifecycle of  a National  Cybersecurity  Strategy     16Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  3  Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy  This Section provides an overview of the  various phases in the development of a  Strategy, which include: • Phase I – Initiation  • Phase II – Stocktaking and analysis  • Phase III – Production  • Phase IV – Implementation  • Phase V – Monitoring and evaluation  This Section also introduces the key entities that should be involved in the  development of the Strategy and highlights other relevant stakeholders that could  contribute to the process.   This Section ultimately aims to provide the reader with an understanding of the  steps to be taken by a nation in order to draft a National Strategy and the possible  mechanisms for its implementation according to the nation’s specific needs and  requirements, integrating the overarching principles (described in Section 4) and  good practice (described in Section 5).  This lifecycle, as illustrated in Figure 1, guides users of this document in focusing  on strategic thinking about cybersecurity at the national level.  3  Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy    17Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  3  Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy  Figure 1 - Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy   Decision to  issue new  Strategy  PHASE 5:  MONITORING & EVALUATION  -  Establishing a formal process -  Monitoring the progress of the   implementation of the Strategy -  Evaluating the outcome of    the Strategy  PHASE 2:  STOCKTAKING AND ANALYSIS  -  Assessing the national  cybersecurity landscape  -  Assessing the cyber-risk landscape  PHASE 4:  IMPLEMENTATION  -  Developing the Action Plan - Determining initiatives to    be implemented -  Allocating human and financial   resources for the implementation -  Setting timeframes and metrics  PHASE 3:  PRODUCTION OF THE   NATIONAL STRATEGY  -  Drafting the National   Cybersecurity Strategy  -  Consulting with a broad range   of stakeholders  -  Seeking formal approval -  Publishing the Strategy  Action Plan  National  Cybersecurity   Strategy  Report and  Consolidated  Repository  Adjustments  to Action Plan  PHASE 1:  INITIATION  -  Identifying the Lead Project Authority -  Establishing a Steering Committee -  Identifying stakeholders to be   involved in the development of   the Strategy  -  Planning the development of   the Strategy  Strategy  Development   Plan    18Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  3  Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy    In accordance with Sections 4 and 5 of this document, the initiation phase of  a National Cybersecurity Strategy provides the foundations for its efficient  development. This phase is expected to focus on processes, timelines, and  identification of key stakeholders who should be involved in the production  of the Strategy. The outcome of this phase is the elaboration of a plan for the  development of the Strategy. When foreseen by the country’s governance process,  the plan may require the approval of the country’s Executive.3    3.1.1  Identifying the Lead Project Authority    In line with the principle of defining clear leadership, roles and resource allocation  (Section 4.8), the Strategy development process should be coordinated by a  single, competent authority. The Executive should appoint an either pre-existing  or newly created public entity, such as a ministry, agency, or a department, to  lead the development of the Strategy. This entity, referred to in this document as  the Lead Project Authority, should in turn, appoint an individual responsible and  accountable for leading the Strategy development process.     The Lead Project Authority should be neutral throughout the development  process. To this end, it is recommended that this entity be different from the  one(s) that will be responsible for the implementation of the Strategy. This or  other mechanisms should be adopted to overcome any inherent bias and help  avoid intra-governmental competition for resources.    3.1.2 Establishing a Steering Committee    The Executive should also establish a Steering Committee to work with the  Lead Project Authority in developing the Strategy. It should be empowered to  provide guidance, as well as play a role in quality assurance. In addition, it should  guarantee the transparency and inclusiveness of the process, in accordance with  the principle on clear leadership, roles and resource allocation (Section 4.8). The  Steering Committee’s role, set-up and membership should be clearly defined from  the outset.     As the Steering Committee may need to review sensitive documents, it should  be constituted accordingly. It is also important that its membership reflects the  various responsibilities given to this body, for instance through seniority   of appointments.      3.1   Phase I: Initiation  3 The individual or entity in charge of the decision-making process at the national level.    19Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  3  Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy   3.1.3 Identifying stakeholders to be involved in the development of the Strategy     In this step, the Lead Project Authority should identify an initial set of stakeholders  to be involved in the development of the Strategy. It should also clarify the roles  of the different stakeholders and outline how they will collaborate in order to  manage expectations throughout the process.     Throughout the process, the Lead Project Authority may need to reach out to  additional stakeholders to ensure all pertinent knowledge and expertise is utilised.  This would embrace the principle of inclusiveness (Section 4.3), which highlights  the importance of cooperation with a range of stakeholders across government,  the private sector and civil society. For example, the Lead Project Authority could  consider including ICT companies, critical-infrastructure operators, academic  experts, and non-governmental organisations working on raising cybersecurity  awareness and preparedness, amongst others.    Such cooperation mechanism could take the form of an Advisory Committee, that  would contribute in providing members to the Steering Committee, as well as be  consulted on the various phases.   3.1.4 Planning the development of the Strategy    In the final step of the Initiation phase, the Lead Project Authority should prepare  a plan for developing the National Cybersecurity Strategy. Once the plan has been  drafted, it should be submitted, as applicable, to the Steering Committee and the  Executive, for approval, in accordance with the national governance processes.     In drafting the plan, the Lead Project Authority should also consider whether  the National Cybersecurity Strategy will take the form of legislation or policy,  as different options might influence the formal processes that would need to be  followed, as well as the timeframe for adoption.     The Strategy development plan should identify the major steps and activities,  key stakeholders, timelines and resource requirements. It should specify how and  when relevant stakeholders will be expected to participate in the development  process to contribute input and feedback.     It should also identify the human and financial resources needed, and where  these could be procured. For example, required expertise could be solicited from  intergovernmental organisations, the private sector, academia, or development  agencies. Similarly, funding requirements might be addressed through reallocation  of dedicated funding streams in existing budgets, or through new funding  available from third parties (e.g., international organisations).    Particular attention should be placed on securing long-term funding for the  full lifecycle of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, including its development,  implementation and refinement. For further details on the allocation of resources     20Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  3  Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy  for the implementation, please see “Allocating human and financial resources for  the implementation” (Section 3.4.3) and for further details on long-term funding,  please see “Allocate dedicated budget and resources” (Section 5.1.5).    Figure 2 shows possible interactions and distribution of roles between different  stakeholders and committees.     Further references available on page 55.   Figure 2 - Stakeholders  Steering  Committee  Lead Project  Authority  Consults on  Advises  Appoints Appoints  Contributes  Members  Plan  Risk Profile  Stocktaking  Consolidation  Government’s  Executive  Advisory  Committee    21Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  3  Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy    The purpose of this phase is to collect data to assess the national cybersecurity  landscape and the current and future cyber-risk landscape to inform the   drafting and development of the National Cybersecurity Strategy. The output   of this exercise should be a report that provides an overview of the strategic  national cybersecurity posture and risk landscapes to be submitted to the  Steering Committee.     Before beginning the actual production of the text of the Strategy, the Lead  Project Authority should carefully analyse and assess the information gathered  during the stocktaking phase to ensure that any gaps in cybersecurity capacity  are identified and options for addressing them presented. The analysis should  result in an assessment of how far the existing policy, regulatory and operational  environments meet the stated objectives of the Strategy and highlight where they  fall short.     Similarly, it should be used to identify specific key issues, such as educational and  training gaps.     Lastly, the analysis should result in an assessment of all relevant and desirable  outcomes for the Strategy, as well as the potential effects and outcomes of   means chosen.    Further references available on page 55.   3.2.1 Assessing the national cybersecurity landscape     For the National Cybersecurity Strategy to be effective, it needs to reflect the  cybersecurity posture of the country. To this end, an analysis of the country’s  existing cybersecurity strengths and weaknesses should be conducted, and  relevant materials and documents should be consulted in collaboration with  relevant stakeholders across government, private sector and civil society. This step  should embrace the principle of comprehensive approach and tailored priorities  (described in Section 4.2).    As part of this effort, the Lead Project Authority should identify assets and  services critical to the proper functioning of the society and economy, and map  existing national laws, regulations, policies, programmes and capacity as they  relate to cybersecurity. The Lead Project Authority should also identify existing  soft regulatory mechanisms, such as private-public partnerships, and take stock of  capabilities that have been developed to address cybersecurity challenges, such  as national Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs). Moreover, the roles  and responsibilities of existing public agencies with a cybersecurity mandate, such  as regulators or data-protection agencies, should be identified and mapped.   3.2   Phase II: Stocktaking and Analysis    22Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  3  Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy    Additionally, related data that can inform the country’s cybersecurity posture  should be collected. This could include: information on existing national  cybersecurity programmes, international initiatives, private sector projects, ICT  and cyber-education and skill-development programmes, cyber-R&D initiatives;  data on Internet penetration and infection rates, ICT uptake, technology  developments; and insights on future ICT and cybersecurity trends and threats.     Relevant information provided by the private sector, research institutions  and other stakeholder groups should be included in this analysis as well. For  developing countries, it is also crucial to map out the collaborative initiatives with  development partners to coordinate technical assistance and investments.     Finally, the Lead Project Authority should also investigate similar information   at the regional and international levels, and examine sector-specific strategies   and initiatives.   3.2.2 Assessing the cyber-risk landscape    Building on the information collected in the previous step, the Lead Project  Authority should assess the risks the nation faces due to digital dependence.   This can be achieved through the identification of national digital assets, both  public and private, their interdependencies, vulnerabilities and threats, and an  estimation of the likelihood and potential impact of a cyber-incident.    This effort embraces the principle of risk management and resilience   (Section 4.6), which recognises that risk management is critical to fully realising  the benefits of the digital environment for socio-economic development.  Furthermore, this initial risk assessment can form the basis for future, more  specific risk assessments (further information on the Principle of Risk Management  and Resilience and how to conduct risk assessments can be found in Section 5.2).    The purpose of this phase is to develop the text of the Strategy by engaging key  stakeholders from the public sector, private sector and civil society through a series  of public consultations and working groups. This broader group of stakeholders,  coordinated by the Lead Project Authority, will be responsible for defining the  overall vision and scope of the Strategy, setting high-level objectives, taking stock  of the current situation (detailed in Phase II), prioritising objectives in terms of  impact on society, citizens and the economy, and ensuring the necessary financial  resources. As part of this phase, all the cross-cutting principles (Section 4) should  be considered and good-practice elements (Section 5) detailed in this Guide  should be considered.   3.3   Phase III: Production of the National    Cybersecurity Strategy     23Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  3  Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy   3.3.1 Drafting the National Cybersecurity Strategy    Once the stocktaking and analysis phase is complete, the Lead Project Authority,  in collaboration with the Steering Committee, should initiate the drafting of the  Strategy. Dedicated working groups could be created either to focus on specific  topics, or to draft different sections of the Strategy. The working groups should  follow the processes established in the Initiation Phase, adjusting these as necessary.     The Strategy should provide the overall cybersecurity direction for the country;  express a clear vision and scope; set objectives to be accomplished within  a specific time frame; and prioritise these in terms of impact on society, the  economy and infrastructure. Moreover, it should identify possible courses of  actions; incentivise implementation efforts; and drive the allocation of required  resources to support all these activities. The Strategy may also include some of  the findings developed in the Stocktaking and Analysis Phase.    Similarly to the step dealing with planning the development of the Strategy, the  actual document needs to put forward a clear governance framework (Section  5.1) that defines the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders. This includes  the identification of the entity responsible for the management and evaluation  of the Strategy, as well as an entity responsible for its overall management and  implementation, such as a central authority or a national cybersecurity council.     The Strategy also needs to define or confirm the mandate of the different entities  responsible for initiating and developing cybersecurity policies and regulations  within the country. In addition, it should define the responsibilities and tasks  of the entities responsible for collecting threat and vulnerability information,  responding to cyber-incidents (e.g., national CERTs), strengthening preparedness  and performing crisis management. It should also ensure that it is clear how all of  these entities interact with each other and with the central authority.   3.3.2 Consulting with a broad range of stakeholders      As mentioned above, engaging stakeholders is crucial for the success of a Strategy.  In order to ensure that the final Strategy is based on a shared vision, the draft  document should be disseminated across a wide stakeholder group not limited  to those who participated in the Strategy development process. This can happen  through a variety of engagements, including online consultation, validation  workshops, and additional working groups. It is expected that feedback and  comments resulting from this process will be used to finalise the Strategy.   3.3.3 Seeking formal approval    In the final step of the Strategy development, the Lead Project Authority should  ensure that the Strategy is formally adopted by the Executive. This official  adoption process will vary by country and be based on how the Strategy is  defined in the legislative framework. For example, it could be adopted through a  parliamentary procedure or a government decree.     24Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  3  Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy    Furthermore, it is pivotal that the Strategy is not only developed with approval  from the highest levels of government, but that this commitment continues in its  implementation phase. The relevant officials should be held accountable and be  supported by both political capital and resources.    3.3.4 Publishing the Strategy    The Strategy should be a public document and should be made readily available.  Its broad availability will both ensure that the general public is aware of the  government’s cybersecurity priorities and objectives, and also support any effort  to raise cybersecurity awareness. Should the Strategy be accompanied by an  Action Plan, the latter should also indicate additional opportunities for further  engagement and cooperation with civil society and the private sector.     Further references available on page 55.    The Implementation phase is the most important element of the overall National  Cybersecurity Strategy lifecycle. A structured approach to implementation,  supported by adequate human and financial resources, is critical to the success  of the Strategy and needs to be considered as part of its development. The  implementation phase is frequently centred on an Action Plan, which guides the  various activities envisioned.    3.4.1 Developing the action plan    As with the development of the Strategy, its implementation cannot be the  sole responsibility of a single authority. Instead, it requires engagement and  coordination of a range of different stakeholders across the government, as well  as support from civil society and the private sector. The Action Plan, developed  in accordance with the principle of clear leadership, roles and resource allocation  (Section 4.8), can support the effective implementation of the Strategy.    The development of the Action Plan is almost as important as the Plan itself. The  process, orchestrated by the Lead Project Authority, should serve as a mechanism  to bring the relevant stakeholders together to agree on objectives and outcomes,  as well as coordinate efforts and pool resources.    3.4.2 Determining initiatives to be implemented      The National Cybersecurity Strategy highlights the government’s objectives and  the outcomes they wish to realise across the different focus areas identified. In  the Action Plan, the Lead Project Authority should – in coordination with relevant  stakeholders – identify the specific initiatives within each focus area that will help  meet those objectives. Examples could include organising cybersecurity exercises,   3.4   Phase IV: Implementation    25Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  3  Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy  establishing security baselines for critical infrastructures, or setting an incident  reporting framework, amongst others.     The timeline and effort needed for the implementation of these initiatives should  be prioritised in accordance with their criticality to ensure that limited resources  are appropriately leveraged. To this end, results and outcomes of Phase II  (Stocktaking and analysis) specifically with regards to “Assessing the cyber-risk  landscape” (Section 3.2.2) might be considered.   3.4.3 Allocating human and financial resources for the implementation      Once the priority initiatives have been identified, the Lead Project Authority  should identify specific government entities as owners for each of those initiatives.  In turn, these government entities would be responsible and accountable for the  implementation of each specific initiative assigned to them and be expected  to coordinate their efforts with other relevant stakeholders as part of the  implementation process.     To ensure these entities can deliver the expected outcomes, the Lead Project  Authority should assess whether they have been given an appropriate mandate –  legal or otherwise – required for the implementation. The Lead Project Authority  should also work with the owners of the specific initiatives to understand  what resources are required to accomplish the work. This assessment should  incorporate human resources, expertise and funding needs. The Lead Project  Authority should then work with the owners to help them identify and secure   the required resources in accordance with administrative financial structures of  the country.    3.4.4 Setting timeframes and metrics    The final critical element of the Action Plan is the development of specific metrics  and key performance indicators to assess each of the initiatives undertaken, such  as whether the country conducted an awareness campaign on the importance of  information sharing, organised and executed a cybersecurity exercise with critical  infrastructure sector, or passed a security baseline law. Specific timelines for  implementation should also be set.     The metrics and key performance indicators should be developed by the Lead  Project Authority in partnership with the respective owners. The latter should be  encouraged to define and maintain a more detailed set of metrics to facilitate  evaluations of the efficiency and effectiveness of the initiatives during and  following their completion.    Further references available on page 55.    26Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  3  Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy    During this phase, a competent authority should devise a formal process to  monitor and evaluate the Strategy. In the monitoring phase, the government  should ensure that the Strategy is implemented in accordance with its Action  Plan. In the evaluation phase, the government and its competent authority  should assess whether the Strategy is still relevant in light of the changing risk  environment and whether it still reflects the government’s objectives and what  adjustments are necessary.     3.5.1 Establishing a formal process      To ensure effective monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the  Strategy, the government will have to identify an independent entity responsible  for monitoring and evaluating the implementation progress and efficiency. The  entity should ideally be involved in defining appropriate monitoring and evaluation  metrics for the implementation of the Strategy and associated Action Plan and  initiatives, which should take place during the Production and Initiation phases.     Monitoring and measuring the performance and successful execution of  the implementation plan for the Strategy should be part of the governance  mechanisms that a country puts in place. Continuous assessment of the  implementation plan (i.e. what is going well and what is not) helps inform  the Strategy. Good governance mechanisms with regards to the Strategy  implementation should also clearly delineate the accountability and responsibility  for ensuring successful execution. Establishing metrics or key performance  indicators (KPI) by near-term, mid-term and long-term objectives helps reinforce  the governance and management mechanisms. Key performance indicators or  metrics should be:    · Specific – target a specific area for improvement.    · Measurable – quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.    · Achievable – state what results can realistically be achieved, given    available resources.    · Responsible – specify who will do it    · Time-related – specify when the result(s) can be achieved.    The establishment of baseline metrics will enable better monitoring of actions and  highlight areas of potential improvement. Furthermore, the allocation of budgets  should match the levels of ambition and complexity of the desired impact.    3.5   Phase V: Monitoring and evaluation    27Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  3  Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy   3.5.2 Monitoring the progress of the implementation of the Strategy     The entity responsible for monitoring the progress of implementation of the  Strategy should do so in accordance with an agreed upon timeline over the  course of the entire lifecycle of the Strategy. The outcome of such monitoring  activity (e.g., a report), should note any deviations from the agreed upon  timelines and the reasons for any delays, such as priorities shifting, insufficient  staffing or resources, etc. This should be done in addition to periodic updates by  the owners of the different strands of the implementation of the Strategy to the  Lead Project Authority.    This approach will ensure that the relevant stakeholders are held accountable to  the commitments set; it will also ensure that any challenges to implementation  are identified early on. In turn, this would allow the government to either rectify  the situation or adapt its plans accordingly based on the lessons learnt in the  implementation process.    3.5.3 Evaluating the outcomes of the Strategy     In addition to assessing the progress across the agreed upon metrics, it is  important to also periodically evaluate the outcomes and compare them with  the objectives set. This is critical for understanding whether the objectives of the  Strategy are being realised or whether different actions should be considered.  As part of this process, the broader risk environment also needs to be regularly  re-evaluated to understand whether any external changes are affecting the  outcomes of the Strategy. Effectively, this process acts as a light-touch revision of  a country’s risk assessment profile.     The assessment, together with associated recommendations, should be compiled  into a report for the Lead Project Authority, and include ways to update the Action  Plan and ensure that it is current and responsive to the changing policy and the  risk landscape.     Ultimately, the reports produced over the lifecycle of the Strategy should also  form the basis for the overall review of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in  accordance with the timeline set during the initiation phase. This overarching  review should not only consider the progress made and the changes in the external  environment, but also re-assess the government’s own priorities and objectives.     Further references available on page 55.    28Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  3  Lifecycle of a National Cybersecurity Strategy    4 Overarching  principles    30Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  4  Overarching principles    This Section presents nine cross-cutting  principles, which taken together can help in the  development of a forward-looking and holistic  National Cybersecurity Strategy.       These principles are applicable to all key focus areas identified in this document.  They should be considered in all steps of a National Strategy development process,  from the drafting of the National Strategy document to its implementation.     The order of these principles reflects a logical narrative rather than an order   of importance.    The Strategy should set a clear whole-of-government and    whole-of-society vision.      A Strategy is more likely to be successful when it sets a vision that helps all  stakeholders understand what is at stake and why the Strategy is needed  (context), what it is to be accomplished (objectives), as well as what it is about  and who it impacts (scope).     The clearer the vision, the easier it will be for leaders and key stakeholders to  ensure a more comprehensive, consistent and coherent approach. A clear vision  also facilitates coordination, co-operation and implementation of the Strategy  amongst the relevant stakeholders. It should be formulated at a sufficiently high  level and consider the dynamic nature of the digital environment.    The objectives and implementation timeline of the Strategy should be aligned   with this vision.    Further references available on page 56.    The Strategy should result from an all-encompassing understanding and analysis   of the overall digital environment, yet be tailored to the country’s circumstances   and prioritised.    Cybersecurity is not only a technical challenge but a complex multi-faceted issue,  with aspects extending beyond economic and social prosperity into areas such as   4  Overarching Principles  4.1   Vision  4.2   Comprehensive approach and tailored priorities    31Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  4  Overarching principles  law enforcement, national and international security, international relations, trade  negotiations, sustainable development, etc.    It is important to understand all the aspects of cybersecurity and how they  interrelate, potentially complementing or competing with each other. Based on  this understanding and an analysis of the country’s specific context, priorities can  then be defined in line with the objectives and implementation timeline of the  Strategy. Priorities will allow for setting up specific objectives and timelines and to  allocate the necessary resources.     The priorities included in a National Cybersecurity Strategy will vary by country.  Some of the cybersecurity topics can be addressed in the same or in separate  strategic documents (e.g., digital aspects of national security and defence can be  addressed within a national security or defence strategy).     Further references available on page 56.     The Strategy should be developed with the active participation of all the   relevant stakeholders, and it should address their needs and responsibilities.    The digital environment has become critical to government, businesses  and individuals. These groups face cybersecurity risks and share a level of  responsibility in managing them, depending on their role. While it may be a  difficult task, identifying and engaging all the relevant stakeholders is essential  to the development and successful implementation of a National Cybersecurity  Strategy. This will help understand stakeholder needs and their unique knowledge  and expertise, thus facilitating cooperation towards achieving the objectives of   the Strategy.     To foster inclusiveness, the Strategy should be a public document.    Further references available on pages 56 and 57.    The Strategy should foster economic and social prosperity and maximise the   contribution of ICT to sustainable development and social inclusiveness.    The digital environment has the potential to expedite economic growth and social  progress, to advance key societal values, to improve public-service delivery and  capacity, to facilitate international trade, and to promote good governance.    4.4   Economic and Social Prosperity  4.3   Inclusiveness    32Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  4  Overarching principles  The increasing reliance on the digital environment for the functioning of societies’  demands increased attention on cybersecurity. However, cybersecurity is not a goal  in itself; the Strategy should be aligned with the country’s broader socio-economic  objectives and lead to building the trust and confidence necessary to both help  realise these objectives as well as protect the country from cyber-threats.    Further references available on page 57.     The Strategy should respect and be consistent with fundamental values.    The Strategy should recognise the fact that rights that people have offline must  also be protected online. It should respect universally agreed fundamental rights,  including, but not limited to, the ones found in the United Nations’ Universal  Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political  Rights, as well as relevant multilateral or regional legal frameworks.     Attention should be paid to freedom of expression, privacy of communications  and personal-data protection. In particular, the Strategy should avoid facilitating  the practice of arbitrary, unjustified or otherwise unlawful surveillance, interception  of communications, or processing of personal data.     In balancing the needs of the State with those of the individuals, the Strategy  should ensure that, where applicable, surveillance, interception of communications  and collection of data are conducted within the context of a specific investigation  or legal case, authorised by the relevant national authority and on the basis of a  public, precise, comprehensive and non-discriminatory legal framework enabling  effective oversight, procedural safeguards and remedies.    Further references available on pages 57 and 58.    The Strategy should enable an efficient management of cybersecurity risks and   drive the resilience of the economic and social activities.     While the digital environment provides stakeholders with economic and social  opportunities, it also exposes them to cybersecurity risk. For example, when  organisations use ICT to foster innovation, gain productivity and improve  competitiveness, or when governments deploy their services online, cybersecurity  incidents can occur, potentially resulting in financial loss, reputational damage,   4.5   Fundamental human rights  4.6   Risk management and resilience    33Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  4  Overarching principles  disruption of operations, undermining of innovation, etc. As with other types of  risk, cybersecurity risk cannot be entirely eliminated but they can be managed  and minimised.    To address that challenge, the Strategy should encourage entities to prioritise  their cybersecurity investments and to proactively manage risk. Depending on an  entity’s risk appetite, a balance has to be maintained between security measures  and potential benefits, considering the dynamic nature of the digital environment.  The Strategy should also recognise the need for continuous risk management and  facilitate a coherent approach across interdependent entities.     The focus on risk management will also prepare stakeholders for potential security  incidents, ensuring the resilience of economic and societal activity in the country.  With that in mind, the Strategy should encourage the adoption of business- continuity measures, which include incident and crisis management, as well as  recovery plans.      Further references available on page 58.    The Strategy should utilise the most appropriate policy instruments available to   realise each of its objectives, considering the country’s specific circumstances.     The government’s cybersecurity goals will only be achieved if a change in  behaviour occurs across all stakeholders involved. In most cases, governments  have different levers and policy instruments at their disposal to achieve that  outcome. These include legislation, regulation, standardisation, incentive and  information-sharing programmes and mechanisms, education programmes,  sharing best-practice, setting expected norms of behaviour, and building  communities of trust among others. Each of these has its own strengths and  weaknesses, comes at differing cost, and brings different results.     The best results can be achieved by selecting the most appropriate policy  instrument for each individual objective and balancing the use of different tools.    Further references available on page 59.  4.7   Appropriate set of policy instruments    34Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  4  Overarching principles    The Strategy should be set at the highest level of the government, which   will then be responsible for assigning relevant roles and responsibilities and   allocating sufficient human and financial resources.     Cybersecurity should be promoted and sustained at the highest levels of  government. Moreover, to ensure accountability and progress, focal points of  individual work streams need to be identified, and all parties involved should have  a clear understanding of their respective roles and responsibilities.     The Strategy should also allocate the human, financial and material resources  necessary for its implementation. This principle needs to guide both the Strategy  development process and the elaboration of the action plan for the Strategy.    Further references available on page 59.    The Strategy should help build a digital environment that citizens and    businesses can trust.      Building trust in the national digital ecosystem, in which users’ rights and interests  are protected and security of data and systems is assured, is essential to realise  the full potential of the social, political and economic opportunities offered by  the use of ICTs. The Strategy must enable policies, processes and actions at the  national level in order to render secure critical services (including e-governance,  e-commerce and digital financial transactions, among others) supported by ICTs  and utilised by the citizens. Such course of actions would inculcate the principle  of trust not only among the general population but also within those public and  private organisations that will offer their ICT-related services to citizens.

Therefore, this Section introduces a set of good-practice elements that can make  the Strategy comprehensive and effective, while allowing for tailoring to the  national context.     These good-practice elements are grouped into distinct focus areas – effectively  overarching themes for a National Cybersecurity Strategy. While both the focus  areas and the elements have been put forward here as examples of good practice,  it is particularly important that the latter are viewed in the national context, as  some may not be relevant to a country’s specific situation. Countries should  identify and follow the good-practice elements that support their own objectives  and priorities in line with the vision defined in their Strategy (Section 4). The order  of the individual elements or focus areas below should not be seen as indicating a  level of importance or priority.    This focus area introduces good-practice elements to be considered for inclusion  in the text of the Strategy when addressing the governance structure for national  cybersecurity. The Strategy should clearly state the objectives and ambitions  the government has in mind for cybersecurity, as well as outline the roles and  accountabilities required to ensure its implementation.     To that end, the Strategy should identify and empower the competent authority  accountable for the execution of the Strategy; establish a mechanism to  identify and include the government entities affected by, or responsible for,  the implementation of the Strategy; commit to include specific, measurable,  attainable, result-based and time-based objectives in the implementation plan  for the Strategy; and recognise the need to commit resources (e.g., political will,  funding, time and people) to achieve the desired outcomes.   5.1.1 Ensure the highest level of support    The Strategy should have the formal endorsement of the highest level of  government. This endorsement serves two important purposes. Firstly, it improves  the likelihood that sufficient resources will be allocated and that coordination  efforts will be successful. Secondly, it signals to the broader national ecosystem  how significant the country finds cybersecurity.  5  National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice  5.1   Focus area 1 - Governance    37Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  5  National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice   5.1.2 Establish a competent cybersecurity authority      The Strategy should identify a dedicated national-competent cybersecurity  authority – a leader (whether an individual or an entity) who is elevated and  strongly anchored at the highest level of government to provide direction, to  coordinate action, and to monitor the implementation of the Strategy.     Such a national competent cybersecurity authority should also act as  management entity to define and clarify roles, responsibilities, processes, decision  rights, and the tasks required to ensure effective implementation of the Strategy.  This includes identifying the stakeholders who will oversee the implementation  of the Strategy and establishing performance targets for various ministerial or  governmental departments, institutions, or individuals responsible for specific  aspects of the Strategy and subsequent action plan. This approach may require  additional policy or legal structures to empower them to perform their missions.     Given the fact that cybersecurity intersects many different issue areas, it is  important to ensure that the national-competent authority has the ability to  involve and direct relevant stakeholders.    5.1.3 Ensure intra-government cooperation      The Strategy should establish a mechanism to identify and include the  government entities affected by or responsible for its implementation. Intra- governmental commitment, coordination and cooperation are core functions  of those governmental institutions, needed to ensure that the governance  mechanisms (i.e. rules) and resources yield the desired outcomes of the Strategy.     Effective communication and coordination ensure that all ministries and  government agencies are aware of each other’s respective authorities, missions  and tasks. Commitment, however, is about supporting consistent policies over  time to ensure that promises in the Strategy are delivered. An example of a  coordination mechanism would be conducting periodic meetings that involve  all relevant stakeholders in the plans of actions that are to be jointly reviewed.  An example of a cooperation mechanism would be the creation of an intra- government task force to address a particular issue. An example of commitment  is consistency between the country’s domestic and foreign policy agendas, so  that one ministry does not undermine the credibility of another by representing  different positions on the same policy issue area.    5.1.4 Ensure inter-sectoral cooperation      The Strategy should reflect an understanding of the dependencies that  the government has on the private sector and other national stakeholders  (and vice-versa) in ensuring cybersecurity. To this end, it should articulate  how the government will engage these stakeholders and define their roles  and responsibilities. For example, the Strategy should identify a network of  authoritative national contact points for critical industries that are essential for the  operation and recovery of critical services and infrastructures.    38Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  5  National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice   5.1.5 Allocate dedicated budget and resources    The Strategy should specify the allocation of dedicated and appropriate resources for  its implementation, maintenance and revision. Sufficient, consistent and continuous  funding provides the foundations for an effective national cybersecurity posture.  Resources should be defined in terms of money (i.e. dedicated budget), people,  material, as well as the relationships and partnerships and continued political  commitment and leadership required for successful execution. Resourcing the  objectives and tasks within the Strategy should not be viewed as a one-time initiative.  Resources can be allocated by task or objective, or by a governmental entity.     The government may also consider the establishment of a central budget for  cybersecurity, managed by a central cybersecurity governance mechanism.  Whether assembling disparate funding sources into a coherent, integrated  programme or creating a unified intra-governmental budget, the overall  programme should be managed and tracked by milestones to ensure successful  implementation of the Strategy.    5.1.6 Develop an implementation plan    The Strategy should be accompanied by, or reference, an implementation plan  that outlines in greater detail how its strategic objectives will be achieved.  Effective implementation plans identify the accountable entity responsible for  each task and objective, the resources required to execute them over time (near- term, mid-term, long-term), the processes that will be used, and the outcomes  that are expected (Section 3.4 on Initiating Implementation).     Further references available on pages 60 and 61.    This focus area introduces good practices for addressing cybersecurity through  risk management. As stipulated in the Principle of Risk Management and  Resilience (Section 4.2), a risk-management approach should be adopted, as  cyber-risks cannot be fully eliminated. Rather, ensuring that a country has a good  understanding of the risks that it is exposed to allows it to manage these most  effectively. In terms of assessing risk, the approach should focus on identifying  inter-dependencies and also consider risks arising from dependencies across  the national border. The risk-management approach should consider the whole  lifecycle, from development or procurement to operation and replacement.    It is also important to note that, as cybersecurity threats are extremely dynamic  and unpredictable, any risk-management approach should be reviewed regularly.  As such, the Strategy should plan for monitoring and evaluation of risk- management activities to ensure continuous improvement.   5.2   Focus area 2 - Risk management in national      cybersecurity    39Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  5  National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice   5.2.1 Define a risk-management approach    The Strategy should define a coherent approach for risk management to be  followed by all government entities and critical-infrastructure operators identified  domestically. The approach should result in the identification of key assets and  services critical to the proper functioning of the society and economy, threats, and  the risks associated with them.     The approach should aim to develop a national risk register, securely stored  and communicated, to allow government oversight of risks and approaches  taken to manage these. The approach should moreover develop a method of  prioritisation based on a calculation of the probability of realising the risks and  their impact. It should furthermore specify the responsibilities of key entities in  each sector regarding the assessment, acceptance and treatment of national-level  cybersecurity risks.   5.2.2 Identify a common methodology for managing cybersecurity risk    The Strategy should identify a common methodology for managing cybersecurity  risks. This will ensure efficiency and consistency across all organisations and  facilitate the exchange of risk information across inter-dependent systems. A  methodology based on international standards should be favoured as it may  reduce costs and yield better interaction with the private sector.     The methodology should provide guidance on assigning roles and responsibilities  for various aspects of managing risk, such as assessing the threats, valuing assets,  implementing and maintaining mitigating measures, and accepting the residual  risk. The methodology should include a certification programme to help assess  and eventually improve compliance.     Importantly, for the procurement and development of infrastructure or services,  the risk-management methodology should furthermore provide guidance on  minimising risk through secure architecture and design, recognising that security  is best achieved where it is an integral part of the design process of a product,  process or service (security by design).    5.2.3 Develop sectoral cybersecurity risk profiles    The Strategy should call for the use of sectoral risk profiles for cybersecurity. A  sectoral risk profile is a quantitative analysis of the types of threats faced. The goal  of a risk profile is to provide a less-subjective understanding of risk by assigning  numerical values to variables representing different types of threats and the  danger they pose. The Strategy should recommend risk profiles to be developed  for those sectors that the country considers critical to its society and economy.     The use of sectoral risk profiles provides a basis for more specific risk assessments  for individual organisations, introduces coherence within and across all sectors  nationally, and reduces the resources needed for organisational risk assessments.  They should be regularly updated to ensure that they remain current.     40Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  5  National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice   5.2.4 Establishing cybersecurity policies    The Strategy should encourage the establishment of cybersecurity policies for  critical national entities, such as government authorities and critical infrastructures  operators, among others. Such policies, adopted in accordance with the  Principle of an Appropriate Set of Policy Instruments (Section 4.7), would cover  governance, operational and technical requirements, and instruct stakeholders on  their roles and responsibilities, as well as guide or mandate specific approaches   to these issues.     For example, this could include policies that address cybersecurity in procurement  or development, define information-sharing programmes, coordinate vulnerability  disclosure, set minimum standards of care, specify security baselines, define  certification programmes for compliance, and mandate the reporting of   cyber-incidents.     A coordinated approach at the national level would lead to more efficient and  effective cybersecurity management, as it would harmonise practices and  facilitate coordination and interoperability.    Further references available on page 61.    This focus area provides an overview of good practices that support the  establishment and sustainability of effective national capabilities to prevent,  detect, mitigate and respond to major cybersecurity incidents, and to improve a  country’s overall cyber-resilience.   5.3.1 Establish cyber-incident response capabilities    The Strategy should call for the establishment of appropriate national incident- response capabilities to address operational cybersecurity challenges. Often, this  capability refers to the establishment of Computer Emergency Response Teams  (CERTs), Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) or Computer  Incident Response Teams (CIRTs) with national responsibility.     Although the specific organisational form of a CERT/CSIRT/CIRT may vary (e.g.,  national, government, sectoral, etc.), and not every country may have the same  needs and resources, these specialised and dedicated teams should provide a set  of both proactive and reactive functions, as well as preventive and educational  services. Thus, these entities can increase a country’s ability to respond quickly  and recover from cyberattacks, as well as improve its resilience against cyber- threats, reducing the possible overall economic and operational impact of  nationally significant cyberattacks.  5.3   Focus area 3 - Preparedness and resilience    41Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  5  National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice    The Strategy should also identify and develop cooperation mechanisms and  communication procedures between national and sectorial incident-response  teams (should they exist in the country), as well as with international counterparts.     5.3.2 Establish contingency plans for cybersecurity crisis management     The Strategy should call for the development of a national contingency plan for  cybersecurity emergencies and crises. The plan should be part of, or aligned  with, the overall national contingency plan. A specific plan for critical information  infrastructures should also be considered.     This national cybersecurity contingency plan should consider the findings from  the national risk assessments and any cross-sector dependencies that could affect  the continuity of operations of critical infrastructures, as well as any disaster- recovery mechanisms. Moreover, it should provide an overview of the national  incident-response mechanisms; as well as highlight how cybersecurity incidents  are categorised, based on their impact on critical assets and services.   5.3.3 Promote information-sharing    The Strategy should call for the establishment of information-sharing mechanisms  to enable the exchange of actionable intelligence and threat information between  and amongst the public and private sectors.    Formal and informal information-sharing programmes can help foster effective  coordination and consistent, accurate and appropriate communications during  incident response and recovery activities; facilitate rapid sharing of threat and  intelligence information among affected parties and other stakeholders; help  improve the understanding of how and which sectors have been targeted;  disseminate information on the methods that can be used to defend and mitigate  damage on the affected assets; and ultimately reduce vulnerabilities and exposure  along with their attendant risks.     The Strategy should identify one or more institutional structures (i.e. competent  authorities) responsible for transmitting accurate and actionable information among  the national cybersecurity community, including the public and private sectors.     Information-sharing should be a two-way process. If governments are willing to  share the information they retain, their actions will demonstrate to private sector  entities that the government is indeed a partner in threat-information sharing, and  help ensure that responders are focused on and better prepared to respond to  essential threats.    5.3.4 Conduct cybersecurity exercises    The Strategy should encourage the organisation and coordination of domestic  and international cybersecurity and incident response exercises. These can follow  different formats (e.g., simulations or real-time exercises) and target the technical  and decision-making audiences.    42Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  5  National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice    Cybersecurity exercises and other crisis planning mechanisms can help countries  develop the institutional capacity to perform incident response effectively, test  crisis-management procedures and communication mechanisms, verify the  operational ability of CERTs/CSIRTs/CIRTs to respond under pressure, and help  understand any cross-sector dependencies.    Similarly, international cybersecurity exercises can help strengthen cyber-incident  response capacity among states, understand cross-border dependencies, build  confidence and trust between countries, and improve the overall international  resilience and preparedness levels.      Further references available on pages 62 and 63.       This focus area investigates good practice relating to protecting Critical  Infrastructures (CIs), and in particular Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs).  While there are no universally recognised definitions for the two terms and the  governments need to consider which entities and services to include based on  their own national risk assessment, for the purpose of this Guide, these terms are  defined as follows:    • Critical Infrastructures (CI) is a term used to describe assets that are essential  to the functioning and security of a society and economy in any given nation;  and    • Critical Information Infrastructures (CII) are IT and ICT systems that operate  key functions of the critical infrastructure of a nation.    Alternatively, the concept of essential services may be applied, referring to  services, which are essential for the maintenance of critical societal or   economic activities.     In either case, a few non-exhaustive examples of these services include: energy  (electricity, oil and gas), transportation (air, rail, water and road), finance and  banking (credit institutions, trading venues and central counterparties), healthcare  (healthcare organisations, including hospitals and private clinics), drinking- water supply and distribution, digital and telecommunications (fixed and mobile  telephone services and provision of internet infrastructure, such as internet  exchange points (IXPs) and domain name service, among others).   5.4   Focus area 4 - Critical Infrastructure services and   essential services    43Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  5  National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice   5.4.1 Establish a risk-management approach to protecting critical infrastructures   and services      The Strategy should address the protection of CIs and CIIs from a risk- management perspective, in accordance with Principle of Risk Management and  Resilience (Section 4.6). A detailed risk assessment should guide the identification  of national CIs and CIIs and critical services, whose disruption may have a serious  impact on the health, safety, security, or economic well-being of citizens, or on the  effective functioning of government or the economy.     Furthermore, a risk-based approach should also be adopted in identifying and  prioritising implementation of programmes and policies designed to protect CIs  and CIIs. To facilitate engagement with the private sector, a risk-management  approach based on international standards might also be considered.   5.4.2 Adopt a governance model with clear responsibilities    The Strategy should at a high level describe the governance structure, roles  and responsibilities of the different stakeholders for CI and CII protection. As  stipulated in the Principle of Clear Leadership, Roles and Resource Allocation  (Section 4.8), an effective and efficient CI-protection programme requires that  stakeholders have clearly defined roles and responsibilities and establish a  coordination mechanism for managing ongoing issues.    CIs and CIIs are often not owned or controlled by the government, and CI and CII  protection efforts generally exceed the capabilities and mandate of any single  agency in a government. Thus, appointing an overall coordinator for CI and CII  (cyber-)security, such as an interagency committee, can greatly assist in efforts to  protect critical infrastructure.    The governance model for CI and CII protection should include the identification  of government entities in charge of specific verticals, the responsibilities and  accountability of operators of CIs and CIIs, as well as the communication channels  and cooperation mechanisms between public and private agencies to ensure the  operation and recovery of critical services and infrastructures.   5.4.3 Define minimum cybersecurity baselines     The Strategy should either highlight the existing or propose the development  of new legislative and regulatory frameworks outlining minimum cybersecurity  baselines for CI and CII operators, among others. When developing such baselines,  internationally recognised standards and best practices should be considered to  ensure better security outcomes and greater efficiencies.     Security baselines should be outcomes-focused, articulating what organisations  should aim to achieve (e.g., “control logical access to critical resources”), rather  than how organisations should implement security (e.g., “utilise two-factor  authentication”), which in turn can allow government and industry to benefit     44Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  5  National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice  from continuous security improvements. In addition, an outcomes-based  approach to the development of these baselines leaves room for sector-specific  implementation or “how to” guidance, which allows enterprises the flexibility to  regularly update their own guidance to reflect the changing technology and   threat environments.   5.4.4 Utilise a wide range of market levers    The Strategy should consider a wide range of policies to ensure that all  organisations and individuals are indeed incentivised to fulfil their individual  cybersecurity responsibilities, commensurate with the risks they face, in  accordance with the principle of comprehensive approach and tailored priorities  (Section 4.2).     Identifying gaps between what the markets can and should drive and what the  risk environment requires is a crucial step towards determining when and how to  leverage the range of incentives and disincentives available to improve security.  To encourage the uptake of cybersecurity standards and practices across CIs and  CIIs, the Strategy should indicate that the government will consider a range of  policy options and market levers at its disposal.     5.4.5 Establish public-private partnerships    The Strategy should encourage the creation of formal public-private partnerships  to increase the security of Cis and CIIs. Public-private partnerships are a  cornerstone of effectively protecting critical infrastructure and managing security  risks in both the short- and long-term. They are essential for boosting trust  amongst and between the industry and the government.     However, establishing sustainable partnerships requires that all of the participating  stakeholders have a clear understanding of the goals of the partnership and the  mutual security benefits that stem from working together. Some of the areas could  include: coming to an agreement on common cybersecurity baselines, establishing  effective coordinating structures and information-sharing processes and protocols,  building trust, identifying and exchanging ideas, approaches and best practices for  improving security, as well as improving international coordination.    Further references available on pages 63 and 64.    45Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  5  National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice    Technology and policy considerations can dominate cybersecurity discussions,  overlooking the fundamental human element at its core. This Focus Area  addresses the challenges related to advancing cybersecurity capacity-building  and awareness-raising among government entities, citizens, businesses and other  organisations – crucial to enabling a country’s digital economy.     Good practices considered in this section include, the establishment of dedicated  cybersecurity curricula and awareness-raising programmes, expansion of training  schemes and workforce-development programmes, adoption of international  certification schemes, and promotion of innovation and research and development  (R&D) clusters.    5.5.1 Develop cybersecurity curricula    The Strategy should facilitate the development of school curricula with the aim  of accelerating cybersecurity skills development and awareness throughout the  formal education system. This should include developing dedicated cybersecurity  curricula across primary and secondary schools, integrating cybersecurity courses  in all computer science and IT programmes in higher education, and creating  dedicated cybersecurity degrees and government apprenticeships.     Additionally, the school curricula should foster awareness of and stimulate   interest in cybersecurity career opportunities. To further the efforts in this   space, the government should also consider establishing various incentive  schemes, such as scholarships for private education programmes and grants   for relevant apprenticeships.   5.5.2 Stimulate skills development and workforce training    The Strategy should address the development of cybersecurity training and skills- development schemes for experts and non-experts in both public and private sectors.  The effort could include the provision of executive and operational training, formal  internships and traineeships, and (national and international) certification of security  professionals, based on the needs identified by industry and government. Technical  training should be complemented with initiatives focused on risk management.     The Strategy should also foster initiatives, which aim to develop dedicated  cybersecurity career paths, in particular for the public sector, and incentives to  increase the supply of qualified cybersecurity professionals. These should be  created in partnership with academia, the private sector and civil society. To  address the ongoing gender gap of experts in cybersecurity, a gender-balanced  approach that motivates, encourages and facilitates more engagement from  women should be considered across all efforts aimed at skills-development and  training, ensuring inclusivity in the future.   5.5   Focus area 5 - Capability and capacity building and    awareness raising    46Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  5  National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice   5.5.3 Implement a coordinated cybersecurity awareness-raising programme    The Strategy should assign responsibility to coordinate cybersecurity awareness  campaigns and activities at the national level to a competent authority to ensure  resources are streamlined and accountability established. The authority should  collaborate with relevant stakeholders to develop and implement cybersecurity  awareness programmes focusing on disseminating information about cybersecurity  risks and threats, as well as about best practices for countering them.     A cybersecurity awareness-raising programme could include awareness-raising  campaigns aimed at the general public, children, digitally challenged, consumer- focused education programmes, and awareness-raising initiatives among others,   targeted at executives across public and private sectors.   5.5.4 Foster cybersecurity innovation and R&D    The Strategy should foster an environment that stimulates basic and applied  research in cybersecurity across sectors and various stakeholder groups. Such  initiatives include, for example, ensuring that national research efforts support  the objectives of the National Cybersecurity Strategy; developing cybersecurity- focused R&D programmes in public research organisations; effective dissemination  of new findings, baseline technologies, techniques, processes and tools. Moreover,  as part of the Strategy, countries should also seek to establish ties with the  international research community in the scientific fields related to cybersecurity,  such as computer science, electrical engineering, applied mathematics and  cryptography, but also non-technical fields such as social and political sciences,  business and management studies and psychology to name a few.    The Strategy should look at incentive mechanisms available from grants,  procurements, tax credits, competitions and other initiatives that encourage the  development of innovative cybersecurity solutions, products and services.    Further references available on pages 64 and 65.     This focus area covers the development of a legal and regulatory framework  to protect society against cybercrime and promote a safe and secure cyber- environment, in accordance with the Principles of Inclusiveness and on Trust  Environment (Sections 4.3 and 4.9, respectively). Such a framework could include:  the adoption of legislation that defines what constitutes illegal cyber-activity; legal  recognition of individual rights and civil liberties; establishment of compliance  mechanisms; the building of capacity to enforce the framework; institutionalisation  of critical entities; and international cooperation to fight cybercrime.  5.6   Focus area 6 - Legislation and regulation    47Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  5  National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice   5.6.1 Establish cybercrime legislation    The Strategy should promote the development of a domestic legal framework   that clearly defines what constitutes prohibited cyber-activity, and that aims  to reduce online crime. Most often, this capability takes the form of cybercrime  legislation, which can be achieved by enacting specific new laws or amending  existing ones (e.g., the penal code, laws regulating banking, telecommunications  and other sectors).     The Strategy should also encourage the creation of a process to monitor the  implementation and review of legislation and governance mechanisms, identify  gaps and overlapping authorities, and clarify and prioritise areas that require  modernisation (e.g., existing laws such as old telecommunication laws).   5.6.2 Recognise and safeguard individual rights and liberties      The Strategy should safeguard essential due process rights (in the case of criminal  investigations and prosecutions), as well as rights of data protection, including  protecting the privacy of personal data (possibly through the development of a  data-protection and privacy framework) and freedom of expression, in accordance  with the Principle of Fundamental Human Rights (Section 4.5).   5.6.3 Create compliance mechanisms     The Strategy should promote the establishment of domestic compliance  mechanisms (both enforcement and incentives). These mechanisms should  be set in place to prevent, combat and mitigate actions directed against the  confidentiality, integrity and availability of ICT systems and infrastructures,  and threatening computer data, in accordance with the aforementioned legal  framework. They should inter alia cover the particularities of digital investigation,  lawful interception of communications and use of electronic evidence.   5.6.4 Promote capacity-building for law enforcement    The Strategy should encourage the development of cyber-law-enforcement  capacity, including training and education for a range of stakeholders involved  in combating cybercrime (e.g., judges, prosecutors, lawyers, law-enforcement  officials, forensic specialists and other investigators). Law enforcement should  receive specialised training to interpret and apply domestic cybercrime laws (i.e.,  translate the law into technical notions and vice versa); to effectively detect, deter,  investigate and prosecute cybercrime offenses; and to effectively collaborate with  industry and international law-enforcement entities (e.g., INTERPOL, Europol)  to tackle cybercrime and to boost cybersecurity. This element should take into  consideration focus area 5 on Capability and Capacity Building and Awareness  Raising (Section 5.5).    48Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  5  National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice   5.6.5 Establish inter-organisational processes    The Strategy should identify and recognise the mandates of domestic agencies  with the primary authority to ensure compliance with cybercrime legislation, those  responsible for protecting critical infrastructures, and those responsible for ensuring  that all international cybercrime requirements are being met (e.g., ensure that  national laws comply with international treaty obligations) and across judicial lines  (e.g., cross-border cooperation) (see also Section 5.1.3 and 5.1.4; and Section 5.6.6).    In some legal systems, legislation might be required for the establishment of  institutions involved in cybersecurity, such as national CERTs/CIRTs/CSIRTs, or in  clarifying the authority of a single agency to coordinate cyber-policy in a country.   5.6.6 Support international cooperation to combat cybercrime    The Strategy should demonstrate a commitment to protect society against  cybercrime globally, through ratification, where possible and in accordance with  the overall national agenda, of international cybercrime agreements or equivalent  agreements to fight cybercrime, and through the promotion of coordination  mechanisms to address international cybercrime. This may include aligning  national laws with international treaty obligations and bilateral agreements,  for example by establishing mutual legal assistance, enabling cross-border  investigations and prosecutions, handling of digital evidence, and extradition.   This element should take into consideration focus area 7 on international  cooperation (Section 5.7).    Further references available on pages 65 and 66.    This focus area emphasises the elements that the Strategy should cover in terms  of cybersecurity engagements outside the particular country, both at regional and  international levels. Cybersecurity increasingly plays a role in many different areas  of international relations, including human rights, economic development, trade,  commerce, arms control, security, stability, peace and conflict resolution.     The Strategy should therefore recognise the borderless nature of cybersecurity,  and highlight the need to cooperate with not only national, but also international  stakeholders. International engagements with public and private stakeholders  are key to facilitating a constructive dialogue, developing trust and cooperation  mechanisms, finding mutually acceptable solutions to common challenges, and  creating a global culture of cybersecurity.    In accordance with the principle of comprehensive approach and tailored priorities  (Section 4.2), regional and international cooperation should be fostered in   5.7   Focus area 7 - International cooperation    49Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  5  National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice  harmony with the political, social, cultural and economic layout of the country, as  well as its foreign-policy priorities.   5.7.1 Recognise the importance of cybersecurity as a priority of foreign policy    The Strategy should express a commitment to international cooperation on  cybersecurity and recognise cyber-issues as an integral component of the  country’s foreign policy. To this end, it is important to encourage the development  and use of competencies and skills focused on cyber-issues (cyber-diplomacy) to  complement the traditional methods and processes of diplomacy. The Strategy  may also include the development of specific organisational structures and the  establishment of some dedicated office or trained personnel whose primary focus  is diplomatic engagement on cyber-issues.    More specifically, the Strategy should clearly articulate the government’s focus  areas and long-term objectives for international cooperation, including which  stakeholders (for instance, public, private, regional, global) would be engaged.  These might include, for instance, support for establishment of international  cybersecurity norms and confidence-building measures, commitment  to cybersecurity capacity-building, participation in the development of  international cybersecurity standards, as well as joining existing regional and  international instruments.    This may also require better harmonisation among different governmental players  (e.g., head of state and cabinet, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of ICT, Ministry  of Industry and Trade, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Defence, etc.) so that the  policy position expressed by one domestic player at a negotiating table in the  international cybersecurity arena is properly coordinated and aligned with other  governmental bodies.   5.7.2 Engage in international discussions     The Strategy should identify specific international fora and cooperation  mechanisms that the country wishes to join to effectively engage diplomatically  on cyber-related issues. These could include regional or global organisations,  intergovernmental discussions, public and/or private-sector alliances, as well as  established traditional cooperation and collaboration mechanisms that include  cybersecurity issues.     As the country begins to undertake such engagements, these will likely require  the government to develop additional competencies and skills focused on cyber- issues and increase its overall cybersecurity capacity. It is therefore important to  effectively prioritise these efforts and allocate adequate resources (personnel and  money) to ensure that they deliver concrete results.    50Guide to Developing a National Cybersecurity Strategy  5  National Cybersecurity Strategy Good Practice   5.7.3 Promote formal and informal cooperation in cyberspace    The Strategy should indicate the operational international-cooperation  mechanisms that the country wishes to commit to. The country may wish to  engage in formal and informal international endeavours advancing cooperation  on, for example, policy and legislative development, law enforcement, incident- response, information- and threat-sharing. Participation in such initiatives could,  for example, support better cooperation and exchange of information between  relevant authorities on potential threats and vulnerabilities.   5.7.4 Align domestic and international cybersecurity efforts      The Strategy should consider existing regional and international cybersecurity  initiatives and foster harmonisation and alignment. This would allow the country  to leverage existing best practices, as well as to contribute towards cohesion and  convergence of cybersecurity approaches.     To this end, the Strategy should show the country’s commitment to ensuring  consistency between its domestic and foreign-policy agendas by harmonising  its national legal framework and policies with its international commitments, and  aligning its national cybersecurity approaches with its international efforts.    Notable examples of existing international efforts that could be considered as  part of the Strategy include, but are not limited to: the work of the United Nations  Governmental Group of Experts on Developments in the Field of Information  and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (UN GGE),  the Organisation of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) on confidence  building measures (CBMs) and international norms applicable in cyberspace,  the work of the G7 Group’s High-Tech Crime Subgroup, the Council of Europe’s  Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, the African Union’s Convention on  Cybersecurity, the agreement between the governments of state members of  the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on cooperation in the field of ensuring  international information security, the Arab Convention on Combating Information  Technology Offences, the ECOWAS Directive on fighting cybercrime, as well as  the support of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (NATO  CCD COE) for the Tallinn Manuals 1.0 and 2.0.

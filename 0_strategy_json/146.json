Critical Success Factors  25 REPUBLIC OF NAMIBIA 1 Ministry of Information and Communication Technology STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22 Foreword by Hon. Minister: Strategic planning is an essential effort through which the Ministry of ICT can establish directions and create strategic initiatives that mobilise limited resources to fulfill its mission, to achieve its goals, and to take maximum advantage of trends in the internal and external environment. Through strategic planning, we can take advantage of opportunities and deal with challenges. This Strategic Plan has been aligned with the Vision 2030, SWAPO Party Manifesto, National Development Plan (NDP) 5 and Harambee Prosperity Plan in an effort to accelerate the implementation of the high level goals and ensure that the strategic objectives are fully implemented Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are not only mere economic enablers, but have great potential to transform economies and should be seen as important economic drivers. World-wide, ICTs are known to have potential to contribute to accelerated Gross Domestic Products and increased labour productivity growth rates. This has been evidenced by numerous research results on the impact of ICT on macro, industry and micro-level. Namibia can certainly maximise on this reality. During the past three years, the Ministry managed to create an enabling legislative environment and undertook projects aimed at developing ICT infrastructure and services such as implementation of the Digital Terrestrial Television coverage; drafting and adopting the Universal Access and Service Policy; developing the Broadband Policy and its Strategic Implementation Plan; developing the Electronic Transaction and Cybercrime Bill; implementation of the Scan-ICT programme and operationalisation of the Scan –ICT portal to 2 Ministry of Information and Communication Technology STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22 depict available ICT indicators and data to the users; as well as initiating the review of the National Information Policy; and the drafting the Access to Information Bill development process. In addition, the Ministry of ICT facilitated the establishment of 25 Multi-purpose Community Centres in remote parts of the country, equipping them with internet infrastructure. Through the Namibia Film Commission outreach programmes, we saw the rise of Mobile Cinemas taken to grassroots communities in 199 villages and settlements all over the country. This particular activity was initiated to develop a screen culture in remote rural communities. Educational, informative and entertaining videos and films have been screened to keep communities abreast of both historical and current affairs developments in our country and beyond. In line with the country’s policy on International Relations and Cooperation as well as South- South Cooperation Strategy, the Namibia Film Commission together with the Institute of Cinematography and Audio-visual Arts (ICAA) in Argentina funded the film “The Hidden Sky”. Since its release it continues to be screened at International Film Festivals in Africa, Asia, North and South America. The film is produced in Spanish, Khoekhoegowab (Damara-Nama) and Otjiherero with English subtitles. About 100 Namibians were employed onset, while 5 received training in filmmaking. In order to meet the demands of the evolving ICT sector, the Ministry is in the process of reviewing the current staff structure to make it synonymous to the mandate. During the new 5 year Strategic Plan, the MICT will continue with efforts to invest in its human resources through appropriate capacity building initiatives , which will not only be through traditional training methods, but also through grooming and mentoring as alternative, less cost consuming means. In furthering its mandate, MICT is committed to provide its staff with state of the art infrastructure and ICT equipment, hereby creating a conducive working environment and equipping staff to enhance performance excellence, through the implementation of the Customer Service Charter (CSC). With the implementation of the CSC, coupled with the new ‘core values’ which are ‘Helpfulness; Innovation; Transparency, Accessibility, and Accountability (HITAA)’, the MICT vows to committedly improve service delivery and serve the Namibian citizens. The general public should look forward to extended and accessible broadband services which will enable each citizen to participate in democratic processes, stay connected, communicate and enjoy unfettered access to information, as it should be. 3 Ministry of Information and Communication Technology STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22 The dream to make Namibia 100% connected to mobile, fixed, broadcasting and internet services is not just an ambitious vision, but it is a promise that the Ministry is dedicated to see through to deliver on Government’s stance that no Namibian should be left out. Access to information is an important empowerment tool, because information is indeed power and at MICT we further say, “Shared information is more powerful”. During the implementation of this Strategic Plan, I call for dedication, hard work and cooperation by all MICT staff, so that come the review period, our feedback to the nation is tangible and evidence based and can be backed by positive feedback from our internal and external stakeholders. Managers are urged to use the Strategic Plan as their guiding document when planning on their annual and daily activities in order not to divert from our new strategic objectives. It gives me great pleasure to present to you the new Ministry of Information and Communication Technology’s 2017-2022 Strategic Plan. 4 Ministry of Information and Communication Technology STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22 Acknowledgement We hereby acknowledge that the implementation of our first ever MICT Strategic Plan was not a cool breeze walk in the park, but a rewarding journey worth celebrating and drawing lessons thereof. Following completion of the lifespan of the just ended 2014 – 2017 MICT Strategic Plan, the Ministry of ICT conducted a review to evaluate performance. Constant monitoring of implementation has been done through-out the years of the Strategic Plan through quarterly Annual Plan review sessions, as well as implementation and review of all staff’s Performance Agreements. The objective of the review was to see how the Ministry faired in its promise as outlined in the old Strategic Plan, identify lessons learned, look at challenges – at the same time developing creative means to tackle these challenges. All-in-all, we took the opportunity to learn from all the success stories experienced. Since our journey is far from reaching its end, we started the hard work of developing and crafting a new Strategic Plan for the years 2017 – 2022. During this exercise, the MICT management deemed it fit to review the MICT’s Mission, Vision and Core Values to align them to the ministerial mandate and changing ICT trends. In order to enhance ownership of the new MICT Strategic Plan, it was essential to involve operational staff members in its development, therefore Directorates and Divisions held a number of consultative meetings with their staff to ensure that staff contributes to its 5 Ministry of Information and Communication Technology STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22 development, and can own this document not only during implementation, but also from its development phases. It remains the responsibility of the Heads of Directorates/Divisions to ensure that the content of this Strategic Plan is inculcated into their organisation culture and climate on a day-to-day basis. This should form the basis of the MICT’s service commitment to the Namibian nation and beyond. Each MICT staff, regardless of position, should be acquainted with what is expected of them in furtherance of the MICT mandate. The onus lies on the MICT Management to drive this as a vehicle towards becoming ‘a catalyst for an informed and inclusive ICT smart Namibia’. This plan will be further cascaded into Annual Plans and eventually individual Performance Agreements that will hold us accountable to the public as public servants. In order to effectively implement the Performance Management System, we need to introduce aspects of change management, coaching and mentoring into the workplace. I would like to sincerely thank the MICT Strategy Committee for facilitating the development of this Strategic Plan, the hard work and dedication of the MICT Management is indeed inspiring, that together we will fulfil the Ministry’s mandate. With expert guidance from the CoreElite team, we have managed to carve our destiny, determine the path we will take to deliver, and so we vow to remain accountable during this journey. All this would not be possible, without the continuous guidance, faith and support that the Ministry of ICT enjoys from its Top Management. 6 Ministry of Information and Communication Technology STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22 Introduction 1.1. Background The Ministry of Information and Communication Technology is mandated to ‘Lay the foundation for the accelerated use and development of ICT in Namibia, and Coordinate information management within Government’. As a step to fulfil their mandate, MICT embarked upon the development of a comprehensive five-year Strategic Plan 2017-2022 through a process of strategic planning and application of strategic thinking. The result of this process is a Strategic Plan which provides the strategic direction comprising a Vision, Mission and Core Values; details of how MICT will get there and how it will know that it has attained its vision. Central to all these processes is an effective Performance Management System (PMS) which ensures delivery on results and accountability. In this regard, a Strategic Plan is therefore a foundation for an effective Performance Management System which ultimately forms a basis in setting parameters for individual/staff level Performance thereby translating a strategy into the desired actions by the entire organisation. All these actions should demonstrate the Ministry’s contribution to the achievement of the national dream, Vision 2030. The desired future of Namibia is to be “A prosperous and industrialized Namibia developed by her human resources, enjoying peace, harmony and political stability”. In order to evaluate its successes and overcome challenges in executing the mandate, the process of strategic planning commenced with the review of the previous Strategic Plan 2014- 2017. This was done to appreciate the past and lay a foundation for the new Strategic Plan as well as to execute the mandate in response to attaining the country’s Vision. The methodology followed in formulating the 2017-2022 Strategic Plan was based on the Public Service Strategic Planning Framework. It was developed by the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) to guide the development of strategic plans across the entire Public Service. In this regard, the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (MICT) will in the next five years deliver results on the following Pillars: 1. ICT Development; 2. Information Services and 3. Operational Excellence. These results will come about through the achievement of four distinct but interrelated Strategic objectives. MICT will: i. Accelerate ICT development, access and use for an inclusive ICT smart Namibia. ii. Enhance unhindered access to information for an informed nation. iii. Promote Namibia as a preferred film destination. Focused to contribute to the realization of Namibia Vision 2030 7 Ministry of Information and Communication Technology STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22 iv. Enhance an enabling environment for a high performance culture and effective service delivery. In pursuit of these results, MICT leadership, management and staff shall live and uphold the following core values namely: 1. Helpfulness; 2. Innovation; 3. Transparency; 4. Accessibility and 5. Accountability. The acronym for these values shall be known as “HITAA” 1.2. Governance and Management of MICT The successful implementation of any Strategic plan requires a fit for purpose structure which will support the operationalisation of the Strategic plan. In this regard, the Ministry is headed by the Honourable Minister supported by a Deputy Minister. At Management level, MICT is headed by a Permanent Secretary. Other senior positions which will provide direction and ensure implementation of the Strategic Plan are as per fig one. The full structure which includes positions within the fourteen regions can be viewed at the Ministry‘s Offices. However, it should be noted that in order to meet the demands of the evolving ICT sector, the Ministry is in the process of reviewing the current staff structure to make it synonymous to the mandate. 8 Ministry of Information and Communication Technology STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22 HONORABLE MINISTER DEPUTY MINISTER 1X PERMANENT SECRETARY 1 SECTION INTERNAL AUDITOR 1X CHIEF INTERNAL AUDITOR 6 1X INTERNAL AUDITOR 8 1X ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER 12 DIRECTORATE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION DEVELOPMENT 1X DIRECTOR 3 DIRECTORATE PRINT MEDIA 1X DIRECTOR 3 DIRECTORATE AUDIOVISUAL MEDIA COPYRIGHT SERVICES AND REGIONAL OFFICES 1X DIRECTOR 3 DIVISION GENERAL SERVICES 1X DEPUTY DIRECTOR 4 Fig.1 MICT Structure 9 Ministry of Information and Communication Technology STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22 1.3 Linkage of MICT Strategic Plan to National and International Agendas One of the critical reasons for formulating and implementing Strategic plans is to ensure that they become drivers to operationalising National and International Agendas to which Namibia is signatory to. This reality calls for strong alignment of the Strategic Plan with the National priorities and aspirations as well as international agendas. (See table 1for details). The table below presents the agenda with a corresponding contributor on the side of MICT. Table 1: Linkage of MICT Strategic Plan to National and International Agendas Agenda Statement MICT Corresponding Contribution Vision 2030 “A prosperous and industrialised Namibia developed by her human resources, enjoying peace, harmony and political stability”. MICT pledges its contribution through the attainment of its vision of being ‘A catalyst for an informed and inclusive ICT smart Namibia’. In addition the Ministry’s contribution will be felt through the achievement of their strategic objectives as outlined below: Strategic Objective 1: Accelerate ICT development, access and use for an inclusive ICT smart Namibia. Strategic Objective 2. Enhance unhindered access to information for an informed nation. Strategic Objectives 3. Promote Namibia as a preferred film destination. Strategic Objective 4: Enhance an enabling environment for a high performance culture and effective service delivery.

HPP OMAs will be on e-governance by 2020 Strategic Objective 1: 10 Ministry of Information and Communication Technology STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22 Agenda Statement MICT Corresponding Contribution The Office of the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology were given a joint responsibility for the implementation of these projects. The joint responsibilities as extracted from the HPP document are: “To promote transparency and accessibility, Government will expedite the deployment of e-governance to cover all Ministries and public agencies by 2020. The Office of the Prime Minister in conjunction with the MICT, as the central government agency tasked with the planning, design and implementation of all Government ICT solutions, will submit a detailed roll-out plan by July 2016. All Ministries and Public Agencies will be linked to e- governance during the Harambee. Accelerate ICT development, access and use for an inclusive ICT smart Namibia will form the basis of MICT contribution. SWAPO Party Manifesto 2014 On Information communication technology this is the promise:  Enhancement of the use and application of ICTs for socio- economic development. Further investments will be made in ICT infrastructure development and connectivity so as to provide access to modern communication systems, technology transfer, and adaption for industrialisation.  Encouragement and promotion of cooperation among ICT service providers in the development and utilisation of ICT infrastructure to enhance communication and accelerate socio-economic development.  Promotion of public-private partnership funding for technology centres to advance ICT literacy. The achievement of all MICT objectives has an overarching component which is very much aligned to the statement in SWAPO Party Manifesto’ promise on information communication technology (see details below): Vision: ‘A catalyst for an informed and inclusive ICT smart Namibia’. Strategic Objective 1: Accelerate ICT development, access and use for an inclusive ICT smart Namibia. Strategic Objectives 2. Enhance unhindered access to information for an informed nation. Strategic Objectives 3. Promote Namibia as a preferred film destination. 11 Ministry of Information and Communication Technology STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22 Agenda Statement MICT Corresponding Contribution  Acceleration of the implementation of e-governance to improve public service delivery.

To this end the CORE VALUES |How WE make a difference… Helpfulness Providing a courteous and helpful service which is run to suit the convenience for those entitled to the service Innovation Using ICTs creatively as an enabler for service delivery Transparency Openly, timely and accurately provide government information services to our customers Accessibility To enhance the quality of being able to be reached or easy to obtain or used and easily understood Accountability Accepting our responsibilities and consequences for our actions The ministry has declared 13 Ministry of Information and Communication Technology STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22 MICT identified the Strategic issues listed and described below. There are other challenges which were identified and can be resolved by the existing structure.  Slow pace of ICT development, access and use. This issue is propelled by many factors including; the absence of sufficient ICT Research and Development (R&D) in the country; lack of mechanisms for consolidation of all ICT services to empower the nation; inadequate measures/ tools to enforce proper regulations on affordability of ICT products and services; lack of mechanism and awareness on the effects of cybercrime and extremism will receive attention in the Strategic Plan period in the form of an electronic cyber bill; and insufficient efforts to position and market Namibia as a preferred regional ICT hub.  The ICT and Information service sector is faced with a shortage of expertise. Graduates from universities and colleges around the country do not meet the required skilled for the market.  Inadequate measure to strengthen Public Private Partnership (PPP). PPP is critical recipe to accelerate ICT development and improve information service delivery, especially in developing and disseminating local content. Similarly achievement of the strategic objectives of the Ministry will also require strengthening stakeholder relationships including Ministerial coordination.  Loopholes and fragmentation of policies and laws. Inconsistencies of legislations leading to corrupt practices. Luck of initiatives to harmonise policies and laws.  Negative effects of natural disasters. The environmental hazards have a direct and critical bearing in the development of the sector, example floods.  Limited access and availability of insufficient information. This issue is caused by many factors: inadequate understanding on GRN programmes and projects; limited access to public information; and inadequate measure to make information easily accessible in all languages at grassroots level.  Prevailing operational challenges. These include: outdated structure that is not aligned to the current mandate; no mechanism in place to monitor and evaluate service delivery; lack of incentives to attract technical staff; insufficient organisational culture; inadequate financial and human resources for Mandate execution; high staff turnover; mismatch of skills; and ever changing technology effecting the structure.  Lack of ownership and national pride. 14 Ministry of Information and Communication Technology STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22 Prior to Namibia's independence on 21 March 1990, Namibian people were divided into homelands based on their ethnic and tribal orientation. A legacy that was imprinted in the minds of Namibians, thus robbing them of their sense of common identity and loyalty to a single state. As the custodian of the Nationhood and National Pride programme, the Ministry therefore has the responsibility to reinforce the message of unity and national pride in order to ensure that citizens take ownership and contribute to the achievement of Vision 2030. In addition it is important that the Namibians tell their stories the Namibian way.  Negative effects of world economic crisis on Namibia economy. This issue, although by nature an external factor which is outside the control of the Ministry, does impact negatively on Namibia’s economic growth and in turn on financial resources which are required to execute the programmes and projects. 4. Our Strategic Objectives In order to attain its vision the ministry’s Strategic Plan puts forth four (4) high-level Strategic Objectives/ Strategies which will be used to overcome the Strategic issues outlined above. 4.1. Strategic Objective (SO1): Accelerate ICT development, access and use for an inclusive ICT smart Namibia The following interventions will be used to accelerate ICT development, access and use for an inclusive ICT smart Namibia. a) Harmonization of ICT and Information legislation; b) Formulation/ updating and amendment of ICT policies where necessary; c) Strengthening ICT and information Research and Development (R & D) to timely respond to changing technology; d) Improving coordination mechanisms of ICT and information programmes and projects; e) Strengthening the over-sight role on the implementation of the ICT policies and laws; f) Ensuring the development and implementation of mechanisms to protect the nation from cybercrimes and extremism; Four (4) Strategic Objectives: So1: Accelerate ICT development, access and use for an inclusive ICT smart Namibia SO2: Enhance unhindered access to information for an informed nation SO3: Promote Namibia as a preferred film destination SO4: Enhance an enabling environment for a high performance culture and effective service delivery 15 Ministry of Information and Communication Technology STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22 g) Devising strategies to improve ICT connectivity; h) Creating mechanism to harness ICT for people with disabilities. 4.2.

Situational Analysis A number of processes were used to analyze the current situation. Among others was the SWOT, PESTLE and Stakeholder analysis. The purpose of conducting the analysis was to identify Strategic issues which then formed the foundation for Strategic pillars and Strategic objectives. Each of these analyses is further described below; 7.1. SWOT Analysis SWOT Analysis is a useful framework for analyzing an organization's strengths and weaknesses, and the opportunities and threats that the organization faces. In this regard it will help MICT focus on its strengths; overcome weaknesses minimize threats, and take the greatest possible advantage of opportunities available to it.

Stakeholder Analysis A Stakeholder is anybody/organization that can affect or is affected by the organization’s strategy, programs and or projects. Stakeholders can either be internal or external. By implication they influence the success or failure of an institution. They need to be identified, their needs and their role mapped out. Equally it is important for MICT to inform the stakeholders on how they can contribute to its success. To this end the table below presents MICT’s key stakeholders.It is therefore imperative that the Ministry shall collaborate with all its Stakeholders in pursuit of being, ‘A catalyst for an informed and inclusive ICT smart Namibia’. (See table 2 for details) Table 2: Key stakeholders’ expectations and needs are presented in the table below: Key Stakeholders What they want from you (Expectations) What you need from them that will enhance execution of your strategy?

Critical Success Factors Critical success factor (CSF) is a Management term for an element that is necessary for an organization to attain its vision. It is a critical factor or activity required for ensuring the success of an organization. The Ministry of Information and Technology therefore identified the following factors as critical for the successful implementation of the 2017/18-2021/22 Strategic Plan. Critical Success Factor Description 1. Leadership, Commitment and Ownership: In order to achieve what it sets out in this Strategic Plan, MICT needs to inspire its officials and make them feel valued. This requires a committed leadership team with leadership styles focusing on providing guidance, developing mutual trust, motivating, and inspiring all staff members to have the desire and commitment necessary to execute the Ministerial Strategic Plan successfully. 2. Teamwork The implementation of this Strategic Plan, MICT requires a work culture that values collaboration. It is necessary to create an environment where staff members, Management understand and believe that thinking, planning, decisions and actions are better when done cooperatively and collectively. Staff members, Management should recognize, and even assimilate, the belief that “none of them is as good as all of them.” Therefore, teamwork is required to implement this Strategic Plan. 26 Ministry of Information and Communication Technology STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22 3. Communication It is imperative that for the success of this Strategic Plan MICT managers are able to communicate the Ministerial strategic intent to all staff members and stakeholders to ensure that the Strategic Plan is successfully implemented. This is necessary for all staff members to understand their roles, buy in and commit to performing their tasks exceptionally. Regular feedback to all stakeholders and maintaining a good communication practice is the key to ensuring the successful implementation of this Plan. 4. Monitoring and Evaluation Regular monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of programmes and projects is necessary to assess success and the execution rate of the Strategic Plan and to devise corrective measures for successful implementation of programmes and activities. 5. Good Stakeholder Relation: It is imperative for the MICT to develop and maintain strong relationships with its stakeholders in order to consistently work together with the intention of to realize the its aspirations. 6. Capacity building development The implementation of the Strategic Plan requires skills upgrade of staff members which should be identified in the Performance Agreements. Continuous skills transfers and development are central to improving productivity and the realisation of the Ministry’s mandate. 7. Alignment to the Budget In order to realise the intents of the Strategic Plan, Directorates/Divisions need to realistically estimate the cost/resource requirements for the strategic programmes to be implemented. Resource allocations as per MTEF estimation should be aligned to programmes so as to ensure the achievement of maximum results with minimum resources. 8. Accountability In implementing this Strategic Plan, all staff members need to take and accept responsibilities and consequences for their actions.

Minister:      Strategic planning is an essential effort through which the Ministry of ICT can establish   directions and create strategic initiatives that mobilise limited resources to fulfill its mission,   to achieve its goals, and to take maximum advantage of trends in the internal and external   environment. Through strategic planning, we can take advantage of opportunities and deal   with challenges.   This Strategic Plan has been aligned with the Vision 2030, SWAPO Party Manifesto, National   Development Plan (NDP) 5 and Harambee Prosperity Plan in an effort to accelerate the   implementation of the high level goals and ensure that the strategic objectives are fully   implemented   Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are not only mere economic enablers, but   have great potential to transform economies and should be seen as important economic   drivers. World-wide, ICTs are known to have potential to contribute to accelerated Gross   Domestic Products and increased labour productivity growth rates. This has been evidenced   by numerous research results on the impact of ICT on macro, industry and micro-level.   Namibia can certainly maximise on this reality.   During the past three years, the Ministry managed to create an enabling legislative   environment and undertook projects aimed at developing ICT infrastructure and services such   as implementation of the Digital Terrestrial Television coverage; drafting and adopting the   Universal Access and Service Policy; developing the Broadband Policy and its Strategic   Implementation Plan; developing the Electronic Transaction and Cybercrime Bill;   implementation of the Scan-ICT programme and operationalisation of the Scan –ICT portal to     2  Ministry of Information and Communication Technology  STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22   depict available ICT indicators and data to the users; as well as initiating the review of the   National Information Policy; and the drafting the Access to Information Bill development   process.   In addition, the Ministry of ICT facilitated the establishment of 25 Multi-purpose Community   Centres in remote parts of the country, equipping them with internet infrastructure. Through   the Namibia Film Commission outreach programmes, we saw the rise of Mobile Cinemas taken   to grassroots communities in 199 villages and settlements all over the country. This particular   activity was initiated to develop a screen culture in remote rural communities. Educational,   informative and entertaining videos and films have been screened to keep communities   abreast of both historical and current affairs developments in our country and beyond.    In line with the country’s policy on International Relations and Cooperation as well as South-  South Cooperation Strategy, the Namibia Film Commission together with the Institute of   Cinematography and Audio-visual Arts (ICAA) in Argentina funded the film “The Hidden Sky”.    Since its release it continues to be screened at International Film Festivals in Africa, Asia, North   and South America. The film is produced in Spanish, Khoekhoegowab (Damara-Nama) and   Otjiherero with English subtitles. About 100 Namibians were employed onset, while 5 received   training in filmmaking.   In order to meet the demands of the evolving ICT sector, the Ministry is in the process of   reviewing the current staff structure to make it synonymous to the mandate.    During the new 5 year Strategic Plan, the MICT will continue with efforts to invest in its human   resources through appropriate capacity building initiatives , which will not only be through   traditional training methods, but also through grooming and mentoring as alternative, less   cost consuming means.    In furthering its mandate, MICT is committed to provide its staff with state of the art   infrastructure and ICT equipment, hereby creating a conducive working environment and   equipping staff to enhance performance excellence, through the implementation of the   Customer Service Charter (CSC).  With the implementation of the CSC, coupled with the new   ‘core values’ which are ‘Helpfulness; Innovation; Transparency, Accessibility, and   Accountability (HITAA)’, the MICT vows to committedly improve service delivery and serve   the Namibian citizens.   The general public should look forward to extended and accessible broadband services which   will enable each citizen to participate in democratic processes, stay connected, communicate   and enjoy unfettered access to information, as it should be.          3  Ministry of Information and Communication Technology  STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22   The dream to make Namibia 100% connected to mobile, fixed, broadcasting and internet   services is not just an ambitious vision, but it is a promise that the Ministry is dedicated to see   through to deliver on Government’s stance that no Namibian should be left out.  Access to   information is an important empowerment tool, because information is indeed power and at   MICT we further say, “Shared information is more powerful”.     During the implementation of this Strategic Plan, I call for dedication, hard work and   cooperation by all MICT staff, so that come the review period, our feedback to the nation is   tangible and evidence based and can be backed by positive feedback from our internal and   external stakeholders.    Managers are urged to use the Strategic Plan as their guiding document when planning on   their annual and daily activities in order not to divert from our new strategic objectives.   It gives me great pleasure to present to you the new Ministry of Information and   Communication Technology’s 2017-2022 Strategic Plan.                     4  Ministry of Information and Communication Technology  STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22   Acknowledgement         We hereby acknowledge that the implementation of our first ever MICT Strategic Plan was   not a cool breeze walk in the park, but a rewarding journey worth celebrating and drawing   lessons thereof.   Following completion of the lifespan of the just ended 2014 – 2017 MICT Strategic Plan, the   Ministry of ICT conducted a review to evaluate performance. Constant monitoring of   implementation has been done through-out the years of the Strategic Plan through quarterly   Annual Plan review sessions, as well as implementation and review of all staff’s Performance   Agreements.   The objective of the review was to see how the Ministry faired in its promise as outlined in the   old Strategic Plan, identify lessons learned, look at challenges – at the same time developing   creative means to tackle these challenges.  All-in-all, we took the opportunity to learn from all   the success stories experienced.   Since our journey is far from reaching its end, we started the hard work of developing and   crafting a new Strategic Plan for the years 2017 – 2022.  During this exercise, the MICT   management deemed it fit to review the MICT’s Mission, Vision and Core Values to align them   to the ministerial mandate and changing ICT trends.   In order to enhance ownership of the new MICT Strategic Plan, it was essential to involve   operational staff members in its development, therefore Directorates and Divisions held a   number of consultative meetings with their staff to ensure that staff contributes to its     5  Ministry of Information and Communication Technology  STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22   development, and can own this document not only during implementation, but also from its   development phases.      It remains the responsibility of the Heads of Directorates/Divisions to ensure that the content   of this Strategic Plan is inculcated into their organisation culture and climate on a day-to-day   basis.  This should form the basis of the MICT’s service commitment to the Namibian nation   and beyond.  Each MICT staff, regardless of position, should be acquainted with what is   expected of them in furtherance of the MICT mandate.  The onus lies on the MICT   Management to drive this as a vehicle towards becoming ‘a catalyst for an informed and   inclusive ICT smart Namibia’.   This plan will be further cascaded into Annual Plans and eventually individual Performance   Agreements that will hold us accountable to the public as public servants.  In order to   effectively implement the Performance Management System, we need to introduce aspects   of change management, coaching and mentoring into the workplace.   I would like to sincerely thank the MICT Strategy Committee for facilitating the development   of this Strategic Plan, the hard work and dedication of the MICT Management is indeed   inspiring, that together we will fulfil the Ministry’s mandate.  With expert guidance from the   CoreElite team, we have managed to carve our destiny, determine the path we will take to   deliver, and so we vow to remain accountable during this journey.   All this would not be possible, without the continuous guidance, faith and support that the   Ministry of ICT enjoys from its Top Management.        6  Ministry of Information and Communication Technology  STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22   Introduction   1.1. Background   The Ministry of Information and Communication Technology is mandated to ‘Lay the  foundation for the accelerated use and development of ICT in Namibia, and Coordinate  information management within Government’. As a step to fulfil their mandate, MICT  embarked upon the development of a comprehensive five-year Strategic Plan 2017-2022  through a process of strategic planning and application of strategic thinking.   The result of this process is a Strategic Plan which provides the strategic direction comprising  a Vision, Mission and Core Values; details of how MICT will get there and how it will know that  it has attained its vision. Central to all these processes is an effective  Performance Management System (PMS) which ensures delivery on results  and accountability. In this regard, a Strategic Plan is therefore a foundation  for an effective Performance Management System which ultimately forms a  basis in setting parameters for individual/staff level Performance thereby  translating a strategy into the desired actions by the entire organisation. All  these actions should demonstrate the Ministry’s contribution to the  achievement of the national dream, Vision 2030. The desired future of  Namibia is to be “A prosperous and industrialized Namibia developed by her  human resources, enjoying peace, harmony and political stability”.   In order to evaluate its successes and overcome challenges in executing the mandate, the  process of strategic planning commenced with the review of the previous Strategic Plan 2014- 2017. This was done to appreciate the past and lay a foundation for the new Strategic Plan as  well as to execute the mandate in response to attaining the country’s Vision.   The methodology followed in formulating the 2017-2022 Strategic Plan was based on the  Public Service Strategic Planning Framework. It was developed by the Office of the Prime  Minister (OPM) to guide the development of strategic plans across the entire Public Service.  In this regard, the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (MICT) will in the  next five years deliver results on the following Pillars:   1. ICT Development;  2. Information Services and   3. Operational Excellence.   These results will come about through the achievement of four distinct but interrelated   Strategic objectives. MICT will:    i. Accelerate ICT development, access and use for an inclusive ICT smart Namibia.  ii. Enhance unhindered access to information for an informed nation.   iii. Promote Namibia as a preferred film destination.   Focused to   contribute to   the realization   of Namibia   Vision 2030     7  Ministry of Information and Communication Technology  STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22   iv. Enhance an enabling environment for a high performance culture and effective  service delivery.     In pursuit of these results, MICT leadership, management and staff shall live and uphold the  following core values namely:    1. Helpfulness;  2. Innovation;  3. Transparency;  4. Accessibility and   5. Accountability.     The acronym for these values shall be known as “HITAA”     1.2. Governance and Management of MICT     The successful implementation of any Strategic plan requires a fit for purpose structure which   will support the operationalisation of the Strategic plan. In this regard, the Ministry is headed   by the Honourable Minister supported by a Deputy Minister. At Management level, MICT is   headed by a Permanent Secretary. Other senior positions which will provide direction and   ensure implementation of the Strategic Plan are as per fig one.  The full structure which   includes positions within the fourteen regions can be viewed at the Ministry‘s Offices.   However, it should be noted that in order to meet the demands of the evolving ICT sector, the   Ministry is in the process of reviewing the current staff structure to make it synonymous to   the mandate.         8  Ministry of Information and Communication Technology  STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22              HONORABLE MINISTER   DEPUTY MINISTER   1X PERMANENT SECRETARY 1   SECTION INTERNAL AUDITOR   1X CHIEF INTERNAL AUDITOR 6   1X INTERNAL AUDITOR 8   1X ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER 12   DIRECTORATE INFORMATION   AND COMMUNICATION   DEVELOPMENT   1X DIRECTOR 3   DIRECTORATE PRINT   MEDIA   1X DIRECTOR 3   DIRECTORATE AUDIOVISUAL   MEDIA COPYRIGHT SERVICES   AND REGIONAL OFFICES   1X DIRECTOR 3   DIVISION GENERAL   SERVICES    1X DEPUTY DIRECTOR 4   Fig.1 MICT Structure     9  Ministry of Information and Communication Technology  STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22   1.3 Linkage of MICT Strategic Plan to   National and International Agendas   One of the critical reasons for formulating and implementing Strategic plans is to ensure that   they become drivers to operationalising National and International Agendas to which Namibia   is signatory to. This reality calls for strong alignment of the Strategic Plan with the National   priorities and aspirations as well as international agendas. (See table 1for details). The table   below presents the agenda with a corresponding contributor on the side of MICT.   Table 1: Linkage of MICT Strategic Plan to National and International Agendas   Agenda Statement MICT Corresponding Contribution   Vision 2030 “A prosperous and industrialised  Namibia developed by her human  resources, enjoying peace, harmony  and political stability”.      MICT pledges its contribution through the  attainment of its vision of being ‘A catalyst for  an informed and inclusive ICT smart Namibia’. In  addition the Ministry’s  contribution will be felt  through the achievement of their strategic  objectives as outlined below:     Strategic Objective 1:   Accelerate ICT development, access and use for  an inclusive ICT smart Namibia.    Strategic Objective 2.  Enhance unhindered access to information for  an informed nation.     Strategic Objectives 3.  Promote Namibia as a preferred film destination.     Strategic Objective 4:   Enhance an enabling environment for a high  performance culture and effective service  delivery.

To this end the   CORE VALUES |How WE make a difference…   Helpfulness   Providing a   courteous and   helpful service   which is run to   suit the   convenience for   those entitled   to the service   Innovation   Using ICTs   creatively as an   enabler for   service delivery   Transparency   Openly, timely   and accurately   provide   government   information   services to our   customers   Accessibility   To enhance the   quality of being   able to be   reached or easy   to obtain or   used and easily   understood   Accountability   Accepting our   responsibilities   and   consequences   for our actions   The ministry   has declared     13  Ministry of Information and Communication Technology  STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22   MICT identified the Strategic issues listed and described below. There are other   challenges which were identified and can be resolved by the existing structure.    Slow pace of ICT development, access and use. This issue is propelled by   many factors including; the absence of sufficient ICT Research and   Development (R&D) in the country; lack of mechanisms for consolidation of   all ICT services to empower the nation; inadequate measures/ tools to   enforce proper regulations on affordability of ICT products and services;   lack of mechanism and awareness on the effects of cybercrime and   extremism will receive attention in the Strategic Plan period in the form of   an electronic cyber bill; and insufficient efforts to position and market   Namibia as a preferred regional ICT hub.    The ICT and Information service sector is faced with a shortage of   expertise. Graduates from universities and colleges around the country do   not meet the required skilled for the market.    Inadequate measure to strengthen Public Private Partnership (PPP). PPP is   critical recipe to accelerate ICT development and improve information   service delivery, especially in developing and disseminating local content.   Similarly achievement of the strategic objectives of the Ministry will also   require strengthening stakeholder relationships including Ministerial   coordination.    Loopholes and fragmentation of policies and laws. Inconsistencies of   legislations leading to corrupt practices. Luck of initiatives to harmonise   policies and laws.    Negative effects of natural disasters. The environmental hazards have a   direct and critical bearing in the development of the sector, example floods.    Limited access and availability of insufficient information. This issue is   caused by many factors: inadequate understanding on GRN programmes   and projects; limited access to public information; and inadequate measure   to make information easily accessible in all languages at grassroots level.    Prevailing operational challenges. These include: outdated structure that is   not aligned to the current mandate; no mechanism in place to monitor and   evaluate service delivery; lack of incentives to attract technical staff;   insufficient organisational culture; inadequate financial and human   resources for Mandate execution; high staff turnover; mismatch of skills;   and ever changing technology effecting the structure.    Lack of ownership and national pride.     14  Ministry of Information and Communication Technology  STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22   Prior to Namibia's independence on 21 March 1990, Namibian people were   divided into homelands based on their ethnic and tribal orientation. A   legacy that was imprinted in the minds of Namibians, thus robbing them of   their sense of common identity and loyalty to a single state. As the   custodian of the Nationhood and National Pride programme, the Ministry   therefore has the responsibility to reinforce the message of unity and   national pride in order to ensure that citizens take ownership and   contribute to the achievement of Vision 2030. In addition it is important that   the Namibians tell their stories the Namibian way.    Negative effects of world economic crisis on Namibia economy.    This issue, although by nature an external factor which   is outside the control of the Ministry, does impact   negatively on Namibia’s economic growth and in turn on   financial resources which are required to execute the   programmes and projects.    4. Our Strategic Objectives  In order to attain its vision the ministry’s Strategic Plan puts   forth four (4) high-level Strategic Objectives/ Strategies which   will be used to overcome the Strategic issues outlined above.    4.1.

Situational Analysis     A number of processes were used to analyze the current situation. Among others was the SWOT, PESTLE and   Stakeholder analysis. The purpose of conducting the analysis was to identify Strategic issues which then formed the   foundation for Strategic pillars and Strategic objectives. Each of these analyses is further described below;   7.1. SWOT Analysis   SWOT Analysis is a useful framework for analyzing an organization's strengths and weaknesses, and the   opportunities and threats that the organization faces. In this regard it will help MICT focus on its strengths; overcome   weaknesses minimize threats, and take the greatest possible advantage of opportunities available to it. MICT   presents its SWOT below:   STRENGTHS WEAKNESSES  • Modern ICT tools (computers, network access, regional  connectivity, tablets, cell phones, digital and still cameras)   • Supportive leadership and strategic direction  •  Ability to implement directives  • Availability of a Customer Service Charter   • Decentralized print and audio visual functions to all 14  regional councils  • Experienced and competent staff in key positions  • Ability to provide state of the art studio equipment   • National ICT laws and policies in place  • Relatively young staff   • Strong relationship with stakeholders and partners  • Ability to cover events where media houses can’t reach  • Ability to build capacity  • Ability to disseminate information   • Functional up to date website   • Outdated structure that is not aligned to the current mandate  • Procrastination, lack of accountability and non-committal  leading to  low performance  • Lack of one ministerial building which hampers efficiency  • Non usage of Electronic Data Record Management System  • Low level understanding of Performance Management System  • Poor directorate and inter-directorate support and information  sharing  • Lack of direction and accountability from some managers   • Need to make information easily accessible in all languages at  grassroots level   • Lack of support for the establishment of community media and  development  • Lack of reading culture  • No mechanism in place to monitor and evaluate   service delivery  • Lack of incentives to attract technical staff   • Lack of organizational culture     S  S   Internal  Factor   W     21  Ministry of Information and Communication Technology  STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22   OPPORTUNITIES THREATS  • Market gap for the development of mobile application,  social media platforms and local content.   • The demand on the use of websites and social media to  interact and share information on development and GRN  policies with the public by all O/M/As.   • Paperless campaign type of work country wide.   • Provision of information to the public on the identified  media platforms   • Namibia enjoys peace and political stability; Peace is not  only a reality, but a Namibian value    • Attained gateway status of technological advancement to  landlocked SADC neighbors  • Namibia considers environmental impacts with regards to  policies and programs on film tourism and ICT infrastructure   • Inadequate financial and human resources for Mandate execution  • Legislations with loopholes leading to corrupt practices    • Negative effects of natural disasters   • High staff turnover   • Negative effects  of world economic crisis on Namibia economy  • Rural-urban disparity in ICT and information service provision  • Low ICT literacy levels  • Mismatch of skills   • Need for harmonization of policies and laws   • Ever changing technology has an effect on the structure   • Graduates that are not ready and skilled for the job market                                External  Factor   O  T   Positive  Negative     22  Ministry of Information and Communication Technology  STRATEGIC PLAN 2017 - 22   7.2. Stakeholder Analysis   A Stakeholder is anybody/organization that can affect or is affected by the organization’s   strategy, programs and or projects. Stakeholders can either be internal or external. By   implication they influence the success or failure of an institution. They need to be identified,   their needs and their role mapped out. Equally it is important for MICT to inform the   stakeholders on how they can contribute to its success. To this end the table below presents   MICT’s key stakeholders.It is therefore imperative that the Ministry shall collaborate with all   its Stakeholders in pursuit of being, ‘A catalyst for an informed and inclusive ICT smart   Namibia’. (See table 2 for details)    Table 2: Key stakeholders’ expectations and needs are presented in the table below:   Key  Stakeholders   What they want from you               (Expectations)    What you need from them that will  enhance execution of your strategy?

Critical Success Factors     Critical success factor (CSF) is a Management term for an element that is necessary for an   organization to attain its vision. It is a critical factor or activity required for ensuring the   success of an organization. The Ministry of Information and Technology therefore identified   the following factors as critical for the successful implementation of the 2017/18-2021/22   Strategic Plan.       Critical Success Factor Description   1. Leadership,  Commitment and  Ownership:   In order to achieve what it sets out in this Strategic Plan, MICT needs  to inspire its officials and make them feel valued. This requires a  committed leadership team with leadership styles focusing on  providing guidance, developing mutual trust, motivating, and  inspiring all staff members to have the desire and commitment  necessary to execute the Ministerial Strategic Plan successfully.    2.

Chapter 5. Risks in case of execution of the State program The solution of tasks of the State program is performed by forming and accomplishment of complex of scientific, technical and organizational actions. In case of implementation of the State program as risks which can influence negatively achievement of target indicators of the State program in general and subprogrammes, are considered as the external factors which are not depending on participants of implementation of the State program, and internal, created during its accomplishment. Internal factors can be fully or partially eliminated. As external and internal factors are considered: the reducing the amount of financing caused, for example, by results of impact on economy of the Republic of Belarus of the economic or political processes happening in the world; inflationary tendencies; reorganization of the customer during implementation of the State program; impossibility of the choice of the contractor owing to mismatch of requirements of the customer and proposals of potential contractors; unsatisfactory condition of staffing of the customer in the field of informatization; other factors revealed by participants of implementation of the State program during its accomplishment. These risks belong to all subprogrammes of the State program. Quantitative taking note of risk is performed by introduction in calculation formula of efficiency of accomplishment of tasks of subprogrammes of the State program in reporting year of coefficient of K considering extent of influence of external and internal factors of risk on achievement of planned value of target indicator. The procedure for its calculation is given in Chapter 6 of the State program. The approach to accounting of risk factors stated in Chapter 6 of the State program will allow to minimize their influence on efficiency of accomplishment of subprogrammes and the State program in general. Chapter 6. Technique of efficiency evaluation of the State program The efficiency evaluation of implementation of the State program is performed based on the analysis of accomplishment of actions, subprogrammes and the State program in general taking into account the actual accomplishment of the actions reached values of summary target indicators and target indicators, and also development of the allocated financial resources. In case of determination of planned quantitative values of summary target indicators and target indicators of the State program and its subprogrammes the current status of objects of informatization, the existing requirements and possibilities of their enhancement and upgrade, world tendencies in the field of ICT, effective objectives and tasks were considered. The actual values of the specified indicators characterize the current results achieved during the course of performance complex of actions of the State program and its subprogrammes. The main sources of receipt of data on accomplishment of summary target and target indicators of the State program are the departmental reporting, the statistical, accounting and financial reporting, administrative information. Data collection is performed by annually responsible customer and customers of the State program. Assessment of the current efficiency of implementation of the State program is made in several stages and comes down to comparison of actually reached values of summary target indicator, target indicators for the corresponding period with their planned values. At the first stage assessment of results of accomplishment of tasks of subprogrammes of the State program based on determination of degree of the solution of each of them on formula is made where Et - efficiency of accomplishment of task of the subprogramme of the State program in reporting year; n - quantity of target indicators on task of the subprogramme of the State program; - the actual i-go value of target indicator of task of the subprogramme of the State program in reporting year; 05/10/2022, 16:14Resolution of Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus \"Abo…tate program of development of digital economy and information\" Page 4 of 6 - planned i-go value of target indicator of task of the subprogramme of the State program in reporting year; Ki - the coefficient considering extent of influence of external and internal factors of risk on achievement of planned value of target indicator. It is necessary to consider that when evaluating efficiency of the solution of task of the subprogramme of the State program in numerator calculations for target indicators which values in reporting year are equal to zero are not made, however their total quantity in denominator is considered. Value of coefficient Ki is determined by calculation of the relation of difference of planned and actual parameter values characterizing the course of accomplishment of the State program on which the significant effect, to its planned value in reporting year appears risk factor: where Ki - the coefficient considering extent of influence of external and internal factors of risk on achievement of planned value of target indicator; - the actual parameter value which changes owing to risk factor action, led to variation of the actual i-go value of target indicator of task of the subprogramme of the State program from its planned value in reporting year; - planned parameter value on which risk factor can exert impact. At the same time in case of identification of simultaneous influence on achievement of planned value of target indicator of two and more risk factors value of coefficient Ki is determined as the amount of the coefficients considering influence of each factor for calculation of their cumulative impact. If the received Et value: it is more or equally in 0,9, that solution of task in reporting year is considered executed with outstanding performance; is in the range from 0,9 to 0,8, that solution of task of the subprogramme in reporting year is considered executed effectively; is in the range from 0,8 to 0,65, that solution of task of the subprogramme in reporting year is considered executed well; it is less than 0,65, that the course of accomplishment of task of the subprogramme in reporting year is considered unsatisfactory. At the second stage the efficiency evaluation of accomplishment of subprogrammes of the State program based on determination of degree of the solution of the tasks set in each subprogramme on formula is performed where - efficiency of accomplishment of the subprogramme of the State program in reporting year; m - quantity of tasks in the subprogramme of the State program; - efficiency of accomplishment of j-y of task of the subprogramme of the State program in reporting year. If the received Epp value: it is more or equally to 0,9, that the subprogramme is executed in reporting year with outstanding performance; is in the range from 0,9 to 0,8, that accomplishment of the subprogramme in reporting year is considered effective; is in the range from 0,8 to 0,65, that accomplishment of the subprogramme in reporting year is considered satisfactory; it is less than 0,65, that the course of accomplishment of the subprogramme in reporting year is considered unsatisfactory. At the final stage the efficiency of accomplishment of the State program in general in reporting year proceeding from efficiency of accomplishment of its subprogrammes and summary target indicators characterizing goal achievement of the State program calculated on formula is evaluated 05/10/2022, 16:14Resolution of Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus \"Abo…tate program of development of digital economy and information\" Page 5 of 6 where Ep - efficiency of accomplishment of the State program; k - number of subprogrammes of the State program; d - quantity of summary target indicators of the State program; - efficiency of accomplishment of the subprogramme of the State program in reporting year; - the actual value of summary target indicator of the State program in reporting year; - planned value of summary target indicator of the State program in reporting year. If the received Ep value: it is more or equally to 0,9, that the State program is executed in reporting year with outstanding performance; is in the range from 0,9 to 0,8, that accomplishment of the State program in reporting year is considered effective; is in the range from 0,8 to 0,65, that accomplishment of the State program in reporting year is considered satisfactory; it is less than 0,65, that the course of accomplishment of the State program in reporting year is considered unsatisfactory. Efficiency of accomplishment of the State program for the entire period is evaluated proceeding from efficiency of its realization in every year and calculated by formula where E - efficiency of accomplishment of the State program for the entire period of realization; z - number of years of implementation of the State program; - efficiency of accomplishment of the State program in year of q. If the received value E: it is more or equally to 0,9, that the State program is executed with outstanding performance for the entire period of realization; there is in the range from 0,9 to 0,8, that the State program is considered the realization executed effectively for the entire period; is in the range from 0,8 to 0,65, that accomplishment of the State program for the entire period of realization is considered satisfactory; it is less than 0,65, that the State program is considered the realization executed unsatisfactorily for the entire period.

It is necessary to consider that when evaluating efficiency of the solution of task of the subprogramme of the State program in numerator calculations for target indicators which values in reporting year are equal to zero are not made, however their total quantity in denominator is considered.  Value of coefficient Ki is determined by calculation of the relation of difference of planned and actual parameter values characterizing the course of accomplishment of the State program on which the significant effect, to its planned value in reporting year appears risk factor:  where Ki - the coefficient considering extent of influence of external and internal factors of risk on achievement of planned value of target indicator;  - the actual parameter value which changes owing to risk factor action, led to variation of the actual i-go value of  target indicator of task of the subprogramme of the State program from its planned value in reporting year;  - planned parameter value on which risk factor can exert impact.  At the same time in case of identification of simultaneous influence on achievement of planned value of target indicator of two and more risk factors value of coefficient Ki is determined as the amount of the coefficients considering influence of each factor for calculation of their cumulative impact.  If the received Et value:  it is more or equally in 0,9, that solution of task in reporting year is considered executed with outstanding performance;  is in the range from 0,9 to 0,8, that solution of task of the subprogramme in reporting year is considered executed effectively;  is in the range from 0,8 to 0,65, that solution of task of the subprogramme in reporting year is considered executed well;  it is less than 0,65, that the course of accomplishment of task of the subprogramme in reporting year is considered unsatisfactory.  At the second stage the efficiency evaluation of accomplishment of subprogrammes of the State program based on determination of degree of the solution of the tasks set in each subprogramme on formula is performed  where - efficiency of accomplishment of the subprogramme of the State program in reporting year;  m - quantity of tasks in the subprogramme of the State program;  - efficiency of accomplishment of j-y of task of the subprogramme of the State program in reporting year.  If the received Epp value:  it is more or equally to 0,9, that the subprogramme is executed in reporting year with outstanding performance;  is in the range from 0,9 to 0,8, that accomplishment of the subprogramme in reporting year is considered effective;  is in the range from 0,8 to 0,65, that accomplishment of the subprogramme in reporting year is considered satisfactory;  it is less than 0,65, that the course of accomplishment of the subprogramme in reporting year is considered unsatisfactory.  At the final stage the efficiency of accomplishment of the State program in general in reporting year proceeding from efficiency of accomplishment of its subprogrammes and summary target indicators characterizing goal achievement of the State program calculated on formula is evaluated    05/10/2022, 16:14Resolution of Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus \"Abo…tate program of development of digital economy and information...\"  Page 5 of 6https://cis-legislation.com/document.fwx?rgn=85202  where Ep - efficiency of accomplishment of the State program;  k - number of subprogrammes of the State program;  d - quantity of summary target indicators of the State program;  - efficiency of accomplishment of the subprogramme of the State program in reporting year;  - the actual value of summary target indicator of the State program in reporting year;  - planned value of summary target indicator of the State program in reporting year.  If the received Ep value:  it is more or equally to 0,9, that the State program is executed in reporting year with outstanding performance;  is in the range from 0,9 to 0,8, that accomplishment of the State program in reporting year is considered effective;  is in the range from 0,8 to 0,65, that accomplishment of the State program in reporting year is considered satisfactory;  it is less than 0,65, that the course of accomplishment of the State program in reporting year is considered unsatisfactory.  Efficiency of accomplishment of the State program for the entire period is evaluated proceeding from efficiency of its realization in every year and calculated by formula  where E - efficiency of accomplishment of the State program for the entire period of realization;  z - number of years of implementation of the State program;  - efficiency of accomplishment of the State program in year of q.  If the received value E:  it is more or equally to 0,9, that the State program is executed with outstanding performance for the entire period of realization;  there is in the range from 0,9 to 0,8, that the State program is considered the realization executed effectively for the entire period;  is in the range from 0,8 to 0,65, that accomplishment of the State program for the entire period of realization is considered satisfactory;  it is less than 0,65, that the State program is considered the realization executed unsatisfactorily for the entire period.  Chapter 7. Subprogramme 1 \"Information and communication infrastructure\"  Accomplishment of the main actions of the subprogramme \"National information and communication infrastructure the\" of the National program of the accelerated development of services in the field of information and communication technologies for 2011-2015 approved by the resolution of Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus of March 28, 2011 No. 384 (The national register of legal acts of the Republic of Belarus, 2011, 38, 5/33546), creation of modern infrastructure basis for the organization of information exchange between all participants of economic processes allowed to provide No.: society, business, state.  In the annual report of MSE \"Measurement of Information Society\" following the results of 2014 on index of development of ICT the Republic of Belarus took the final 36th place from 167. Belarus is noted by the international experts as one of ten economies of the world with the greatest changes on the indicators of access of ICT reflecting technological level of development of modern infrastructure in the country.  By estimates of the Commission of MSE on development of broadband access, for the beginning of 2015 the Republic of Belarus takes the 25th position by the number of subscribers of stationary broadband access (28,8 on 100 inhabitants) and 23rd line item by quantity of the households having access to the Internet (57,1 on 100 households), among 195    05/10/2022, 16:14Resolution of Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus \"Abo…tate program of development of digital economy and information...\"  Page 6 of 6https://cis-legislation.com/document.fwx?rgn=85202  countries which participated in research.  Development of national IKI in 2016-2020 will happen in the conditions of further rapid growth of information needs of society and economy, integration into the international information space, further convergence of networks to gradual substitution of the traditional services of telecommunication by services based on the IP protocol provided atop traditional networks of telecommunication (OTT-services) with gradual transition to provision of such services based on cloud platforms and technologies.  The priority directions of development of national IKI are:  development of stationary broadband access taking into account use of modern technologies of the organization of access which technological basis are development of multiservice networks of telecommunication and construction of infrastructure with use of fiber-optic communication links.

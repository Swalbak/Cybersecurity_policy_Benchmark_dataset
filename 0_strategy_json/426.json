Whether you are at home, in the workplace, or out with friends, chances are there is an app on your phone, computer, or even fridge that seeks to improve your experience. To bring about this revolution, industries from around the world have transformed their business models, investing heavily in information technology. Similarly, in line with the Digital Government Strategy1, the NSW Government is working tirelessly to harness digital technologies to help streamline its services and operations. We see digital transformation as a means of optimising the use of public resources and enabling our government to focus on the citizen experience. Notwithstanding the tremendous benefits brought by the digital era, we must also address growing risks. Advanced malicious cyber activity against Australian national and economic interests is increasing in frequency, scale, sophistication and severity2. With this in mind, the NSW Cyber Security Strategy has been developed to guide and inform the safe management of government’s growing cyber footprint. The Strategy outlines a risk-based approach that will play an important role in safeguarding citizen data and critical government services. Importantly, the Strategy is supported by $20 million in government funding which will allow for the effective delivery of its initiatives. This Strategy takes its place alongside Australia’s Cyber Security Strategy3 and the NSW Cyber Security Industry Development Strategy driven by the NSW Department of Industry4. Developing strong cyber capabilities that scale with our ambitious digital agenda, will be key to our success. By investing in cyber security today, we are enabling the NSW Government to accelerate digital transformation while providing confidence to citizens who trust us with their data and services. 1 2 Australian Cyber Security Centre 2017 Threat Report Report_2017.pdf 3 Australia’s Cyber Security Strategy: Enabling innovation, growth and prosperity  4 In development. The Hon. Victor Dominello, Minister for Finance, Services and Property Minister’s foreword 3NSW Cyber Security Strategy | A cyber safe NSW: connected, protected and trusted “ Effective cyber security, robust risk controls and strong information management are central to maintaining the confidence and trust of our customers. From individual transactions to critical information sharing across agencies, a strong framework for managing information security and cyber risks is a pre-requisite for any modern digital government.” NSW Digital Government Strategy 4NSW Cyber Security Strategy | A cyber safe NSW: connected, protected and trusted The cyber security imperative Focus on risk Definition Cyber security: actions required to preclude unauthorised use of, denial of service to, modifications to, disclosure of, loss of revenue from, or destruction of critical systems or informational assets5. As the NSW Government leads the way on streamlined digital service delivery, we must also increase cyber resilience and invest to protect against cyber threats. A priority remains to reduce the impact of cyber attacks which may have a cascading effect on the lives of citizens and the functioning of our critical infrastructure. Recent years have seen a deterioration in the global cyber security environment with a notable increase in political hacktivism, espionage, sabotage, and financially driven cyber crime. The Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) has identified an increase in diverse and innovative attempts to compromise government networks, along with foreign states increasing their level of investment in offensive cyber capabilities6. The ransomware criminal economy grew by more than 2,500 per cent between 2016 and 20177. There are predictions that cyber crime damages will cost the world $6 trillion annually by 2021 from $3 trillion in 20158. Global ransomware damage costs are predicted to climb from $5 billion in 2017 to $11.5 billion in 20199. Cyber attacks increasingly exploit human vulnerabilities and organisational failings rather than purely gaps in security technology. In 2017, the first NSW Government Chief Information Security Officer (GCISO) was appointed to build whole-of-government cyber security capabilities and standards. Since being established, the GCISO has laid the foundations for the whole-of-government cyber security practice, providing basic coordination and support for agencies and a single point-of-contact for the receipt and sharing of cyber security information across NSW Government. The Cyber Security Senior Officers Group (CSSOG) has been established to provide for whole-of-government decision-making for cyber security. Members represent the key business owners of cyber risk from across NSW Government. The group’s focus is on supporting the GCISO in minimising the impact of cyber risk to NSW (citizens, business and government agencies) and integrating cyber risk into the emergency management and counter terrorism frameworks. 5 International Standard: IEC/TS 62443-1-1 ed. 1.0 6 Australian Cyber Security Centre 2017 Threat Report  Report_2017.pdf 7 The Ransomware Economy (October 2017): Carbon Black Report  uploads/2017/10/Carbon-Black-Ransomware-Economy-Report-101117.pdf 8 9 An integrated approach to preventing and responding to cyber security threats across NSW safeguarding our information, assets, services and citizens secure • integrated • responsive • holistic 5NSW Cyber Security Strategy | A cyber safe NSW: connected, protected and trusted Figure 1 NSW cyber security organisational context Cyber security is a global concern and requires engagement across jurisdictions and sectors including Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments, industry and research organisations.

Ensuring a cyber safe NSW is critical to realising this plan. The NSW Cyber Security Strategy is targeted at meeting the needs of government, business and citizens for connected, protected and trusted services and infrastructure. Principles of cyber security in NSW Government Secure Government systems are secure and resilient to evolving cyber incidents. Non-negotiable minimum security standards are applied across the sector. Our approach is risk-based with an emphasis on securing high impact information and services. Integrated Agencies coordinate and collaborate with other agencies, jurisdictions and the private sector within a federated framework, acknowledging that they are interdependent and cannot operate in isolation. Security is not an afterthought, but is integrated into all ICT assurance processes to ensure that our systems are secure-by-design. Responsive Agency capability is lifted through collaboration, training and support. Strong and agile teams are embedded across the sector to ensure timely response to cyber threats and incidents. Holistic Our technical and human capabilities are interconnected and interdependent. From a cyber risk perspective, they operate as one system. We have a ‘joined-up’ mindset, recognising that everyone takes responsibility for cyber security. This requires deep collaborative relationships across sectors and jurisdictions. The NSW Cyber Security Strategy now sets the course for achieving this commitment. NSW Cyber Security Strategy A cyber safe NSW: connected, protected and trusted 7 Government Digital services and information holdings must be secured and protected from cyber criminals who are constantly trying to circumvent our cyber security controls. Departments and Agencies Must trust the integrity of the whole government network, working together with confidence that their systems and data remain secure in an increasingly interconnected environment. Businesses Need assurance that the data they entrust to government will be protected and used appropriately. They also rely on critical services and infrastructure which government must ensure are secure and highly available. Citizens Provide sensitive and personal information to government. This information must be protected. They also depend upon critical services. These services must be secure, trusted and highly available. Figure 2 NSW cyber security framework Our framework provides themes and actions for realising the vision of a cyber safe NSW. The framework draws on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Framework10 which consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cyber security-related risk. Each theme within the framework is supported by actions which will deliver continual improvement across the whole of NSW Government. 10 NSW Government cyber security framework Lead Cooperation and communication across agencies and jurisdictions, nationally and internationally, and across public and private sectors to effectively meet the challenge of an interconnected and global cyber environment. Prepare A cyber aware culture based on a risk management approach. Prevent Processes, controls and well-trained staff are in place to reduce the likelihood and harm of cyber disruption. Detect Effective, up-to-date monitoring technology and threat intelligence, alert  and advice sharing. Respond Clear protocols, roles, responsibilities and regular practice ensure efficient and effective action in the event of a cyber incident. Recover When a cyber attack causes disruption, the extent, harm and duration are minimised and government returns rapidly to business as usual. A cyber safe NSW: connected, protected and trusted 8NSW Cyber Security Strategy NSW Government agencies all have a role to play in ensuring a cyber safe NSW. Individual agencies are responsible for maintaining security of their own systems, services and infrastructure. The GCISO provides coordination, advice and threat intelligence. Law enforcement agencies conduct investigations and provide victim support. NSW Department of Industry and TAFE NSW provide industry and skills development. Responsibilities of NSW Government agencies 9NSW Cyber Security Strategy | A cyber safe NSW: connected, protected and trusted NSW citizens and businesses Figure 3  Cyber security responsibilities of NSW Government agencies Cyber security industry growth Support for self-protection (Small Business Commissioner) Skills development (TAFE NSW) Protection from cyber crime and cyber terrorism activities (Justice & NSW Police) Investigations and victim support (NSW Police) Support on handling physical impacts of incidents (emergency services) Health Justice Industry Planning FACS Finance Premier Transport Education Treasury GCISO Government Chief Information Security Officer provides expert advice for whole- of-government cyber security Departments and agencies are responsible for their own disaster recovery and business continuity. Effective, holistic cyber security is achieved through a strong sense of mutual responsibility between government, business, industry, researchers and the public. If each is empowered and able to fulfil its role, the security of the entire community is enhanced. Accordingly, the GCISO is working across NSW Government agencies to lift cyber security capability in the public sector. NSW Government NSW law enforcement and emergency response Coordination between the GCISO, NSW police force and the State Emergency Operations Centre (SEOC) will be essential for an effective response to a serious cyber security incident, particularly if there is an impact on critical infrastructure. Similarly, the State Counter Terrorism Committee (SCTC), which coordinates terrorism-related policy, and the State Emergency Management Committee (SEMC), which provides crisis response capabilities, will work closely with the GCISO. Infrastructure NSW The GCISO is collaborating with Infrastructure NSW in accordance with the State Infrastructure Strategy to ensure Internet of Things (IoT) devices have cyber security risk assessments built in as part of a comprehensive assurance process. A secure by-design approach for new infrastructure initiatives and developments will be adopted in accordance with standards set by the GCISO. NSW Department of Industry Through a complementary Cyber Security Industry Development Strategy, NSW Government is helping to enable innovation and encourage NSW cyber security entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized enterprises to establish and grow. Commonwealth Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) NSW Government, through the GCISO, is connected with Commonwealth cyber threat intelligence feeds and ensures all threat and intelligence information shared by the ACSC (including CERT, the national computer emergency response team) is appropriately distributed to all relevant stakeholders within NSW. Joint Cyber Security Centre (JCSC) A key initiative of the Australian Government’s Cyber Security Strategy, NSW Government is participating in the Joint Cyber Security Centre (JCSC) by co-locating staff from the GCISO to ensure sensitive information, including actionable cyber threat intelligence, is shared quickly between and among partners, including leading private sector organisations. Through the Sydney JCSC, a common understanding of the cyber security environment and optimal mitigation options will be achieved through sharing and analysis of incidents, threats and risks. Collaboration with partners and stakeholders 10NSW Cyber Security Strategy | A cyber safe NSW: connected, protected and trusted Academia and Research Data61 NSW Government has partnered with CSIRO’s Data61, Australia’s leading data innovation group, to develop solutions for the top technology challenges facing NSW Government. These include cyber security, privacy, data sharing and enhancing skills and capabilities in the public sector. NSW Cyber Security Network The NSW Cyber Security Network brings together leading scientists and engineers from seven of the state’s universities to protect government, industry and individuals against cyberattacks. Through the network, NSW Government will identify solutions to emerging cyber security challenges, train specialist graduates and develop a skilled cyber security workforce. It will also provide industry with strategic and operational advice on cyber security threats. Cyber Security Cooperative Research Centre (CRC) The CRC is charged with delivering advancements that will build Australia’s cyber security capability and deliver solutions to ensure the safety of Australians and Australian businesses online.

Each theme  within the framework is supported by  actions which will deliver continual  improvement across the whole of  NSW Government.  10 www.nist.gov/cyberframework  NSW Government cyber security framework  Lead Cooperation and communication across agencies and jurisdictions, nationally   and internationally, and across public and private sectors to effectively meet   the challenge of an interconnected and global cyber environment.  Prepare A cyber aware culture based on a risk management approach.  Prevent Processes, controls and well-trained staff are in place to reduce the likelihood  and harm of cyber disruption.  Detect Effective, up-to-date monitoring technology and threat intelligence, alert   and advice sharing.  Respond Clear protocols, roles, responsibilities and regular practice ensure efficient and  effective action in the event of a cyber incident.  Recover When a cyber attack causes disruption, the extent, harm and duration are  minimised and government returns rapidly to business as usual.  A cyber safe NSW: connected, protected and trusted 8NSW Cyber Security Strategy    NSW Government agencies all have a role to play in ensuring a cyber safe NSW. Individual agencies are  responsible for maintaining security of their own systems, services and infrastructure. The GCISO provides  coordination, advice and threat intelligence. Law enforcement agencies conduct investigations and  provide victim support. NSW Department of Industry and TAFE NSW provide industry and skills development.  Responsibilities of NSW Government agencies  9NSW Cyber Security Strategy | A cyber safe NSW: connected, protected and trusted  NSW citizens  and businesses  Figure 3   Cyber security responsibilities of   NSW Government agencies  Cyber security industry growth  Support for self-protection  (Small Business Commissioner)  Skills development (TAFE NSW)  Protection from cyber crime  and cyber terrorism activities   (Justice & NSW Police)  Investigations and victim  support (NSW Police)  Support on handling  physical impacts of incidents   (emergency services)  Health Justice Industry Planning  FACS Finance Premier Transport  Education Treasury  GCISO Government   Chief Information  Security Officer  provides expert   advice for whole- of-government  cyber security  Departments   and agencies    are responsible for  their own disaster   recovery and   business continuity.    Effective, holistic cyber security is achieved through a strong sense of mutual responsibility between  government, business, industry, researchers and the public. If each is empowered and able to fulfil its  role, the security of the entire community is enhanced. Accordingly, the GCISO is working across NSW  Government agencies to lift cyber security capability in the public sector.  NSW Government NSW law enforcement and  emergency response  Coordination between the GCISO, NSW  police force and the State Emergency  Operations Centre (SEOC) will be essential  for an effective response to a serious cyber  security incident, particularly if there is an  impact on critical infrastructure. Similarly, the  State Counter Terrorism Committee (SCTC),  which coordinates terrorism-related policy, and  the State Emergency Management Committee  (SEMC), which provides crisis response  capabilities, will work closely with the GCISO.  Infrastructure NSW  The GCISO is collaborating with  Infrastructure NSW in accordance with the  State Infrastructure Strategy to ensure  Internet of Things (IoT) devices have cyber  security risk assessments built in as part of  a comprehensive assurance process.  A secure by-design approach for new  infrastructure initiatives and developments will  be adopted in accordance with standards set  by the GCISO.  NSW Department of Industry  Through a complementary Cyber Security  Industry Development Strategy, NSW  Government is helping to enable innovation  and encourage NSW cyber security  entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized  enterprises to establish and grow.  Commonwealth Australian Cyber Security  Centre (ACSC)  NSW Government, through the GCISO, is  connected with Commonwealth cyber threat  intelligence feeds and ensures all threat and  intelligence information shared by the ACSC  (including CERT, the national computer  emergency response team) is appropriately  distributed to all relevant stakeholders  within NSW.  Joint Cyber Security Centre (JCSC)  A key initiative of the Australian Government’s  Cyber Security Strategy, NSW Government  is participating in the Joint Cyber Security  Centre (JCSC) by co-locating staff from  the GCISO to ensure sensitive information,  including actionable cyber threat intelligence,  is shared quickly between and among  partners, including leading private sector  organisations. Through the Sydney JCSC,  a common understanding of the cyber security  environment and optimal mitigation options  will be achieved through sharing and analysis  of incidents, threats and risks.  Collaboration with partners and stakeholders  10NSW Cyber Security Strategy | A cyber safe NSW: connected, protected and trusted    Academia and Research Data61  NSW Government has partnered with CSIRO’s  Data61, Australia’s leading data innovation group, to  develop solutions for the top technology challenges  facing NSW Government. These include cyber  security, privacy, data sharing and enhancing skills  and capabilities in the public sector.  NSW Cyber Security Network  The NSW Cyber Security Network brings together  leading scientists and engineers from seven of the  state’s universities to protect government, industry  and individuals against cyberattacks. Through  the network, NSW Government will identify  solutions to emerging cyber security challenges,  train specialist graduates and develop a skilled  cyber security workforce. It will also provide  industry with strategic and operational advice on  cyber security threats.  Cyber Security Cooperative  Research Centre (CRC)  The CRC is charged with delivering advancements  that will build Australia’s cyber security capability  and deliver solutions to ensure the safety of  Australians and Australian businesses online.

This strategic plan is the first that involves all SOEs operating under the Ministry of Information, Communication, Transport and Tourism Development (MICTTD). The key areas addressed and content in this includes the following: • Transportation, ports and regulatory requirements • Information and Communication Technologies and its regulatory requirements • Tourism development • Government printer • Postal services • Customer services • Registry and accounting systems The plan was designed in alignment with Te Motinnano (Government Manifesto) and the KV20 and is a guiding framework with an inclusive approach that focuses on the commercial, technical, administrative and operational issues, extending it as far as possible to look into other factors that have impact on the efficiency of the service. Of critical importance, this time are: • Expansion and improvement of sea and air ports • Improving sea and air transportation infrastructures and regulatory requirements • Improving sustainable tourism developments • Developing efficient postal and printer services • Establishment of autonomous Authorities so they focus specifically on their functions and objectives to implement MICTTD’s strategies more efficiently. Commitment from all staff of the Ministry and SOEs participating in the implementation of the plan is fundamental. We invite our development partners to work with us in good partnership to achieve our mission for better service delivery, so our vision for our country and the people in the years ahead will be realized.

The SOE’s business plans were also not included in the Ministry’s Strategic Plan 2016-2019 but remain vital for the Ministry’s strategic operations to achieve the desired goals set by Government. This new edition of the MSP has new content and has incorporated those missing links from the Ministry’s SOEs towards the overarching plan, as well it aims to promote the use of support services that the Ministry is endowed with, provided its diverse nature. The Strategic Plan sets the direction for the MICTTD and its SOEs over the next four years. It identifies a Vision, Goal, Guiding Principles and Strategic Objectives - describing what the Ministry expects to achieve and identifies Strategic Actions and Indicative Activities for implementation in order to achieve its goals. It includes Indicators and Targets as a basis for monitoring progress towards the Strategic Objectives. It also signals the need for a strong multi-sector coordination in order to effectively implement the Strategic Plan. The initial sections of the Strategic Plan outline its scope, provide some strategic context and summarises population needs administered under this Ministry in Kiribati. A Vision and Goal for the Strategic Plan are then defined, also, a set of Guiding Principles to guide decisions on implementation priorities. The Strategic Objectives and their associated Strategic Actions, Indicators and Targets form the focus of the Strategic Plan 2020-2023 and are outlined on pages 17-29. Taken together, these describe what the Ministry wants to do (the results), how it will do it (the activities to implement), and how to know when achieved (monitoring progress). Details are set out as Indicative Activities in the Implementation Plan in Annex A. The Implementation Plan can be used as a basis and tool for annual Divisions’ MOPs and can also be used by the Ministry to record and monitor for results the SOEs progresses on their business plans (SOIs). The Strategic Plan emphasises the importance of relationships, partnerships and inter-sectoral coordination and collaboration to the effective delivery of the plan. This includes relationships with domestic partners, including other Kiribati Government departments and agencies, and NGOs and community-based groups. It promotes partnership and good relationships with numerous bi-lateral and international development partners. The Strategic Plan notes specific initiatives on which the Ministry needs to work with domestic and development partners. It also promotes the use of the MICTTD’s Development Coordinating Committee (MDCC) as an effective mechanism for supporting the implementation of this Strategic Plan. 2 MICTTD’s organizational structure Figure 1: MICTTD Organizational Structure 2018 Hon Minister Permanent Secretary ICT Director Staff SIO Customer Services Marine Director Staff Aviation Director Staff Airport Director Staff Tourism Director Staff Postal Director Staff Printery GP Staff Planning Director Staff Highway DS SAS AS Account Registry HRO HR Board and Commisioners AKL CEO Staff KPA CEO Staff CCK CEO Staff BPA CEO Staff KNSL CEO Staff 2 3 Figure 2: Planned MICTTD Organizational Structure after 2019 The new organizational structure is based on reforms to improve the Ministry’s efficiency in delivering its services. Some of its core departments are transformed, to become commercial entities; Tourism, Airport, Highway and BNL (Submarine and Outer Island Telecommunications Infrastructure company). This will ease the Ministry’s budgetary constraints and will improve functions of these enterprises, especially in quality service delivery and in revenue generation.

These principles need to be reflected in all strategic actions and activities developed and implemented. The principles can also be used to guide decisions on implementation priorities. Table 1: Guiding principles that guide the Ministry and SOE’s strategic plan Guiding Principles Relevant and appropriate Do the proposed strategies and activities reflect the people and the Government’s needs and will the activities undertaken meet those needs? Sustainable Are the proposed strategies and activities sustainable in Kiribati? Effective Are the proposed strategies and activities likely to be effective in Kiribati? Efficient Are the proposed strategies and activities likely to be efficient in Kiribati? Outcome oriented Do the strategies and activities have clear links to the Mission and Vision of the Ministry? Realistic Are the outcomes and targets realistic? Coordinated Are the proposed strategies and activities well-coordinated with relevant stakeholders and partners? 6 Introduction The Strategic Plan 2020-2023 sets the direction for the MICTTD and its SOE’s activities. It identifies the results that the Ministry wants to achieve in the four years (strategic objectives), and what undertakings needed in order to achieve these results (strategic actions), and also how progress will be measured (indicators and targets). The Strategic Plan is informed by the KV20, which examines the needs of Government and the ability of the system to respond to those needs. The connection of the strategies to the higher level national policy is shown in figure 3. The alignment of each and every activity by the Ministry’s Divisions and SOEs to the overarching National Policy (KV20) are imperative - that these activities are geared towards those targets in the longer-term plan. 5 Figure 3: Elements of the Strategic Plan The Ministry SMT and SOE management have participated in the development of the Strategic Plan. The Strategic Plan sets the overall framework of actions on the objectives. It is intended to be a living strategy plan that may be further developed and refined over its lifetime to reflect changing conditions, including emerging priorities and needs, availability of funding, or for further development or modification of Ministry strategies, policies and plans for specific programme or service areas. A more practical approach (outcome oriented) is needed to deliver outputs, so the aim of this plan is to paint a clearer picture of what each entity is programmed to do within the four-years or the medium term. These strategies or activities are within the guiding principles, the emphasis that these activities will be sustainable and realistic. Also, the plan aims to focus on the outcome and desires effective mechanisms to solve issues and problems. 7 Strategic Context The strategies and activities in this plan links with the KV20. The previous KPIs reflect the KDP 2016-2019 indicators, to enable progress monitoring and evaluation for each KPI. It will be the same for this Plan with the new KDP 2020-2023. Pillar 1 and 3 of the KV20 set out three core issues. I. The need to develop sustainable tourism II. The need to improve air, sea and land transportation and infrastructures III. The need to improve ICT and communications. Kiribati Vision 20 (KV20) Kiribati Development Plan (KDP) Ministry and SOEs Strategic Plan - Strategic objectives - Strategic Actions Ministry MOP and SOE Statement of Intent Indicators and Targets inputs activities outputs policies outcomes 6 The Ministry will effectively deliver its core services if the supporting services are functioning efficiently. These include; I. The ongoing need for human resource capacity building II. Provision of quality Government printery services III. The need for efficient postal services IV. Improvement of accounts and registry systems V. Improved customer service delivery VI. Establishment of Authorities or commercial entities to focus specifically on their functions and objectives to implement MICTTD’s strategies more efficiently. Figure 4: MICTTD Core Objectives and Support Services Therefore, this strategic plan also focuses on the need to strengthen supporting services to complete the strategic objectives. During the consultations with the Ministry’s Divisions and SOEs, the main discovery and a profound strategy by itself, to address the issues spelt under the KV20 and the KDP, is the efficient and effective supporting services that will drive the rest of those objectives to the targets in the overarching plan. Table 2 identifies issues and strategies from the KV20 and aligning these issues with the Ministry’s supporting services identified. 7 Table 2: Issues and strategies identified Issues Strategies • The need to develop sustainable tourism • Developing sustainable tourism • Improved marketing, promotion, and public awareness of the tourism industry • The need to improve air, sea and land transportation, and infrastructures • To improve air, land and sea transport infrastructure • Human capacity to operate new Government infrastructure to quality standards • To harmonize infrastructural development for tourism • The need to improve ICT and communication services. • To develop and improve ICT infrastructure and services • The need to strengthen supporting services; Human Resources, Printery, Postal, Accounts, Registry and customer services. • To strengthen supporting services; Human Resources, printery, postal, accounts, registry and customer services. • Establish new authorities or commercial entities to deliver needed services for the public and focus on MICTTD’s targets. 8 Situational Analysis The MICTTD is the most diverse Ministry administering seven different divisional portfolios and nine SOEs. It has also been the main contributor to Pillar 1 (Wealth) and Pillar 3 (Infrastructure) of the KV20. It comes second in terms of the Government development budget for projects and major capital investments for the larger Ministries and captures more than 25% of the GOK development budget. 8 The Ministry and its SOEs are not restricted to those pillars only but also aims to provide a complete package of strategies to improving or addressing the issues identified under the pillars and objectives of the KV20 and KDP - to cope with the hardship and problems that the nation is struggling with, provided its limited resources. These coping strategies are geared to improving services and infrastructure, and there is also great emphasis on improving contracts and agreements that Government can benefit more from, for instance, review of an air-service agreement. Or a regulator (CCK) for the Telecom service, is a vital entity to ensure greater benefits for the people. Tourism and Infrastructure, identified as core pillars in the long-term plan and accorded first priorities in the KV20, will need considerable public investments. These should be well-aligned with the Government objectives and mean to be sustainable investments, therefore accurate analysis is needed. MICTTD is working closely with the Ministry of Finance to ensure that these investments are properly analyzed and promising big returns for the public and the future generation. 8.1 Sustainable Tourism Pillar 1 of the KV 20 recognizes sustainable tourism as the potential contributor towards stimulating economic development, providing employment, income generation, as well as supporting the retention of cultural traditions, sustainable management of national environmental assets and wider contribution towards social–economic benefits. The sector can support the development of other sectors like agriculture through forward and backward linkages. Tourism is currently approximately 3.6% of the country’s GDP1, however the Ministry believes that Tourism can become a major contributor to the economy if the right approach is adopted. Some of the economic benefits have been seen on Kiritimati Island. Tarawa also derives significant income but mostly from business travelers. The tourism growth has not been uptrend, with limited tourism products and markets over the years. Although the number of visitors increases, there is great potential for more, it can be improved by better tourism products and services. Figure 4: Visitors arrival and purpose (Tarawa and Kiritimati) Source: KNTO, March 2019 1 Kiribati 20-year vision 2016 to 2036 9 The number of holiday visitors in 2017 was 2,425 on data, this shows an increase of more than 50% from the previous year in 2016. It is estimated that the increase will continue and therefore Government will need to improve on infrastructure for tourism to meet the demand. The Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA)2 remains unexploited, with pristine lagoons and beaches, the isolated islands are an ideal vacation location for tourists. The KNTO and the PIO are trying to find ways to develop PIPA into a niche tourism product adopting the Bhutan tourism model3 which is controlled and restricted but is a major contributor to their economy. This approach will require the KNTO to improve on its marketing and promotion, and to engage more on e-marketing as social media is currently trendy, free and a more effective approach to promoting destinations to visitors and tourists. KNTO also recognises that it is mostly about improving its tourism product and the quality of its services, before it is able to establish a tourism brand with PIPA. If the product is well established, of good quality and promoted properly with a good marketing approach (online), it could build a good and trusted brand for tourists. Game fishing is one area that tourism is looking to develop and promote in the Gilbert Islands. This tourism activity has vast potential and travellers from Australia, New Zealand, USA and Europe are visiting our shores for game fishing. However, the tourism sector in Kiribati is limited with weak marketing and under-developed infrastructure to meet the tourist’s demand, creating a major gap towards tourism investments and tourist visitations. Compounding that is the isolation and dispersed islands with limited means of transportations. So, the other key strategy to develop the tourism sector, besides a good marketing approach is from an improved transportation system, it needs a more robust and capable transport system to carry tourists in and out of Kiribati. AKL and KNSL (Air Kiribati and Kiribati National Shipping) will link this strategy to remedy the missing gap in the tourism sector. The transport SOEs (air and sea) will require financial support from Government and our development partners. 2 The PIPA Area has vast potential in tourism, PIPA is the Phoenix Islands archipelago and surrounding waters, an area of 410,500 sq. km. (KNTO, 2019) 3 The principle of high-value, low-impact tourism development, is guiding tourism’s growth in Bhutan (World Tourism Organization- UNWTO, 2019). 10 8.2 Air, Sea and Land transportation and infrastructure Pillar 3 of the KV20 recognizes transportation and its infrastructure to be key complimentary drivers to economic development. These are also recognized as more expensive investments but have been identified that if these investments are properly analysed and monitored, they will be very beneficial to the public and the future generation. Government has committed to these projects, and seeing that some will not immediately reap benefits, however Government believes that in the future these investments will eventually grow the economy. Expansion of these services and infrastructure will also pose risks and therefore an effective monitoring and risk assessment mechanism is indeed a necessity. Airport stimulates economic activity, however, there are only two international airports in Kiribati; one on South Tarawa and one on Kiritimati Island. In addition to that, there are 19 airports in the outer islands which are used for domestic services, mostly made of reef-mud and require upgrading and additional maintenance work to improve the deteriorated runway surface conditions, to support frequent air operations and to meet the traveling demand. Four of these have been upgraded to accommodate the newly acquired Dash 8 aircraft of Air Kiribati Ltd (AKL) and two more to be upgraded in 2019. The 100% Government owned Air Kiribati Limited (AKL) is the only airline servicing the domestic market in Kiribati with 5 aircrafts – 1 Bombardier Dash 8, 1 de Havilland Twin Otter and 3 Harbin Y-12s. With the Y-12s nearing the end of their economic life, fleet capacity could again become insufficient without timely replacements. One of AKL’s main obstacle is the high cost of fuel which has greatly affect the company’s ability to make large marginal profits. Because of this, Government is heavily subsidizing this company to sustain domestic air travels. The Airport reported that the number of domestic passengers in 2018 has increased remarkably, compared to the number of passengers travelling domestically in 2017 (Figure 5). This shows an increase in demand for domestic travelling, as well as the improved services provided by AKL in 2018. There are currently four available international routes connecting Kiribati to the outside world, operated by Nauru Airlines, Fiji Airways and Solomon Air, the latter being a co-shared operation with AKL. To meet the demand and to provide competition in International travel, Government has recently purchased a 40-seater Dash 8 aircraft and 2 Embraer jets. 11 Figure 5: Number of Domestic and International passengers: Comparison between 2017 and 2018 Source: MICTTD airport November 2018 report MICTTD Airport also reported the increase in the number of passengers travelling abroad with similar uptrend pattern in 2017 and 2018 (Figure 5). Connectivity and accessibility to the Outer Islands from the Capital (South Tarawa) is challenging due to inadequate infrastructure (wharves, ramps, piers and ports), boat channels, passages and Aids to Navigation (AToNs). The two international seaports in Kiribati - Betio and Kiritimati are the only designated ports by the ministry managed by KPA, 100% Government owned company. The KPA’s container yard at Betio is facing constrains in space volume against the increasing influx of international containers. The ministry is looking at options for increasing space area. The two ports are used by international fishing vessels and local vessels. On the other hand, the outer islands, seaports are under developed with narrow channels cut through the reef-flat, with docks in some islands without proper infrastructure. Most of domestic vessels are not designed for this challenging marine contour and therefore affecting their effective delivery and efficient services causing high rates of lost and damages to their cargoes and inhibiting the natural food and trade supply cycle. 12 Domestic sea transport is largely dominated by the private sector though their presence is only prominent in profitable sectors. While the Kiribati National Shipping Line (KNSL) is the only Government owned shipping company that provided shipping service in Kiribati prior to the entry of the private sector, it currently focuses on providing shipping services to those routes considered to be non-profitable by the private sector with two landing crafts. Land transportation and infrastructures are equally vital for economic development. Nonetheless, the South Tarawa road network is the only and recently improved road in the entire nation. The Ministry is committed to provide utmost care of the new road, and the Highway Authority is dedicated to deliver this promise to the public. Under the new Highways Protection Act 2018, the Highway Authority promises safety to all road users and works closely with MISE on repair and maintenance of the roads. On the other hand, the outer Island roads are still made from reef mud that makes them prone to premature damage. Government is committed to improving road infrastructure, especially in the outer islands, as a matter of priority. 8.3 ICT and Communication services ICT infrastructures have been one of the development priority areas given its linkages with other drivers of growth. The mobile industry has shown slight improvement with two privately owned companies, Amalgamated Telecom Holdings Kiribati Limited (ATHKL) and Ocean-Link Ltd (OLL) being the sole providers for mobile network. CCK is a regulator entity, one of its core purpose is to address the issue of barriers to entry and encourage fair competition in the telecom industry, it has recently announced a successful arrangement with both the telecom companies being able to connect their services and the public can now exchange calls and receive messages between both networks (ATHKL and OLL). South Tarawa is covered by the 4G mobile network, while 3G services are available on South Tarawa, North Tarawa, Abaiang, Marakei, Maiana and Kiritimati. In addition, 2G services are also available on Abemama, Tabiteuea North and Onotoa. Other islands have VSAT systems set up at Island Council premises which the people on the islands can access. The World Bank has started the roll out the mobile services to four of the outer islands while Government will cover the rest. The current internet connectivity uses satellite technology and Government in partnership with the World Bank, ADB intends to address this by connecting South Tarawa and Kiritimati to a fiber optics submarine cable (Figures 7 & 8). 13 The completion of the mobile and submarine cable projects will enhance communication and provide better quality internet service at lower cost to the public. Figure 7: Conceptual Submarine Optical Fiber Cable Route Plan for EMCS Figure 8: Southern Cross NEXT System with Kiritimati Connection Source: BNL 14 8.4 Strengthening Support Services The Ministry administered supporting services that are very vital for its office and operational functions and for providing quality service for the people. Human resource capacity building is an ongoing need for the Ministry to meet demands from the evolving and regulatory needs from its highly specialized departments. As tourism, air, sea, ports and land transportations are expanding, so does the need to meet the required skills. A lot of these skill sets are dictated by international regulatory bodies and audits to meet the required standards set mostly for functionality and safety. Hence, there is a great need to meet and comply with all the required international standards, which means better and safer for the people. The Postal Division is the national and only postal service provider in the country, providing universal postal services to the government and people under the Postal Services Act (Cap 74 of Kiribati Law) and Universal Postal Service regulations. It is a member of the Universal Postal Union (UPU)4. The core function of Postal is to provide efficient delivery of mails and money transfer services and produce high quality philatelic products. With a substantial increase of parcel mails volume there is a significant need to improve International Postal System (IPS.POST) and Express Mail Service (EMS) for fast and efficient mail delivery. Further, Postal provide tele-money transfer and this is the only money transfer service that is widely used by the people on the outer Islands, however the current system is time consuming and old-fashion. The introduction of a fast-tele-money system is underway. With a high demand for international money transfer service and high-quality philatelic products, there is a need to expand the money transfer service and maintain the high quality of philatelic products. The Government Printery (GP) is established to provide central printing services to government ministries. It manages and is responsible for the production of standard forms, documents, secured stationeries and publications for government. The other important and very specific role is the printing of seamen discharge books and other maritime booklets. There is significant need to improve government printing capacity and quality of the printed materials, with state-of-the-art machineries to meet the demand of government ministries and some of the general public that cannot be taken up by private firms. In the centre of the Ministry and SOE’s business, there is always the need to maintain effective and efficient registry, account and customer services systems. The provision of service required from the 4 Ministry of Information, Communication, Transport and Tourism Development strategic plan 2016-2019. 15 counter to office and to elsewhere is essential, without much focus on the necessary and quality service delivery, it can lead to a dysfunctional Ministry and its SOEs. 8.4.1 The New Authorities and Commercial entities An approach that MICTTD has identified for effective development is having enough regulation to support better service, but another is to also produce more autonomous bureaus, that can support their own operations financially and sustainably. This strategy is aimed to address the Ministry’s diverse nature, and to give that specialized function to the new Authority or SOE to run and operate on itself with less Ministry financial assistance. This will also free the Ministry from excess tension and also able it to focus on its core functions as a Ministry and administrator - a caretaker of its departments and SOEs. Airport Kiribati Authority The Government’s Manifesto (Motinnano) identifies airport and air services as areas Government needs to strengthen. Accordingly, the Airport Authority Act, was passed in 2018. Following enactment, MICTTD established the Airport Kiribati Authority. An independent Airport Authority is required to ensure separation of the policy and regulatory responsibilities of MICTTD from the service provision responsibilities of an airport authority. This satisfies the probity and international regulatory safety oversight requirements and will enable Kiribati to upgrade air transport standards and venture into Jet operations for improved international routes for AKL. A major project for the Airport Authority to support Jet operations by AKL is the provision of additional apron area and a Hangar at Bonriki Airport, this project is underway. The cconstruction of a new and sizeable Hangar will improve the current infrastructure at Bonriki, providing facilities for effective and efficient air services. BwebwerikiNet Ltd BwebwerikiNet Ltd (BNL) is a new SOE, under the Ministry’s portfolio and represents the Government’s interest to support and improve voice and data telecommunications network in the Outer Islands, an international submarine cable venture with government entities from Nauru and FSM, the East Micronesia Cable System, and also provides needed support to the establishment of an international submarine cable venture with Southern Cross, the Southern Cross (NEXT). Kiribati Highway Authority The New Public Highways Protection Act was assented in early 2019, this brought with it many changes, much of which have improved safety for road users. The Highway Authority performs functions of a licensing authority, registering vehicles and drivers’ licenses and also ensures that the roads are continually maintained and repaired throughout. 16 Tourism Authority of Kiribati Government plans to establish an authority that can properly manage, regulate, promote, and improve Tourism in Kiribati. Recognising that Tourism is a complex industry that cuts across multiple sectors (especially the private sector), one of the development objectives is to increase contributions from private sectors to the economy in compatibility with the evolution of Kiribati culture and sustainable development. The answer to this is the Tourism Authority of Kiribati that will focus on marketing and promote Kiribati to the outside world for tourists. It will also design better policies and regulations to improve the tourism industry and also improve the private sector involvement in tourism. The Ministry has also identified that one way to do this effectively is to learn from the experts, and professionals who have been engaged in the business and know how to operate it. Therefore, the need for Technical Advisors (TAs) for their experience and knowledge in the field is necessary, our development partners also recognize this strategy to have been a sure-way to transfer knowledge to the locals. 9 Goals, Objectives and Strategies The main goal for the Ministry and SOEs strategic plan is; To improve tourism, communication, transportation, information technology, postal and printery through continuous improvement, efficient and effective services to support Government and the people and contribute to the economic development. The four main strategic objectives of the Ministry and the SOE’s strategic plan 2020 to 2023 were identified during consultation sessions with the Ministry’s Divisions and SOEs. The exercise focused on drawing and expanding their shorter-term plans (MOPs and SOIs) to cover the four years, a medium-term plan to work side-by-side with the Kiribati Development Plan (KDP) and aligning these plans with the KV20’s targets. 17 Table 4: MICTTD Objectives MSP 2020-2023 MICTTD Goals 2020-2023 Develop and strengthen sustainable Tourism development to boost economic development Strengthen air, sea and land transportation and infrastructures to meet social demands and compliment economic enhancing activities To improve Information Communication technology to ensure to promote service equity to all the people To strengthen supporting services; human resource needs, printery, postal, accounts and registry, to support the efficient and effective functions of the Ministry and SOEs, and establishment of new functional authorities or commercial entities. The first three objectives are consistent with the core issues and strategies for pillar 1 and 3 in the KV20. The fourth objective is based on strengthening the functions and core services of the Ministry, SOEs and Government. Strategic Actions, Indicators and Targets.

It also includes a set of indicators to enable progress in each KPI to be monitored and evaluated. MOPs and SOE’s plans (SOIs) are to be aligned with key strategies stated in this strategic plan. The MSP2020-2023 is a guide for Divisions and SOEs to developing their annual or semi-annual plans and to inform management and the Boards on the way forward that has been planned for them for the four years, however this will not limit them for more and new plans, changes are considered for the next review of this medium-term plan. It is a live work-plan and is subject to change following changed situations. Issues Strategies • The need to develop sustainable tourism • Developing sustainable tourism and niche products, focusing on the PIPA area. • The need to improve air, sea and land transportation and infrastructures • To improve air, land and sea transport infrastructure • The need to improve ICT and communication services. • To develop and improve ICT infrastructure • The need to strengthen supporting services; Human Resources, Printery, Postal, Accounts, Registry and customer services. • To strengthen supporting services; Human Resources, printery, postal, accounts, registry and customer services. • New autonomous Authorities for focussed functions 12 Result management The importance of relationships, partnerships and inter-sectoral coordination and collaboration is apparent in many of the strategic actions in this Strategic Plan. A results management is key for monitoring and evaluation and this will need the support of our counterparts from other GOK departments and our development partners. 12.1 Domestic coordination. In working towards the objectives in this Strategic Plan, there are opportunities for strengthening coordination between the MICTTD, SOEs and other GOK departments and agencies, and with NGOs and community-based groups. This includes collaborating on issues, such as with the Public Service Office (PSO) on objectives relating to workforce planning and human resource development, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MFED) on investigating alternative sources of financing and analysis of investments, and the National Statistics Office to build capacity in the collection and analysis of information. It also includes working with others more directly to coordinate support on implementing specific programme and interventions. The Strategic Plan notes a number of existing mechanisms for coordinating planning and implementation of initiatives, such as the MICTTD Coordinating Committee. Where they are not formalised structures or systems for coordination on specific programs or broader system issues, the 31 benefits of establishing such processes will be investigated as part of the implementation of this Strategic Plan. 12.2 Coordination with development partners The MICTTD has built strong relationships with numerous bi-lateral and international development partners. These partners have provided technical assistance and funding for a number of programs, infrastructure, and workforce development and training. Strong coordination and prioritising among development partners and the MICTTD are required in order to promote the effectiveness and efficiency of such support. Moreover, development partners and donors require Kiribati to provide reporting and financial statements on project expenditure, so donor practices needs to be strengthened. The Ministry has, with its development partners, established a MICTTD Development Coordinating Committee (MDCC) in order to strengthen coordination and support, and planning and delivery of services in Kiribati. The MDCC comprises of the Senior Management Team (SMT) of the MICTTD and representatives from Australian DFAT, New Zealand MFAT, Taiwan, Japan, SPC, SPTO, PIPA, ADB and the World Bank. The strong commitment on the part of development partners, and of the Ministry in engaging with these partners, provides an opportunity to integrate this support into the Strategic Plan. To this end, the MDCC will support the implementation of this Strategic Plan through providing a mechanism to: 1. Assist with identifying priority areas for funding and with the efficient mobilisation of resources, through working together to coordinate assistance, to give effect to the MICTTD and SOE plan. 2. Promote integrated, multi-sectoral and regional initiatives that are consistent with the Strategic Plan. 3. Identify initiatives to promote improvements in the efficiency, effectiveness and quality of service delivery. 4. Review progress of activities against the indicators and targets in the Strategic Plan. 5. Report to the Government of Kiribati and development partners on the implementation of the Strategic Plan, including in such a way that rationalises reporting and other accountability processes to promote greater efficiency 6. The MDCC will meet once or twice per year during the period of this Strategic Plan. One meeting per annum will focus on the review of progress against the Strategic Plan. At the following meeting, in each annual cycle, the MICTTD will present an annual action plan for the next year for discussion and agreement. 7. One or two members of the MDCC will have oversight on each strategic objective in the Strategic Plan. These members are not responsible for implementation of the objective; they are responsible for overseeing the MDCC’s role in relation to the objective. 32 13 Monitoring The MICTTD’s Senior Management Team and the Planning Unit (MICTTD) is responsible for monitoring the implementation of this strategic plan. The Planning Unit will coordinate the collection and analysis of information and data to report on the indicators and targets in the plan. It will provide progress updates on the activities to the SMT on a quarterly basis, and also report on issues. One of the challenges that the Ministry is keen to tackle immediately is collection and consolidation of information and data. Whilst this needs a better system or mechanism to coordinate in order to collect (data), it will certainly assist to provide the relevant information required by the SMT and the MDCC, as well as development partners, for reporting and making decisions for future funding of projects. This MSP will become a tool for the Ministry and its SOEs. The indicators in this strategic plan will be monitored, reported, and used for developing shorter-term plans (MOPs). The Planning unit will also be able to use it as a monitoring tool and a metric matrix to check for performance and progress, that should inform the MICTTD Development Coordinating Committee and our development partners.

This strategic plan is the first that involves all SOEs  operating under the Ministry of Information, Communication, Transport and Tourism Development  (MICTTD).       The key areas addressed and content in this includes the following:    • Transportation, ports and regulatory requirements  • Information and Communication Technologies and its regulatory requirements  • Tourism development   • Government printer  • Postal services  • Customer services  • Registry and accounting systems      The plan was designed in alignment with Te Motinnano (Government Manifesto) and the KV20 and  is a guiding framework with an inclusive approach that focuses on the commercial, technical,  administrative and operational issues, extending it as far as possible to look into other factors that  have impact on the efficiency of the service. Of critical importance, this time are:   • Expansion and improvement of sea and air ports  • Improving sea and air transportation infrastructures and regulatory requirements   • Improving sustainable tourism developments   • Developing efficient postal and printer services  • Establishment of autonomous Authorities so they focus specifically on their functions and   objectives to implement MICTTD’s strategies more efficiently.    Commitment from all staff of the Ministry and SOEs participating in the implementation of the plan  is fundamental. We invite our development partners to work with us in good partnership to achieve  our mission for better service delivery, so our vision for our country and the people in the years ahead  will be realized.

The SOE’s business plans were also not included in the Ministry’s Strategic Plan 2016-2019 but remain  vital for the Ministry’s strategic operations to achieve the desired goals set by Government. This new  edition of the MSP has new content and has incorporated those missing links from the Ministry’s  SOEs towards the overarching plan, as well it aims to promote the use of support services that the  Ministry is endowed with, provided its diverse nature.   The Strategic Plan sets the direction for the MICTTD and its SOEs over the next four years. It  identifies a Vision, Goal, Guiding Principles and Strategic Objectives - describing what the Ministry  expects to achieve and identifies Strategic Actions and Indicative Activities for implementation in  order to achieve its goals. It includes Indicators and Targets as a basis for monitoring progress towards  the Strategic Objectives. It also signals the need for a strong multi-sector coordination in order to  effectively implement the Strategic Plan.    The initial sections of the Strategic Plan outline its scope, provide some strategic context and  summarises population needs administered under this Ministry in Kiribati. A Vision and Goal for the  Strategic Plan are then defined, also, a set of Guiding Principles to guide decisions on implementation  priorities.    The Strategic Objectives and their associated Strategic Actions, Indicators and Targets form the focus  of the Strategic Plan 2020-2023 and are outlined on pages 17-29. Taken together, these describe what  the Ministry wants to do (the results), how it will do it (the activities to implement), and how to know  when achieved (monitoring progress). Details are set out as Indicative Activities in the Implementation  Plan in Annex A. The Implementation Plan can be used as a basis and tool for annual Divisions’  MOPs and can also be used by the Ministry to record and monitor for results the SOEs progresses  on their business plans (SOIs).   The Strategic Plan emphasises the importance of relationships, partnerships and inter-sectoral  coordination and collaboration to the effective delivery of the plan. This includes relationships with  domestic partners, including other Kiribati Government departments and agencies, and NGOs and  community-based groups. It promotes partnership and good relationships with numerous bi-lateral  and international development partners. The Strategic Plan notes specific initiatives on which the  Ministry needs to work with domestic and development partners. It also promotes the use of the  MICTTD’s Development Coordinating Committee (MDCC) as an effective mechanism for  supporting the implementation of this Strategic Plan.                         2 MICTTD’s organizational structure   Figure 1: MICTTD Organizational Structure 2018             Hon Minister  Permanent Secretary  ICT  Director  Staff SIO  Customer  Services  Marine  Director  Staff  Aviation  Director  Staff  Airport  Director  Staff  Tourism  Director  Staff  Postal  Director  Staff  Printery  GP  Staff  Planning  Director  Staff  Highway  DS  SAS  AS  Account  Registry  HRO  HR   Board and Commisioners  AKL  CEO  Staff  KPA  CEO  Staff  CCK  CEO  Staff  BPA  CEO  Staff  KNSL  CEO  Staff  2                   3     Figure 2: Planned MICTTD Organizational Structure after 2019      The new organizational structure is based on reforms to improve the Ministry’s efficiency in delivering its services.

These principles need to be  reflected in all strategic actions and activities developed and implemented. The principles can also be  used to guide decisions on implementation priorities.   Table 1: Guiding principles that guide the Ministry and SOE’s strategic plan   Guiding Principles   Relevant and appropriate  Do the proposed strategies and activities reflect the people and the  Government’s needs and will the activities undertaken meet those  needs?   Sustainable Are the proposed strategies and activities sustainable in Kiribati?   Effective Are the proposed strategies and activities likely to be effective in  Kiribati?   Efficient Are the proposed strategies and activities likely to be efficient in  Kiribati?   Outcome oriented Do the strategies and activities have clear links to the Mission and  Vision of the Ministry?   Realistic Are the outcomes and targets realistic?   Coordinated  Are the proposed strategies and activities well-coordinated with  relevant stakeholders and partners?       6 Introduction   The Strategic Plan 2020-2023 sets the direction for the MICTTD and its SOE’s activities. It identifies  the results that the Ministry wants to achieve in the four years (strategic objectives), and what  undertakings needed in order to achieve these results (strategic actions), and also how progress will be  measured (indicators and targets). The Strategic Plan is informed by the KV20, which examines the  needs of Government and the ability of the system to respond to those needs. The connection of the  strategies to the higher level national policy is shown in figure 3. The alignment of each and every  activity by the Ministry’s Divisions and SOEs to the overarching National Policy (KV20) are  imperative - that these activities are geared towards those targets in the longer-term plan.                    5     Figure 3: Elements of the Strategic Plan         The Ministry SMT and SOE management have participated in the development of the Strategic Plan.  The Strategic Plan sets the overall framework of actions on the objectives. It is intended to be a living  strategy plan that may be further developed and refined over its lifetime to reflect changing conditions,  including emerging priorities and needs, availability of funding, or for further development or  modification of Ministry strategies, policies and plans for specific programme or service areas.    A more practical approach (outcome oriented) is needed to deliver outputs, so the aim of this plan is  to paint a clearer picture of what each entity is programmed to do within the four-years or the medium  term. These strategies or activities are within the guiding principles, the emphasis that these activities  will be sustainable and realistic. Also, the plan aims to focus on the outcome and desires effective  mechanisms to solve issues and problems.    7 Strategic Context   The strategies and activities in this plan links with the KV20. The previous KPIs reflect the KDP  2016-2019 indicators, to enable progress monitoring and evaluation for each KPI. It will be the same  for this Plan with the new KDP 2020-2023.    Pillar 1 and 3 of the KV20 set out three core issues.      I. The need to develop sustainable tourism  II. The need to improve air, sea and land transportation and infrastructures   III. The need to improve ICT and communications.   Kiribati Vision 20 (KV20)  Kiribati Development  Plan (KDP)  Ministry and SOEs  Strategic Plan  - Strategic objectives - Strategic Actions  Ministry MOP and SOE  Statement of Intent  Indicators and Targets  inputs activities outputs policies outcomes                  6     The Ministry will effectively deliver its core services if the supporting services are functioning  efficiently. These include;     I. The ongoing need for human resource capacity building   II. Provision of quality Government printery services   III. The need for efficient postal services  IV. Improvement of accounts and registry systems  V. Improved customer service delivery   VI. Establishment of Authorities or commercial entities to focus specifically on their functions  and objectives to implement MICTTD’s strategies more efficiently.     Figure 4: MICTTD Core Objectives and Support Services           Therefore, this strategic plan also focuses on the need to strengthen supporting services to complete  the strategic objectives.  During the consultations with the Ministry’s Divisions and SOEs, the main  discovery and a profound strategy by itself, to address the issues spelt under the KV20 and the KDP,  is the efficient and effective supporting services that will drive the rest of those objectives to the targets  in the overarching plan.    Table 2 identifies issues and strategies from the KV20 and aligning these issues with the Ministry’s  supporting services identified.                                   7     Table 2: Issues and strategies identified     Issues Strategies   • The need to develop sustainable tourism • Developing sustainable tourism  • Improved marketing, promotion, and public   awareness of the tourism industry     • The need to improve air, sea and land  transportation, and infrastructures   • To improve air, land and sea transport infrastructure  • Human capacity to operate new Government   infrastructure to quality standards  • To harmonize infrastructural development for   tourism  • The need to improve ICT and   communication services.  • To develop and improve ICT infrastructure and   services     • The need to strengthen supporting  services; Human Resources, Printery,  Postal, Accounts, Registry and customer  services.   • To strengthen supporting services; Human  Resources, printery, postal, accounts, registry and  customer services.   • Establish new authorities or commercial entities to  deliver needed services for the public and focus on  MICTTD’s targets.     8 Situational Analysis  The MICTTD is the most diverse Ministry administering seven different divisional portfolios and nine  SOEs. It has also been the main contributor to Pillar 1 (Wealth) and Pillar 3 (Infrastructure) of the  KV20. It comes second in terms of the Government development budget for projects and major  capital investments for the larger Ministries and captures more than 25% of the GOK development  budget.                            8     The Ministry and its SOEs are not restricted to those pillars only but also aims to provide a complete  package of strategies to improving or addressing the issues identified under the pillars and objectives  of the KV20 and KDP - to cope with the hardship and problems that the nation is struggling with,  provided its limited resources. These coping strategies are geared to improving services and  infrastructure, and there is also great emphasis on improving contracts and agreements that  Government can benefit more from, for instance, review of an air-service agreement. Or a regulator  (CCK) for the Telecom service, is a vital entity to ensure greater benefits for the people.   Tourism and Infrastructure, identified as core pillars in the long-term plan and accorded first priorities  in the KV20, will need considerable public investments. These should be well-aligned with the  Government objectives and mean to be sustainable investments, therefore accurate analysis is needed.  MICTTD is working closely with the Ministry of Finance to ensure that these investments are properly  analyzed and promising big returns for the public and the future generation.   8.1 Sustainable Tourism    Pillar 1 of the KV 20 recognizes sustainable tourism as the potential contributor towards stimulating  economic development, providing employment, income generation, as well as supporting the retention  of cultural traditions, sustainable management of national environmental assets and wider contribution  towards social–economic benefits. The sector can support the development of other sectors like  agriculture through forward and backward linkages. Tourism is currently approximately 3.6% of the  country’s GDP1, however the Ministry believes that Tourism can become a major contributor to the  economy if the right approach is adopted. Some of the economic benefits have been seen on Kiritimati  Island. Tarawa also derives significant income but mostly from business travelers. The tourism growth  has not been uptrend, with limited tourism products and markets over the years. Although the number  of visitors increases, there is great potential for more, it can be improved by better tourism products and  services.   Figure 4: Visitors arrival and purpose (Tarawa and Kiritimati)          Source: KNTO, March 2019                                                          1 Kiribati 20-year vision 2016 to 2036                   9     The number of holiday visitors in 2017 was 2,425 on data, this shows an increase of more than 50%  from the previous year in 2016. It is estimated that the increase will continue and therefore  Government will need to improve on infrastructure for tourism to meet the demand.   The Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA)2 remains unexploited, with pristine lagoons and beaches,  the isolated islands are an ideal vacation location for tourists. The KNTO and the PIO are trying to  find ways to develop PIPA into a niche tourism product adopting the Bhutan tourism model3 which  is controlled and restricted but is a major contributor to their economy. This approach will require the  KNTO to improve on its marketing and promotion, and to engage more on e-marketing as social  media is currently trendy, free and a more effective approach to promoting destinations to visitors  and tourists.    KNTO also recognises that it is mostly about  improving its tourism product and the quality  of its services, before it is able to establish a  tourism brand with PIPA.  If the product is  well established, of good quality and promoted  properly with a good marketing approach  (online), it could build a good and trusted  brand for tourists. Game fishing is one area  that tourism is looking to develop and promote  in the Gilbert Islands. This tourism activity has  vast potential and travellers from Australia,  New Zealand, USA and Europe are visiting our  shores for game fishing.      However, the tourism sector in Kiribati is limited with weak marketing and under-developed  infrastructure to meet the tourist’s demand, creating a major gap towards tourism investments and  tourist visitations. Compounding that is the isolation and dispersed islands with limited means of  transportations. So, the other key strategy to develop the tourism sector, besides a good marketing  approach is from an improved transportation system, it needs a more robust and capable transport  system to carry tourists in and out of Kiribati. AKL and KNSL (Air Kiribati and Kiribati National  Shipping) will link this strategy to remedy the missing gap in the tourism sector. The transport SOEs  (air and sea) will require financial support from Government and our development partners.                                                             2 The PIPA Area has vast potential in tourism, PIPA is the Phoenix Islands archipelago and surrounding waters, an area of 410,500  sq. km. (KNTO, 2019)  3 The principle of high-value, low-impact tourism development, is guiding tourism’s growth in Bhutan (World Tourism Organization-  UNWTO, 2019).                       10     8.2 Air, Sea and Land transportation and infrastructure   Pillar 3 of the KV20 recognizes transportation and its infrastructure to be key complimentary drivers  to economic development. These are also recognized as more expensive investments but have been  identified that if these investments are properly analysed and monitored, they will be very beneficial  to the public and the future generation. Government has committed to these projects, and seeing that  some will not immediately reap benefits, however Government believes that in the future these  investments will eventually grow the economy. Expansion of these services and infrastructure will also  pose risks and therefore an effective monitoring and risk assessment mechanism is indeed a necessity.   Airport stimulates economic activity, however, there are only two international airports in Kiribati;  one on South Tarawa and one on Kiritimati Island.  In addition to that, there are 19 airports in the  outer islands which are used for domestic services, mostly made of reef-mud and require upgrading  and additional maintenance work to improve the deteriorated runway surface conditions, to support  frequent air operations and to meet the traveling demand. Four of these have been upgraded to  accommodate the newly acquired Dash 8 aircraft of Air Kiribati Ltd (AKL) and two more to be  upgraded in 2019.   The 100% Government owned Air Kiribati Limited (AKL) is the only airline servicing the domestic  market in Kiribati with 5 aircrafts – 1 Bombardier Dash 8, 1 de Havilland Twin Otter and 3 Harbin  Y-12s. With the Y-12s nearing the end of their economic life, fleet capacity could again become  insufficient without timely replacements. One of AKL’s main obstacle is the high cost of fuel which  has greatly affect the company’s ability to make large marginal profits. Because of this, Government  is heavily subsidizing this company to sustain domestic air travels.   The Airport reported that the number of domestic passengers in 2018 has increased remarkably,  compared to the number of passengers travelling domestically in 2017 (Figure 5). This shows an  increase in demand for domestic travelling, as well as the improved services provided by AKL in 2018.      There are currently four available international routes connecting Kiribati to the outside world,  operated by Nauru Airlines, Fiji Airways and Solomon Air, the latter being a co-shared operation with  AKL. To meet the demand and to provide competition in International travel, Government has  recently purchased a 40-seater Dash 8 aircraft and 2 Embraer jets.                         11     Figure 5: Number of Domestic and International passengers: Comparison between 2017 and 2018      Source: MICTTD airport November 2018 report   MICTTD Airport also reported the increase in the number of passengers travelling abroad with similar  uptrend pattern in 2017 and 2018 (Figure 5).   Connectivity and accessibility to the Outer Islands from the Capital (South Tarawa) is challenging due  to inadequate infrastructure (wharves, ramps, piers and ports), boat channels, passages and Aids to  Navigation (AToNs).    The two international seaports in Kiribati - Betio and Kiritimati are the only designated ports by the  ministry managed by KPA, 100% Government owned company. The KPA’s container yard at Betio  is facing constrains in space volume against the increasing influx of international containers. The  ministry is looking at options for increasing space area. The two ports are used by international fishing  vessels and local vessels. On the other hand, the outer islands, seaports are under developed with  narrow channels cut through the reef-flat, with docks in some islands without proper infrastructure.  Most of domestic vessels are not designed for this challenging marine contour and therefore affecting  their effective delivery and efficient services causing high rates of lost and damages to their cargoes  and inhibiting the natural food and trade supply cycle.                                          12     Domestic sea transport is largely dominated by the private sector though their presence is only  prominent in profitable sectors. While the Kiribati National Shipping Line (KNSL) is the only  Government owned shipping company that provided shipping service in Kiribati prior to the entry of  the private sector, it currently focuses on providing shipping services to those routes considered to be  non-profitable by the private sector with two landing crafts.   Land transportation and infrastructures are equally vital for economic development. Nonetheless, the  South Tarawa road network is the only and recently improved road in the entire nation. The Ministry  is committed to provide utmost care of the new road, and the Highway Authority is dedicated to  deliver this promise to the public. Under the new Highways Protection Act 2018, the Highway  Authority promises safety to all road users and works closely with MISE on repair and maintenance  of the roads.  On the other hand, the outer Island roads are still made from reef mud that makes them  prone to premature damage. Government is committed to improving road infrastructure, especially  in the outer islands, as a matter of priority.     8.3 ICT and Communication services   ICT infrastructures have been one of the development priority areas given its linkages with other  drivers of growth. The mobile industry has shown slight improvement with two privately owned  companies, Amalgamated Telecom Holdings Kiribati Limited (ATHKL) and Ocean-Link Ltd (OLL)  being the sole providers for mobile network.    CCK is a regulator entity, one of its core purpose is to address the issue of barriers to entry and  encourage fair competition in the telecom industry, it has recently announced a successful arrangement  with both the telecom companies being able to connect their services and the public can now exchange  calls and receive messages between both networks (ATHKL and OLL).  South Tarawa is covered by the 4G mobile network, while 3G services are available on South Tarawa,  North Tarawa, Abaiang, Marakei, Maiana and Kiritimati. In addition, 2G services are also available on  Abemama, Tabiteuea North and Onotoa. Other islands have VSAT systems set up at Island Council  premises which the people on the islands can access. The World Bank has started the roll out the  mobile services to four of the outer islands while Government will cover the rest.    The current internet connectivity uses satellite technology and Government in partnership with the  World Bank, ADB intends to address this by connecting South Tarawa and Kiritimati to a fiber optics  submarine cable (Figures 7 & 8).                                      13       The completion of the mobile and submarine cable projects will enhance communication and provide  better quality internet service at lower cost to the public.   Figure 7: Conceptual Submarine Optical Fiber Cable Route Plan for EMCS      Figure 8: Southern Cross NEXT System with Kiritimati Connection      Source: BNL                  14     8.4 Strengthening Support Services     The Ministry administered supporting services that are very vital for its office and operational  functions and for providing quality service for the people.    Human resource capacity building is an  ongoing need for the Ministry to meet  demands from the evolving and regulatory  needs from its highly specialized departments.  As tourism, air, sea, ports and land  transportations are expanding, so does the  need to meet the required skills. A lot of these  skill sets are dictated by international regulatory  bodies and audits to meet the required  standards set mostly for functionality and  safety. Hence, there is a great need to meet and  comply with all the required international  standards, which means better and safer for the  people.         The Postal Division is the national and only postal service provider in the country, providing universal  postal services to the government and people under the Postal Services Act (Cap 74 of Kiribati Law)  and Universal Postal Service regulations.  It is a member of the Universal Postal Union (UPU)4. The  core function of Postal is to provide efficient delivery of mails and money transfer services and  produce high quality philatelic products.  With a substantial increase of parcel mails volume there is a  significant need to improve International Postal System (IPS.POST) and Express Mail Service (EMS)  for fast and efficient mail delivery.  Further, Postal provide tele-money transfer and this is the only  money transfer service that is widely used by the people on the outer Islands, however the current  system is time consuming and old-fashion. The introduction of a fast-tele-money system is underway.  With a high demand for international money transfer service and high-quality philatelic products, there  is a need to expand the money transfer service and maintain the high quality of philatelic products.      The Government Printery (GP) is established to provide central printing services to government  ministries. It manages and is responsible for the production of standard forms, documents, secured  stationeries and publications for government. The other important and very specific role is the printing  of seamen discharge books and other maritime booklets. There is significant need to improve  government printing capacity and quality of the printed materials, with state-of-the-art machineries to  meet the demand of government ministries and some of the general public that cannot be taken up  by private firms.    In the centre of the Ministry and SOE’s business, there is always the need  to maintain effective and  efficient registry, account and customer services systems. The provision of service required from the                                                          4 Ministry of Information, Communication, Transport and Tourism Development strategic plan 2016-2019.                   15     counter to office and to elsewhere is essential, without much focus on the necessary and quality service  delivery, it can lead to a dysfunctional Ministry and its SOEs.     8.4.1 The New Authorities and Commercial entities   An approach that MICTTD has identified for effective development is having enough regulation to  support better service, but another is to also produce more autonomous bureaus, that can support  their own operations financially and sustainably. This strategy is aimed to address the Ministry’s diverse  nature, and to give that specialized function to the new Authority or SOE to run and operate on itself  with less Ministry financial assistance. This will also free the Ministry from excess tension and also  able it to focus on its core functions as a Ministry and administrator - a caretaker of its departments  and SOEs.      Airport Kiribati Authority    The Government’s Manifesto (Motinnano) identifies airport and air services as areas Government  needs to strengthen. Accordingly, the Airport Authority Act, was passed in 2018. Following  enactment, MICTTD established the Airport Kiribati Authority. An independent Airport Authority  is required to ensure separation of the policy and regulatory responsibilities of MICTTD from the  service provision responsibilities of an airport authority.   This satisfies the probity and international  regulatory safety oversight requirements and will enable Kiribati to upgrade air transport  standards and venture into Jet operations for improved international routes for AKL. A major  project for the Airport Authority to support Jet operations by AKL is the provision of additional  apron area and a Hangar at Bonriki Airport, this project is underway.  The cconstruction of a new and  sizeable Hangar will improve the current infrastructure at Bonriki, providing facilities for effective and  efficient air services.      BwebwerikiNet Ltd     BwebwerikiNet Ltd (BNL) is a new SOE, under the Ministry’s portfolio and represents the  Government’s interest to support and improve voice and data telecommunications network in the  Outer Islands, an international submarine cable venture with government entities from Nauru and  FSM, the East Micronesia Cable System, and also provides needed support to the establishment of an  international submarine cable venture with Southern Cross, the Southern Cross (NEXT).    Kiribati Highway Authority    The New Public Highways Protection Act was  assented in early 2019, this brought with it  many changes, much of which have improved  safety for road users. The Highway Authority  performs functions of a licensing authority,  registering vehicles and drivers’ licenses and  also ensures that the roads are continually  maintained and repaired throughout.                                                  16     Tourism Authority of Kiribati    Government plans to establish an authority that can properly manage, regulate, promote, and improve  Tourism in Kiribati. Recognising that Tourism is a complex industry that cuts across multiple sectors  (especially the private sector), one of the development objectives is to increase contributions from  private sectors to the economy in compatibility with the evolution of Kiribati culture and sustainable  development. The answer to this is the Tourism Authority of Kiribati that will focus on marketing  and promote Kiribati to the outside world for tourists. It will also design better policies and regulations  to improve the tourism industry and also improve the private sector involvement in tourism.      The Ministry has also identified that one way to do this effectively is to learn from the experts, and  professionals who have been engaged in the business and know how to operate it. Therefore, the need  for Technical Advisors (TAs) for their experience and knowledge in the field is necessary, our  development partners also recognize this strategy to have been a sure-way to transfer knowledge to  the locals.     9 Goals, Objectives and Strategies    The main goal for the Ministry and SOEs strategic plan is;    To improve tourism, communication, transportation, information technology, postal and printery through continuous  improvement, efficient and effective services to support Government and the people and contribute to the economic  development.        The four main strategic objectives of the  Ministry and the SOE’s strategic plan 2020 to  2023 were identified during consultation  sessions with the Ministry’s Divisions and  SOEs. The exercise focused on drawing and  expanding their shorter-term plans (MOPs and  SOIs) to cover the four years, a medium-term  plan to work side-by-side with the Kiribati  Development Plan (KDP) and aligning these  plans with the KV20’s targets.                                                   17     Table 4: MICTTD Objectives MSP 2020-2023   MICTTD Goals 2020-2023   Develop and strengthen sustainable Tourism development to boost economic development   Strengthen air, sea and land transportation and infrastructures to meet social demands and compliment economic  enhancing activities   To improve Information Communication technology to ensure to promote service equity to all the people   To strengthen supporting services; human resource needs, printery, postal, accounts and registry, to support the  efficient and effective functions of the Ministry and SOEs, and establishment of new functional authorities or  commercial entities.     The first three objectives are consistent with the core issues and strategies for pillar 1 and 3 in the  KV20. The fourth objective is based on strengthening the functions and core services of the Ministry,  SOEs and Government.       Strategic Actions, Indicators and Targets.

It also  includes a set of indicators to enable progress in each KPI to be monitored and evaluated. MOPs and  SOE’s plans (SOIs) are to be aligned with key strategies stated in this strategic plan.    The MSP2020-2023 is a guide for Divisions and SOEs to developing their annual or semi-annual plans  and to inform management and the Boards on the way forward that has been planned for them for  the four years, however this will not limit them for more and new plans, changes are considered for  the next review of this medium-term plan. It is a live work-plan and is subject to change following  changed situations.     Issues Strategies   • The need to develop sustainable tourism  • Developing sustainable tourism and niche products,   focusing on the PIPA area.     • The need to improve air, sea and land  transportation and infrastructures   • To improve air, land and sea transport infrastructure    • The need to improve ICT and  communication services.   • To develop and improve ICT infrastructure    • The need to strengthen supporting  services; Human Resources, Printery,  Postal, Accounts, Registry and customer  services.   • To strengthen supporting services; Human Resources,  printery, postal, accounts, registry and customer  services.   • New autonomous Authorities for focussed functions       12 Result management   The importance of relationships, partnerships and inter-sectoral coordination and collaboration is  apparent in many of the strategic actions in this Strategic Plan. A results management is key for  monitoring and evaluation and this will need the support of our counterparts from other GOK  departments and our development partners.     12.1 Domestic coordination.   In working towards the objectives in this Strategic Plan, there are opportunities for strengthening  coordination between the MICTTD, SOEs and other GOK departments and agencies, and with  NGOs and community-based groups. This includes collaborating on issues, such as with the Public  Service Office (PSO) on objectives relating to workforce planning and human resource development,  the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MFED) on investigating alternative sources of  financing and analysis of investments, and the National Statistics Office to build capacity in the  collection and analysis of information. It also includes working with others more directly to coordinate  support on implementing specific programme and interventions.      The Strategic Plan notes a number of existing mechanisms for coordinating planning and  implementation of initiatives, such as the MICTTD Coordinating Committee. Where they are not  formalised structures or systems for coordination on specific programs or broader system issues, the                   31     benefits of establishing such processes will be investigated as part of the implementation of this  Strategic Plan.      12.2 Coordination with development partners     The MICTTD has built strong relationships with numerous bi-lateral and international development  partners. These partners have provided technical assistance and funding for a number of programs,  infrastructure, and workforce development and training.     Strong coordination and prioritising among development partners and the MICTTD are required in  order to promote the effectiveness and efficiency of such support. Moreover, development partners  and donors require Kiribati to provide reporting and financial statements on project expenditure, so  donor practices needs to be strengthened. The Ministry has, with its development partners, established  a MICTTD Development Coordinating Committee (MDCC) in order to strengthen coordination and  support, and planning and delivery of services in Kiribati. The MDCC comprises of the Senior  Management Team (SMT) of the MICTTD and representatives from Australian DFAT, New Zealand  MFAT, Taiwan, Japan, SPC, SPTO, PIPA, ADB and the World Bank.     The strong commitment on the part of development partners, and of the Ministry in engaging with  these partners, provides an opportunity to integrate this support into the Strategic Plan. To this end,  the MDCC will support the implementation of this Strategic Plan through providing a mechanism to:     1. Assist with identifying priority areas for funding and with the efficient mobilisation of resources,   through working together to coordinate assistance, to give effect to the MICTTD and SOE plan.   2. Promote integrated, multi-sectoral and regional initiatives that are consistent with the Strategic   Plan.   3. Identify initiatives to promote improvements in the efficiency, effectiveness and quality of service   delivery.   4. Review progress of activities against the indicators and targets in the Strategic Plan.   5. Report to the Government of Kiribati and development partners on the implementation of the   Strategic Plan, including in such a way that rationalises reporting and other accountability  processes to promote greater efficiency    6. The MDCC will meet once or twice per year during the period of this Strategic Plan. One meeting  per annum will focus on the review of progress against the Strategic Plan. At the following  meeting, in each annual cycle, the MICTTD will present an annual action plan for the next year  for discussion and agreement.    7. One or two members of the MDCC will have oversight on each strategic objective in the Strategic  Plan. These members are not responsible for implementation of the objective; they are responsible  for overseeing the MDCC’s role in relation to the objective.                               32     13 Monitoring  The MICTTD’s Senior Management Team and the Planning Unit (MICTTD) is responsible for  monitoring the implementation of this strategic plan. The Planning Unit will coordinate the collection  and analysis of information and data to report on the indicators and targets in the plan. It will provide  progress updates on the activities to the SMT on a quarterly basis, and also report on issues.                                                        One of the challenges that the Ministry is keen to tackle immediately is collection and consolidation  of information and data. Whilst this needs a better system or mechanism to coordinate in order to  collect (data), it will certainly assist to provide the relevant information required by the SMT and the  MDCC, as well as development partners, for reporting and making decisions for future funding of  projects.    This MSP will become a tool for the Ministry and its SOEs. The indicators in this strategic plan will  be monitored, reported, and used for developing shorter-term plans (MOPs). The Planning unit will  also be able to use it as a monitoring tool and a metric matrix to check for performance and progress,  that should inform the MICTTD Development Coordinating Committee and our development  partners.

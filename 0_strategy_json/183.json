The surest way to achieve these objectives is the EU integration. For this purpose, the Government is set to create all prerequisites, which once developed, will make Moldova eligible to get the statute of candidate-country for EU accession. To fulfil this goal, the implementation of the Republic of Moldova - European Union Association Agreement, in particular through the implementation of the National Action Plan approved by Government Decision no. 808 of October 7, 2014, was put at the basis of the Government Action Programme. The Government will further spoke out for the desideratum to reintegrate Moldova, this being one of the basic priorities of the ruling process. The political solution to the conflict will be correlated with the objective of European integration of Moldova. The final settlement of the conflict must ensure the viable, democratic, independent and sovereign nature of the reunified state. In the short term, the Government’s major efforts are directed to remove obstacles as to Moldova’s internal and external security, to stabilise the banking sector, to penalise and fight against financial fraud, to ensure a balance between sustainable fiscal consolidation and boost of economic development, and to protect citizens' incomes. In the medium term, the Government's priorities include:  To increase the wellbeing of citizens by ensuring inclusive economic growth and support vulnerable groups of society;  To fight against corruption;  To reform justice and law-enforcement bodies, which will guarantee the rule of law;  Country reintegration;  To provide access to quality education and health; 5  To rise up the quality of services provided to citizens, reduce administrative costs and development discrepancies between regions;  To ensure economic, financial and energy security of the country. To ensure optimal, sustainable and inclusive economic growth, economic policies will be based on the following key principles: economic freedom and equal conditions for all businesses, fair competition, support to entrepreneurship, balancing the interests of employees with those of employers, including the adoption of new codes in customs, fiscal and labour field, macroeconomic stability and financial and banking accountability, strengthening energy security. The Government’s efforts will be aimed at increasing competitiveness and quality of domestic goods, export growth, including by increasing investments into economic infrastructure, modern and high-performance agriculture development, creating an attractive and motivating environment for investments. The government is set to build a society based on the European social model. In this connection, the key tasks are investments in human resource development, providing equal opportunities, fair redistribution of income to disadvantaged groups and to guarantee the protection of citizens against any kind of discrimination. Investments in education, science, development of information technology and electronic services lay the foundation of a society and an economy based on knowledge and innovation. To transform the educational system into one relevant for personal and professional development of citizens, this is imperative. In healthcare sector, we will insist on continuing and deepening the reforms, so that inhabitants of villages and towns have equal access to qualitative public health, medical and pharmaceutical services. The ultimate goal of the act of governance, which we are committed to accomplish, is a strong state to serve people. A state with fair and proper institutions, which act under the principle of transparency and efficiency. A state where the law functions, where legal institutions are depoliticized, where justice is done in the interest of the citizen and public money is spent for the benefit of people.

CIVIL SOCIETY .......................................................................................... 50         4     PREAMBLE      This programme, which underpins the activity of the Government of Republic   of Moldova for 2016-2018, has as main objective to increase the welfare, safety and   quality of the life of citizens, in particular by: economic development and facilitating   well paid job creation, eradication of corruption and ensuring the rule of law,   personal security, national defence capacity building, accessible and cost-effective   public services, social protection for vulnerable populations.   The surest way to achieve these objectives is the EU integration. For this   purpose, the Government is set to create all prerequisites, which once developed, will   make Moldova eligible to get the statute of candidate-country for EU accession. To   fulfil this goal, the implementation of the Republic of Moldova - European Union   Association Agreement, in particular through the implementation of the National   Action Plan approved by Government Decision no. 808 of October 7, 2014, was put   at the basis of the Government Action Programme.   The Government will further spoke out for the desideratum to reintegrate   Moldova, this being one of the basic priorities of the ruling process. The political   solution to the conflict will be correlated with the objective of European integration   of Moldova. The final settlement of the conflict must ensure the viable, democratic,   independent and sovereign nature of the reunified state.    In the short term, the Government’s major efforts are directed to remove   obstacles as to Moldova’s internal and external security, to stabilise the banking   sector, to penalise and fight against financial fraud, to ensure a balance between   sustainable fiscal consolidation and boost of economic development, and to protect   citizens' incomes.      In the medium term, the Government's priorities include:    To increase the wellbeing of citizens by ensuring inclusive economic   growth and support vulnerable groups of society;    To fight against corruption;    To reform justice and law-enforcement bodies, which will guarantee the   rule of law;    Country reintegration;    To provide access to quality education and health;     5      To rise up the quality of services provided to citizens, reduce   administrative costs and development discrepancies between regions;    To ensure economic, financial and energy security of the country.   To ensure optimal, sustainable and inclusive economic growth, economic   policies will be based on the following key principles: economic freedom and equal   conditions for all businesses, fair competition, support to entrepreneurship, balancing   the interests of employees with those of employers, including the adoption of new   codes in customs, fiscal and labour field, macroeconomic stability and financial and   banking accountability, strengthening  energy security. The Government’s efforts   will be aimed at increasing competitiveness and quality of domestic goods, export   growth, including by increasing investments into economic infrastructure, modern   and high-performance agriculture development, creating an attractive and motivating   environment for investments.   The government is set to build a society based on the European social model.   In this connection, the key tasks are investments in human resource development,   providing equal opportunities, fair redistribution of income to disadvantaged groups   and to guarantee the protection of citizens against any kind of discrimination.   Investments in education, science, development of information technology and   electronic services lay the foundation of a society and an economy based on   knowledge and innovation. To transform the educational system into one relevant for   personal and professional development of citizens, this is imperative. In healthcare   sector, we will insist on continuing and deepening the reforms, so that inhabitants of   villages and towns have equal access to qualitative public health, medical and   pharmaceutical services.    The ultimate goal of the act of governance, which we are committed to   accomplish, is a strong state to serve people. A state with fair and proper institutions,   which act under the principle of transparency and efficiency. A state where the law   functions, where legal institutions are depoliticized, where justice is done in the   interest of the citizen and public money is spent for the benefit of people. A state   where crime and corruption is effectively fought and priority is the observance of   human rights and freedoms, re-establishment of community spirit and strengthening   solidarity. To succeed in this commitment, we will use professional resources.              6     The following principles will be implemented to the entire contents of the   Programme:    To make deep transformations in key areas;    To continue reforms initiated for the benefit of citizen and society;    To ensure the integrity and professionalism in the act of government;    To ensure the transparency, accountability and predictability of   governance;    Government coherent and uniform communication;    To get real results for ordinary people.                                                                                            7        I.

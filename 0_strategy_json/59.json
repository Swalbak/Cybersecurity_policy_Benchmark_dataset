It serves the guests of the Two Holy Mosques, represents a major source of energy in the global markets, seeks to provide an attractive investment destination for local and foreign investments, and contributes to enhancing regional and global security. The Kingdom will – with God’s permission – proceed with leadership from the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud – may God grant him success – and His Royal Highness the Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman Bin Abdulaziz – may God protect him and care for him – and in accordance with the Kingdom’s Vision 2030, towards enhancing its regional and international standing, and growing its economic power. It has also strived and will continue to strive to empower safety and security as it considers them the foundation for its structure, development, and prosperity to bring about a bright future. The Kingdom’s status renders it a target for actors looking to harm its security, economy, and development. As such, cyber attacks, which are increasing globally, has made cybersecurity a priority for all countries with the aim of strengthening their cyberspace and protecting themselves from various risks, threats, and geopolitical dimensions. Nowadays, threats and cyber attacks have become more sophisticated and dangerous to countries, their systems, and their institutions through innovative and unforeseen methods that are expected to rise in the future as these actors, threat mechanisms, and threat technologies are quickly shared across the globe to help conduct attacks. The Kingdom is aware of cyber threats and realizes that cybersecurity is a key pillar and objective in enhancing its position and protecting its vital interests, national security, critical infrastructure, key sectors, and government services and activities. As such, the Kingdom has reinforced its cybersecurity efforts and activities. One of the key outcomes was approving the establishment of the National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA), its regulations, and linking it directly to the King – God Bless Him – whereas it will oversee cybersecurity matters in the Kingdom and be the national reference for cybersecurity. The NCA has been assigned important strategic objectives, of which the most prominent is 11 National Cybersecurity Strategy developing the National Cybersecurity Strategy, overseeing its execution, and proposing amendments. As such, the NCA has based this Strategy on a clear and specific vision aiming to achieve a secure and trusted Saudi cyberspace that enables growth and prosperity, endorsing the local economy, supporting businesses and other activities, providing opportunities for cybersecurity developments in the Kingdom, offering new jobs, building specialized capabilities, and providing incentives for research and development. The Strategy aims to establish an integrated national cybersecurity organization that is aligned with the most distinguished international practices in the field; build a comprehensive approach that enables all stakeholders to improve their cybersecurity; protect their networks, systems, and electronic data; develop cybersecurity principles; and reinforce organization and individual awareness of their national responsibilities. As such, it will achieve a high level of cybersecurity maturity and professionalism as each stakeholder is responsible for their own cybersecurity standing as long as they are in alignment with the NCA and its mandate. Supporting and funding this Strategy will be in alignment with the Kingdom’s efforts in maintaining and enhancing safety and security. It will also help achieve its ambitious vision (Vision 2030) and preserve its developmental, social, and economic gains, thus improving the efforts of their national organizations in raising the level of cybersecurity. As result, the Kingdom was ranked 13th in the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) for 2018, which is managed by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) of the United Nations. As we realize that challenges are still substantial nowadays and overcoming them will require great efforts from both the NCA and national stakeholders, in addition to the high cost of cybersecurity and the even higher cost of cyber incidents – God Forbid – we hope that this National Cybersecurity Strategy and its frameworks will be implemented to reduce risks, increase trust, and enable growth. May God Grant Us Success. Dr. Musaed Bin Mohammed Al-Aiban Chairman of the Board of Directors of the National Cybersecurity Authority 12 National Cybersecurity Strategy Executive Summary 12 13 National Cybersecurity Strategy Executive Summary An integrated and secure national digital infrastructure is one of the most important drivers of growth and prosperity in the King- dom of Saudi Arabia. However, the rapid ex- pansion of technology usage has introduced new Cybersecurity vulnerabilities and cyber threats. These evolving threats necessitate strengthening the Kingdom’s overall cyberse- curity posture so that networks, information technology, operational technology systems, and related hardware and software compo- nents are secured, thus protecting services and data from penetration, disruption, modifica- tion, entry, use, or exploitation. By doing so, the critical technical linkages between govern- ment services and critical national infrastruc- ture are secured and growth of the Kingdom’s digital economy is supported. The National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) prepared the Kingdom’s first National Cybersecurity Strategy to guide implementa- tion of key initiatives as specified by Royal De- cree No. 6801 to achieve an appropriate bal- ance between enhancing cybersecurity, raising confidence, and contributing to the Kingdom’s growth and prosperity. This Executive Summary provides key in- sight into the methodology employed to de- velop the Strategy, its vision and national stra- tegic goals, national organization roles and responsibilities, national cybersecurity frame- works, and the action plan. The Comprehensive methodology used to prepare the Strategy consisted of the following: • Referencing and aligning with key national resources, foremost of which is the King- dom’s Vision 2030, in addition to relevant national regulations including the regula- tions of the NCA • Studying the most pervasive local, nation- al, and international cyber risks • Designing a comprehensive reference framework, based on international best practices and recent developments in the cybersecurity domain, to build the Strat- egy – inclusive of all aspects of cyber de- fense operations, capacity building, orga- nization design and policy, and others • Cybersecurity Benchmark: Benchmarking cybersecurity best practices and lessons learned across 20 countries, especially those with developed national cybersecu- rity capabilities • Analyzing the current cybersecurity threat landscape in the Kingdom • Formulating the Strategy’s vision and core elements The Strategy’s vision, which balances the Kingdom’s aspiration to provide both security and facilitate growth, is as follows: A resilient, secure, and trusted Saudi cyberspace that enables growth and prosperity 14 National Cybersecurity Strategy Through this Strategy, NCA establised an integrated cybersecurity framework in the Kingdom focusing on six areas: Unify, Manage, Assure, Defend, Partner, and Build. These areas are de- scribed as follows: Unify Whole-of-Nation Cybersecurity Governance Defend Strengthening national technical defense capabilities against cyber threats (Dynamic Defense) Manage Adaptive Cyber Risk Management on National Level Partner Strengthening Partnerships and Cooperation in Cybersecurity (Collaborative Security) Assure Cyber Ecosystem Assurance Build National Capacity Building and Cybersecurity Industry Development (Cyber Ecosystem Development) The roles and responsibilities of organizations in the national cyber ecosystem include the NCA, military and security organizations, civil government organizations, private sector organi- zations, the national community, and the international community. Four national cybersecurity frameworks were built to augment the Strategy and provide an es- sential foundation needed to achieve the national strategic goals. These are as follows: National Cybersecurity Incident Response Framework National Cybersecurity Capability Building Framework National Cybersecurity Risk Management Framework National Cybersecurity Information Sharing Framework 15 National Cybersecurity Strategy The Strategy will be implemented over a five-year period and is sequenced along three tracks consisting of 14 initiatives and 70 discrete projects. The three implementation tracks are as follows: Track #1: High-Return Projects Launching urgent specific projects that have a tangible impact in raising the cybersecurity ma- turity of the Kingdom. Track #2: Cybersecurity Catalyst Program Providing basic cybersecurity services to national organizations that raise the overall level of cybersecurity in the Kingdom. Track #3: National Initiatives Implementing a set of five-year national initiatives and projects with long-term strategic im- pacts. A set of key performance indicators (KPI) has been identified and constructed to measure progress against each of the national strategic goal areas (Unify, Manage, Assure, Defend, Part- ner, and Build) of the Strategy. The KPIs will be measured through a defined set of sub-indica- tors. To establish A resilient, secure, and trusted Saudi cyberspace that enables growth and prosperity, this Strategy will be implemented in collaboration with stakeholders across the Kingdom as well as under the relevant national authorities and with the leadership of the NCA.   Introduction 01 16 The strategy aims to direct national efforts into reinforcing the security of the Kingdom’s cyberspace 17 National Cybersecurity Strategy Cybersecurity is a critical national priority; it is vital to protecting the Kingdom’s economy and securing digital services and infrastructure. It is one of the main pillars needed to enable Vision 2030, considering growth in the Kingdom regarding the provision of digital services and spreading the use of technology. The Strategy aims to: • Direct national efforts into reinforcing the security of the Kingdom’s cyberspace by following secure practices needed to address new technology. • Protect national entities and critical national infrastructure information, data, and systems. • Build a capable cyber workforce. • Support and enable national organizations. • Facilitate private sector investment • Create an environment that fosters cybersecurity innovation. The Strategy considers the current cybersecurity environment and context and is informed by international data, events, variables, and trends as well the current shift towards a digital economy, the launch of the fourth industrial revolution, and the imminent arrival of 5G information and communications technology services. The impact of the growing emerging technologies, such as Internet-of-Things (IoT), has resulted in an expanded attack surface and increased risk levels. In the past, the impact of cyber attacks was often limited to data; however, today their impact on both society and the economy is far greater. Increase cybersecurity risk level Digital economy fourth industrial revolution 5G information and communication Internet of ings Introduction 18 National Cybersecurity Strategy Technical systems and infrastructure across countries are exposed to cyber risks. As such, the cost of cyber attacks will continue to grow at both the national and global level. This incentivizes countries to invest more resources to manage these risks. At the same time countries should capitalize upon opportunities to develop their digital infrastructure and foster economic prosperity. Thus, it is vital to implement and activate this Strategy to manage the Kingdom’s cyberspace in an integrated fashion. The Strategy’s vision, key principles, and national strategic goals will direct all cybersecurity activities in the Kingdom. It is expected that national organizations and the private sector will align their cybersecurity priorities with those of the Strategy. The NCA will facilitate interpretation of this Strategy, roles and responsibilities, and relevant frameworks where policies, governance mechanisms, standards, controls, guidelines, and indexes are drawn and implemented. This Strategy was built using a methodology, aligned to the Kingdom’s Vision 2030, inclusive of its themes, goals, programs, and frameworks. The alignment between the Kingdom›s Vision 2030 and the Strategy is as follows: • Increased interconnectedness of government. • E-services deliveredd digitally. • Agility and efficiency through technology.

The elements of the Strategy have been identified and include the basic principles of development and the Strategy’s vision and national strategic goals. The Strategy highlights the related national cybersecurity frameworks needed to operationalize the Strategy. It also provides an overview of roles and responsibilities for national organizations, including the action plan consisting of its implementation tracks, initiatives, projects, and KPIs. NCA will lead national efforts through this Strategy and work on improving the engagement, participation, and integration of national entities to achieve a secure and trusted Saudi cyberspace that enables growth and prosperity . Figure (2): Strategic Outcomes National Cybersecurity Strategy Methodology 02 20 21 National Cybersecurity Strategy The Strategy was established using a comprehensive approach consisting of six stages. It in- cluded analyzing the most critical global and national cybersecurity risks and a comprehensive reference framework covering the core domain areas of cybersecurity. The Kingdom’s cyberse- curity current state was examined in detail. The best global cybersecurity practices, expertise, and technologies were considered, compared to the Kingdom’s specific needs, and integrated into the Strategy – including the vision and national strategic goals that all national organiza- tions must aim to achieve as specified by their assigned cybersecurity roles and responsibilities and under the leadership of the NCA. The six steps leveraged to develop the Strategy are as follows: and measured through a robust yet simple set of KPIs …translated into action by tangible initiatives executed along an implementation roadmap… brought to life with a national Strategy, operating model, and capability plans informed by internal and global analyses to ensure the optimal Strategy for the Kingdom require a comprehensive National Cybersecurity Strategy Expanding digital opportunity and cyber threats Strategy Metrics 654321 Strategy Implementation Strategy Plans Strategy Inputs Strategy Framework Strategic Context Periodic Review National Cybersecurity Strategy Methodology Figure (3): National Cybersecurity Strategy Development 22 National Cybersecurity Strategy In order to set a practical model for the different domains of cybersecurity, A ref- erence model for the Kingdom was devel- oped based on national and international best practices and the most recent, relevant cybersecurity challenges the Kingdom faces today. This model establishes a structure to examine the most important cybersecurity areas at the national level. The model consists of six dimensions and 18 main cybersecurity elements. The model was used in a current state study of the King- dom’s cybersecurity. In addition, the model guided benchmarks of 20 nations, including countries with mature cybersecurity capabil- ities, which helped inform development the Strategy’s vision, national strategic goals, ini- tiatives, and projects. The reference model used to develop the Strategy is as follows: 2.1 Strategy Reference Model Risk Management Natl. Standards and Controls Natl. Perimeter DefenseNatl. EncryptionNatl.

Track #3: National Initiatives  Implementing a set of five-year national initiatives and projects with long-term strategic im-  pacts.     A set of key performance indicators (KPI) has been identified and constructed to measure   progress against each of the national strategic goal areas (Unify, Manage, Assure, Defend, Part-  ner, and Build) of the Strategy. The KPIs will be measured through a defined set of sub-indica-  tors.  To establish A resilient, secure, and trusted Saudi cyberspace that enables growth and prosperity,   this Strategy will be implemented in collaboration with stakeholders across the Kingdom as well   as under the relevant national authorities and with the leadership of the NCA.       Introduction  01  16  The strategy aims to   direct national efforts into   reinforcing the security of   the Kingdom’s cyberspace    17  National Cybersecurity Strategy  Cybersecurity is a critical national   priority; it is vital to protecting the Kingdom’s   economy and securing digital services and   infrastructure. It is one of the main pillars   needed to enable Vision 2030, considering   growth in the Kingdom regarding the   provision of digital services and spreading   the use of technology. The Strategy aims to:  • Direct national efforts into reinforcing   the security of the Kingdom’s cyberspace   by following secure practices needed to   address new technology.  • Protect national entities and critical   national infrastructure information,   data, and systems.  • Build a capable cyber workforce.  • Support and enable national   organizations.  • Facilitate private sector investment  • Create an environment that fosters   cybersecurity innovation.  The Strategy considers the current   cybersecurity environment and context and   is informed by international data, events,   variables, and trends as well the current   shift towards a digital economy, the launch   of the fourth industrial revolution, and   the imminent arrival of 5G information   and communications technology services.   The impact of the growing emerging   technologies, such as Internet-of-Things   (IoT), has resulted in an expanded attack   surface and increased risk levels. In the past,   the impact of cyber attacks was often limited   to data; however, today their impact on both   society and the economy is far greater.  Increase cybersecurity  risk level  Digital economy  fourth industrial revolution  5G information and communication  Internet of �ings  Introduction    18  National Cybersecurity Strategy  Technical systems and infrastructure across   countries are exposed to cyber risks. As   such, the cost of cyber attacks will continue   to grow at both the national and global   level. This incentivizes countries to invest   more resources to manage these risks. At   the same time countries should capitalize   upon opportunities to develop their   digital infrastructure and foster economic   prosperity.  Thus, it is vital to implement and activate   this Strategy to manage the Kingdom’s   cyberspace in an integrated fashion. The   Strategy’s vision, key principles, and national   strategic goals will direct all cybersecurity   activities in the Kingdom. It is expected that   national organizations and the private sector   will align their cybersecurity priorities with   those of the Strategy. The NCA will facilitate   interpretation of this Strategy, roles and   responsibilities, and relevant frameworks   where policies, governance mechanisms,   standards, controls, guidelines, and indexes   are drawn and implemented.  This Strategy was built using a methodology,   aligned to the Kingdom’s Vision 2030,   inclusive of its themes, goals, programs, and   frameworks. The alignment between the   Kingdom›s Vision 2030 and the Strategy is   as follows:  • Increased interconnectedness of     government. • E-services deliveredd digitally. • Agility and efficiency through    technology.

The elements of the Strategy have been   identified and include the basic principles   of development and the Strategy’s vision   and national strategic goals. The Strategy   highlights the related national cybersecurity   frameworks needed to operationalize   the Strategy. It also provides an overview   of roles and responsibilities for national   organizations, including the action plan   consisting of its implementation tracks,   initiatives, projects, and KPIs.  NCA will lead national efforts through   this Strategy and work on improving the   engagement, participation, and integration   of national entities to achieve a secure and   trusted Saudi cyberspace that enables growth   and prosperity .  Figure (2): Strategic Outcomes    National Cybersecurity  Strategy Methodology  02  20    21  National Cybersecurity Strategy  The Strategy was established using a comprehensive approach consisting of six stages. It in-  cluded analyzing the most critical global and national cybersecurity risks and a comprehensive   reference framework covering the core domain areas of cybersecurity. The Kingdom’s cyberse-  curity current state was examined in detail. The best global cybersecurity practices, expertise,   and technologies were considered, compared to the Kingdom’s specific needs, and integrated   into the Strategy – including the vision and national strategic goals that all national organiza-  tions must aim to achieve as specified by their assigned cybersecurity roles and responsibilities   and under the leadership of the NCA. The six steps leveraged to develop the Strategy are as   follows:  ...and measured  through a robust  yet simple set of   KPIs  …translated into  action by tangible   initiatives  executed along   an  implementation   roadmap…  ...brought to life  with a national   Strategy,  operating model,   and capability  plans...  ...informed by  internal and   global analyses  to ensure the   optimal Strategy  for the   Kingdom...  ...require a  comprehensive   National  Cybersecurity   Strategy...

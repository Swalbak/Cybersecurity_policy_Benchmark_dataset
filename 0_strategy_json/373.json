We have come a long way since the first adoption of the Internet back in 1995. Today, broadband connectivity has become a necessity for businesses, services and citizens of Malaysia to succeed and be relevant in the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). Hardly any person or thing is unconnected to cyberspace. Businesses are becoming deeply reliant on democratised technologies such as mobile, social, Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and hyper-scale cloud that are all dependant on this connectivity. INTRODUCTION Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-20244 Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 5 Anything connected to the internet is exposed to cyber risks. With this in mind, Malaysia needs to develop a cyber security strategy that is pragmatic and aims for a cyberspace that is secured, trusted and resilient while at the same time fostering economic prosperity and the well-being of its citizens. We believe that our vision can be achieved by fortifying local capabilities to predict, detect, deter and respond to cyber threats by strengthening our cyber security governance, nurturing competent people, supporting best practice processes and deploying effective technologies. Information sharing platforms, channels and avenues for government agencies, businesses and the general public on cyber security and cyber threats need to be enhanced. Our situational awareness, coordination, and threat mitigation capabilities likewise must be improved. We are indeed fast becoming a digitalised nation. In 2018 there are 28.7 million Internet users in Malaysia which represent 87.4% of the population. Such astounding figures illustrates our growing dependency and connectedness to cyberspace. On the other side, cyber-attacks have progressed just as fast as, or even faster than the security measures that were put in place. Governments now have to deal with cyber threats not just aimed at personal and financial gains, but also threats from state- sponsored actors aimed at critical targets of national importance. It is worth noting that state-sponsored attacks are not only sophisticated and potent, but once deployed, these advanced technologies can fall into the hands of cyber- criminals who can then amplify the use of these powerful cyber- weapons at global scale. The targets of malicious cyber activity are often the very foundation of a nation. Consequently Malaysia recognises cyber security as a national priority. This has led to the formulation of the National Cyber Security Policy (NCSP) in 2006. The NCSP was specifically developed to address the risks to the Critical National Information Infrastructure (CNII), which are made up of 10 sectors namely: National Defence and Security; Banking and Finance; Information and Communications; Energy; Transportation; Water; Health Services; Government; Emergency Services; and Food and Agriculture. The NCSP recognises the critical and highly interdependent nature of the CNII and aims to develop and establish a comprehensive programme and a series of frameworks that will ensure the effectiveness of cyber security controls over vital assets, as well as to ensure that the CNII sectors are protected to a level that commensurate with the risks faced. The establishment of the National Cyber Security Agency (NACSA) further reaffirmed the growing importance of cyber issues to Malaysia’s national security. NACSA is a dedicated agency that oversees all national cyber security functions formed under the aegis of the National Security Council (NSC). NACSA was established as a response to the dynamic nature, increasing sophistication, global nature and heighten socio- economic impact of cyber security threats. It serves as the lead agency that integrates the existing cyber security capabilities. This includes combating cybercrime in a strategic and coordinated manner in partnership with the private sector and other governments. The efforts are ongoing to assess the current legislative framework for cybercrime issues and cases. In order to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of cyberspace, existing laws need to be enhanced to effectively address the legal challenges in taking action against cyber criminals. The Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) led the review of the laws of Malaysia with a view to enhance the existing legislative and regulatory framework used to combat cybercrime. The amendments to certain laws are now in progress, where the AGC collaborates with law enforcement agencies and other relevant government bodies. Furthermore, a national policy and procedure in managing cyber crises has been formulated to ensure that cyber attacks and cyber incidents are being managed proactively through a coordinated approach at the national level. This initiative is closely guided by the National Security Council’s Directive No 24: Policy and Mechanism of the National Cyber Crisis Management, an executive directive that outlines the nation’s strategy for ‘cyber crisis mitigation and response’ through public and private collaboration and coordination. There are six (6) main principles under this directive namely national cyber crisis management structure; national cyber-threat levels; Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT); cyber security protection mechanisms; response, communication and coordination procedures; and a readiness programme. Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-20246 The government has also established the National Cyber Coordination and Command Centre (NC4), a centre that deals with cyber threats and crises at the national level. The NC4 was developed under the purview of the NACSA as a central coordination and command facility responsible for managing cyber security at the national level, including mitigation, preparedness and response functions at a strategic and tactical level. It is connected to the entire main cyber security-operating centre (SOC) in Malaysia namely MCMC Network Security Centre, Government Integrated Telecommunications Network (GITN) SOC, Cyber Defence Operation Centre (CDOC) and Cybersecurity Malaysia SOC. It has the ability to determine the national cyber security threat level and assess the impact of the threats to the country. Malaysia has also implemented the initiative to ensure the adoption and certification of the CNII agencies (public and private) to the MS ISO/IEC 27001: Information Security Management Systems standard and other related certifications. This initiative is to ensure the CNII agencies and organisations have the necessary information security protection in place and are in compliance with the standard. Appropriate measures will also be prepared to protect other non- CNII sectors such as the manufacturing, construction, education and retail since cyber threats and attacks in these sectors also pose risks to the overall economic wellbeing and security of the nation. Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 7 Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-20248 Another important cyber security initiative that has been conducted for the past decade is the National Cyber Crisis Exercise (also known as X-Maya). The exercise was designed to test the effectiveness of the procedures that have been developed under the National Cyber Crisis Management Plan (NCCMP) and to assess the readiness and preparedness of critical national infrastructure agencies against cyber-attacks. To date, six (6) national cyber crisis exercises have been organised with the participation from more than 100 public and private agencies across the 10 CNIIs. On another front, Malaysia has also been actively creating awareness and capacity building programmes. Whilst the rapid of ICT, bring benefits and advantages to our citizen, it is also carries risks to the nation’s economy, social harmony and security. To manage such risks, public awareness is crucial. Agencies have been carrying out various awareness programmes to educate Malaysians. As a mean to coordinate these programmes, NACSA is developing the National Cyber Security Awareness Master Plan. This Master Plan aims to increase the level of cyber security awareness among Malaysian Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 9 cyber citizens through concerted and effective programmes and initiatives. Under this Master Plan, four (4) main target groups, (kids, youth, adults/parents and organisations), were identified for specific cyber security awareness programmes and initiatives. This Master Plan outlines an implementation strategy to ensure it achieves its anticipated goals and objectives. To address the critical shortage of skilled cyber security professionals, a comprehensive capacity building plan on cyber security will be established riding on the existing initiatives with a more coordinated mechanism and clear measurement. It will start from the development of school curricula in cyber security; followed by focus- based skills at the institutions of higher learning; and training and skills development schemes for expert and non-experts in both public and private sectors. The government will further enhance the current initiatives especially the Centre of Excellence, a collaboration with the local universities to address the shortage of local talent in the cyber security workforce.

In the past, we have seen how the infrastructure of nations and businesses were brought down with significant financial implications. This is not a far-fetched scenario for Malaysia, especially if we refer to the results of a study conducted by Microsoft in collaboration with Frost & Sullivan on Understanding the Cybersecurity Threat Landscape in Asia Pacific : Securing the Modern Enterprise in a Digital World published in July 2018. The study revealed that the potential economic loss in Malaysia due to cyber security incidents could hit up to RM51 billion, which is more than 4% of the total Gross Domestic Product. As the foundations of our economy become increasingly rooted in digital technologies, Malaysia will model and promote standards that protect our economic security and reinforce the vitality of the nation as a viable marketplace and source of innovation. This will include, among others, the initiatives to promote local industry in emerging technologies and 5G. The Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy (MCSS) has been designed with tools to provide trust in our cyber environment not only for national security, but also to support the government agenda in the digital economy, Industry 4.0 and the adoption of other disruptive technologies for Malaysia’s advancement. This Strategy will replace the existing NCSP as it is developed to be more inclusive and comprehensive covering protection of CNII, businesses, industries and also citizen. This document includes specific Pillars to define key areas of our concern as well as the necessary strategies for each of them. Each strategy will in turn comprise of a number of action plans and measurement mechanisms that will be implemented within the effective period of this document. Regardless of those mechanisms we need to, we have to realistically remind ourselves that none of these strategies will be effective in combating cyber security issues without the cooperation from all stakeholders. Cyber threats are persistent and there will always be the risk of targeted cyberattacks of massive scale and consequences. Such threats can never truly be eradicated as long as everything stays connected. Yet, they can be mitigated. For this to happen, everyone will have to play their role and work together to enhance Malaysia’s overall cyber security readiness, capacity and capabilities.

In 2018, the Royal Malaysia Police had to deal with 10,742 cybercrime cases with an estimated loss amounting to almost RM400 million, while in 2019, the number has increased to 11,875 cases with an estimated loss to almost RM500 million. The numbers may be shocking to some but not if we consider the fact that cyber criminals these days are no longer conduct hacking merely out of curiosity or to test their intrusion and penetration skills, but also for economic gain.

In 2018, a total of 5,627 cyber security incidents were reported to the NC4 compared to 2,981 in 2017 and 2,429 a year before that. Malicious software infections top the rest with 2,244 cases, followed by intrusion attempts and actual intrusions at 2,076 and 1,270 cases, respectively. However, in 2019 the total number of incidents reported to NC4 has shown a significant decreased to 3,787 cases compared to 2018. This reflects the effectiveness of proactive measures that has been put in place to secure our cyberspace. 2016 49 1,754 228 372 0 26 2,429 2017 37 1,910 225 752 0 57 2,981 2018 19 1,270 2,076 2,244 15 3 5,627 2019 14 1,297 256 2,154 6 60 3,787 DOS / DDoS Intrusion Instrusion Attempt Malware Infection Malware Hosting Potential Attacks Cyber Security Incidents (2016 - 2019) Cybercrime Statistics (2018 & 2019) Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 15 Malaysia is also a target of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks, with the most recent incident manifested by way of email spear phishing. These threats can escalate further given that many Malaysian organisations continue to operate a number of legacy and unsupported systems, which can no longer be updated with the latest security patches. These legacy systems may have multiple vulnerabilities, which are susceptible to attack payloads and tools available to cyber criminals. There are also concerns about the increasing number of content- related issues in Malaysian cyberspace. While these incidents are relatively still small in number, the impact on the nation is not. Given the speedy and widespread nature of the Internet as a medium of delivery, the effects of content- related issues are potentially more detrimental and damaging. For this reason, Internet-based contents, in the form of fake news, misinformation, contents that are seditious and slanderous in nature, or with racial or religious overtones, are taken very seriously by the government, while respecting the right to freedom of speech. As Malaysia continues to embrace digital technologies, there is an increasing need to streamline the management of cybercrimes and incidents to assure the public that all cybercrimes and incidents will be handled appropriately and effectively by the respective law enforcement agencies. There is a need to eliminate duplicative efforts and maximise resource utilisation among the law enforcement agencies. One of the main reasons for the establishment of NACSA was to coordinate and complement all efforts on cyber security to make sure that all aspects are given due attention. While focusing on cyber security policy, governance and coordination matters, NACSA will also be administering other areas of concern, which will be mandated to specialised agencies. Efforts concerning other target areas, namely the CNII, cybercrime, awareness, capacity building and international cooperation will be delegated to Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202416 Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 17 selected groups of lead agencies, law enforcement arms and institutions that have the relevant expertise and direct responsibility, as well as the required capacity and capability to deal with the related issues and initiatives. In Cyber Security Ecosystem, NACSA will serve as the focal point on all matters related to cyber security that also spans vertically to include other existing and aligned national initiatives such as the Digital Infrastructure, Digital Trade, National Security, Digital Malaysia and Digital Government. NACSA serves as an entity that is responsible for streamlining all cyber security planning, development and implementation. To ensure the successful implementation of the strategy, an effective ecosystem and governance, this Strategy will outline the roles and responsibilities of agencies involved in managing national cyber security. This will be realised by legislating a new National Security Council’s Directive, which will elucidate our enhanced national cyber security governance arrangements and the restructuring of committees directly responsible for national cyber security, and delineating the exact roles and responsibilities of all relevant agencies.

To date, Internet-related fraud has been the most prevalent cyber threat in Malaysia. This is supported by the cybercrime reports received by Royal Malaysian Police in 2018 and 2019 which shows that telecommunication fraud, e-commerce, 419 scam (also known as Nigerian Scam) and e-financial fraud are among the most prominent threats. Such cases have been known to cause huge monetary losses to the victims. If this trend is sustained, Malaysians will project a greater concern in doing business through an online platform, which indirectly erodes the consumers’ confidence in our cyber security measures. Cybercrime Statistics By Offences (2018 & 2019) Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202420 However, it is important to note that lack of awareness is the main factor in most of these fraud cases. In phishing incidents, for example, people can be easily duped by bogus sites and services due to their negligence. The same goes for scams whereby unsuspecting victims would transfer huge amount of money to recipients whom they have never met and whose identity cannot be verified – all done for the expectation of an honest purchase, attractive investments and even promises of love. On another alarming note, the healthcare sector now has other cyber threat concerns that are even more worrying than the attacks and intrusions on electronic medical records. Medical robotic technology and robot-assisted surgical procedures are now connected to computer systems and networks which expose them to cyber threats. As the patient records are digitised, the risks of breach and disclosure of confidential information are also rampant. Clearly, much has to be done in terms of creating awareness among the general public. This would explain why cyber security education will soon be introduced even as early as in primary education. Cyber security awareness and education aims to educate citizens from making errors of judgement while transacting on the Internet. Aside from that, Malaysia is also facing a shortage in its cyber security workforce and talent gaps in many sectors. In today’s constantly connected and borderless world, such inadequacy can be disastrous Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 21 to organisations. The shortage of cyber security professionals will leave organisations vulnerable and exposed to untold dangers from cyberspace. Insider threats also remain a significant cyber security risk to organisations. Insiders with access to critical information systems and data pose a significant threats to any organisations. There have been numerous cases of intellectual property theft and the leaking of sensitive information that have caused substantial financial and reputational damage. There were also incidents where these insiders, either employees or vendors, unknowingly became victims of elaborate cybercrime schemes such as through watering hole attacks, social engineering ploys, malware and ransomware infections, propagation mechanism by inserting infected USB devices into the internal networks or arbitrarily clicking on links found in emails or while browsing the Internet. The government via its relevant agencies and initiatives will have to approach organisations and institutions on best cyber security practices. More efforts have to be made to encourage Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202422 necessary controls over system and data access by employees and vendors. The implementation of a proper Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy should be deployed by organisations and institutions. Again, awareness also plays an important role here in mitigating incidents due to insider threats, especially for those at the management tier. Additionally, the correct posture and approach are needed in dealing with the selection of third parties/vendors, planning, development and implementation of ICT projects, especially those that involve or intended for critical establishments such as an Industrial Control System (ICS) for CNII agency. Security-by-Design should be the flagship approach in ICT project development in order to ensure that the end products and systems are free of vulnerabilities and not susceptible to cyber threats. This can only be achieved through continuous testing, authentication safeguards and adherence to best practices. Malaysia has also been facing threats of terrorism and violent extremism. Terrorists and violent extremists have been using various web services and social media as a breeding ground to entice new Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 23 Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202424 recruits, followers and supporters to their causes. Continuous efforts have been made to curb such threats and there have been successful convictions in recent years. Yet the ease of developing a new website or forum for any agenda presents a growing challenge to law enforcement agencies. These issues are complex due to the varying interpretation of what would and should be considered as amounting to terrorism or violent extremism. There has been a dire need of manpower and expertise to monitor and correctly identify web contents that would fall under this category. There are also other obstacles including this content which is usually hosted by providers that are beyond our jurisdiction. The lack of awareness among the general public concerning these types of resources reduces the incidents of timely reporting of this content. Content-related issues, on the other hand, bring a new level of complexity to the challenges of cyberspace. Some issues concerning pornography and harmful content such as online gambling, information on illegal substances, instructions to make firearms, and misleading and false information, require a coordinated and swift effort and commitment by all parties, which in this case would be agencies and institutions that are directly responsible for network accessibilities. Removal or restriction of access to content that is deemed as harmful by Malaysian law must be pursued. There is also the issue of differing perspectives on content that may be perceived as either hate speech or seditious, or an appropriate expression of free speech. This is often the case for politically-motivated postings on blogs and social media. While there have been successful convictions from time to time, the creation and spreading of content of this nature does not seem to be lessening, and if anything, they seem to flourish correspondingly to the actual situation of the counterpart issues in the real world. Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 25 Concerns over the misuse of user personal data are increasing at all levels of society. Citizens are now more vigilant on how and what personal information is shared. The Personal Data Protection Act 2010 has also helped to clarify what would be considered as encroaching user privacy by entities collecting user information. Greater effort is needed to take strong action against those that do not act appropriately to protect personal data. On the technological side, threats due to vulnerabilities and cyber- attacks are consistently increasing. This is very much due to lack of awareness among users, both in government institutions and business entities; and among individuals. Good cyber hygiene habits - such as creating complex passwords, consistently backing up data, regularly updating and upgrading software and hardware, and limiting privileged access to critical systems - are still lacking among public and private sector users. All things considered, we believe that it is rather fair to assume that the prevailing issues and challenges in Malaysia’s cyber security landscape can be attributed to, first and foremost, awareness and education. Technological solutions and controls can only do so much – it is the netizens themselves that need to have a basic grasp of cyber security essentials and related legislation and regulations so that they can at least avoid the most common pitfalls, particularly while navigating cyberspace. Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202426 STRATEGIC PILLARS STRATEGIC PILLARS Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy outlines our key objectives, categorised into five strategic Pillars that will govern all aspects of cyber security planning and implementation in Malaysia until 2024. The Strategy is focused on the three overriding success factors for interrelated and interdependent organisational change, namely People, Process and Technology. For this purpose, People represents the need for knowledge, skill and expertise enhancements as well as capacity and capability building among the human capital of the digital era. Process covers the development and strengthening, and implementation and maintenance of laws, regulations, procedures and guidelines to effectively govern our cyberspace. Technology covers the technology required for effective cyber security implementation. The Strategy also describes a number of action plans aimed at increasing cyber security in various sectors of the government, businesses and society. These action plans will be measured accordingly to assess their effectiveness. The five Pillars outlined in this Strategy have been identified as crucial for achieving Malaysia’s goals of protecting government and CNII networks, system and data, as well as businesses and citizens, while at the same time combatting cybercrime. Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202428 1 EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT Experience has taught Malaysia that the most important measure to safeguard cyberspace is effective governance and management. The management of cyber security risks should evolve simultaneously with the evolution of threats, alongside the adoption of digital in doing business. Ideally, we need a national standard on governance and management, which allows for shared responsibility and cross-sectional integration to optimise the efforts in dealing with any issues, threats or breaches. Effective Governance and Management Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202430 Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 31 To improve national resilience against cyber threats, an active cyber defence approach which ranges from Advanced Persistent Threat to cybercrimes and content-related threats is needed. This approach will include both the defensive and offensive capabilities to effectively mitigate cyber threats, focusing on the capability to detect, analyse, and act upon any cyber threats within our cyber defence ecosystem. In the quest to achieve greater resilience, Malaysia needs a functional governance and management system that is agile, adoptable and ready to cater for the challenges of the digital era (and beyond). It has to have the necessary framework and action plans in place, creating a partnership within the ecosystem that will foster close collaborations among stakeholders, including relevant government entities, law enforcement agencies, businesses and industry leaders. Such partnerships will be made possible through the establishment of appropriate platforms for information sharing, strategy- building and resource sharing to form a strong national cyber workforce to manage the ever evolving and ever increasing cyber-related issues and incidents. This Pillar aims to create effective governance and management through three strategic initiatives, specifically by: This Pillar aims to achieve the ability to defend our networks, data and systems from cyber threats and subsequently respond to threats effectively in a well- coordinated and concerted manner. Equally imperative is the ability to predict and detect, investigate and disrupt hostile actions against the government, businesses and citizens of Malaysia. To achieve this, the government shall play the crucial role of ensuring that all action plans are properly implemented by the intended entities. In order to enhance the national cyber security governance framework, we will strengthen governance structures by clearly defining the roles and responsibilities of all parties within the ecosystem. This can be accomplished by reviewing the current roles and responsibilities held by the existing cyber security stakeholders in Malaysia. Recognising the critical and highly interdependent nature of CNII organisations from both the government and private sectors in managing cyber security risks and incident responses, the government will continue to clarify the roles and responsibilities of the respective organisations as technologies evolve to ensure the CNII are protected to a level that commensurates with the risks faced. Improving organisation management and business operations among the government, CNII and business entities Strengthening cyber security incident management and active cyber defence Enhancing national cyber security governance and ecosystem Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202432 We will also identify and bridge gaps in responsibilities and coordination among agencies and sector leads in managing incident response by enhancing threat information sharing platforms. At present, there are various cyber security stakeholders in Malaysia in the form of law enforcement agencies and other government bodies with varying degrees of roles, jurisdiction, competence and functions in the cyber security governance value chain. Agencies such as the MCMC, MDEC and CyberSecurity Malaysia focus on regulating the communications and multimedia industry, driving the digital economy and providing ICT security specialist services, respectively. Others like the Royal Malaysia Police and the Central Bank of Malaysia lean more towards law enforcement. Whereas parent institutions such as the Ministry of Communications and Multimedia Malaysia and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry oversee the bigger picture and implementation of policies. For the purpose of improving the national cyber security ecosystem, all these resources must be pulled together and work side by side via a multi-agency coordination protocol with streamlined processes and procedures, and a well-defined scope of authority and accountability. To achieve this agenda, the government has established NACSA to serve as the central agency for cyber security in Malaysia. At the moment, development and enhancement efforts are now in place to equip NACSA with the necessary capabilities to provide leadership and guidance to all cyber security organisations that will fall under its coordination. In this respect, NACSA will be directly responsible in overseeing the establishment and operations of various information sharing platforms among the various stakeholders. It will also be at the forefront in the identification and management of risks and vulnerabilities that are of significance and concern to the national cyber security ecosystem. Subsequently, NACSA will be the focal point for the implementation of proactive measures to protect the government and CNII agencies’ networks, systems and data and to improve inter- agency coordination to combat cybercrime. The NC4 will be the main hub of all other Cyber Operation Centres in Malaysia. NC4’s capability to predict, detect, deter and respond will be further intensified, strengthened and enhanced to address cyber-security related issues. Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 33 Even though the government has led many initiatives to improve the current cyber security landscape, it requires the cooperation and collaboration of all stakeholders to achieve the mission to secure our cyberspace and provide a safer environment for all Malaysians. An embedded and sustainable approach is needed whereby citizens, industry and other partners in the society and government, play their full part in securing the networks, services and data. Therefore, efforts will also be taken to enhance collaboration and build trust among government and CNII agencies, businesses and partners through information sharing and Public-Private Partnerships. To facilitate this, we will provide the engagement programmes and information sharing platforms, such as conducting conferences, seminars, workshops and dialogues where all the stakeholders, including Chief Executive Officers, Chief Financial Officers, Chief Information Officers, Chief Security Officers and Chief Information Security Officers could share their knowledge, thoughts, experiences and proposals. Such collaboration would pave the way for an appropriate and systematic sharing mechanism and platform on actionable cyber threat information, enhancements of cyber security coordination and the promotion of analytical and technical exchanges between subject matter experts. A change management plan will also be prepared and subsequently introduced to organisations that are involved to streamline changes and improvements that are required to be in place to support the envisioned governance structure. Also, in order to provide the necessary mechanism and structure for effective Clear roles and responsibilities Well coordinated and conserted approach Close cooperation and collaboration Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202434 coordination, information and media management, we will be working towards establishing the National Communication Plan. This Plan is necessary to describe the requirements of an information channel that is both capable and quick to accommodate for information sharing during a cyber crisis or incident and will also serve as the main reference to explain the roles and responsibilities of all related agencies with regards to media management. These are especially crucial given the rapid advancements of the digital age that foresee the expansions of e-government initiatives, e-commerce transactions and digital economy in our daily lives. This is with the inclusion of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning in modern systems, the increasing application of IoT in devices and peripherals, and the extensive use of complex Industrial Control Systems. All of which inadvertently would open up even more avenue for potentials risks and threats to security, safety and privacy. In essence, Pillar 1 initiatives will cover the protection of the CNII sectors, with support and guidance for businesses and individuals to mitigate cyber threats. Recognising the importance of digital economy, the government will include Trade, Industry and Economy as one of the CNII sectors. Focus will be made on the development of sector specific guidelines and frameworks, such as maritime and aviation to accommodate current cyber security needs and address the emerging threats, with a key attention on the convergence of Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) systems. Hence, a government-led Technical Working Group will be established to spearhead an in- depth study on laws, rules and regulations as well as standards and best practices in cyber security that have to be adhered to by the CNII agencies. The government will also create a training platform to assist participating organisations in complying with cyber security standards. The government will work together with private sector entities to promote understanding of cyber security risks, encourage a more informed risk management decisions, and advocate investments in appropriate security measures. This will serve as an effective platform of cooperation between various public and private sectors thus ensuring that business entities and organisations, as well as citizens, adopt the security-centric norms, behaviour and practices that are required to stay safe in cyberspace. Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 35 CNII: 11 SECTORS National Defence and Security Information and Communication Banking and Finance Transportation Energy Health Services Water Emergency Services Government Agriculture and Plantation Trade, Industry and Economy We will establish a data leakage protection mechanism through the adoption and implementation of policies, procedures and guidelines related to data protection, public key infrastructure and electronic information management. This will be realised through the development of data leakage protection policy and guidelines as well as the execution of the National Cryptography Policy, which outlines the methods and strategic approach in the use and creation of cryptographic algorithms and cryptography products to protect information that are of national interest. Management of vendors that deal with government and CNII agencies will also be improved to minimise data privacy and security risks. Awareness initiatives will be conducted on supply chain threats. Supply chain security management will be integrated into agency procurement and risk management process. Vendors, products and services shall be assessed to identify those with high risk and mitigated accordingly. Third parties that are awarded with government projects, especially on ICT, will be required to adhere to information security standards and practices such as the International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission’s ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and ISO/IEC 27002:2013 as well as having the necessary cyber security and information security experts in place. Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202436 Management of the Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) will also be improved and strengthened through the enhancement and restructuring of National Cyber Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT), Sector CSIRT and Organisation CSIRT. These CSIRTs will be provided with the necessary capabilities and capacity to handle, mitigate and recover from cyber crisis and incidents. Furthermore, cyber incident reporting will be made mandatory for all government and CNII agencies, while businesses will be encouraged to report them. We will also develop a Vulnerability Assessment Implementation Plan and conduct periodic risk and vulnerability assessment on all critical ICT services. We will measure the National Readiness Level through periodically- conducted studies. The government will draw on its capabilities to develop and apply active cyber defence measures to enhance the levels of cyber security readiness across national and government networks. Cyber security courses, content and syllabuses will be developed for government training programmes and for specific target groups that will be identified based on their roles and responsibilities. All existing training platforms will be utilised to establish main training centres that can cater for these target groups and properly meet their needs and requirements in capacity and capability building efforts. Sector specific guideline Laws, rules and regulations Standards compliance Best practices Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 37 Cyber security incident management will also be enhanced through the revision of the National Cyber Crisis Management Plan (NCCMP) and its reporting mechanism by the first quarter of 2021. Cyber exercises at the organisational, sectoral and national levels will be implemented according to the Cyber Exercise Implementation Plan, of which the findings will greatly contribute to the preparation of the Cyber Readiness Report, planned to be delivered by end of 2021. Combatting terrorists and violent extremists’ use of the Internet will continue to be a priority area, with the main objectives of: raising awareness among the public; and preventing radicalisation and terrorist recruitment and fund- raising activities through digital platforms such as social media and web portals. The Southeast Asia Regional Centre for Counter- Terrorism (SEARCCT) and the Royal Malaysia Police will continue to play their role in monitoring violent extremist activities in cyberspace. An integrated information sharing platform shall be developed to facilitate flow of information between agencies and towards the general public. Ultimately, under this Pillar, it is expected that a new national cyber security governance structure with a clear division of power and responsibilities is built based on the foundations and principles set forth by the National Security Council’s Directive. The implementation of the Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy will be supervised through an annual evaluation process, after which a Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy landscape report will be prepared and presented to the stakeholders for milestone reviews and further deliberations.

Since the 1990s, Malaysia has introduced numerous laws to cater for the advent of digital age and the full spectrum of cyber issues. Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202444 DIRECT SALES AND ANTI-PYRAMID SCHEME ACT 1993 Sedition Act 1948 Criminal Procedure Code Defamation Act 1957 Official Secrets Act 1972 Penal Code Evidence Act 1950 Prevention of Crime Act 1959 Trade Marks Act 1976 Patents Act 1983 Direct Sales and Anti-Pyramid Scheme Act 1993 Digital Signature Act 1997 Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 Copyright Act 1987 Computer Crimes Act 1997 Telemedicine Act 1997 Consumer Protection Act 1999 Optical Discs Act 2000 Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 2002 Capital Market and Services Act 2007 Child Act 2001 Film Censorship Act 2002 Electronic Commerce Act 2006 Electronic Government Activities Act 2007 Personal Data Protection Act 2010 Financial Services Act 2013 Prevention of Terrorism Act 2015 Security Offences (Special Measures) Act 2012 Islamic Financial Services Act 2013 Sexual Offences Against Children Act 2017 EXISTING LAWS FOR CYBERCRIME AND CYBER SECURITY ISSUES IN MALAYSIA National Security Council Act 2016 Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 45 The Computer Crimes Act 1997 was enacted in 1997 to address crimes directed at computers and ICTs. This act covers offences such as unauthorised access to computer material and unauthorised modification of computer contents. As technology evolves at a rapid pace, Malaysia recognises that there are areas in the laws which need to be reviewed to accommodate new technologies and to reflect new realities, especially in the cyber security domain. The emergence of new cyber threats pose new challenges. Consequently, Malaysia may need to consider mechanisms to enable existing laws to be applied in cyberspace, and, only if required, enact new laws. The first order of this Pillar is to study and review all the existing laws and regulations that have been used to deal with cybercrime and cyber security cases. Findings of said efforts will not only pave the way for us to appropriately update the existing legislation and regulation but will also help us introduce a new law in cyber security, if deemed necessary. Malaysia is fully aware that cybercrime requires a coordinated and cooperative international response. The cross-border nature of cybercrime creates challenges in bringing cyber criminals justice. Recognising that effective regional and international cooperation is crucial in combating cybercrime, Malaysia will continue enhancing regional and international co- operation through existing bilateral Enhancing Malaysia’s cyber laws in addressing current and emerging threats Enhancing the capacity and capability of cybercrime enforcement This Pillar aims to strengthen cyber security legislation and enforcement through two strategic initiatives, specifically by: Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202446 and multilateral cooperation platforms. Malaysia is also striving to strengthen and harmonise domestic legislation with international conventions and treaties. Malaysia recognises that the challenge presented by cybercrime also requires a coordinated and an integrated national approach. Law enforcement agencies need to work together to address the threats. Malaysia will be taking steps to enhance the capacity and capability of law enforcement agencies to tackle cybercrime by developing and implementing the National Cybercrime Enforcement Plan (NCCEP). Under this Plan, efforts will be taken to increase the knowledge and skill of judiciary members, prosecutors, law enforcement officers and legal practitioners so as to prepare them for the intricacies of cybercrimes in the digital era. An expert group will also be established to identify gaps and required improvements in cybercrime enforcement. Furthermore, we also need to foster better collaboration between government agencies and key stakeholders including telecommunication companies, Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 47 industries, Internet service providers as well as content providers both at national and international levels. Law enforcement agencies will be equipped with the latest tools and capability for the identification of criminals / malicious parties; and the identification, collection, acquisition and preservation of digital evidence. Digital forensic labs will be enhanced to address the growing complexity of cybercrime investigation. We will also ensure that the tools and technology, as well as capability enhancements for each law enforcement agency are accredited, directly related and the best available to accommodate the type of cybercrime cases that they handle. A national working group on capacity building and joint collaboration with various training institutions will be established in order to develop specific modules of training and the mechanisms to assess the effectiveness of such training. The Plan also calls for a clear and streamlined coordination process among central and enforcement agencies. For this purpose, a Cybercrime Coordination Centre will be established. The Centre will focus on ensuring an integrated and coordinated approach in addressing cybercrime. This approach is timely since fighting cybercrime requires concerted efforts. In order to achieve effective investigation and successful prosecution of cybercrime, a team of experts, consisting of investigating officers and forensic experts, should be established at the initial stage of the investigation to address and advise on specific issues arising during the investigation process. The Centre will also serve as a central information sharing mechanism between law enforcement agencies to increase efficiency and to minimise delay in investigation. Such endeavours follows the study on the requirements for the establishment of more cyber courts. The first cyber court was established in September 2016, and was aimed at addressing the increasing number of civil and criminal cyber cases. The dedicated cyber court will ensure that cyber cases receive priority with adequate levels of expertise, which will translate into efficiency in disposal of cyber cases. The government will also examine the feasibility and viability of establishing a specific unit that Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202448 combines elements from all of the various government agencies that have been dealing with cyber security cases and incidents under one roof in order to streamline our actions and reactions. A comprehensive Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) also needs to be developed and endorsed to serve as a guide for law enforcement agencies in investigating cybercrime. This is particularly important as cybercrime have expanded well beyond the virtual domains and now even interconnected with other type of criminal activities such as human trafficking, drug smuggling and illicit recruitment whereby ICT tools are used as an information, communication and coordination platform. Other than fostering collaborations between local law enforcement agencies, the Plan will also explore the possibility of furthering cooperation with foreign counterparts. This could include cross-border secondments or visiting experts’ programmes. It is hoped that through these efforts, more can be shared between like- minded national agencies and experts in dealing with cyber security issues and challenges that are common to all and borderless in nature. Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 49 Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202450 Enhancing Malaysia’s Cyber Laws to Address Current and Emerging Threats To enhance and review current legal frameworks to address cybercrime To study the need to introduce a new law on cyber security • • Enhancing the Capacity and Capability of Cybercrime Enforcement To strengthen cybercrime enforcement capacity and capability in managing cybercrime, advanced threats and organised syndicates • STRATEGY 4 STRATEGY 5 SUMMARY PILLAR 2: Strengthening Legislative Framework and Enforcement CYBERCRIME COORDINATION CENTRE National Cybercrime Enforcement Plan Enforcement Agencies Industries Telcos Expert Groups Cyber Security Act Knowledge and Skill Comprehensive SOP Coordinated and an Integrated National Approach Enhancing regional and international cooperation through existing bilateral and multilateral cooperation Strengthen cybercrime enforcement capacity & capability in managing cybercrime, advanced threats and organised syndicates Review existing laws Adequate Tools Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 51 3 CATALYSING WORLD CLASS INNOVATION, TECHNOLOGY, R&D AND INDUSTRY Catalysing World Class Innovation, Technology, R&D and Industry To ensure self-reliance and encourage economic growth, the government plans to spur innovative cyber security technology research and development (R&D) by local industry players through the development of the National Cyber Security Research and Development Roadmap and creating a conducive domestic environment for innovation and R&D. The key objective of the Roadmap is to spearhead innovation in the areas of cyber security, safety and privacy protection. Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202454 Towards this end, we will establish a R&D collaboration platform between the government, academia and industry with the objective of generating local innovations and scaling-up existing cyber security technology solutions. This will not only address current cyber security challenges, but also drive local industry to compete and thrive at the global level. MIMOS Berhad is well positioned to spearhead this initiative since it has been very active and productive in driving R&D in Cyber security, together with partners from the academia, industry and government, for more than two decades. Key areas of R&D include: • Privacy enhancing technology; • Digital signature; • Digital identity; • Entity authentication; • Encryption algorithm; and • Cyber physical security Technologies developed have been incorporated into various systems to provide higher security posture, for example Malaysian Health Data Warehouse, Government Online Services Gateway, National Cyber Coordination and Command Centre, and the National Digital ID Proof-of-Concept. Appropriately, this Pillar aims to catalyse world class innovation, technology, R&D and industry in building and strengthening the cyber security innovation ecosystem in Malaysia through two strategic initiatives, specifically by: Spurring the National Cyber Security R&D Programme Promoting a competitive local industry and technology Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 55 The National Cyber Security Research and Development Roadmap, which will take into consideration of the maturity of R&D initiatives, will be formulated after identifying the priority areas and the prevailing gaps. The Roadmap will outline short- term, medium-term and long- term planning to address security challenges and opportunities brought forward by current and emerging technologies. The Roadmap will be further supported by the establishment of a shared Centre of Excellence. Specialised programmes will be established to produce more local talent and contribute towards a sustainable and vibrant R&D community. Collaborations will also be fostered between universities, educational institutions, industries and key government stakeholder to help design, create and introduce more industry-oriented courses and specialisations and thereby increase the number of marketable university graduate students in cyber security-related fields of study. Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202456 To promote the creation of local technologies and a competitive local industry, we plan to nurture existing companies and create new ventures, supported by the Public- Private Partnership establishment of a Cyber Security Start-Up Hub. The Hub will help to understand and address local cyber security challenges so that companies or start-ups could in turn develop solutions and services that are relevant and ready to serve local needs and subsequently scale up to meet global requirements. The Hub will also provide incentives and appropriate platforms for companies to share information. The Hub will assist companies with marketing their products locally and globally. A national programme will facilitate adoption of locally developed cyber security products, solutions and services within critical national infrastructure. There will also be a notable expansion of funding, through additional government grants and incentives, to help promote the acceptance and adoption of locally developed cyber security products, solutions and services by CNII organisations, including government agencies and private sector organisations.

Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202462 Correspondingly, this Pillar aims to enhance capacity and capability building, awareness and education through three strategic initiatives, specifically by: The Plan will be implemented by building coherent cross- sector collaboration in strategic information sharing and security awareness initiatives, deepening the understanding of advanced threats, developing a culture that understands security risks in the context of business resiliency and expanding the capability to develop a safer and more resilient technology, as well as the ability to respond to advanced threats. Malaysia has been developing and implementing cyber security capacity and capability through various ministries, agencies and CNII organisations. Enhancements of national cyber security capacity and capability will be focused on increasing the number of local skilled professionals through training and certification programmes to meet the demands for skilled workforce in both the public and private sectors. Specialist skill development, on the other hand, requires pursuing good quality and established security professional certifications primarily in specific areas of cyber security domain, that are lacking in the country. Meanwhile, awareness and education would require, among other things, the identification of necessary target audiences and content development approaches that can enable resource sharing and collaboration. The government, through its various agencies, will take up the crucial role of empowering all levels of society to understand cyber security-related risks and challenges, as well as the necessary defensive measures needed for safer Internet use. Enhancing national cyber security capacity and capability Enhancing cyber security awareness Nourishing cyber security knowledge through education Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 63 The Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation, the lead agency for driving the digital economy in Malaysia, will spearhead efforts to increase the number of local skilled professionals, which will include talent development initiatives through new talent, up-skilling and re-skilling. The government will also provide additional funding and scholarships in order to encourage knowledge acquisition and enrichment among existing cyber security professionals. This will help develop a new generation of a cyber security professionals, with the necessary education and skills. Currently, CyberSecurity Malaysia has started its efforts to increase the number of local cyber security professionals through the implementation of Global Accredited Cybersecurity Education (ACE) Scheme. It is a holistic professional certification scheme established indigenously to certify and recognise cyber security personnel in tandem with ISO/IEC 17024 on people certifications, ISO/ IEC 9000 on processes and ISO/IEC 27001 on security management. Ehance capacity at national sectoral organisation New talent up-skilling and re-skilling Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202464 Realising that cyber security is about human interaction and attitude towards technology, we will need to inculcate the importance of adhering to cyber hygiene practices among government and CNII entities, businesses and the general public. Currently, there are various cyber security awareness initiatives undertaken by relevant agencies or organisations through various approaches and target groups. Increase the number of local skilled professionals through training and certification programmes Adhering to cyber hygiene practices To name a few; • NACSA has published the 10 Easy Steps for Cyber Security Awareness that outlines all of the most sensible practices in cyberspace; • Malaysian Modernisation and Management Planning Unit (MAMPU) has been organising cyber security awareness programmes for public sector such as the Cyber Security Awareness Month and Public Sector ICT Security Conference; • Royal Malaysia Police through the Be Smart campaign ensures the community are more aware and cautious about cybercrime; • Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission has organised various programmes under the Klik Dengan Bijak® initiative, a media and digital literacy initiative to nurture positive and responsible Internet use among ICT users based on the Rukun Negara together with its strategic partners including the Ministry of Communications and Multimedia Malaysia, Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of Education (MOE), Ministry of Women, Family and Community Development (MWFCD), Royal Malaysia Police, Communications and Multimedia Ehance capacity at national sectoral organisation New talent up-skilling and re-skilling Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 65 Forum of Malaysia (CMCF) as well as civil society partners such as United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), Scouts Association of Malaysia, Malaysian Youth Council and others; • Ministry of Health also has come out with Semak Sebelum Klik campaign; • Chief Government Security Office (CGSO) through the Protective Security Training Centre provides ICT security awareness courses to government officer as part of its annual cyber security awareness programme; • CyberSecurity Malaysia in collaboration with MOE and DiGi Telecommunications Sdn. Bhd. runs the CyberSAFE campaign to nurture positive and responsible Internet use among ICT users; and • Central Bank of Malaysia has been raising awareness to all banking users on online fraud and safety tips for Internet banking services. Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202466 These commendable initiatives at the same time are experiencing challenges in terms of resources, coverage, approaches and target groups that have hindered the effectiveness of the implementation. To enhance Malaysia’s approach on cyber security awareness, the government will develop and implement the National Cyber Security Awareness Master Plan. Under the Plan, the National Cyber Security Awareness Governance structure will be established, which aims to develop an integrated and concerted cyber security awareness programme. The primary aim of the integrated programme is to reduce the number of cyber incidents by running cyber security awareness programmes and call for actions that are more organised, coordinated and able to reach a wider target audience among Malaysians. The Plan will outline integrated initiatives on public-private driven collaboration and coordination, and the mobilisation of resources Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 67 to enable a wider outreach of programmes to kids, youth, adults/parents and organisations. Initiatives by various agencies will also be implemented in an integrated and coordinated manner to ensure a wider coverage and bigger impact. This will be crucial to educating citizens on the necessary knowledge to detect and avoid abuse, fraud and crime online, as well as to nurture accountable behaviour, thereby creating well-informed and responsible cyber citizens. At the same time, we will also be working on establishing a creative content development programme mechanism that brings together all the stakeholders, from both the public and private sectors, to share their experience and best practices on creating awareness. It is hoped that a unified national brand of cyber security awareness programme can then be developed, one which streamlines the content of various awareness programmes based on the accepted security baseline framework. A corresponding measurement mechanism will also be appropriately devised to evaluate the effectiveness of said programmes and to identify ways to improve them from time to time. Cyber security will also become part of the syllabi at the primary, secondary and tertiary level of education. Given the increasing threats from cyberspace and the all-embracing nature of ICT and the Internet, especially among the younger generation of Malaysians, we believe that it is never too early to introduce and foster cyber security awareness. Our youth needs to be equipped with the necessary cyber security knowledge and tools to ensure safety and security. In academia, there is a need to embed cyber security across taught courses under ICT and Computer Engineering programmes. As an example, cyber security requirements need to be taught in Software Programming (secure coding), Software and System Development Cycle (Secure SDLC), Database, Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202468 Operating Systems, Network, IT Administration and Management, as well as cross platform application development. This effort is in addition to the present dedicated cyber security related courses being taught in colleges and universities. The same effort of introducing cyber security related issues across non-ICT or non-Engineering disciplines covering cyber law in Law, FinTech in Finance, security risk management of network ready medical devices in Health, among others, is necessary to enable graduates to stay relevant and to be able to grasp the impact of new technological developments. Within the Public Service Department, there is a need to establish cyber security as a vertical (grade) in the government sector to enable specialisation in the various domains under information security and to enable retention of these trained personnel within their expertise by providing sufficient opportunities for career growth.

Global collaborations, including information and knowledge sharing, as well as international cooperation and enforcement, are crucial to effectively counter evolving cyber threats. The nature of the Internet – which is ambiguous and anonymous – may contribute to the misperception, misinterpretation and misrepresentation of cyber threats or attacks, leading to potential escalation or tension between states. As such, it is imperative to instil trust and transparency between states through close international cooperation on cyber issues. Strengthening Global Collaboration Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202474 International engagement is also pivotal to combat cross-border threats and attacks involving multiple jurisdictions. Strong international engagement plays important roles in addressing the challenge, particularly in expediting cross-border enforcement activities. Fostering global collaboration is thus a key component of this strategy. Malaysia needs to engage with other trusted international entities to strengthen cooperation that is mutually beneficial, while respecting state boundaries and sovereignty. While establishing or enhancing cooperation will significantly strengthen relationships, Malaysia is also committed to adhering to the international commitments and obligations with regard to cyber security (where appropriate), be it at regional, sub-regional or multilateral level. Malaysia also recognises the need to build capacity in cyber diplomacy. Strengthening international collaboration and cooperation in cyber security affairs Demonstrating Malaysia's commitment in promoting a secure, stable and peaceful cyberspace to uphold international security For that reason, this Pillar aims to strengthen global collaboration through two strategic initiatives specifically by: Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 75 The primary element in accomplishing the first strategic initiative is through embedding cyber security as a key priority in our foreign policy. The development of a cyber security international engagement plan will be the next step – it will enable Malaysia to enhance and coordinate its international engagement across government. A dedicated working group will be established to develop this plan. Having a comprehensive plan will only be beneficial if the government machinery responsible for implementation is well equipped with appropriate skills and knowledge. Hence, the relevant government agencies will work together to embed cyber security as one of the elements in our diplomatic and international affairs capacity building programme. The aim is to ensure that our diplomats around the globe have a clear understanding of key cyber security issues and knowledge of our national context. Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202476 Malaysia will continue to foster bilateral relations in cyber security with other nations and identified international organisations or industry players through the creation of official collaboration instruments either by Memorandum of Understandings, joint statements or legal instruments. The efforts will be followed through with practical collaborations such as knowledge sharing and transfers, joint R&D, technology transfers, information exchange and training, policy dialogues, jointly organised programme, and discussions on harmonisation of legislation. Malaysia will also continue to actively participate and contribute in regional, sub- regional and multilateral cyber security collaboration efforts through the United Nations (UN), the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its dialogue partners, the Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Commonwealth, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the Global Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 77 Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202478 Forum on Cyber Expertise (GFCE), the Asia-Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT), the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), the Council of Europe, and other international entities. Malaysia will innovate proposals on international cyber security cooperation tailored to the interest of the respective fora in collaboration with the identified partners. Concurrently, we will also promote international collaboration in both the public and private sectors, and establish strategic alliances with international partners and entities that share our vision. Malaysia will also strive to be at the forefront of international discussions by driving, chairing and hosting regional and international cyber security fora as well as conferences. We will intensify our efforts to disrupt the business model and infrastructure of organised crime through greater cross-border collaboration. We will learn from the successes and failures of others in policing and enforcing cyber security such as in dealing with infringements of copyright, computer-related fraud, child pornography, online gambling and violations of network security to help improve cyber security measures. Intelligence from trusted international partners on issues with implications to the nation, especially on critical national infrastructure, will be constantly monitored and responded to accordingly. Malaysia will also engage the international platforms, primarily in international standards development and ratification of treaties, to ensure that any new international cyber security norms being developed does not contradict our national interest. Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 79 To demonstrate Malaysia’s commitment in promoting a secure, stable and peaceful cyberspace with the aim of upholding international security as per the second strategic initiative, we will shape a concerted national position on key international cyber security issues particularly with regard to norms, rules and principles of responsible states’ behaviour, how international law applies in cyberspace, as well as Confidence Building Measures (CBMs). With regard to CBMs, Malaysia aims to intensify efforts in driving CBMs within ASEAN in collaboration with identified dialogue partners with a view to elevate trust and confidence between states in cyberspace. In taking the steps toward realizing Malaysia’s commitments in international cooperation, we will also constantly review and assess the effectiveness of efforts and investments that have been made thus far. In the long run, we aspire to be recognised and seen as a country that promotes and upholds international stability in cyberspace based on the existing international agreements on all of these matters.

We are confident that this can be accomplished by strengthening our capabilities to predict, detect, deter and respond to cyber threats. Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202484 In the face of constantly changing cyber threats, Malaysia needs to be prepared, more than ever, to protect its national security and sovereignty. Although the global community agrees on the importance of cyber threats, there are still continuing discussions at the regional and international levels as to how to effectively combat them. There will always be questions on how far a nation can or should go in responding to what it perceives as a threat to its national security and sovereignty, and the complexities surrounding such a situation when the cyber incidents are cross-border in nature. The Malaysian government will strive to meet its responsibilities and lead the national response; however, businesses, organisations and individual citizens also have to play their roles and take reasonable cyber hygiene measures to protect themselves and ensure that they are cyber resilient and able to continue operating in the event of a cyber incident. NACSA will play its part in providing cyber security guidance and coordination while keeping pace with existing and emerging cyber threats and the development of new technologies. All the necessary steps will be taken to ensure ease of access and sharing of threat information among government entities, businesses and the general public. NACSA will also provide advice on the risks and the actions necessary to mitigate them. However, the effort to develop such competencies has to be supported by a structured governance that provides the means, funding and facility required to cultivate a competent workforce, maintain the appropriate standards, policies and best practices, and implement the most effective approach and solutions to address cyber security issues. Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 85 The main duty of the government is and will always be to defend the nation, its economy and prosperity as well as its citizens from threat and harm by internal and external factors, be it from cyberspace or otherwise. It is therefore pertinent for Malaysia to set the rules, standards and expectations over all elements and entities under its control and responsibility in order to ensure a safe and secure cyberspace; and to collaborate with trusted parties from the international community that share the same objective and aspiration. For all these to be realised, there has to be a sense of inclusiveness, first and foremost, among all the stakeholders at the national level. Securing the national cyberspace will indeed require a collective effort. All roles and functions within the cyber security ecosystem that are outlined by the strategies are eventually connected and interdependent with one another, which clearly show that cooperation will always be a key aspect in ensuring success, security and peace. To support the national interest, Malaysia needs a class of competency, capability and awareness that can truly safeguard the national cyberspace, its critical sectors, businesses and most importantly the well-being of its citizens, not only from external threats but also those from within. It is also important to highlight that while we will always uphold the right to a free cyberspace, we also acknowledge that constraints and controls are still needed at some levels of access and provision to ensure that our intrinsic values as a multi-racial nation and society are protected and kept intact. In the long run, this can significantly assist in ensuring uniformity in the adoption and implementation of standards, policies and guidelines among all cyber security stakeholders in Malaysia. Again, we should remind ourselves that any strategy or planning will only be as good as the people behind it. Therefore, for the next five years, everybody must pull together or face the risk of getting left behind in the digital era. Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202486 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT In the journey of the development of the Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy (MCSS), an extensive deliberations, engagements and dialogues with a range of stakeholders has been carried out to gather inputs, feedbacks and insight from their point of view. A series of workshops, seminars and conferences has been conducted which involved government ministries and agencies, CNII agencies, enforcement agencies, industry, businesses, academia, non-gov- ernment organisations as well as the public. On the other hand, Academy of Sciences Malaysia (ASM) has conducted an exercise to understand the issues and challenges that affect the national in- frastructures, businesses and the well-being of citizens, as well as to identify the gaps in cyber security in Malaysia. As a result, ASM has produce an advisory report which outline the relevant strategies and specific recommendations to- wards ensuring a safe and secure national cyber environment. The advisory report also being used as a reference in developing the Malaysia Cyber Secu- rity Strategy. On that note, the Government would like to express an appreciation to every- one for their commitment, contribution and efforts towards the completion of MCSS.

We have come a long way since the first adoption of  the Internet back in 1995. Today, broadband connectivity  has become a necessity for businesses, services and citizens  of Malaysia to succeed and be relevant in the Fourth  Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). Hardly any person or thing  is unconnected to cyberspace. Businesses are becoming  deeply reliant on democratised technologies such as mobile,  social, Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence  (AI), and hyper-scale cloud that are all dependant on this  connectivity.  INTRODUCTION  Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-20244    Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 5  Anything connected to the   internet is exposed to cyber risks.   With this in mind, Malaysia needs to   develop a cyber security strategy   that is pragmatic and aims for a   cyberspace that is secured, trusted   and resilient while at the same   time fostering economic prosperity   and the well-being of its citizens.   We believe that our vision can   be achieved by fortifying local   capabilities to predict, detect,   deter and respond to cyber threats   by strengthening our cyber security   governance, nurturing competent   people, supporting best practice   processes and deploying effective   technologies.  Information sharing platforms,   channels and avenues for   government agencies, businesses   and the general public on cyber   security and cyber threats need   to be enhanced. Our situational   awareness, coordination, and   threat mitigation capabilities   likewise must be improved.  We are indeed fast becoming a   digitalised nation. In 2018 there   are 28.7 million Internet users in   Malaysia which represent 87.4% of   the population. Such astounding   figures illustrates our growing   dependency and connectedness   to cyberspace. On the other side,   cyber-attacks have progressed just   as fast as, or even faster than the   security measures that were put   in place. Governments now have   to deal with cyber threats not just   aimed at personal and financial   gains, but also threats from state-  sponsored actors aimed at critical   targets of national importance. It is   worth noting that state-sponsored   attacks are not only sophisticated   and potent, but once deployed,   these advanced technologies   can fall into the hands of cyber-  criminals who can then amplify   the use of these powerful cyber-  weapons at global scale.  The targets of malicious   cyber activity are often the   very foundation of a nation.   Consequently Malaysia recognises   cyber security as a national   priority. This has led to the   formulation of the National Cyber   Security Policy (NCSP) in 2006. The   NCSP was specifically developed   to address the risks to the Critical   National Information Infrastructure   (CNII), which are made up of 10   sectors namely: National Defence   and Security; Banking and Finance;   Information and Communications;   Energy; Transportation; Water;   Health Services; Government;   Emergency Services; and Food   and Agriculture. The NCSP   recognises the critical and highly   interdependent nature of the CNII   and aims to develop and establish   a comprehensive programme and   a series of frameworks that will   ensure the effectiveness of cyber     security controls over vital assets,   as well as to ensure that the CNII   sectors are protected to a level   that commensurate with the risks   faced.   The establishment of the National   Cyber Security Agency (NACSA)   further reaffirmed the growing   importance of cyber issues to   Malaysia’s national security.   NACSA is a dedicated agency that   oversees all national cyber security   functions formed under the aegis   of the National Security Council   (NSC). NACSA was established   as a response to the dynamic   nature, increasing sophistication,   global nature and heighten socio-  economic impact of cyber security   threats. It serves as the lead   agency that integrates the existing   cyber security capabilities. This   includes combating cybercrime   in a strategic and coordinated   manner in partnership with   the private sector and other   governments.  The efforts are ongoing to   assess the current legislative   framework for cybercrime issues   and cases. In order to adapt to   the ever-changing landscape of   cyberspace, existing laws need   to be enhanced to effectively   address the legal challenges   in taking action against cyber   criminals. The Attorney General’s   Chambers (AGC) led the review   of the laws of Malaysia with a view   to enhance the existing legislative   and regulatory framework used   to combat cybercrime. The   amendments to certain laws are   now in progress, where the AGC   collaborates with law enforcement   agencies and other relevant   government bodies.  Furthermore, a national policy   and procedure in managing   cyber crises has been formulated   to ensure that cyber attacks   and cyber incidents are being   managed proactively through   a coordinated approach at the   national level. This initiative is   closely guided by the National   Security Council’s Directive   No 24: Policy and Mechanism   of the National Cyber Crisis   Management, an executive   directive that outlines the   nation’s strategy for ‘cyber crisis   mitigation and response’ through   public and private collaboration   and coordination. There are six   (6) main principles under this   directive namely national cyber   crisis management structure;   national cyber-threat levels;   Computer Emergency Response   Team (CERT); cyber security   protection mechanisms; response,   communication and coordination   procedures; and a readiness   programme.  Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-20246    The government has also established   the National Cyber Coordination and   Command Centre (NC4), a centre that   deals with cyber threats and crises at the   national level. The NC4 was developed   under the purview of the NACSA as a   central coordination and command facility   responsible for managing cyber security   at the national level, including mitigation,   preparedness and response functions at a   strategic and tactical level. It is connected   to the entire main cyber security-operating   centre (SOC) in Malaysia namely MCMC   Network Security Centre, Government   Integrated Telecommunications Network   (GITN) SOC, Cyber Defence Operation   Centre (CDOC) and Cybersecurity Malaysia   SOC. It has the ability to determine the   national cyber security threat level and   assess the impact of the threats to the   country.  Malaysia has also implemented the initiative   to ensure the adoption and certification of   the CNII agencies (public and private) to   the MS ISO/IEC 27001: Information Security   Management Systems standard and other   related certifications. This initiative is to   ensure the CNII agencies and organisations   have the necessary information security   protection in place and are in compliance   with the standard. Appropriate measures   will also be prepared to protect other non-  CNII sectors such as the manufacturing,   construction, education and retail since   cyber threats and attacks in these sectors   also pose risks to the overall economic   wellbeing and security of the nation.  Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 7    Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-20248  Another important cyber security   initiative that has been conducted   for the past decade is the National   Cyber Crisis Exercise (also known   as X-Maya). The exercise was   designed to test the effectiveness   of the procedures that have been   developed under the National   Cyber Crisis Management Plan   (NCCMP) and to assess the   readiness and preparedness of   critical national infrastructure   agencies against cyber-attacks.    To date, six (6) national cyber crisis   exercises have been organised   with the participation from more   than 100 public and private   agencies across the 10 CNIIs.  On another front, Malaysia has   also been actively creating   awareness and capacity building   programmes. Whilst the rapid of   ICT, bring benefits and advantages   to our citizen, it is also carries   risks to the nation’s economy,   social harmony and security.   To manage such risks, public   awareness is crucial.  Agencies   have been carrying out various   awareness programmes to   educate Malaysians. As a mean   to coordinate these programmes,   NACSA is developing the National   Cyber Security Awareness Master   Plan. This Master Plan aims to   increase the level of cyber security   awareness among Malaysian     Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 9  cyber citizens through concerted   and effective programmes and   initiatives. Under this Master Plan,   four (4) main target groups,   (kids, youth, adults/parents and   organisations), were identified for   specific cyber security awareness   programmes and initiatives.   This Master Plan outlines an   implementation strategy to ensure   it achieves its anticipated goals   and objectives.  To address the critical shortage of   skilled cyber security professionals,   a comprehensive capacity   building plan on cyber security   will be established riding on the   existing initiatives with a more   coordinated mechanism and clear   measurement. It will start from the   development of school curricula in   cyber security; followed by focus-  based skills at the institutions of   higher learning; and training and   skills development schemes for   expert and non-experts in both   public and private sectors. The   government will further enhance   the current initiatives especially   the Centre of Excellence, a   collaboration with the local   universities to address the shortage   of local talent in the cyber security   workforce.

In the past, we have seen how   the infrastructure of nations and   businesses were brought down with   significant financial implications.  This is not a far-fetched scenario for   Malaysia, especially if we refer to   the results of a study conducted by   Microsoft in collaboration with Frost   & Sullivan on Understanding the   Cybersecurity Threat Landscape   in Asia Pacific : Securing the   Modern Enterprise in a Digital   World published in July 2018. The   study revealed that the potential   economic loss in Malaysia due   to cyber security incidents could   hit up to RM51 billion, which is   more than 4% of the total Gross   Domestic Product.  As the foundations of our economy   become increasingly rooted in   digital technologies, Malaysia will   model and promote standards   that protect our economic security   and reinforce the vitality of the   nation as a viable marketplace   and source of innovation. This   will include, among others, the   initiatives to promote local industry   in emerging technologies and 5G.  The Malaysia Cyber Security   Strategy (MCSS) has been   designed with tools to provide   trust in our cyber environment   not only for national security, but   also to support the government   agenda in the digital economy,   Industry 4.0 and the adoption   of other disruptive technologies   for Malaysia’s advancement.   This Strategy will replace the   existing NCSP as it is developed   to be more inclusive and   comprehensive covering   protection of CNII, businesses,   industries and also citizen. This   document includes specific   Pillars to define key areas of our   concern as well as the necessary   strategies for each of them. Each   strategy will in turn comprise   of a number of action plans   and measurement mechanisms   that will be implemented within   the effective period of this   document. Regardless of those   mechanisms we need to, we have   to realistically remind ourselves   that none of these strategies   will be effective in combating   cyber security issues without the   cooperation from all stakeholders.  Cyber threats are persistent   and there will always be the   risk of targeted cyberattacks of   massive scale and consequences.   Such threats can never truly be   eradicated as long as everything   stays connected. Yet, they can   be mitigated.  For this to happen,   everyone will have to play   their role and work together to   enhance Malaysia’s overall cyber   security readiness, capacity and   capabilities.

In 2018, the Royal Malaysia Police  had to deal with 10,742 cybercrime cases with an estimated  loss amounting to almost RM400 million, while in 2019, the  number has increased to 11,875 cases with an estimated  loss to almost RM500 million. The numbers may be shocking  to some but not if we consider the fact that cyber criminals  these days are no longer conduct hacking merely out of  curiosity or to test their intrusion and penetration skills, but also  for economic gain.

In 2018, a   total of 5,627 cyber security   incidents were reported to the   NC4 compared to 2,981 in 2017   and 2,429 a year before that.   Malicious software infections top   the rest with 2,244 cases, followed   by intrusion attempts and actual   intrusions at 2,076 and 1,270 cases,   respectively. However, in 2019 the   total number of incidents reported   to NC4 has shown a significant   decreased to 3,787 cases   compared to 2018. This reflects   the effectiveness of proactive   measures that has been put in   place to secure our cyberspace.  2016  49  1,754  228  372  0  26  2,429  2017  37  1,910  225  752  0  57  2,981  2018  19  1,270  2,076  2,244  15  3  5,627  2019  14  1,297  256  2,154  6  60  3,787  DOS / DDoS  Intrusion  Instrusion Attempt  Malware Infection  Malware Hosting  Potential Attacks  Cyber Security Incidents (2016 - 2019)  Cybercrime Statistics (2018 & 2019)  Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 15    Malaysia is also a target of   Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)   attacks, with the most recent   incident manifested by way of   email spear phishing. These threats   can escalate further given that   many Malaysian organisations   continue to operate a number of   legacy and unsupported systems,   which can no longer be updated   with the latest security patches.    These legacy systems may have   multiple vulnerabilities, which are   susceptible to attack payloads   and tools available to cyber   criminals.  There are also concerns about   the increasing number of content-  related issues in Malaysian   cyberspace. While these incidents   are relatively still small in number,   the impact on the nation is not.   Given the speedy and widespread   nature of the Internet as a medium   of delivery, the effects of content-  related issues are potentially   more detrimental and damaging.   For this reason, Internet-based   contents, in the form of fake news,   misinformation, contents that are   seditious and slanderous in nature,   or with racial or religious overtones,   are taken very seriously by the   government, while respecting the   right to freedom of speech.   As Malaysia continues to embrace   digital technologies, there is an   increasing need to streamline   the management of cybercrimes   and incidents to assure the public   that all cybercrimes and incidents   will be handled appropriately   and effectively by the respective   law enforcement agencies.   There is a need to eliminate   duplicative efforts and maximise   resource utilisation among the law   enforcement agencies.  One of the main reasons for the   establishment of NACSA was to   coordinate and complement all   efforts on cyber security to make   sure that all aspects are given   due attention. While focusing on   cyber security policy, governance   and coordination matters, NACSA   will also be administering other   areas of concern, which will be   mandated to specialised agencies.  Efforts concerning other   target areas, namely the CNII,   cybercrime, awareness, capacity   building and international   cooperation will be delegated to   Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202416    Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 17    selected groups of lead agencies,   law enforcement arms and   institutions that have the relevant   expertise and direct responsibility,   as well as the required capacity   and capability to deal with the   related issues and initiatives.  In Cyber Security Ecosystem,   NACSA will serve as the focal point   on all matters related to cyber   security that also spans vertically   to include other existing and   aligned national initiatives such   as the Digital Infrastructure, Digital   Trade, National Security, Digital   Malaysia and Digital Government.   NACSA serves as an entity that   is responsible for streamlining   all cyber security planning,   development and implementation.  To ensure the successful   implementation of the strategy,   an effective ecosystem and   governance, this Strategy will   outline the roles and responsibilities   of agencies involved in managing   national cyber security. This   will be realised by legislating a   new National Security Council’s   Directive, which will elucidate our   enhanced national cyber security   governance arrangements and   the restructuring of committees   directly responsible for national   cyber security, and delineating the   exact roles and responsibilities of   all relevant agencies.

To   date, Internet-related fraud has   been the most prevalent cyber   threat in Malaysia. This is supported   by the  cybercrime reports   received by Royal Malaysian   Police in 2018 and 2019 which   shows that telecommunication   fraud, e-commerce, 419 scam   (also known as Nigerian Scam) and   e-financial fraud are among the   most prominent threats. Such cases   have been known to cause huge   monetary losses to the victims. If   this trend is sustained, Malaysians   will project a greater concern in   doing business through an online   platform, which indirectly erodes   the  consumers’ confidence in our   cyber security measures.   Cybercrime Statistics By Offences (2018 & 2019)  Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202420    However, it is important to note   that lack of awareness is the main   factor in most of these fraud cases.   In phishing incidents, for example,   people can be easily duped by   bogus sites and services due to   their negligence. The same goes   for scams whereby unsuspecting   victims would transfer huge   amount of money to recipients   whom they have never met and   whose identity cannot be verified   – all done for the expectation of   an honest purchase, attractive   investments and even promises of   love.  On another alarming note, the   healthcare sector now has other   cyber threat concerns that are   even more worrying than the   attacks and intrusions on electronic   medical records. Medical robotic   technology and robot-assisted   surgical procedures are now   connected to computer systems   and networks which expose   them to cyber threats.  As the   patient records are digitised, the   risks of breach and disclosure of   confidential information are also   rampant.  Clearly, much has to be done   in terms of creating awareness   among the general public.   This would explain why cyber   security education will soon be   introduced even as early as   in primary education. Cyber   security awareness and education   aims to educate citizens from   making errors of judgement while   transacting on the Internet.  Aside from that, Malaysia is   also facing a shortage in its   cyber security workforce and   talent gaps in many sectors. In   today’s constantly connected   and borderless world, such   inadequacy can be disastrous   Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 21    to organisations. The shortage of   cyber security professionals will   leave organisations vulnerable and   exposed to untold dangers from   cyberspace.  Insider threats also remain a   significant cyber security risk to   organisations. Insiders with access   to critical information systems and   data pose a significant threats to   any organisations. There have been   numerous cases of intellectual   property theft and the leaking of   sensitive information that have   caused substantial financial and   reputational damage.  There were also incidents where   these insiders, either employees   or vendors, unknowingly became   victims of elaborate cybercrime   schemes such as through watering   hole attacks, social engineering   ploys, malware and ransomware   infections, propagation mechanism   by inserting infected USB devices   into the internal networks or   arbitrarily clicking on links found   in emails or while browsing the   Internet.  The government via its relevant   agencies and initiatives will   have to approach organisations   and institutions on best cyber   security practices. More efforts   have to be made to encourage   Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202422    necessary controls over system   and data access by employees   and vendors. The implementation   of a proper Bring Your Own   Device (BYOD) policy should be   deployed by organisations and   institutions. Again, awareness also   plays an important role here in   mitigating incidents due to insider   threats, especially for those at the   management tier.  Additionally, the correct posture   and approach are needed in   dealing with the selection of   third parties/vendors, planning,   development and implementation   of ICT projects,  especially those   that involve or intended for critical   establishments such as an Industrial   Control System (ICS) for CNII   agency. Security-by-Design should   be the flagship approach in ICT   project development in order to   ensure that the end products and   systems are free of vulnerabilities   and not susceptible to cyber   threats. This can only be achieved   through continuous testing,   authentication safeguards and   adherence to best practices.  Malaysia has also been facing   threats of terrorism and violent   extremism. Terrorists and violent   extremists have been using various   web services and social media as   a breeding ground to entice new   Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 23    Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202424  recruits, followers and supporters   to their causes. Continuous efforts   have been made to curb such   threats and there have been   successful convictions in recent   years. Yet the ease of developing   a new website or forum for any   agenda presents a growing   challenge to law enforcement   agencies.  These issues are complex due to   the varying interpretation of what   would and should be considered   as amounting to  terrorism or   violent extremism. There has been   a dire need of manpower and   expertise to monitor and correctly   identify web contents that would   fall under this category. There are   also other obstacles including   this content which is usually   hosted by providers that are   beyond our jurisdiction. The lack   of awareness among the general   public concerning these types of   resources reduces the incidents of   timely reporting of this content.  Content-related issues, on the   other hand, bring a new level   of complexity to the challenges   of cyberspace. Some issues   concerning pornography and   harmful content such as online   gambling, information on illegal   substances, instructions to make   firearms, and misleading and false   information, require a coordinated   and swift effort and commitment   by all parties, which in this case   would be agencies and institutions   that are directly responsible for   network accessibilities. Removal   or restriction of access to content   that is deemed as harmful by   Malaysian law must be pursued.  There is also the issue of differing   perspectives on content that   may be perceived as either   hate speech or seditious, or an   appropriate expression of free   speech. This is often the case for   politically-motivated postings on   blogs and social media. While   there have been successful   convictions from time to time, the   creation and spreading of content   of this nature does not seem to   be lessening, and if anything, they   seem to flourish correspondingly   to the actual situation of the   counterpart issues in the real world.    Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 25  Concerns over the misuse of user   personal data are increasing at all   levels of society. Citizens are now   more vigilant on how and what   personal information is shared.   The Personal Data Protection Act   2010 has also helped to clarify   what would be considered as   encroaching user privacy by   entities collecting user information.   Greater effort is needed to take   strong action against those that do   not act appropriately to protect   personal data.  On the technological side, threats   due to vulnerabilities and cyber-  attacks are consistently increasing.   This is very much due to lack of   awareness among users, both   in government institutions and   business entities; and among   individuals. Good cyber hygiene   habits - such as creating complex   passwords, consistently backing   up data, regularly updating and   upgrading software and hardware,   and limiting privileged access to   critical systems - are still lacking   among public and private sector   users.  All things considered, we believe   that it is rather fair to assume   that the prevailing issues and   challenges in Malaysia’s cyber   security landscape can be   attributed to, first and foremost,   awareness and education.   Technological solutions and   controls can only do so much – it is   the netizens themselves that need   to have a basic grasp of cyber   security essentials and related   legislation and regulations so that   they can at least avoid the most   common pitfalls, particularly while   navigating cyberspace.    Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202426    STRATEGIC PILLARS    STRATEGIC PILLARS  Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy outlines our key objectives,  categorised into five strategic Pillars that will govern all  aspects of cyber security planning and implementation in  Malaysia until 2024. The Strategy is focused on the three  overriding success factors for interrelated and interdependent  organisational change, namely People, Process and  Technology.  For this purpose, People represents   the need for knowledge, skill and   expertise enhancements as well as   capacity and capability building   among the human capital of the   digital era. Process covers the   development and strengthening,   and implementation and   maintenance of laws, regulations,   procedures and guidelines to   effectively govern our cyberspace.   Technology covers the technology   required for effective cyber   security implementation.  The Strategy also describes a   number of action plans aimed   at increasing cyber security in   various sectors of the government,   businesses and society. These   action plans will be measured   accordingly to assess their   effectiveness.  The five Pillars outlined in this   Strategy have been identified as   crucial for achieving Malaysia’s   goals of protecting government   and CNII networks, system and   data, as well as businesses and   citizens, while at the same time   combatting cybercrime.  Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202428    1 EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT    Experience has taught Malaysia that the most important  measure to safeguard cyberspace is effective governance  and management. The management of cyber security risks  should evolve simultaneously with the evolution of threats,  alongside the adoption of digital in doing business. Ideally, we  need a national standard on governance and management,  which allows for shared responsibility and cross-sectional  integration to optimise the efforts in dealing with any issues,  threats or breaches.  Effective  Governance and Management  Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202430    Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 31  To improve national resilience   against cyber threats, an active   cyber defence approach which   ranges from Advanced Persistent   Threat to cybercrimes and   content-related threats is needed.   This approach will include both   the defensive and offensive   capabilities to effectively mitigate   cyber threats, focusing on the   capability to detect, analyse, and   act upon any cyber threats within   our cyber defence ecosystem.  In the quest to achieve greater   resilience, Malaysia needs a   functional governance and   management system that is agile,   adoptable and ready to cater   for the challenges of the digital   era (and beyond). It has to have   the necessary framework and   action plans in place, creating a   partnership within the ecosystem   that will foster close collaborations   among stakeholders, including   relevant government entities,   law enforcement agencies,   businesses and industry leaders.   Such partnerships will be made   possible through the establishment   of appropriate platforms for   information sharing, strategy-  building and resource sharing   to form a strong national cyber   workforce to manage the ever   evolving and ever increasing   cyber-related issues and incidents.    This Pillar aims to create effective governance and management through  three strategic initiatives, specifically by:  This Pillar aims to achieve the   ability to defend our networks,   data and systems from cyber   threats and subsequently respond   to threats effectively in a well-  coordinated and concerted   manner. Equally imperative is   the ability to predict and detect,   investigate and disrupt hostile   actions against the government,   businesses and citizens of Malaysia.   To achieve this, the government   shall play the crucial role of   ensuring that all action plans are   properly implemented by the   intended entities.  In order to enhance the national   cyber security governance   framework, we will strengthen   governance structures by   clearly defining the roles and   responsibilities of all parties within   the ecosystem. This can be   accomplished by reviewing the   current roles and responsibilities   held by the existing cyber security   stakeholders in Malaysia.  Recognising the critical and   highly interdependent nature of   CNII organisations from both the   government and private sectors   in managing cyber security risks   and incident responses, the   government will continue to clarify   the roles and responsibilities of   the respective organisations as   technologies evolve to ensure   the CNII are protected to a level   that commensurates with the risks   faced.  Improving  organisation management  and business  operations  among the government,  CNII and  business  entities  Strengthening cyber security  incident  management  and active  cyber defence  Enhancing  national cyber  security governance and  ecosystem  Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202432    We will also identify and bridge   gaps in responsibilities and   coordination among agencies and   sector leads in managing incident   response by enhancing threat   information sharing platforms. At   present, there are various cyber   security stakeholders in Malaysia   in the form of law enforcement   agencies and other government   bodies with varying degrees of   roles, jurisdiction, competence   and functions in the cyber security   governance value chain. Agencies   such as the MCMC, MDEC and   CyberSecurity Malaysia focus on   regulating the communications   and multimedia industry, driving   the digital economy and providing   ICT security specialist services,   respectively. Others like the   Royal Malaysia Police and the   Central Bank of Malaysia lean   more towards law enforcement.   Whereas parent institutions such   as the Ministry of Communications   and Multimedia Malaysia and the   Ministry of International Trade and   Industry oversee the bigger picture   and implementation of policies.   For the purpose of improving the   national cyber security ecosystem,   all these resources must be pulled   together and work side by side   via a multi-agency coordination   protocol with streamlined   processes and procedures, and   a well-defined scope of authority   and accountability.  To achieve this agenda, the   government has established   NACSA to serve as the central   agency for cyber security in   Malaysia. At the moment,   development and enhancement   efforts are now in place to   equip NACSA with the necessary   capabilities to provide leadership   and guidance to all cyber security   organisations that will fall under   its coordination. In this respect,   NACSA will be directly responsible   in overseeing the establishment   and operations of various   information sharing platforms   among the various stakeholders. It   will also be at the forefront in the   identification and management of   risks and vulnerabilities that are of   significance and concern to the   national cyber security ecosystem.   Subsequently, NACSA will be the   focal point for the implementation   of proactive measures to protect   the government and CNII   agencies’ networks, systems   and data and to improve inter-  agency coordination to combat   cybercrime.  The NC4 will be the main hub of   all other Cyber Operation Centres   in Malaysia. NC4’s capability   to predict, detect, deter and   respond will be further intensified,   strengthened and enhanced to   address cyber-security related   issues.  Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 33    Even though the government has   led many initiatives to improve the   current cyber security landscape,   it requires the cooperation and   collaboration of all stakeholders to   achieve the mission to secure our   cyberspace and provide a safer   environment for all Malaysians.   An embedded and sustainable   approach is needed whereby   citizens, industry and other partners   in the society and government,   play their full part in securing   the networks, services and data.   Therefore, efforts will also be taken   to enhance collaboration and   build trust among government   and CNII agencies, businesses   and partners through information   sharing and Public-Private   Partnerships.  To facilitate this, we will provide   the engagement programmes   and information sharing platforms,   such as conducting conferences,   seminars, workshops and dialogues   where all the stakeholders,   including Chief Executive Officers,   Chief Financial Officers, Chief   Information Officers, Chief Security   Officers and Chief Information   Security Officers could share   their knowledge, thoughts,   experiences and proposals. Such   collaboration would pave the way   for an appropriate and systematic   sharing mechanism and platform   on actionable cyber threat   information, enhancements of   cyber security coordination and   the promotion of analytical and   technical exchanges between   subject matter experts.  A change management plan   will also be prepared and   subsequently introduced to   organisations that are involved   to streamline changes and   improvements that are required   to be in place to support   the envisioned governance   structure.  Also, in order to provide   the necessary mechanism   and structure for effective   Clear roles and responsibilities  Well coordinated and conserted approach  Close cooperation and collaboration  Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202434    coordination, information and   media management, we will be   working towards establishing the   National Communication Plan. This   Plan is necessary to describe the   requirements of an information   channel that is both capable   and quick to accommodate for   information sharing during a cyber   crisis or incident and will also serve   as the main reference to explain   the roles and responsibilities of all   related agencies with regards to   media management.  These are especially crucial given the   rapid advancements of the digital   age that foresee the expansions  of   e-government initiatives, e-commerce   transactions and digital economy   in our daily lives. This is with the   inclusion of Artificial Intelligence   and machine learning in modern   systems, the increasing application   of IoT in devices and peripherals,   and the extensive use of complex   Industrial Control Systems. All   of which inadvertently would   open up even more avenue for   potentials risks and threats to   security, safety and privacy.  In essence, Pillar 1 initiatives   will cover the protection of   the CNII sectors, with support   and guidance for businesses   and individuals to mitigate   cyber threats. Recognising the   importance of digital economy,   the government will include   Trade, Industry and Economy as   one of the CNII sectors. Focus will   be made on the development   of sector specific guidelines and   frameworks, such as maritime and   aviation to accommodate current   cyber security needs and address   the emerging threats, with a key   attention on the convergence of   Information Technology (IT) and   Operational Technology (OT)   systems.  Hence, a government-led   Technical Working Group will be   established to spearhead an in-  depth study on laws, rules and   regulations as well as standards   and best practices in cyber   security that have to be adhered   to by the CNII agencies. The   government will also create   a training platform to assist   participating organisations in   complying with cyber security   standards.  The government will work together   with private sector entities to   promote understanding of cyber   security risks, encourage a more   informed risk management   decisions, and advocate   investments in appropriate security   measures. This will serve as an   effective platform of cooperation   between various public and   private sectors thus ensuring that   business entities and organisations,   as well as citizens, adopt the   security-centric norms, behaviour   and practices that are required to  stay safe in cyberspace.

This will be   realised through the development of   data leakage protection policy and   guidelines as well as the execution   of the National Cryptography Policy,   which outlines the methods and   strategic approach in the use and   creation of cryptographic algorithms   and cryptography products to protect   information that are of national interest.  Management of vendors that deal   with government and CNII agencies   will also be improved to minimise data   privacy and security risks. Awareness   initiatives will be conducted on supply   chain threats. Supply chain security   management will be integrated   into agency procurement and risk   management process. Vendors,   products and services shall be assessed   to identify those with high risk and   mitigated accordingly. Third parties that   are awarded with government projects,   especially on ICT, will be required to   adhere to information security standards   and practices such as the International   Organization for Standardization and   the International Electrotechnical   Commission’s ISO/IEC 27001:2013 and   ISO/IEC 27002:2013 as well as having   the necessary cyber security and   information security experts in place.  Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202436    Management of the Computer   Emergency Response Teams   (CERTs) will also be improved   and strengthened through the   enhancement and restructuring of   National Cyber Security Incident   Response Team (CSIRT), Sector   CSIRT and Organisation CSIRT.   These CSIRTs will be provided with   the necessary capabilities and   capacity to handle, mitigate and   recover from cyber crisis and   incidents. Furthermore, cyber   incident reporting will be made   mandatory for all government and   CNII agencies, while businesses will   be encouraged to report them.   We will also develop a Vulnerability   Assessment Implementation   Plan and conduct periodic risk   and vulnerability assessment on   all critical ICT services. We will   measure the National Readiness   Level through periodically-  conducted studies.  The government will draw on its   capabilities to develop and apply   active cyber defence measures   to enhance the levels of cyber   security readiness across national   and government networks. Cyber   security courses, content and   syllabuses will be developed for   government training programmes   and for specific target groups that   will be identified based on their   roles and responsibilities. All existing   training platforms will be utilised to   establish main training centres that   can cater for these target groups   and properly meet their needs   and requirements in capacity and   capability building efforts.  Sector specific guideline  Laws, rules and regulations  Standards compliance  Best practices  Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 37    Cyber security incident   management will also be   enhanced through the revision   of the National Cyber Crisis   Management Plan (NCCMP) and   its reporting mechanism by the first   quarter of 2021. Cyber exercises   at the organisational, sectoral and   national levels will be implemented   according to the Cyber Exercise   Implementation Plan, of which   the findings will greatly contribute   to the preparation of the Cyber   Readiness Report, planned to be   delivered by end of 2021.  Combatting terrorists and violent   extremists’ use of the Internet will   continue to be a priority area,   with the main objectives of: raising   awareness among the public;   and preventing radicalisation and   terrorist recruitment and fund-  raising activities through digital   platforms such as social media   and web portals. The Southeast   Asia Regional Centre for Counter-  Terrorism (SEARCCT) and the Royal   Malaysia Police will continue to   play their role in monitoring violent   extremist activities in cyberspace.   An integrated information sharing   platform shall be developed   to facilitate flow of information   between agencies and towards   the general public.  Ultimately, under this Pillar, it is   expected that a new national   cyber security governance   structure with a clear division of   power and responsibilities is built   based on the foundations and   principles set forth by the National   Security Council’s Directive. The   implementation of the Malaysia   Cyber Security Strategy will be   supervised through an annual   evaluation process, after which a   Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy   landscape report will be prepared   and presented to the stakeholders   for milestone reviews and further   deliberations.

Since the 1990s, Malaysia has introduced  numerous laws to cater for the advent of digital age and the  full spectrum of cyber issues.

This act covers offences such as   unauthorised access to computer   material and unauthorised   modification of computer contents.  As technology evolves at a   rapid pace, Malaysia recognises   that there are areas in the laws   which need to be reviewed to   accommodate new technologies   and to reflect new realities,   especially in the cyber security   domain. The emergence of   new cyber threats pose  new   challenges. Consequently,   Malaysia may need to consider   mechanisms to enable existing   laws to be applied in cyberspace,   and, only if required, enact new   laws.  The first order of this Pillar is to   study and review  all the existing   laws  and regulations that have   been used to deal with cybercrime   and cyber security cases. Findings   of said efforts will not only pave   the way for us to appropriately   update the existing legislation   and regulation but will also help   us introduce a new law in cyber   security, if deemed necessary.  Malaysia  is  fully  aware  that   cybercrime requires a coordinated   and cooperative international   response. The cross-border nature   of cybercrime creates challenges   in bringing cyber criminals justice.   Recognising that effective regional   and international cooperation is   crucial in combating cybercrime,   Malaysia will continue enhancing   regional and international co-  operation through existing bilateral   Enhancing Malaysia’s cyber laws in addressing current and emerging threats  Enhancing the capacity and capability of cybercrime enforcement  This Pillar aims to strengthen cyber security legislation and enforcement  through two strategic initiatives, specifically by:  Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202446    and multilateral cooperation   platforms. Malaysia is also striving   to strengthen and harmonise    domestic legislation with   international conventions and   treaties.  Malaysia recognises that   the challenge presented by    cybercrime also requires a   coordinated and an integrated   national approach. Law   enforcement agencies need to   work together to address the   threats. Malaysia will be taking   steps to enhance the capacity   and capability of law enforcement   agencies to tackle cybercrime by   developing and implementing the   National Cybercrime Enforcement   Plan (NCCEP). Under this Plan,   efforts will be taken to increase   the knowledge and skill of judiciary   members, prosecutors, law   enforcement officers and legal   practitioners so as to prepare them   for the intricacies of cybercrimes in   the digital era.  An expert group will also be   established to identify gaps   and required improvements   in cybercrime enforcement.   Furthermore, we also need   to foster better collaboration   between government agencies   and key stakeholders including   telecommunication companies,   Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 47    industries, Internet service providers   as well as content providers both   at national and international levels.   Law enforcement agencies will be   equipped with the latest tools and   capability for the identification   of criminals / malicious parties;   and the identification, collection,   acquisition and preservation of   digital evidence. Digital forensic   labs will be enhanced to address   the growing complexity of   cybercrime investigation.  We will also ensure that the   tools and technology, as well   as capability enhancements   for each law enforcement   agency are accredited, directly   related and the best available   to accommodate the type of   cybercrime cases that they   handle. A national working group   on capacity building and joint   collaboration with various training   institutions will be established in   order to develop specific modules   of training and the mechanisms   to assess the effectiveness of such   training.  The Plan also calls for a clear and   streamlined coordination process   among central and enforcement   agencies. For this purpose, a   Cybercrime Coordination Centre   will be established. The Centre will   focus on ensuring an integrated   and coordinated approach in   addressing cybercrime.   This approach is timely since   fighting cybercrime requires   concerted efforts. In order to   achieve effective investigation   and successful prosecution of   cybercrime, a team of experts,   consisting of investigating officers   and forensic experts, should be   established at the initial stage   of the investigation to address   and advise on specific issues   arising during the investigation   process. The Centre will also   serve as a central information   sharing mechanism between law   enforcement agencies to increase   efficiency and to minimise delay in   investigation.  Such endeavours follows the   study on the requirements for   the establishment of more cyber   courts. The first cyber court was    established in September 2016,   and was aimed at addressing   the increasing number of civil   and criminal cyber cases. The   dedicated cyber court will ensure   that cyber cases receive priority   with adequate levels of expertise,   which will translate into efficiency   in disposal of cyber cases. The   government will also examine   the feasibility and viability of   establishing a specific unit that   Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202448    combines elements from all of the   various government agencies that   have been dealing with cyber security   cases and incidents under one roof   in order to streamline our actions and   reactions.  A comprehensive Standard Operating   Procedure (SOP) also needs to be   developed and endorsed to serve   as a guide for law enforcement   agencies in investigating cybercrime.   This is particularly important as   cybercrime have expanded well   beyond the virtual domains and now   even interconnected with other type   of criminal activities such as human   trafficking, drug smuggling and illicit   recruitment whereby ICT tools are used   as an information, communication and   coordination platform.  Other than fostering collaborations   between local law enforcement   agencies, the Plan will also explore the   possibility of furthering cooperation   with foreign counterparts. This could   include cross-border  secondments   or visiting experts’ programmes. It   is hoped that through these efforts,   more can be shared between like-  minded national agencies and experts   in dealing with cyber security issues   and challenges that are common to   all and borderless in nature.

The key objective of the Roadmap is to spearhead innovation  in the areas of cyber security, safety and privacy protection.  Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202454    Towards this end, we will establish   a R&D collaboration platform   between the government,   academia and industry with the   objective of generating local   innovations and scaling-up   existing cyber security technology   solutions. This will not only address   current cyber security challenges,   but also drive local industry to   compete and thrive at the global   level.  MIMOS Berhad is well positioned   to spearhead this  initiative since   it has been very active and   productive in driving R&D in Cyber   security, together with partners   from the academia, industry   and government, for more than   two decades. Key areas of R&D    include:  •  Privacy enhancing technology;  •  Digital signature;  •  Digital identity;  •  Entity authentication;  •  Encryption algorithm; and  •  Cyber physical security   Technologies developed have   been incorporated into various   systems to provide higher security   posture, for example Malaysian   Health Data Warehouse,   Government Online Services   Gateway, National Cyber   Coordination and Command   Centre, and the National Digital ID   Proof-of-Concept.  Appropriately, this Pillar aims to catalyse world class innovation,  technology, R&D and industry in building and strengthening the cyber  security innovation ecosystem in Malaysia through two strategic initiatives,  specifically by:  Spurring the National Cyber Security R&D Programme  Promoting a competitive local industry and technology  Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 55    The National Cyber Security   Research and Development   Roadmap, which will take into   consideration of the maturity of   R&D initiatives, will be formulated   after identifying the priority   areas and the prevailing gaps.   The Roadmap will outline short-  term, medium-term and long-  term planning to address security   challenges and opportunities   brought forward by current and   emerging technologies.  The Roadmap will be further   supported by the establishment   of a shared Centre of Excellence.   Specialised programmes will be   established to produce more local   talent and contribute towards   a sustainable and vibrant R&D   community. Collaborations will also   be fostered between universities,   educational institutions, industries   and key government stakeholder to   help design, create and introduce   more industry-oriented courses   and specialisations and thereby   increase the number of marketable   university graduate students in   cyber security-related fields of   study.   Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202456    To promote the creation of local   technologies and a competitive   local industry, we plan to nurture   existing companies and create new   ventures, supported by the Public-  Private Partnership establishment   of a Cyber Security Start-Up Hub.   The Hub will help to understand   and address local cyber security   challenges so that companies or   start-ups could in turn develop   solutions and services that are   relevant and ready to serve local   needs and subsequently scale up   to meet global requirements. The   Hub will also provide incentives   and appropriate platforms for   companies to share information.   The Hub will assist companies   with marketing their products   locally and globally. A national   programme will facilitate adoption   of locally developed cyber security   products, solutions and services   within critical national infrastructure.   There will also be a notable   expansion of funding, through   additional government grants   and incentives, to help promote   the acceptance and adoption of   locally developed cyber security   products, solutions and services   by CNII organisations, including   government agencies and private   sector organisations.

Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202462    Correspondingly, this Pillar aims to enhance capacity and capability  building, awareness and education through three strategic initiatives,  specifically by:  The Plan will be implemented   by building coherent cross-  sector collaboration in strategic   information sharing and security   awareness initiatives, deepening   the understanding of advanced   threats, developing a culture   that understands security risks in   the context of business resiliency   and expanding the capability to   develop a safer and more resilient   technology, as well as the ability to   respond to advanced threats.  Malaysia has been developing   and implementing cyber security   capacity and capability through   various ministries, agencies and   CNII organisations. Enhancements   of national cyber security   capacity and capability will be   focused on increasing the number   of local skilled professionals   through training and certification   programmes to meet the demands   for skilled workforce in both   the public and private sectors.   Specialist skill development, on the   other hand, requires pursuing good   quality and established security   professional certifications primarily   in specific areas of cyber security   domain, that are lacking in the   country.   Meanwhile, awareness and   education would require, among   other things, the identification of   necessary target audiences and   content development approaches   that can enable resource   sharing and collaboration. The   government, through its various   agencies, will take up the   crucial role of empowering all   levels of society to understand   cyber security-related risks   and challenges, as well as the   necessary defensive measures   needed for safer Internet use.  Enhancing national cyber security capacity and capability  Enhancing cyber security awareness  Nourishing cyber security knowledge through education  Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 63    The Malaysia Digital Economy   Corporation, the lead agency   for driving the digital economy in   Malaysia, will spearhead efforts to   increase the number of local skilled   professionals, which will include   talent development initiatives   through new talent, up-skilling and   re-skilling. The government will also   provide additional funding and   scholarships in order to encourage   knowledge acquisition and   enrichment among existing cyber   security professionals. This will help   develop a new generation of a   cyber security professionals, with   the necessary education and skills.   Currently, CyberSecurity Malaysia   has started its efforts to increase   the number of local cyber   security professionals through   the implementation of Global   Accredited Cybersecurity   Education (ACE) Scheme. It is a   holistic professional certification   scheme established indigenously to   certify and recognise cyber security   personnel in tandem with ISO/IEC   17024 on people certifications, ISO/  IEC 9000 on processes and ISO/IEC   27001 on security management.  Ehance capacity at national  sectoral organisation  New talent up-skilling and re-skilling  Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202464    Realising that cyber security is   about human interaction and   attitude towards technology,   we will need to inculcate the   importance of adhering to   cyber hygiene practices among   government and CNII entities,   businesses and the general public.   Currently, there are various cyber   security awareness initiatives   undertaken by relevant agencies   or organisations through various   approaches and target groups.   Increase the number of local  skilled professionals through  training and certification  programmes  Adhering to cyber hygiene  practices  To name a few;  • NACSA has published the 10   Easy Steps for Cyber Security   Awareness that outlines all of   the most sensible practices in   cyberspace;   • Malaysian Modernisation and   Management Planning Unit   (MAMPU) has been organising   cyber security awareness   programmes for public sector   such as the Cyber Security   Awareness Month and Public   Sector ICT Security Conference;   • Royal Malaysia Police through   the Be Smart campaign ensures   the community are more aware   and cautious about cybercrime;   • Malaysian Communications   and Multimedia Commission has   organised various programmes   under the Klik Dengan Bijak®   initiative, a media and digital   literacy initiative to nurture   positive and responsible Internet   use among ICT users based on   the Rukun Negara together with   its strategic partners including   the Ministry of Communications   and Multimedia Malaysia,   Ministry of Health (MOH),   Ministry of Education (MOE),   Ministry of Women, Family and   Community Development   (MWFCD), Royal Malaysia Police,   Communications and Multimedia   Ehance capacity at national  sectoral organisation  New talent up-skilling and re-skilling  Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 65    Forum of Malaysia (CMCF) as well   as civil society partners such as   United Nations Children’s Fund   (UNICEF), Scouts Association   of Malaysia, Malaysian Youth   Council and others;   • Ministry of Health also has come   out with Semak Sebelum Klik   campaign;   • Chief Government Security Office   (CGSO) through the Protective   Security Training Centre provides   ICT security awareness courses to   government officer as part of its   annual cyber security awareness   programme;   • CyberSecurity Malaysia in   collaboration with MOE and DiGi   Telecommunications Sdn. Bhd.   runs the CyberSAFE campaign to   nurture positive and responsible   Internet use among ICT users; and  • Central Bank of Malaysia has   been raising awareness to all   banking users on online fraud and   safety tips for Internet banking   services.   Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202466    These commendable initiatives at   the same time are experiencing   challenges in terms of resources,   coverage, approaches and   target groups that have   hindered the effectiveness of the   implementation.  To enhance Malaysia’s approach   on cyber security awareness, the   government will develop and   implement the National Cyber   Security Awareness Master Plan.    Under the Plan, the National Cyber   Security Awareness Governance   structure will be established, which   aims to develop an integrated   and concerted cyber security   awareness programme. The primary   aim of the integrated programme   is to reduce the number of cyber   incidents by running cyber security   awareness programmes and call   for actions that are more organised,   coordinated and able to reach   a wider target audience among   Malaysians.   The Plan will outline integrated   initiatives on public-private driven   collaboration and coordination,   and the mobilisation of resources   Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 67    to enable a wider outreach   of programmes to kids, youth,   adults/parents and organisations.   Initiatives by various agencies   will also be implemented in an   integrated and coordinated   manner to ensure a wider   coverage and bigger impact. This   will be crucial to educating citizens   on the necessary knowledge to   detect and avoid abuse, fraud   and crime online, as well as to   nurture accountable behaviour,   thereby creating well-informed   and responsible cyber citizens.  At the same time, we will also be   working on establishing a creative   content development programme   mechanism that brings together   all the stakeholders, from both   the public and private sectors, to   share their experience and best   practices on creating awareness.   It is hoped that a unified   national brand of cyber security   awareness programme can   then be developed, one which   streamlines the content of various   awareness programmes based on   the accepted security baseline   framework. A corresponding   measurement mechanism will   also be appropriately devised to   evaluate the effectiveness of said   programmes and to identify ways   to improve them from time to time.  Cyber security will also become   part of the syllabi at the primary,   secondary and tertiary level of   education. Given the increasing   threats from cyberspace and   the all-embracing nature of   ICT and the Internet, especially   among the younger generation   of Malaysians, we believe that it is   never too early to introduce and   foster cyber security awareness.   Our youth needs to be equipped   with the necessary cyber security   knowledge and tools to ensure   safety and security.   In academia, there is a need   to embed cyber security   across taught courses under   ICT and Computer Engineering   programmes. As an example,   cyber security requirements   need to be taught in Software   Programming (secure coding),   Software and System Development   Cycle (Secure SDLC), Database,   Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202468    Operating Systems, Network, IT   Administration and Management,   as well as cross platform   application development. This   effort is in addition to the present   dedicated cyber security related   courses being taught in colleges   and universities.   The same effort of introducing   cyber security related issues   across non-ICT or non-Engineering   disciplines covering cyber law in   Law, FinTech in Finance, security   risk management of network ready   medical devices in Health, among   others, is necessary to enable   graduates to stay relevant and   to be able to grasp the impact of   new technological developments.  Within the Public Service   Department, there is a need   to establish cyber security as a   vertical (grade) in the government   sector to enable specialisation in   the various domains under   information security and to   enable retention of these trained   personnel within their expertise by   providing sufficient opportunities   for career growth.

Global collaborations, including  information and knowledge sharing, as well as international  cooperation and enforcement, are crucial to effectively  counter evolving cyber threats. The nature of the Internet –  which is ambiguous and anonymous – may contribute to the  misperception, misinterpretation and misrepresentation of  cyber threats or attacks, leading to potential escalation or  tension between states. As such, it is imperative to instil trust  and transparency between states through close international  cooperation on cyber issues.  Strengthening Global Collaboration  Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202474    International engagement is also   pivotal to combat cross-border   threats and attacks involving   multiple jurisdictions. Strong   international engagement plays   important roles in addressing the   challenge, particularly in expediting   cross-border enforcement activities.  Fostering global collaboration   is thus a key component of this   strategy. Malaysia needs to engage   with other trusted international   entities to strengthen cooperation   that is mutually beneficial, while   respecting state boundaries and   sovereignty.  While establishing or enhancing   cooperation will significantly   strengthen relationships, Malaysia   is also committed to adhering to   the international commitments   and obligations with regard to   cyber security (where appropriate),   be it at regional, sub-regional or   multilateral level. Malaysia also   recognises the need to build   capacity in cyber diplomacy.   Strengthening international  collaboration and cooperation  in cyber security affairs  Demonstrating Malaysia's  commitment in promoting a secure, stable and peaceful  cyberspace to uphold international  security  For that reason, this Pillar aims to strengthen global collaboration through  two strategic initiatives specifically by:  Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 75    The primary element in   accomplishing the first strategic   initiative is through embedding   cyber security as a key priority   in our foreign policy. The   development of a cyber security   international engagement plan   will be the next step – it will   enable Malaysia to enhance   and coordinate its international   engagement across government.   A dedicated working group will be   established to develop this plan.  Having a comprehensive   plan will only be beneficial if   the government machinery   responsible for implementation is   well equipped with appropriate   skills and knowledge. Hence, the   relevant government agencies will   work together to embed cyber   security as one of the elements in   our diplomatic and international   affairs capacity building   programme. The aim is to ensure   that our diplomats around the   globe have a clear understanding   of key cyber security issues and   knowledge of our national context.  Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202476    Malaysia will continue to foster   bilateral relations in cyber security   with other nations and identified   international organisations or   industry players through the   creation of official collaboration   instruments either by Memorandum   of Understandings, joint statements   or legal instruments. The efforts will   be followed through with practical   collaborations such as knowledge   sharing and transfers, joint R&D,   technology transfers, information   exchange and training, policy   dialogues, jointly organised   programme, and discussions on   harmonisation of legislation.  Malaysia will also continue   to actively participate and   contribute in regional, sub-  regional and multilateral cyber   security collaboration efforts   through the United Nations   (UN), the Association of South   East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and   its dialogue partners, the Asia-  Pacific Economic Cooperation   (APEC), the Commonwealth,   the Organisation of Islamic   Cooperation (OIC), the Global   Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 77    Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202478  Forum on Cyber Expertise (GFCE),   the Asia-Pacific Computer   Emergency Response Team   (APCERT), the Forum of Incident   Response and Security Teams   (FIRST), the Council of Europe,   and other international entities.   Malaysia will innovate proposals   on international cyber security   cooperation tailored to the   interest of the respective fora in   collaboration with the identified   partners. Concurrently, we   will also promote international   collaboration in both the   public and private sectors, and   establish strategic alliances with   international partners and entities   that share our vision. Malaysia will   also strive to be at the forefront of   international discussions by driving,   chairing and hosting regional and   international cyber security fora as   well as conferences.  We will intensify our efforts to   disrupt the business model and   infrastructure of organised crime   through greater cross-border   collaboration. We will learn from   the successes and failures of   others in policing and enforcing   cyber security such as in dealing   with infringements of copyright,   computer-related fraud, child   pornography, online gambling   and violations of network security   to help improve cyber security   measures. Intelligence from trusted   international partners on issues   with implications to the nation,   especially on critical national   infrastructure, will be constantly   monitored and responded   to accordingly. Malaysia will   also engage the international   platforms, primarily in international   standards development and   ratification of treaties, to ensure   that any new international cyber   security norms being developed   does not contradict our national   interest.    Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 79  To demonstrate Malaysia’s   commitment in promoting a   secure, stable and peaceful   cyberspace with the aim of   upholding international security   as per the second strategic   initiative, we will shape a   concerted national position on   key international cyber security   issues particularly with regard   to norms, rules and principles of   responsible states’ behaviour,   how international law applies   in cyberspace, as well as   Confidence Building Measures   (CBMs). With regard to CBMs,   Malaysia aims to intensify efforts   in driving CBMs within ASEAN   in collaboration with identified   dialogue partners with a view   to elevate trust and confidence   between states in cyberspace.  In taking the steps toward   realizing Malaysia’s commitments   in international cooperation, we   will also constantly review and   assess the effectiveness of efforts   and investments that have been   made thus far.     In the long run, we aspire to   be recognised and seen as   a country that promotes and   upholds international stability in   cyberspace based on the existing   international agreements on all of   these matters.

We are confident  that this can be accomplished by strengthening our  capabilities to predict, detect, deter and respond to cyber  threats.  Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202484    In the face of constantly changing   cyber threats, Malaysia needs to   be prepared, more than ever,   to protect its national security   and sovereignty. Although the   global community agrees on the   importance of cyber threats, there   are still continuing discussions at   the regional and international   levels as to how to effectively   combat them. There will always   be questions on how far a nation   can or should go in responding to   what it perceives as a threat to its   national security and sovereignty,   and the complexities surrounding   such a situation when the cyber   incidents are cross-border in   nature.  The Malaysian government will   strive to meet its responsibilities   and lead the national response;   however, businesses, organisations   and individual citizens also   have to play their roles and   take reasonable cyber hygiene   measures to protect themselves   and ensure that they are cyber   resilient and able to continue   operating in the event of a cyber   incident.  NACSA will play its part in providing   cyber security guidance and   coordination while keeping pace   with existing and emerging cyber   threats and the development   of new technologies. All the   necessary steps will be taken to   ensure ease of access and sharing   of threat information among   government entities, businesses   and the general public. NACSA   will also provide advice on the   risks and the actions necessary to   mitigate them.  However, the effort to develop   such competencies has to   be supported by a structured   governance that provides the   means, funding and facility   required to cultivate a competent   workforce, maintain the   appropriate standards, policies   and best practices, and implement   the most effective approach and   solutions to address cyber security   issues.  Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2024 85    The main duty of the government   is and will always be to defend the   nation, its economy and prosperity   as well as its citizens from threat   and harm by internal and external   factors, be it from cyberspace or   otherwise. It is therefore pertinent   for Malaysia to set the rules,   standards and expectations over   all elements and entities under   its control and responsibility in   order to ensure a safe and secure   cyberspace; and to collaborate   with trusted parties from the   international community that share   the same objective and aspiration.  For all these to be realised, there   has to be a sense of inclusiveness,   first and foremost, among all the   stakeholders at the national level.   Securing the national cyberspace   will indeed require a collective   effort. All roles and functions within   the cyber security ecosystem   that are outlined by the strategies   are eventually connected   and interdependent with one   another, which clearly show that   cooperation will always be a key   aspect in ensuring success, security   and peace.  To support the national interest,   Malaysia needs a class of   competency, capability and   awareness that can truly safeguard   the national cyberspace, its   critical sectors, businesses and   most importantly the well-being of   its citizens, not only from external   threats but also those from within.   It is also important to highlight that   while we will always uphold the   right to a free cyberspace, we also   acknowledge that constraints and   controls are still needed at some   levels of access and provision to   ensure that our intrinsic values as a   multi-racial nation and society are   protected and kept intact.  In the long run, this can significantly   assist in ensuring uniformity in the   adoption and implementation   of standards, policies and   guidelines among all cyber security   stakeholders in Malaysia. Again,   we should remind ourselves that   any strategy or planning will only   be as good as the people behind   it. Therefore, for the next five years,   everybody must pull together or   face the risk of getting left behind   in the digital era.  Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy 2020-202486    ACKNOWLEDGEMENT In the journey of the development of the Malaysia Cyber Security Strategy  (MCSS), an extensive deliberations, engagements and dialogues with a range  of stakeholders has been carried out to gather inputs, feedbacks and insight  from their point of view. A series of workshops, seminars and conferences has  been conducted which involved government ministries and agencies, CNII  agencies, enforcement agencies, industry, businesses, academia, non-gov- ernment organisations as well as the public.   On the other hand, Academy of Sciences Malaysia (ASM) has conducted an  exercise to understand the issues and challenges that affect the national in- frastructures, businesses and the well-being of citizens, as well as to identify the  gaps in cyber security in Malaysia. As a result, ASM has produce an advisory  report which outline the relevant strategies and specific recommendations to- wards ensuring a safe and secure national cyber environment. The advisory  report also being used as a reference in developing the Malaysia Cyber Secu- rity Strategy.  On that note, the Government would like to express an appreciation to every- one for their commitment, contribution and efforts towards the completion of  MCSS.

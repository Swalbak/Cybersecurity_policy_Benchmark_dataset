Summary Background Bordering two of the world’s fastest-growing economies – India and China – Nepal has eight of the world’s highest mountains, an abundance of natural resources, and multidimensional cultural heritage attracting tourists globally. Despite having these enticing features, Nepal has not been able to tap its growth potential due to prolonged political uncertainty. That stated, Nepal has made significant progress on reforms with the adoption of a new Constitution in 2015, transitioning from a unitary to federal state, and election of a stable government. The new government’s priorities are centered on development and targeted initiatives to realize its goal of attaining developing nation status by 2022, and middle-income country status by 2030. The Prime Minister of Nepal, Khadga Prasad Oli, has outlined his vision of “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali” with broad objectives to address some of the basic challenges facing the country. Key focus areas include:  Building capabilities to grow the country’s tourism sector  Focusing on rapid build-out of infrastructure – water, transportation, and energy  Ending absolute poverty, illiteracy, and unemployment  Providing health insurance and free health care for every citizen  Accelerating post-earthquake reconstruction efforts  Curbing the flow of young talent leaving the country  Increasing farming productivity Digital Journey Nepal has enjoyed incredible success in digital adoption compared to its neighbors, with mobile penetration exceeding 100% and Internet penetration reaching 63%. According to the NTA, there was an addition of 2.25 million new Internet users in 2017 alone, translating into approximately 250 new Internet users every hour. Nepal is expected to lead Internet penetration by 2025 in comparison to major economies such as China and India, given its growth trend over the next few years. The growing popularity of social media is a crucial driver for Internet adoption in Nepal, coming second only to Bhutan in South Asia in social media penetration. As at January 2018, Nepal has nearly 9.3 million Facebook users. Entertainment and video sharing are other popular use cases with more than 6.4 million registered users on YouTube. What is Digital Nepal? The early success with Internet and mobile provide the impetus for Nepal to leverage the potential of digital technologies to drive accelerated growth. 2 The Digital Nepal Framework is a blueprint that provides a roadmap to how digital initiatives can: ● Contribute to economic growth ● Find innovative ways to solve major challenges facing society in a shorter period with fewer resources ● Identify opportunities for Nepal to participate in the global economy The digital initiatives have been selected based on: ● Alignment with the vision of Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali ● Demonstrated success in other similar developing markets ● Ability to execute in the local environment The Digital Nepal Framework encompasses: ● One Nation ● Eight Sectors ● 80 Digital Initiatives The Digital Nepal program is designed to enable Nepal to harness its growth potential by leveraging disruptive technologies and driving socioeconomic growth. The program is expected to deliver an impact of up to NPR 800 billion by 2022 3 Methodology Digital Nepal program is designed with six steps strategic methodology. The methodology gives the path from development of Digital Nepal framework document, implementation and continuous engagement of stakeholder to implement the vision of integrating ICT into Nepal’s development. Eight Sectors and Eighty Digital Initiatives Under the Digital Nepal framework, eight sectors – digital foundation, agriculture, health, education, energy, tourism, finance and urban infrastructure – have been identified based on close engagement with stakeholders. Eighty digital initiatives are identified which aims to propel socioeconomic growth in Nepal by addressing crucial challenges while unlocking the growth potential in each of the eight key sectors. All identified 80 4 digital initiatives are discussed with all concerned stakeholders in workshops and feedback process setup by MoCIT.

The Government of Nepal needs to focus on the following priority areas to create an enabling environment for the success of Digital Nepal initiatives: Technology and Infrastructure Entrepreneurship/PPP Talent and Skills Development Digital connectivity needs to be a key priority. Possible actions include: ● Make Internet access a fundamental right for every citizen ● Improve the availability of spectrum to the operators to enhance service coverage and quality ● Take leadership in driving 5G adoption in South Asia ● Establish a nationwide fiber network Encourage private sector participation. Possible actions include: ● Digitally streamline PPP application system to mobilize private investment ● Tax holidays and incentives for investment in Digital Nepal program ● Startup accelerator program to build a strong ecosystem for nurturing innovation and entrepreneurship Improve digital education. Possible actions include: ● Compulsory IT education in schools and colleges ● Increase the education system’s capacity to impart advanced ICT education ● ICT literacy programs for rural communities and underprivileged Nepalese ● Ongoing communication and celebration of digital stories of success Facilitate the development of a robust financial ecosystem. Possible actions include: ● Encourage digital payments ● Attract investments in fintech by encouraging the growth of startups and telecom companies to offer services to drive financial inclusion Encourage foreign direct investment in priority areas. Possible actions include: ● Fast-track FDI applications for Digital Nepal initiatives ● 100% FDI and easier repatriation of funds for Digital Nepal initiatives Making public servants digitally-ready will be essential. Possible actions include ● Digital skills training for public sector employees 6 Nepal in Context Background Bordering two of the world’s fastest-growing economies – India and China – Nepal has eight of the world’s highest mountains, an abundance of natural resources (mainly fresh water), and multidimensional cultural heritage attracting tourists globally. Despite these enticing features, Nepal has not been able to tap into its growth potential due to prolonged political uncertainty, trade disruptions, and natural disasters (such as the twin earthquakes in 2015 and floods in 2017). Political instability had become a part of life for Nepali citizens, with the country changing its government up to 20 times since the introduction of democracy in 1990.1 That stated, Nepal has made significant progress on reforms with the adoption of a new Constitution in 2015, transitioning from a unitary to federal state, and election of a stable government. ● The country’s first-ever Local level elections for state assemblies and the Federal Parliament in 2017 marked a crucial and decisive move toward federalism and political stability. ● The new Constitution aims to turn around the economic and political situation, ensure double-digit economic growth over the next 10 years,2 create an inclusive, pluralistic democracy, and mixed- market economy. ● One of the key goals of the government is to graduate from its Least Developed Country (LDC) status by 2022 to become a middle-income economy by 2030.3 As such, the government has implemented several long-run policies and programs centered on the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Macroeconomic Environment Nepal registered a steady GDP growth of 5% from 2010–2015. However, the massive earthquake of April 2015 significantly impacted the country’s economic development and GDP growth in FY 2015/16, dropping to 0.6%. 1 UNESCO 2 Constitution of Nepal, 2015 3 Envisioning Nepal 2030/ National Planning Commission, 2017 7 ● In 2016–2017, growth picked up significantly to 7.5%, driven by a good harvest, significant foreign aid, normalization of trade activities, and improved electricity supply management. In 2017, Nepal was ranked the third fastest growing economy in the world in terms of GDP growth.4 ● Moving forward, growth is likely to normalize to pre-earthquake levels at approximately 5.3%, sustained by increased spending in infrastructure reconstruction and development. However, this could be offset by a slowdown in remittance inflow due to a decline in the number of outgoing migrants. GDP (US$ billion) and GDP Growth (%), at Constant Prices, Nepal, 2013/14–2021/22F Note: F indicates forecasts Source: Nepal's Macro Environment and Key Industry Prospects, 2017–2022 Nepal is considered one of the least developed countries in the world with low per capita income. Its low economic growth rates compared to other countries in the region is a cause for concern as well. *Based on Atlas Method; Source: Basic Statistics 2018, Asian Development Bank (ADB) Source: World Development Indicators, World Bank 4 World Economic Forum 8 Criteria for Graduation from LDC Category The graduation threshold for any two of the following three graduation criteria must be met over two consecutive triennial reviews for graduation from LDC status: Graduation Criteria Nepal Progress vs. Criteria Per capita income GNI per capita >US$ 1,242 (three-year average) US$ 753 (avg. 2015–2017)* Human assets Human Assets Index (HAI) >66 68.7 (2015) Economic vulnerability Economic Vulnerability Index (EVI) <32 26.2 (2015) Source: UN Committee for Development Policy; *GNI per capita, Atlas method (current US$) While Nepal’s Gross National Income (GNI) per capita is well below the threshold for graduation out of the LDC category, the country’s significant progress in human asset- and economic vulnerability- related KPIs have made it eligible for graduation from LDC. However, Nepal has decided not to rely on the non-income criteria framed by the United Nations to graduate from the LDC category, fearing that such a transition would reduce the flow of foreign aid and deprive the country of other international support measures. The expected economic growth rate of 5%–6% is unlikely to help Nepal to achieve its objectives of:  Meeting income criteria for graduation from the LDC category by 2022  Becoming a middle-income country by 2030 To realize its aspiration to become a middle-income country by 2030, Nepal will require substantial infrastructure development alongside a consistent growth rate of 8% to 10% annually. Maintaining a GDP growth rate of 8% to 10% will require broad-based growth spanning infrastructure development, supporting policies, fiscal reforms, and greater foreign participation Agriculture remains the mainstay of the Nepali economy, accounting for the largest share of total value- add at ~32.1%. ● Future growth is projected to be led by the reconstruction of damaged irrigation facilities and sufficient agricultural supplies. However, unseasonal rainfall in August 2017 that resulted in severe flooding and landslides, and affected paddy production has created significant food shortages which may slowdown sector growth. Trade, transport, and construction are other sectors experiencing strong momentum in Nepal. ● Wholesale and retail trade and transport sectors have picked up with the normalization of trade activities and are expected to grow further in the import-driven economy. ● Construction sector growth in 2017–2018 is expected to be boosted by continued momentum in post-earthquake reconstruction and large infrastructure projects. 9 GDP by Industry (%), Nepal, 2017–2018 Source: Nepal's Macro Environment and Key Industry Prospects, 2017–2022 Foreign Direct Investment The Government of Nepal has taken several steps in recent years to encourage foreign direct investment (FDI) in the country. It issued the new Foreign Investment and One-Window Policy 2015, replacing the Foreign Investment and One-Window Policy 1992, and organized the Nepal Investment Summit 2017 with the objective of attracting FDI. Source: Nepal Rastra Bank As a result of these efforts, FDI in Nepal grew by an astounding 128% to reach NPR 13.5 billion in 2017.5 However, Nepal has not been able to harness the full potential of FDI investments with net FDI contribution at only 0.8% of GDP.6 To optimize FDI investments, the Government of Nepal should continue its efforts to attract foreign investors to bridge funding gaps in targeted sectors, and enable technology transfer and sharing of best practices from other economies. 5 Nepal Rastra Bank 6 World Bank 10 Inflation Rate Following significant volatility in the past five years, the inflation rate in Nepal had stabilized, reaching a 13-year low in 2017, aided by declining food prices and moderation in the cost of non-food items. In 2018, the inflation rate reported a marginal spike due to a sharp rise in vegetable prices; going forward, it is forecast to remain at 5%. In recent months, strong trade linkages with India have resulted in Nepal’s inflation trend mimicking that of India. Source: Nepal's Macro Environment and Key Industry Prospects, 2017–2022 Population High population growth in Nepal has long been regarded as one of the critical challenges inhibiting economic growth. The country’s population almost doubled between 1960 and 1990. However, the expansion of mass education, rising economic opportunities, urbanization, growth in female labor force participation, and delayed marriages are leading to declines in fertility rates and slowing population growth.

This is primarily due to socioeconomic conditions where almost 80% of Nepal’s population lives in rural areas, have large families, very small landholdings, and lack access to primary healthcare, education, safe drinking water, sanitation, and other necessities. The earthquake in 2015 that caused widespread devastation coupled with high dependence on agriculture and geographical issues such as rugged terrain, lack of rainfall, and poor soil quality has further 11 exacerbated the situation. Huge disparities and inequalities continue to exist between regions and underprivileged social groups. Despite the dismal situation, Nepal has gained significant ground in alleviating poverty in the past five years, primarily due to high amounts of remittances from Nepalese who have migrated overseas; Nepal has among the highest foreign remittances in the world at US$6.6 billion, equivalent to 31.3% of the country’s GDP in 2016.7 Poverty Statistics, Nepal Metrics 1995/96 2003/04 2010/11 Population living below international poverty line (US$1.90 a day) 61.9% 46.1% 15.0% Population living below international poverty line (US$3.10 a day) 86.6% 75.5% 50.8% Population living below national poverty line 41.8% 30.9% 25.2% Source: World Bank; Nepal Central Bureau of Statistics Literacy Rate Nepal has made remarkable progress in improving its education system, increasing net primary school enrolment rates from 68.0% to 94.7% from 1991–2017.8 Government efforts such as the School Sector Development Program (SSDP) and ICT implementation through Open Learning Exchange (OLE) Nepal and Open IDEO programs have closed the gender and age gaps in education considerably – one in five elderly people are able to read and write. However, with an adult literacy rate of ~59.6%, Nepal continues to rank the lowest among key South Asian countries, as the majority of youth still struggle to gain access to education, particularly at the secondary and tertiary levels. To overcome this, the government needs to devise better incentives and monitoring mechanisms to ensure the efficient implementation of its various programs. 7 Pew Research Center and World Bank, 2017 8 UNESCO Source: World Bank 12 Literacy Rate (%)*, Nepal vs Selected Asian Countries9 Enrolment Ratio (%), Nepal vs Selected Asian Countries, 201610 *Latest available census data in the country High Rural Population Despite rapid urbanization in recent years, Nepal remains one of the least urbanized countries in the world. The World Bank estimates that only one-fifth of the Nepali population lives in urban areas, while more than 80% of the population resides in rural areas. Source: World Bank Most infrastructure and socioeconomic development in Nepal are centered in a few large cities, while people in remote rural areas continue to struggle with poor infrastructure and limited access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and financial services. As a result, Nepal trails its South Asian peers in economic growth and SDGs with high poverty and low adult literacy rates. Nepal needs to adopt a holistic approach to investing in its socioeconomic growth aspirations. It is important for the Government of Nepal to focus on extending the reach of its services and development agenda to rural areas to drive inclusive growth and achieve its vision of “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali”. 9 Data for the Sustainable Development Goals by Country, UNESCO Institute for Statistics 10 Data for the Sustainable Development Goals by Country, UNESCO Institute for Statistics 13 State of Digital Adoption in Nepal Policy and Regulatory Foundation for Digital Nepal A number of policy and regulatory frameworks governing the ICT sector provide a basic foundation for the Digital Nepal framework. For example, the National ICT Policy introduced in 2015 seeks to enhance the vision of transforming Nepali society into knowledge and information based society by harnessing rapid advances in the ICT sector. Similarly, the National Broadband Policy announced in 2016 puts forth a framework for stimulating broadband access and availability across the country. Among others, policy emphasis that has been placed on effectively leveraging Universal Service Access Funds as a means of bridging digital divide will provide a strong mechanism for expanding broadband access to communities beyond urban areas if implemented effectively. While effective implementation of these policy instruments can substantially complement Digital Nepal Program, it will be important to understand the role of a holistic policy regime that transcends ICT domain. For example, there could be a need to revisit investment and trade policies to secure large scale private sector participation in various sectors within the digital economy such as (ecommerce, sharing economy and IT enabled services). Similarly, it will be important to carry out broad based policy gap analysis so as to ensure that Digital Nepal Program is grounded on sound policy frameworks. In addition to a number of policy and regulatory frameworks including the National ICT Policy, National Broadband Policy and Electronic Transaction Act, the government has also developed the Government Enterprise Architecture (GEA) and Nepal e-Governance Interoperability Framework (NeGIF) which mark some of the foundational initiatives for enabling roll-out of citizen centric digital services and systems that are interoperable and provide a framework for seamless integration. These frameworks do have applicability beyond the realm of centralized roll-out of digitally enabled government services and could easily be adapted to provincial and Local level settings reflecting new political reality of the federal system of governance. In addition, the Government Websites Design/Development and Management Guidelines published in 2068 could also help ensure standardization in the way contents for public consumption are presented by government agencies. The Digital Nepal initiative must assess and evaluate these frameworks and the supporting government endorsed guidelines concerning automation and digitalization of government services and suggest improvements if necessary. 14 Mobile-first Economy In the past, the expansion of telecommunication infrastructure in Nepal was restricted due to multiple challenges including difficult topography, adverse economic conditions, and political instability. In the past decade, however, the country has seen notable improvements in the telecommunication landscape driven by investments from leading mobile network operators Telecom and Ncell. Like many other Asian countries, the mobile services industry in Nepal has recorded remarkable growth in the past four to five years. Mobile penetration increased exponentially to 113% in 2017 from 21% in 2009,11 with the robust growth expected to sustain in the next five years.

Source: Nepal Telecom Authority; World Bank 11 Nepal Telecommunications Authority 15 According to the Nepal Telecommunications Authority, 2.25 million new users were connected to the Internet in 2017, translating into approximately 250 new Internet users every hour. Rapid penetration of Internet in Nepal is being driven by: ● Increasing popularity of social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram) and online communication platforms (e.g., WhatsApp and IMO) ● Growing mobile connections and smartphone penetration ● Increasing use cases in areas such as entertainment (e.g., YouTube), music streaming, and e- commerce 2.25 million new Internet users added in 2017 250 new Internet users per hour Teenagers and youth are key power user segments With the surge in mobile Internet usage, Nepal is expected to surpass the mobile Internet penetration rate of countries such as India and China. Source: International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Mobile operators in Nepal are increasing investments in infrastructure to meet the growing demand for data services. Leading mobile operators are focusing on rolling out 4G services since its launch in early 2017, with 60% of cities in Nepal projected to receive access in the next to two to three years. 4G Telecom Providers 4G Network and Coverage Investment 2017–2018 Nepal Telecom 50% share in Nepalese mobile market in 2018 Launched: Jan 1, 2017 Current Coverage 2 Cities (Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhatapur and Pokhara) ZTE, Huawei and Mavenir to invest US$15.36 million, US$38 million and US$21 million respectively to provide LTE core network service to Nepal Telecom NCELL 46% share in Nepalese mobile market in 2018 Launched: Jun 1, 2017 Current Coverage: 21 Cities Aims to provide 4G services in 40 cities by 2018 Investment of more than US$460 million for the technology transfer and infrastructure.

Fixed broadband services are largely confined to larger cities with some ISPs beginning to offer fiber connections to homes. The Government of Nepal is initiating steps to expand Internet connectivity as part of its vision of a digital society that connects 90% of the population to broadband services by 2020.12 In May 2018, Nepal Telecommunications Authority selected Subisu, a privately-owned Nepali company focusing on cable TV and cable Internet, to build Fiber-To-The-Home (FTTH) network in eight districts in Province 2 of Nepal. Social Media The growing popularity of social media is the key driver for Internet adoption in Nepal, making the country second only to Bhutan in South Asia in social media penetration. Source: Hootsuite, 2017 As at January 2018, Nepal has nearly 9.3 million Facebook users.13 Entertainment and video sharing are other popular use cases with more than 6.4 million registered users on YouTube.14 Expanding social media use is catalyzing the growth of digital marketing in Nepal. Website development, social media marketing, content management, web design, and e-mail marketing have become one of the fastest modes of disseminating information. E-commerce Set to Flourish As at May 2017, there are more than 56,286 registered websites in Nepal, including 40,000 commercial websites.15 Many businesses and organizations leverage digital marketing to enhance their online presence and promote their business globally. The growth of e-commerce in Nepal is inhibited due to the lack of a supporting ecosystem such as limited digital payment options. However, this is changing with the emergence of fintech start-ups such as eSewa and Khalti which are expected to disrupt the payments landscape. Digital to Unlock Potential for Nepal Digital adoption in Nepal is higher than ever with near-universal mobile adoption and almost 60% Internet penetration. While Nepalese are adopting Internet-based services at a rapid pace, case studies for adoption in the public sector and enterprises are scarce. Nepal lacks a support ecosystem such as digital 12 Nepal’s ICT Development and Broadband Policy, 2015 13 Hootsuite 14 Social Blade 15 Nepal Country Commercial Guide, Export.gov 17 payments and online banking which are critical for the development of a digital society. As a result, Nepali society has not been able to reap the full benefits of the ongoing digital revolution. Emerging business models and disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and the Internet of things (IoT) are transforming the way work is done. These digital technologies are allowing governments and enterprises globally to unlock the potential to achieve exponential growth. Digital as a Catalyst for Exponential Accelerated Growth There are strong linkages between digital adoption and GDP growth. According to a World Bank report, every 10% increase in Internet penetration in a country results in incremental economic growth of 1.3%.16 The impact is more pronounced once the penetration reaches critical mass. Source: World Bank; International Telecommunication Union (ITU); Nepal Telecommunications Authority Nepal needs to expand at a significantly higher rate (8%–10%) than current projections (~5%) to have a realistic chance of meeting the income criteria for elevation from the LDC category by 2022 and becoming a middle-income country by 2030. Disruptive digital technologies have the potential to enable Nepal to fast- track its socioeconomic growth. The Digital Nepal framework intends to guide Nepal in identifying critical digital initiatives that can allow it to meet its growth potential. 16 Exploring the Relationship Between Broadband and Economic Growth, World Bank, 2016 18 By leveraging disruptive technologies to drive socioeconomic growth, the Digital Nepal program will allow Nepal to unlock its growth potential and become a developing country by 2022 and a middle-income nation by 2030. 19 Some of the digital initiatives undertaken by the Government of Nepal Digital Foundation Digital Signature Stakeholders: MoCIT, OCC Optical Fiber Networking Stakeholders: MoCIT, NTA, Telecom Companies Different types of Internet technology (VSAT) Stakeholders: MoCIT, NTA Virtual Private Network (VPN) Connections Stakeholders: MoCIT, NDCL Nepal Vital Registration Stakeholders: MoFAGA, MoHA Supported by: World Bank Cyber security and Data Center Stakeholders: MoHA, MoCIT, NITC, NP Supported by: KOICA Supply, delivery, installation & testing microwave radio for mid hill Stakeholders: MoCIT, NTC Agriculture Call centers for supporting farmers (Kisan Call Centers) Stakeholders: MoFAGA, MoCIT NITC, NTA Mobile apps: Support Farmers on plant health and other agriculture related news and alerts Stakeholders: MoALD, MoCIT, NITC Agriculture Atlas of Nepal Stakeholders: MoALD, ICIMOD Supported by: ICIMOD Pilot Program of Climate Resilience: Agriculture Management Information System Stakeholders: World Bank, MoALD Land Usage Monitoring and Analysis Stakeholders: MoALD, MoLCPA Use of GIS and remote sensing along with the use of ICT Stakeholders: MoALD, MoLCPA Land use zoning maps based on soil quality and crop suitability Stakeholders: MoALD and MoLCPA National Geographic Information Infrastructure Stakeholders: MoLCPA, Survey Department Management information system of tea and coffee sub-sector of Nepal Stakeholders: National Tea and Coffee Development Board Supported by: European Union 20 Digital training method to framers for pesticides analysis Stakeholders: MoALD Mobile application on tomato and kausi kheti (house terrace farming) Stakeholders: Vegetable Crops Development Centre, MoALD Supported by: ICT in Agriculture Nepal, UNDP NARC Krishi application launched by Nepal Agriculture Research Council Stakeholders: MoALD Proper price tracking system Stakeholders: MoALD, NDCL Food and Safety (Pesticide Tracking) Stakeholders: MoALD, DFTQC Online Seedling Order System Stakeholders: Vegetable Crops Development Centre Land Record Information Management System (LRIMS) Stakeholders: MoLCPA, DoLMA Supported by: GoN, ADB National Geoportal Stakeholders: MoLCPA, MoFE, DoR, DoMG Bhumi Sushaasan Application Stakeholders: MoLCPA Digitization of Land Parcels Stakeholders: DoLIA Scanning of Field book and Plot Register Stakeholders: DoLIA Application for calculation registration fee and capital gains tax Stakeholders: DoLIA Spatial Application Extension Software Stakeholders: DoLIA Parcel Editor software Stakeholders: Cadastral survey division, Survey department Health E-Childcare Stakeholders: MoHP ELMI's- Electronic Logistics Management Information System Stakeholders: DoHS HMIS-Health Management Information System Stakeholders: DoHS Early Warning and Reporting System Stakeholders: Epidemiology and Disease Control Division Health Infrastructure Information System Stakeholders: DoHS 21 DHIS2 Tracker Stakeholders: DoHS SMS Messaging Stakeholders: National Health Education Information Communication Centre Mobile Health Stakeholders: MoHP, Family welfare division MDIS-Malaria and Disease Information System Stakeholders: Epidemiology and disease control division created by EKbana Telemedicine Stakeholders: Patan Hospital Education GPS Mapping is in practice since 2070–2071 Stakeholders: MoEST Energy Energy Consumption pricing (Smart Pricing according to usage of the electricity) Stakeholders: NEA, ETFC Smart Licensing Stakeholders: NEA GIS Smart Grid Stakeholders: NEA, NTGA Tourism Reliable Tourism Information System Stakeholders: MoCTCA, Tourism Board Nepal TIMs Card Chip (Trekker’s Information Management system) Stakeholders: MoCTCA, Tourism Board Nepal, TAAN Finance National Payment Gateway Stakeholders: MoF, MoCIT, NITC, NRB Secure Payment System (Reduce cost of financial transfer/ withdrawal from any ATM's should be free of cost).

The Government of Nepal needs to undertake initiatives for driving digital adoption and facilitating the establishment of a reliable ICT infrastructure through PPPs. Digital Connectivity Needs to be a Key Priority Digital connectivity in Nepal has improved considerably in the past few years due to the rapid adoption of mobile Internet. However, it continues to lag behind its neighbors and developed economies in the overall development of the ICT sector. As a result, strengthening digital connectivity needs to be a key priority for the Government of Nepal. In coordination with MoCIT and in consultation with other concerned stakeholders following actions are identified to improve digital connectivity: ● Make Internet access a fundamental right for every citizen ● Improve availability of spectrum to operators to enhance service coverage and quality 24 ● Take leadership in driving 5G adoption in South Asia ● Establish a nationwide fiber network Facilitate Development of a Robust Financial Ecosystem Digital payments and financial transactions conducted through smartphones and mobile devices are now a vital cog in modern financial infrastructure. A strong digital finance ecosystem can facilitate the evolution of new business models and digital start-ups, generating new job opportunities and enabling faster economic growth. Digital financial services also have the potential to encourage financial inclusion by allowing previously unbanked population access to these services. Nepal has an underdeveloped financial ecosystem with low penetration of digital financial services. As a result, facilitating the development of a robust financial ecosystem needs to be a priority of the government. Possible actions in this direction include: ● Promoting digital payments ● Attracting investments in fintech by encouraging the growth of start-ups and telecom companies that offer services to drive financial inclusion Entrepreneurship/PPP The Digital Nepal program would require significant investments, which the government alone cannot provide. Public-private partnerships and foreign investments need to play a major role in Digital Nepal by bringing technological expertise and capital infusion for sustainability and scalability of the program. The government should initiate necessary policy interventions to encourage private sector participation in the Digital Nepal program. It could consider taking the following steps to improve the ease of doing business in priority areas: Private Sector Participation Possible actions include: ● Rolling out a digitally streamlined PPP application system for mobilizing private investment in Digital Nepal ● Offering tax holidays for investments in critical areas (e.g., companies focusing on Smart Health in remote rural areas can be given a three-year tax holiday) ● Providing a startup accelerator program to build a strong ecosystem for nurturing innovation and entrepreneurship in tackling key challenges and generating large-scale job opportunities Foreign Investments Foreign investment can help Nepal leverage skills and insights from similar initiatives undertaken by foreign investors in other parts of the world. Possible actions to attract foreign investments include: ● Fast-tracking FDI applications for Digital Nepal initiatives through a single window system ● Increasing FDI limits and easier repatriation of funds (e.g., 100% FDI for Digital Nepal initiatives) Talent and Skills Development Digital Nepal program aims to open up opportunities for socioeconomic growth by addressing challenges in various sectors and enabling Nepal to enter an era of high economic growth. Investment in enhancing the digital skills of the Nepalese is critical to reap the real benefits of the Digital Nepal program. Possible actions include: ● Investing in digital education ● Training public servants in digital skills 25 Improve Digital Education The Government of Nepal should consider the following efforts to enhance the digital skills of the Nepalese: ● Compulsory IT education for schools and colleges ● Geospatial/GIS education for schools and colleges ● Systematically strengthen Nepal’s education system’s capacity to impart advanced ICT education ● ICT literacy programs aimed at combating digital exclusion in rural communities and underprivileged Nepalese Digital Skills Training of Public Servants Making public servants digitally ready is essential to the success of the Digital Nepal program. The government should ensure the establishment of IT training teams in all government agencies to impart digital training for its staff. It can also consider leveraging the proposed National eLearning Platform to train its employees on new systems and technologies introduced in their respective departments. 26 Digital Nepal Framework: 1 – 8 – 80 Vision  Digital based Social economic prosperity Mission  To harness digital technologies as a catalyst to positively transform government, society and economy Objectives  To strengthen the foundation for a knowledge-based society and digital economy  To provide a framework for action aimed at leveraging digital technologies to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Under the Digital Nepal framework, eight sectors – digital foundation, agriculture, health, education, energy, tourism, finance and urban infrastructure – have been identified based on close engagement with stakeholders. The framework aims to guide Nepal on its journey toward becoming a digital state. Digital Foundation: Digital foundation is the foundation of the Digital Nepal program. While Internet penetration in Nepal has risen sharply in the past few years, a large section of Nepalese remains digitally uninitiated due to concerns around affordability, access, and digital illiteracy. The program intends to bridge this gap by providing broader access to connectivity using public-private partnerships and government initiatives. Agriculture: Digital Nepal initiatives in the agriculture sector encompass technological solutions aimed at maximizing yield and minimizing agricultural input. The use of agritech solutions is anticipated to boost farm productivity and sustainability to meet growing food consumption, and in turn, increase farmers’ incomes. 27 Health: Digital Nepal initiatives in health aim to assist the country in meeting its objectives of providing quality basic healthcare to all citizens. The program intends to leverage digital technologies (e.g., videoconferencing, e-learning, and mobile health) to address issues relating to access, affordability, and quality of healthcare for the Nepalese. Education: Digital Nepal initiatives in education aim to prepare human capital to capture new economic opportunities through the creation of an enhanced teaching and learning environment. This entails the use of digital technologies to support teaching, enrich the learning experience, and improve educational outcomes. Energy: Digital initiatives in the energy sector aim to create a sustainable energy infrastructure to not only reduce costs but also reinforce energy networks. Smart solutions include customer-centric solutions, smart transmissions, and distribution networks, with interconnectivity playing an important role. Tourism: Digital initiatives in the tourism sector seek to promote Nepal globally, attract visitors to the country, and create employment opportunities for the Nepalese. It involves the use of omnichannel marketing solutions, e-commerce, and disruptive technologies such as augmented reality to promote tourism, build human capital skills in the tourism sector, and offer better tourist experiences. Finance: Digital Nepal initiatives in promoting the financial services sector target the sizeable unbanked population by leveraging digital technology and telecoms infrastructure. Given the strong linkages between financial inclusion and economic prosperity, Nepal is poised to benefit considerably from the use of fintech, broadening access to financial services to nearly 55% of the country’s unbanked population. Urban Infrastructure: Digital Nepal initiatives in urban infrastructure aim to leverage disruptive technologies to improve the quality of life in Nepal’s urban cities by improving essential services, such as water management, solid waste management, public transport, and traffic management. Eighty digital initiatives are identified across eight critical sectors to guide Nepal as it embarks on its digital transformation journey. The 80 digital initiatives aims to propel socioeconomic growth in Nepal by addressing crucial challenges while unlocking the growth potential in each of the eight key sectors. 1 Country – 8 Sectors – 80 Digital Initiatives 28 GDP Impact of US$8 billion It is estimated the complete impact of Digital Nepal initiatives to the tune of US$8 billion (NPR800 billion) upon complete implementation of programs across different sectors. The estimation is arrived on after analysis of following key points-  Capital investment in ICT has been a key driver of global growth World Bank study indicates that ICT has been a major growth driver across different economies globally during the period of 1995-2014. The impact of ICT in terms of capital infusion has been more profound in developed economies, where it averaged 27%, compares to developing economies averaging 14%. During the same period, it was also observed that developed economies spent close to 10% of capital on labor quality compared to developing economies spending 3% only.17  Government spending on ICT project roll-out and maintenance Capital infusion in form of government funding across different programs which is estimated to be over US$300 million for a period of 10 years. The capital investment is expected to drive the economic growth with help of telecom market. Potential points of investment are tenders for equipment and infrastructure roll-out, maintenance, skilling and re-skilling and revenue stream. E.g. Nepal has launched a US$35.5 million worth project to increase broadband connectivity in hilly and rural areas. Similar projects in future can improve direct and indirect employment.18  E-Governance and Cost Savings Government is often the leading ICT beneficiary in a developing or low-income economy. Some of the important areas have been e-governance, revenue streamlining, education and healthcare. Health care alone can help the government save up to 20% with use of telemedicine and remote consultations19. E-governance across developing economies such as India has helped government reach remote areas and streamlined processes across every aspect, reducing the cost of delay and inefficiency.  Job creation and skill development ICT infrastructure and internet-based economy has the potential to boost the Nepal job-market across different verticals. Telecom and e-commerce are already proving to be early job facilitator across different levels. Nepal’s e-commerce sector is valued close to US$30 million, which is experiencing growth at over 40% per annum. Nepal’s e-commerce revenue by 2023 is expected to cross US$192 million annually at current growth rates.20 Telecom sector is another major employer, which has the potential to growth Nepal’s job market in form of skilled workforce requirement for technical work, installation, maintenance. Growth across internet and ICT based verticals will enable a larger IT-BPO sector in Nepal. A shift to service economy has the potential to add another US$4.0 billion in the fifth year of implementation, with potential cumulative impact of close to US$10.5 billion across 5-years. 17 Accelerating Growth, World Development Report 2016 18 19 Broadband: A Platform for Progress, Broadband Commission 2011 20 asia.html 29  ICT as Enabler in Agriculture Nepal’s agricultural sector can benefit from early stage of ICT adoption in form of inclusive programs and community-based projects. Getting the commodity markets online can help farmers track prices in real-time, enabling better price for yield. Similarly, community centers with internet and media connection can help modern agricultural methods reach rural and hilly areas via tele-conferencing. Using common platforms for selling yield can help reduce distribution costs. There are similar inclusive technologies in place in Africa, India and Bangladesh which have enabled farmers to attain better yields and prices.  Capital Deepening Major investment and growth in ICT technologies has been observed to lead subsequent increase in workforce efficiency and lower equipment cost, resulting in overall capital savings in in long-run. This results in greater savings for further investment in other business or socio-economic areas.21 Investment for Digital Nepal Digital Nepal project will require a large-scale investment with an aggressive plan to achieve the desired benefits. World Bank mentions 10% increase in penetration of broadband to have impact of 1.19% on high-income economies and 1.35% on low- and middle-income economies. Similarly, a 10% increase in penetration of mobile devices is expected to have an impact of 0.21% and 0.40% for high-income and low- and middle-income economies respectively. Nepal’s current internet penetration at close to 60% is mostly 2G based, which needs to be replaced with 3G/4G and broadband fixed line connection in order to harness the benefits. Analysis of select economies estimates the required direct investment from Government to be close around US$350 million over 10 years.22 The investment in next 5-years could be on higher proportion to facilitate the rapid build-up of basic infrastructure in form of fiber cables, telecom set-up, skilling and re-skilling, R&D, industry development, inclusion of rural areas into IT network and implementation of e-governance programs. A robust 21 What is the Impact of ICT on Economic Growth, The Write Pass Journal, December 2012 22 Frost and Sullivan analysis 25.26 36.30 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 2017 2022 G D P V a lu e in U S $ b il li o n S e ct o r w is e c o n tr ib tu io n t o G D P , in U S $ b il li o n Projected GDP Growth DIgital Nepal, Services Industry Agriculture GDP ( current US$, billion) 30 infrastructure in short-span of time will also allow Nepal to attract potential FDI sources in different sector early-on. The main focus and responsibility for government would be to expand the infrastructure outside the urban centers, as private players may find it economically unviable due to longer gestation period. Digital Nepal and Employment Opportunities ICT infrastructure and internet-based economy will boost Nepal’s job market across different verticals. Some of the fast-growing verticals directly impacted by ICT in Nepali economy are e-Commerce, telecom, IT-BPO, banking and finance. Digital Nepal project is expected to help grow Nepal’s GDP by 3.2% at the end of initial implementation period. Telecom and e-commerce are already proving to be early job facilitator across different levels. This is likely to be driven by:  Growth of Service sector Internet economy can boost the employment opportunities in service sector and hence, increase the GDP contribution per capita labor employed. Countries like India, Malaysia, Vietnam, Philippines have experienced exponential growth with help of service sector. In Nepal, per capita service sector contribution to GDP is more than seven-times compared to agriculture23. E- commerce studies in India and China have highlighted that for each direct job created, there are three jobs created in allied and indirect form.24 Nepal’s service economy can potentially absorb close to 1.3 million additional workforce in 5 years, most of which would be diverted from agriculture.  MSMEs leveraging ICT and internet technology ICT evolution has been a major factor in equalizing the playing-field for smaller businesses and entrepreneurs. It has substantially lowered the entry-barriers compared to conventional business models, while providing a larger market audience. This 23 World Bank Data, 2017 24 Impact of e-commerce on employment in India, Dec 2016, KPMG 4.90 4.96 5.02 5.09 5.12 5.22 4.90 5.42 5.74 6.07 6.40 6.48 0.00 0.46 0.71 0.98 1.28 1.26 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 0.00 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00 5.00 6.00 7.00 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 G D P I m p a ct , U S $ m il li o n N u m b e r o f jo b s. i n m il li o n Employment Growth in Services- GDP Impact Employment in Service Emloyment in Services with Digital Nepal Additional Jobs ( in mn) Additional GDP Contribution (in US$ million) 31  E-commerce Growth in online market sellers is expected to contribute the Nepalese economy in big way. Nepal’s e-commerce industry is value at US$30 million and is expected to grow at more than 41%. The number of online sellers and platforms connecting to e-commerce is growing exponentially. The employment impact for the sector has been estimated to be 1:4, where four indirect jobs are created for each direct job. Increase in online seller base also creates additional 12 jobs in support services as delivery, customer service, warehousing etc.  Technology Start-ups and App ecosystem Nepal’s startup sector is still in infancy and app ecosystem has only started to see growth in past couple of years. With improvement in IT infrastructure, the start-up sector can enable the app ecosystem in Nepal, which is combined with mobile-devices can unlock an entire new segment of employment. The impact on job market has been impressive where for each job in App economy created 2.9 jobs in direct, indirect and induced forms.  Evolution of internet and IT-BPO growth Nepal’s IT space has about 500 companies with most of them with most of them focused on IT and ITES. Tech start-up scene in Nepal has been around for some time but has failed to catch up. The sector has started to grow with more focus from government and boost in the IT infrastructure. IT- BPO can be catalyst to Nepal’s tech-based job creation on the lines of neighboring India, Philippines and Vietnam while adding to services sector.  Strengthening of innovation Ecosystem Internet and ICT are considered as key enablers for innovation and R&D in modern times, helping to bring together isolated wells of disruption. Homegrown innovation ecosystem is the key to attracting foreign investment and also enabling disruptive growth across key sectors as banking, finance, inclusive innovation, agriculture, skill development education, while creating new employment opportunities in process.  Industry and Construction With increase in telecommunication infrastructure deployment, direct job markets across construction and engineering will see growth. The nature of jobs is expected to be a mix of skilled blue collared jobs and white collar jobs. Additional employment opportunities in field of support activities as logistics and supply would also emerge. Domestic telecom and ICT industry will see job creation in form of maintenance and sales of hardware. Further development of infrastructure can encourage domestic manufacturing Caveat The mentioned growth figures in the report are estimates based in specific assumption on condition of current state of economy, future policy direction, governance efficiency and other independent market factors that can influence economic conditions. The goals are achievable when simultaneous changes can be brought about in governance pattern and decision-making. Nepal’s ICT sector has been a key victim of lack of proper project implantation and slow utilization of project funds. There are also challenges with physical infrastructure in terms of roads and rails, which can prove to be hindrance. With expects simultaneous efforts in the direction of overcoming these challenges to gain optimal benefit out of Digital Nepal project. 32 Appendix Current Position of Nepal Growing popularity of social media and online communication platforms using smart phones has played important role in rising penetration of internet across Nepal. Internet penetration in Nepal stood at 57% in 2017, higher than South Asian average of 36%. Mobile connectivity in Nepal stood at 125% of the population, which is higher than the regional average of 91%, which includes India at 90% of the population. However less than 1/3rd of mobile connections in Nepal are 3G/4G which limits the user usage and experience with mobile internet.

Internet maturity across developed economies was observed to have contributed to an increase in real GDP by US$500 per capita on an average during 15-year study. The graph below shows the rate of internet penetration vs the per capita income of economies. Here the gap between Nepal’s current and potential per capita income can be observed relative to that of China, Philippines and Mexico. Source: World Bank; International Telecommunication Union (ITU); Nepal Telecom Authority Though Nepal has as a high internet penetration, per capita income remains low compared to most of its peers. The internet penetration in Nepal is primarily driven by 2G networks, accounting for 2/3rd of the connection, while broadband connectivity including mobile and fixed remains below 30%. The broadband services are dominated by mobile broadband which accounts for more than 65% of 0 20 40 60 80 Nepal Bangladesh India Vietnam Philippines S co re o n s ca le o f 1 0 0 ICT Indicator for Nepal Compared to select countries ( 2017) Consumer Readiness Availability of Relevant Content Mobile Network Infra 34 broadband connections25. The situation highlights lack of developed ICT ecosystem which can provide greater benefits in terms of revenue, job-creation and overall social well-being. Nepal has lacked presence of substantial IT outsourcing or BPO business which thrive on ICT infrastructure and local talent. A key requirement for large scale IT businesses to flourish has been robust underlying IT infrastructure and civic facilities as electric-power supply. ICT and GDP Contribution World Bank report titled ‘Exploring the relationship between broadband and Economic Growth’ in 2016 highlights the direct correlation between different ICT technologies with GDP growth across developing and developed economies. The report infers on the basis of 10 percentage point increase in penetration across different ICT technologies as fixed landline connection, mobile phone, internet (wired, wireless) and broadband connection. The sectorial analysis of each of these vertical revealed a different level of impact on economies GDP growth. Broadband was observed to have the highest impact with 1.19% on high-income economies and 1.35% on low- and middle-income economies, while mobile has lowest impact with 0.21% and 0.40% for high-income and low- and middle-income economies respectively.26 ICT development has also been a direct contributor to GDP growth globally. Study conducted for the period of 1995 to 2014, indicated that ICT capital was responsible for about 20% growth across global economies on an average. It contributed the most to developed economies, with average of 27% across 39 countries studied. The average contribution across 91 developing countries was close to 14% for the same period.27 The report was based on studies carried out across different countries at different level of economic progress. Whilst broadband was a key growth factor in most of the economies, the report also found that mobile penetration was a key driver as well for some of the lower income economies. Internet Economy Internet has increasingly become a major direct contributor to GDP, accounting more than 3.4% across large and developed economies. The impact of internet has also accelerated the economic growth across developed and developing economies. For the period during 2005-09, internet’s contribution in select developed economies was 21% and in large developing economies it was 11%. The variation in level of contribution depended on the scale of technology development and overall eco-system maturity. Matured economies with more balanced systems and platforms in place were able to harness more economic benefits, while the developing economies had few challenges due to gaps, e.g. coverage of population, platforms and adoption, which limited the benefits. The middle economies as Malaysia, Turkey experienced greater benefits, but not on the same scale as matured economies. Impact of internet has been substantial in terms of creating and replacing jobs. The McKinsey Global SME Survey estimates an average of 2.6 jobs created for every job eliminated. Study on French economy revealed internet to have created 1.2 million jobs where it eliminated 500,000 jobs over 1995 t0 2009, with ratio of 2.4 jobs for every job lost.28 25 26 Exploring the Relationship Between Broadband and Economic Growth, WDR 2016, World Bank 27 Accelerating Growth, World Development Report 2016 28 The Great Transformer: The impact of Internet on Economic Growth and Prosperity, McKinsey Global Institute, October 2011 35 Potential Impact on Nepal Growth in ICT can directly impact Nepal’s GDP value in coming years with a paradigm shift in employment across sectors. Internet penetration in Nepal grew during 2014-2017 by 21% of population. However, with slower internet connection more prevalent, the focus is now on upgrading the infrastructure to broadband and 4G levels. Current broadband penetration is close to 30% mostly over 3G/4G mobile connections. Nepal government had targeted 45% coverage across households by broadband by 2018 and all the VDCs29 under broadband Master Plan 2020. Additional penetration of broadband internet can aid Nepal’s GDP by 2.8-3.3% for each 10% penetration achieved, it is estimated a slower growth in overall internet penetration growth, but expects development of broadband in the existing network areas. Improved broadband coverage can help Nepal realize more than 3% GDP value addition over next 5-years. ICT evolution in India led to 17% increase in internet traffic which during 2015-16 lead to absolute increase in GDP by USD103 billion, whereas increase in mobile of same scale would add have added US$41.4 billion.30 Okun’s Law Okun’s Law explores and defines the relationship between employment and GDP growth. The law based on empirical evidences mentions that every time GDP grows 2% faster than the normal growth rate31, 1 percentage point of employment is created. The law also has been applied with GNI, employment rises by 1%, GNI increases by 3%. Research data by different sources also presents a strong co-relation between job creation and GDP of up to 0.7 to 0.82. 323334 29 VDC- Village Development Center 30 Estimating the value of new-generation internet-based applications in India, July 2017, ICRIER-Broadband India Forum 31 Normal Growth rate- the potential growth rate of economy under current condition without external disruption 32 33 34 employment-and-economic-growth/ 25.26 36.30 0.00 5.00 10.00 15.00 20.00 25.00 30.00 35.00 40.00 0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 30000 35000 40000 2017 2022 G D P V a lu e , i n U S $ b il li o n S e ct o r w is e c o n tr ib tu io n t o G D P , in U S $ c u rr e n t y e a rs Porjected GDP Growth DIgital Nepal, US$ million Services Industry Agriculture GDP ( current US$, billion) 36 Impact on Job Market Nepal’s e-commerce sector is valued close to US$30 million, which is experiencing growth at over 40% per annum. Nepal’s e-commerce revenue by 2023 is expected to cross US$192 million annually at current growth rates. The industry has proved to have huge impact on job-creation throughout the supply chain across different economies, including large economies as India and China, with more than 2/3rd of the jobs in logistics, ware-housing and last-mile delivery. Direct jobs created by the start-up and e-commerce sector grew by CAGR of 50% for 2012-2015 period and is expected to continue the same through to 2021. Nepal’s job sector has huge potential to boost from the same, as it has an under developed logistics infrastructure and lacks in last-mile delivery. The seller base for Nepal’s online business has been on the growth. Telecom is another area which has been consistent with positive impact on job creation. The opportunities exist across telecom installation, equipment manufacturing, distribution, maintenance etc. India expects more 20 million jobs in telecom sector by 2025, driven by fiber network plans, BTS installations, WiFi projects, and domestic telecom industry. Nepal as of now imports most of its equipment and has an untapped potential3536373839 Potential Impact of Service Sector in Nepal As of 2017, Nepal’s 70% of the population is employed in agricultural activities and contributes 26.41% of GDP. Services employ 20.1% of workforce while contributing 51.6% of GDP. For 2017, per capita employment in service yielded GDP value addition of US$8,468.56 in PPP, compared to US$1,212.05 by agricultural and allied sectors. The shift from agriculture to services across workforce has been linear and consistent over last few years. Growth in ICT and internet economy can absorb the annual addition of workforce into service economy at increasing rate, creating more value per capita. Every year more than 500,000 youth are entering into Nepal’s job market, translating into need of at least 286,900 jobs to sustain the current rate of employment.40 It is predicted additional job opportunities created across service sector across different vertical of economy, there is a potential growth of 1 percentage point of workforce working in service sector. In 5 years, the potential impact of workforce employed in service economy reaching 25% of total active workforce is predicted to be more than US$12 billon. This comes at assumption of decline in total employment in agriculture to 65% from 2017 level of 70%. Further benefits can be realized from Digital payments, App ecosystem, and improvement in agro-value chain, smart logistics, education and development of knowledge economy. 35 World Bank, Frost and Sullivan Analysis 36 asia.html 37 38 39 40 World Bank 37 Impact of ICT in job market across select verticals E-commerce – Nepal’s e-commerce has been limited to the Capital and key urban centers, while logistics challenges keep it out of rural areas. The e-commerce sector is still in its early stages, with estimates to be US$25 million in 2017 and is experiencing rapid growth. Growth in e-commerce platforms has the potential to accelerate FMCG, services and other small goods market, resulting in SME growth and employment. Indian e-commerce industry growing at 41% CAGR is expected to add 1.45 million jobs by 2021which employed only 23,500 in 2012. More than 2/3rd of the jobs will be in logistics and warehousing which is available to semi-skilled and skilled workforce. Growth in seller base will add another 10 million new jobs. It is estimated that one job in e-commerce generates 3 jobs in allied sectors. The most important driving force for Indian e-commerce has been growth in smaller cities and towns, which have emerged as both demand and supply centers.41 Daraz Nepal’s major e-commerce website stated that it aims to grow the online sellers from 1200 to 5000 during 2018-19. The indicative job impact has been observed to be of 1:4 ratio, where increase in 1 online seller creates 4 direct jobs and while 12 indirect jobs are created in support services as delivery, customer services, warehousing etc. For a seller count of 5000, the potential impact on job market could be more than 75,000 new jobs across different levels. Boost in e-commerce can drive homegrown IT sector of Nepal, adding additional services jobs to the economy. Information and Communication technology (ICT) - Growth in ICT sector has multi-dimensional benefit for the economy. ICT inclusive of mobile, fixed line and internet is capable of boosting economy across different areas. Growth in ICT coverage and integration across different business sectors can boost in efficiency, bring in network effects and create enhanced logistics. IT-BPO services in Nepal can expand further, which remains an untapped area. Digital platforms for agriculture can boost production, improve supply chain and help farmers connect directly with markets. Start-ups and App ecosystem- Nepal’s IT space has about 500 companies with most of them focused on IT and ITES. Tech start-up scene in Nepal has been around for some time but has failed to catch up. Key challenges being finance, overall customer base and tech readiness of customers. The sector has started to grow with more focus from government and boost in the IT infrastructure. Startups can be catalyst to Nepal’s tech-based job creation on the lines of neighboring India. In 2015, startups in 41 Impact of e-commerce on employment in India, Dec 2016, KPMG 26.7 27.98 29.37 30.98 32.77 26.70 28.45 30.58 33.10 36.08 0% 2% 3% 3% 3% 0% 1% 1% 2% 2% 3% 3% 4% 0 10 20 30 40 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 In cr e m e n ta l G D P g ro w th G D P ( i n U S $ b il li o n ) Digital Nepal Impact- GDP Growth BAU Digital Nepal Incremental GDP Growth 38 India attracted close to US$5 billion in investment, creating 80,000 direct jobs at different skill-levels. Indian app ecosystem contributes more than US$20 billion in 2015-16 which is expected to rise to US$270 billion by 2020. The impact on job market has been impressive where for each job in App economy created 2.9 jobs in direct, indirect and induced forms42. Nepal is yet to be anywhere near to realizing the full-potential of its app-ecosystem. Investment Estimation Digital India, an accelerated ICT development program with additional budget to the tune of US$17 billion for the period of 2015-2025 is forecasted to help Indian GDP by 20-30% of additional growth by 2025. The additional value add to GDP is to come from increased revenue, job creation, foreign and domestic investments and gained efficiency across sectors. Indian budget on ICT has been growing increasingly with further projects being added under the Digital India umbrella. The expected impact on GDP has been measured to the tune of US$500 billion to US$1 trillion by 2025, achievable by simultaneous development across different verticals impacting growth and usage of ICT. Relative comparison of ICT projects across Southeast Asian economies have also been taken into account while putting in the estimated investment and potential benefits for Nepal. However, Nepal, still in the early stages of ICT adoption in several services and manufacturing sector and having smaller economy and geographical size would require the budget to be a lot lesser. It is estimated the overall direct government expenditure to be close to the US$350 million for Nepal to achieve an accelerated growth in different aspects of ICT over a period of 10 years. The estimates have been made by taking into account Nepal’s GDP and Purchasing Power Parity. The investment in next 5-years should be on higher proportion to facilitate the rapid build-up of basic infrastructure in form of fiber cables, telecom set-up, skilling and re-skilling, R&D, industry development etc. Current budget of Nepal in rural and hilly ICT development is US$105 million, which is expected to be spent on optical fiber and rural internet development. Currently Nepal has assigned US$35.5 million for lying of optical fiber networks in hilly and rural areas. The biggest challenge for Nepal’s ITC infrastructure has been slow rate of expenditure which was 2.6% of total budget till 2015. Example/ Case Studies on impact of internet / ICT in some Asian countries – South East Asia Southeast Asia has emerged as a leading hub of internet fueled growth and has seen rise of ICT based economy. More developed economies as Singapore and Malaysia have been driving the internet-based services. Developing economies as Vietnam and Philippines have emerged as leading destinations in IT outsourcing and BPO industry. As highlighted by Google Temasek report 2018, the region is expected to see more than 1.7 million full- time with growth in internet economy by 2025. The number of people employed in high-skilled internet sector will double from 100,000 to 200,000 while creating opportunities in sectors as e- commerce and ride-hailing services along with high-skill jobs, the number of jobs will triple from the jobs created in 2018. The value of internet economy in the region among six major countries has been growing at accelerating rate, doubling from 2015 to 2018 reaching US$72 million. The size of internet’s contribution is expected to be US$240 million by 2025, which is US$40 billion more than last year’s estimate from Google Temasek. 42 Estimating the value of new-generation internet based applications in India, July 2017, ICRIER-Broadband India Forum 39 The growth is expected to be driven by combined efforts of government policies and infrastructure spend in ICT and supporting areas, along with massive private investment in form of venture and angel funding, R&D and user readiness. The growth across key sectors during 2015-2018 was –  E-commerce – recorded a growth rate of 62% CAGR  Online Travel – recorded a growth rate of 15% CAGR  Online Media – recorded a growth rate of 44% CAGR  Ride Hailing– recorded a growth rate of 39% CAGR During the same period contribution to GDP across SEA by internet more than doubled from 1.3% to 2.8%. Among the six major economies, highest contribution was to Vietnam with 4%, while lowest was in Philippines where it contributed 1.6% of GDP. Vietnam Vietnam’s internet sector has led the growth in GDP contribution across Southeast Asia with 4%, while it also has one of the highest CAGR of 35% for growth revenue. Vietnam had raised it focus on IT development and started investment in infrastructure along with policy support to encourage global businesses and entrepreneurs to start operations in Vietnam. Since 2000, its IT sector has expanded from close to being absent to more than 14,000 IT companies across hardware, software and digital content. With its expanding IT skilled labor-force, Vietnam became the 2nd largest IT partner for Japan in 2015. In 2015, Vietnam adopted IT Master plan 2020 with aim of boosting the IT sector and accelerating GDP growth. Plan also emphasized on Vietnam coming under top 55 countries of ICT index of ITU. Philippines Philippines experienced the lowest contribution from internet economy to its GDP with 1.6%, and recorded a growth of 30% during 2015-18. Over the last decade Philippines has emerged as an IT outsourcing hub in SEA, with strong growth in BPO sector. In 2015, Manila became the only city to be among top 7 Outsourcing Destinations outside India. In 2015, Manila’s BPO sector provided employment to more than 1 million people, while generating revenue over US$20 billion and expected to be around US$23 billion for 2016 while employing 1.1 million people. The program during 2011-16 saw US$1 revenue create half-equivalent wealth.43 Further under employment, every full-time job created 3.2 indirect jobs. Philippine Government had been actively engaging in policy and infrastructure development for sustainable long-term growth across IT-BPM industry, while recognizing ICT as a key enabler to achieve the target for sector. BPO was identified as 10 high-potential areas for development in 2011-16 Philippine Development Plan. During the plan government invested heavily in the development of SEZ areas for BPOs and call centers, Creation of regional ICT councils and ICT road map, training programs, along with other fiscal and non-fiscal incentives.44 Philippines have followed up the development plans with IT-BPM Roadmap 2022, which aims to leverage the technology advancement and capabilities to enhance the IT-BPM industry and expand its sub-sectors. The plan highlights Animation and Game Development, Contact Center and BPO, Health Information Management, IT & Software, and Global In-house Centers operations. The roadmap is expected to create 1.8 million direct jobs with 7.6 million direct and in-direct jobs across IT-BPM 43 44 40 and US$40 billion in revenue. More than 500,000 jobs are expected to be created outside NCR at a CAGR of 11% helping employment opportunities in distant areas45 Malaysia- Malaysia had launched HSBB plan in 2008 to expand the capability and reach of its broadband network to enhance business and local infrastructure for improved connectivity using next-generation internet. The project mentioned two categories of connections under the plan-  High Speed Broadband (HSBB)- for residential household and businesses across select geographic areas, connection speed to be 10-100 Mbps, with final speed for connection in economic centers and businesses being 1Gbps.  Broadband to General Population (BBGP) - connection for general public with speeds from 256 Kbps-2 Mbps46, reaching up to 10 Mbps. Project was designed to be spread across 10 years and in two-phases. Agreement on investment and implementation was signed between Ministry of Energy, Water and Communication (KTAK) and Telekom Malaysia (TM) under Public-Private Partnership (PPP). The program aimed to provide last mile connectivity using Fibre-to-the-home (FTTH), Ethernet-to-the-Home (ETTH) and Very High Speed Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL2) to homes and businesses across the country. Investment in the project over 10 years was estimated to be US$3.23 billion in 2008, of which US$685 million was to be contributed by Government of Malaysia and US$2.54 billion was to come from Telekom Malaysia itself. First phase of the project was rolled out in mid-2008 to 2012, with aim to achieve 50% broadband penetration across households by 2010 and total of 1.3 million households are to be covered by 2012. The economic impact of HSBB and its sub-projects were immediate and visible. By 2010, HSBB project contributed 1% to GDP and 135,000 new-jobs. The jobs were spread across core-telecom sector, internet and contract under infrastructure lay-out. Second-phase of the plan, HSBB 2 was rolled-out in 2015, with a budget of US$ 885 million47 distributed across expansion of HSBB network and simultaneously upgrading existing copper-lines (sub-urban broadband) to be HSBB compatible for next 10 years. Contribution of TM was to be total of US$535 million and that of government to be US$350 million.484950 Expected Benefits Projected by 2020-  Total gross national income contribution to be US$15.1 billion  Income from potential spill-over effect up to USD2.33 billion from communication content and infrastructure sector.  In 2020, expected job creation to be 43,162.

Internet economy contributed 3.2%, 5% and 6% in 2013, 2016 and 2017 respectively to Indian GDP, and is expected to reach 7.5% of the GDP5152. The accelerated growth is expected to come from large scale long-term plans put in place by Indian government to facilitated wider and more robust coverage of broadband and mobile internet across country. The Government of India has increased its focus on digital economy in wake of its assumptions that for a developing economy like India with multitude of opportunities in digital arena, 10% increase in broadband will have a greater effect of 3.3% of GDP53. Some of the flagship programs are –  Digital India – Launched in July 2015, it is an umbrella project under which the Government of India (GoI) has proposed to invest in country’s ICT sector across different domains and spheres of governance and daily life. The project aims to propel India into a knowledge economy, with help of digital infrastructure development in form of broadband penetration, e-Governance, modern irrigation, skill development and capacity building to support future digital economy. Some of the key projects are Smart Cities, Bharat Net, Public Wi-Fi hotspots, Universal Access to mobile, Common Services Centers etc. The overall project benefits are to be realized across large gamut of socio-economic fabric of India. o Initial estimated of the project put the cost close to US$17 billion spread across 10 years in different cost areas under key Ministries- DeiTy and DOT. Implementation of projects under Digital India been calculated to have an impact of USD 500-1000 billion annually by 2025. The key sectors leading it would be banking & finance, health care, agriculture, energy, infrastructure and education. CMAI association of India projects number of jobs created to be more than 100 million, with 17 million in direct and 85 million indirect. The improvement in infrastructure is expected to propel India, currently ranked 134, into top 50 nations in ICT development index of ITU.545556 57  National Digital Communications Policy, May 2018- aims to provide fixed broadband fiber connections to 50% of the household and internet coverage to all areas by 2022. The initiative aims to create 4 million additional jobs under digital and communication sectors. The plan also covers important aspect of skill development by targeting 1 million individuals for new-economy skills. The initiative aims to attract increased investments to the tune of US$100 billion on improved skill-level, enhanced global value chain integration and accelerated progress towards Industry 4.0.  The Bharat Net project is being implemented in two phases with a total cost of US$7 billion (INR 45,000 crores )58 . The project aims to connect 250,000 Indian villages with help of Wi-Fi-hotspots and broadband connections. The completion of project is expected to yield US$65 billion as contribution to GDP. 51 52 53 whopping-amount-of-rs-4-5-lakh-crore-to-indias-gdp/931358/ 5454 55 56 telecommunications/in-tmt-digital-india-unlock-opportunity-noexp.pdf 57 NDCP 2018: The future looks bright, Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) blog 58 Exchange rate April 2017- 41 Digital Foundation Digital foundation sector intends to empower Nepali people to benefit from the on-going digital transformation by focusing on the following three pillars: ● Digital Connectivity, ● Digital Skills, and ● Digital Governance Digital Foundation: Empowering Nepalese Focus Areas Digital Connectivity Digitally Skills Digital Governance ‒ Ensuring quality of digital connectivity ‒ Ensuring reliability and quality of digital services ‒ Creating a digitally-ready society ‒ Job creation ‒ Transform the way government machinery works ‒ Investing in citizen-facing functions/ technologies Overview of Digital Foundation Digital Connectivity Digital connectivity in Nepal has improved considerably in the past five years, with an exponential increase in access to mobile services. Mobile connections and mobile Internet penetration in Nepal almost doubled between 2012 and 2017, with penetration crossing 100%. 2012 2017 Mobile penetration 60% 134%59 Mobile Internet penetration 21% 57% 59 MIS Report (16 December, 2017 – 14 January, 2018), Nepal telecommunications Authority 42 Growth in mobile penetration in Nepal has been mostly driven by significant investments made by leading mobile network operators in expanding their network footprints, and increasing affordability of mobile devices and services. Mobile operators have made large investments in their data networks60, with 3G network coverage in Nepal increasing from 25% in 2013 to reach 65% in 2017. The top three telecommunications operators in Nepal also launched 4G services in 2017. According to NTA, the number of 4G subscribers in Nepal currently stands at 2,144,887. Source: NTA However, fixedline and fixed broadband networks in Nepal continue to remain underdeveloped with limited coverage outside large cities. Digital Skills Digital Literacy The full potential of the Internet remains untapped with a high level of digital illiteracy among Nepalese, especially for low-income and less educated users. In spite of an increasing role of digital technologies across all spheres, digital education is yet to find its place in Nepali education system with more than 90% of the schools in Nepal not having digital connectivity and ICT devices.61 ICT Sector The ICT sector, comprising Internet, telephone, mobile, IT-enabled services (ITeS) and business process outsourcing (BPO), is among the fastest growing in Nepal. The sector has a large role to play in driving socioeconomic growth, as it applies to all sectors and potential to create a large number of jobs. Due to its potential, the Nepal government has taken steps to liberalize the sector by allowing 100% FDI investment in the ITeS and BPO sector, and 80% FDI in the telecommunications sector. Nepali outsourcing companies offer services at reasonable prices compared to other South Asian BPO companies in India, China, and the Philippines. There are more than 6,000 BPO companies in the country of which only 256 are legally registered as at 2017. Nepal offers distinct advantages as a BPO destination due to its lower salaries/cost base and lower employee turnover. However, Nepal has not been able to completely exploit the full potential of the ICT sector. Digital Governance Governments are typically one of the largest technology users in a country, and therefore able to promote adoption and industry growth by delivering public services digitally. Promotion of digital governance forms one of the key pillars of Digital Nepal 60 MIS Report, NTA, August 2018 61 UNESCO, 2014 43 Program. Digital governance in Nepal can build upon a number of on-going initiatives such as the government PKI, national ID, automation of vital registration of citizens, automation of land registration processes, and election data repository in electronic format, among others. eGovernance and digitalization of public services have emerged as a key priority of the Government of Nepal. Initiating several steps in this direction, Nepal’s ranking on the E-Government Development Index improved from 165th in 2014 to 117th in 2018. Source: UN Challenges in Nepal’s Digital Foundation Sector While Nepal has made great strides in rapidly expanding mobile and Internet connections, a significant section of Nepali society continues to remain digitally uninitiated. Key challenges include: ● Availability and coverage: Almost one-third of Nepal’s population is not covered by 3G networks while 4G networks cover less than 20% of the population. Fixed broadband networks are limited to large cities ● Low digital literacy: Low digital literacy, especially among the rural poor, widening the digital divide ● Absence of relevant content: Lack of information in the local language targeting the Nepali- speaking population ● Limited spectrum availability: Nepal ranks 148th out of 167 countries (score of 39.1 out of 100) on spectrum in GSMA’s Mobile Connectivity Index 2017 ● High cost of broadband services Despite rapid growth in mobile connections, Nepal remains a follower in overall ICT development: ● ITU ranked Nepal 140th out of 176 countries in its ICT Development Index (IDI) for 2017 ● GSMA ranked Nepal 137th out of 167 countries its Mobile Connectivity Index for 2017.

Nepalese and businesses face growing threats such as ransom ware and data breaches ● Data security concerns in the minds of consumers also restrict the growth of e- commerce and start-ups, as many people (especially older generations) are reluctant to share their financial details due to concerns on online fraud ICT Policy 2015 intends to: ● Build an effective legal framework and enforcement capabilities for cybercrime ● Raise awareness, educate, and empower people and firms to protect themselves online ● Establish a national cyber security cell to prevent, detect, defend, and recover from cyber attacks ● Implement data security and protection standards ● Need for a comprehensive data security framework Underdeveloped ICT sectors ● The growth of ICT sector in Nepal is underdeveloped due to poor ● IT services and the BPO sector has been identified as one of the ● Strengthening IT infrastructure is critical for 64 GSMA Intelligence, Q4 2017, “Digital in 2018 in Southern Asia” report, January 2018; We are Social & Hootsuite 47 infrastructure, lack of technical talent, and limited foreign investment 12 sectors with the greatest export potential as part of the Nepal Trade Integration Strategy (NTIS) 2016 ● The Government of Nepal Plans and Programs 2017 has identified IT as one of the key drivers of economic growth the growth of BPO and ITeS sectors ● Focus on IT education and training ● Hire dedicated IT officers Promise of Digital Foundation Sector Internet and mobile connectivity form the backbone of economic growth and employment generation, and create an enabling environment for socioeconomic transformation by improving income levels, empowering underprivileged communities, and bridging the digital divide. There is a strong link between improvements in digital connectivity and economic growth. Studies find that every 10% increase in broadband penetration results in a 1.3% rise in GDP. As a result, Nepal should undertake necessary steps to improve digital connectivity and create digitally ready society, which are critical to tap the potential of the ongoing digital transformation. These investments will also result in jobs through BPO and ITeS industry, and the emergence of new business models. Digital Initiatives Roadmap to Digital Foundation in Nepal Following digital initiatives are identified to address challenges of the digital foundation sector in Nepal: 1 Technology and Infrastructure 2 Entrepreneurship/PPP 3 Talent and Skills Development ● Establish the Internet as an essential service ● Improve spectrum availability management and optimization ● Take the lead in 5G network deployment ● National Optical Fiber Network ● High-speed Internet connectivity for efficient delivery of Public services ● Special Economic Zones for ICT sector ● Government of Nepal App ● Use of Government Enterprise Architecture (GEA) ● Paperless Government to promote collaboration ● Public Wi-Fi Hotspots ● Digital Innovation and Co- Creation Hub ● Digital Skills Development Initiative ● Government eLearning Platform ● ICT in Education 48 ● National Cyber Security Center ● Provincial Data Centers establishment ● Nepali language computational resource pack ● National Biometric ID Card ● Digital Signature Technology and Infrastructure Effective implementation of smart connectivity in Nepal with the aim of having a digitally connected nation will require an upgrade of infrastructure and technology, and universal connectivity on a nationwide level to reach even the remotest areas. Key projects that the government may consider include: 01.01.01.00 Establish the Internet as an essential service Solution Establish the Internet as an essential service means that everyone must be able to access the Internet to exercise their right to freedom of expression and other fundamental liberties. It requires the government to ensure that Internet access is broadly available and prevents it from unreasonably restricting an individual's access to information and the Internet. Several countries including Costa Rica, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, and Spain have adopted the Internet as a fundamental right. In most of these countries, telecom operators must provide each permanent residence and business office with access to a reasonably priced and high-quality connection with a downstream rate of at least 1 Mbit/s. Focus Area Digital Connectivity Stakeholders ● Ministry of Communication and Information Technology ● Nepal Telecommunications Authority ● Telecoms / Network operators / ISPs Timelines Long-Term Outcomes ● The Internet is the backbone of the Digital Nepal initiative. Ensuring Internet connectivity for all is critical for success of the program ● Better connectivity across Nepal including remote rural areas ● Improving the quality of life through better access to information and services ● Economic growth and job creation through increased investments by telecommunications companies to increase footprint 49 01.01.02.00 Improve spectrum availability, management and optimization Solution There is a strong correlation between spectrum availability and service quality. Nepal should focus on improving spectrum availability as a key priority in line with its National Frequency Policy 2073 to drive better quality of services. Focus Areas Digital Connectivity Stakeholders  Ministry of Communication and Information Technology  National Telecommunications Authority Timelines Immediate Outcomes  Improvement in Nepal’s rankings on spectrum availability and ICT Development Index  Improvement in quality of mobile services  Address industry’s concerns on spectrum shortage 01.01.03.00 Take the lead in 5G networks deployment Solution Prepare Nepal for 5G telecom networks through a range of initiatives: ● Set up a central committee to design a roadmap for implementation, and decide on stakeholders, timelines, pricing ● The objective should be to take a lead in 5G, rather than be a follower Focus Area Digital Connectivity Stakeholders  Ministry of Communication and Information Technology  Nepal Telecommunications Authority Timelines  Medium-Term Outcomes  Taking lead of 5G will put Nepal at the forefront of the ongoing digital transformation  Enhanced prospects for faster economic growth and Job creation on account of investments in 5G rollout  Highly stimulated demand for data positively impacting revenue streams of telecom operators and service providers 01.01.04.00 National Optical Fiber Network Solution Construct high-speed fiber optic based broadband infrastructure that connects with international networks to improve latency and speeds:  Expand FTTH networks to households and rural areas as a means of providing robust last mile connectivity  Replace and modernize current copper lines with fiber broadband that provide stable, high-speed connectivity 50  Provide Underground fiber connectivity for more reliable connection Focus Area Digital Connectivity Stakeholders  Ministry of Communication and Information Technology  Nepal Telecommunications Authority  Telecoms / Network operators /ISPs Timelines Long Term Outcomes  Give businesses of all sizes, from SMEs to large international corporations, a boost from the high speeds of fiber optic broadband infrastructure.  Make businesses more competitive and empower SMEs  Create a more favorable innovation and investment environment  Boost the efficiency of e-government services. Broadband will make government data more accessible, facilitate the development of new applications and services, reduce government costs and the costs of accessing government services by promoting the use of online channels and deliver front-line services to where they are most needed at a lower cost 01.01.05.00 High-speed Internet connectivity for efficient delivery of public services Solution High-speed Internet connectivity refers to bandwidth that is broad enough to handle a lot of data at the same time and let users take advantage of technologies including video conferencing and voice calls over computers, online applications, services, features, games and high quality audio and videos streaming. With patients having access to high-speed Internet, it can enable real-time interactive communication between patients and doctors. This leads to gains in a number of critical areas including health preservation and personal fulfillment. ● Ensure high-speed Internet connectivity for all government establishments, municipal corporations, village development authorities, agriculture knowledge centers, hospitals, and education institutions in the country. ● All healthcare facilities in Nepal should be equipped with high-speed Internet. High-speed Internet access would enable the delivery of healthcare services to remote areas from central/regional hospitals, along with facilitating the roll-out of other digital healthcare initiatives. ● The government should aim to provide 100% high-speed connectivity to all healthcare facilities in Nepal by 2020 (starting with rural healthcare facilities) ● The effort can allow digital access to underprivileged sections of society.

Source: Ministry of Finance, Government of Nepal Almost three-fourths of Nepal’s population relies on agriculture for their livelihood, making the sector a vital component of the nation’s growth agenda. The Government of Nepal considers farming and agriculture as critical to achieving its socioeconomic growth aspirations, allocating nearly 4%–5% of its annual budget to the sector. There are multiple government-led initiatives to drive agriculture sector productivity with a target to achieve self-sufficiency in food production in the near future. Challenges in Nepal’s Agriculture Sector Despite continued policy interventions and government focus, progress remains slow and restricted to a few regions in Nepal owing to inherent issues such as high dependence on climate, difficulty obtaining credit and financing, poor distribution infrastructure, and limited access to extension and advisory services. 65 World Bank 60 Nepal’s agricultural imports are also growing, showing negative trade balance especially with India. The import of agricultural produce, e.g., cereals, vegetables, and fruits has also surged in the past few years. Source: Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), Government of Nepal Other challenges the agriculture sector faces include: ● Poor access to agricultural inputs and supply, including bottlenecks in obtaining necessary equipment, seeds, breeds and knowledge on agricultural and livestock best practices, particularly in remote rural areas. ● Low yields and declining productivity, especially for principal crops and livestock products such as rice, due to lack of irrigation facilities, smaller land holdings, and reliance on subsistence farming; Nepal has much lower agricultural yield compared to other developing countries in the region. ● Inadequate access to agricultural markets and end customers due to underdeveloped transport, infrastructure, and distribution facilities, increasing the risk of exploitation of farmers by intermediaries. ● Limited access to financial services, including loans and crop insurance. ● Labor shortages as more rural workers migrate to cities in search of better opportunities. The government is seeking to digitize and modernize the sector to address these issues. Wheat and Rice Yields by Country, 2016–June 2018 Country Yield (Metric Tons per Hectare) Wheat Rice 2016/17 2017/18 2016/17 2017/18 China 5.33 5.41 6.86 6.91 India 2.88 3.2 3.74 3.85 Pakistan 2.78 2.97 3.77 4.02 Nepal 2.41 2.31 3.48 3.70 Bangladesh - - 4.42 4.35 Sri Lanka - - 4.35 4.22 Source: United States Department of Agriculture, Foreign Agricultural Service Promise of Digital Solutions in Agriculture For decades, the Government of Nepal has used numerous policy instruments to improve farming productivity. However, there are only marginal improvements to the yields of most farmers. Majority of farmers continue to use traditional processes and tools that depend heavily on historical norms and have not evolved for centuries. As the barrier of entry for farming technology drops and digital tools such as cloud, computer systems, connectivity, and open source software become increasingly affordable, the government can deliver 61 these technologies to farmers more cost effectively. Authorities should also look at India’s Digital India program, as a case example for implementation. The agriculture sector has made some progress in the use of soil health cards, modern irrigation methods (e.g., sprinkle irrigation technology), mobile apps to access agricultural information, and e- commerce platforms. However, the initiatives seem too few and far between and focused on easily accessible regions, while hard-to-reach mountainous areas continue to be underserved. Future success would be contingent on a consolidated and centralized ICT policy, led by the state or the central governments, with concerted efforts targeting specific pain points. Use of modern agriculture technologies is likely to provide measurable returns to Nepal, with analysts estimating technologies such as precision agriculture to improve yields on existing agricultural land by ~70%.66 Case Study: India’s plan to digitalize agriculture benefiting stakeholders across the agricultural value chain and increasing farmers’ incomes In February 2018, the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, unveiled an agricultural strategy aimed at boosting farmers’ incomes, increasing minimum support price, and reducing wastage and production cost. Objectives  Double farmers’ incomes by 2022  Double private corporate investments in farming from the current 2% of agricultural investments  Indian farms to become outsourcing hubs for global supermarket chains Initiatives  Encouraging the entry of private companies by relaxing investment rules in contract farming, transport, marketing, warehousing, and food processing.  Creating a unified National Agriculture Market (NAM) to regulate the agriculture market. Through real- time electronic auctioning of commodities and integrated assaying, weighing, storage, and payment systems, the system will enable the participation of both farmers and consumers in the market.  Initiating completion of 99 irrigation schemes delayed over the past 25–30 years by investing ~INR80, 000 crores; ~50% of the schemes are to be completed in 2018.  Launching Startup Agri India to support agritech entrepreneurs striving to improve the efficiency of the agricultural process; organizing hackathons among leading technology institutes in India to generate out-of-the-box ideas for agriculture.  Directing a mandatory transfer of 50% of all cropped areas under new insurance schemes. 66 Goldman-Sachs, 2016 62 Agriculture Sector in Nepal: Pain Points, Priorities, and

Total healthcare expenditure in Nepal as a percentage of GDP grew from 4% in 2006 to exceed 6% in 2015, comparatively higher than its neighbors such as India, Pakistan, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka with healthcare spending at 2.6% and 4.7% of GDP.70 The rise in healthcare expenditure and continued focus by the government in enhancing healthcare policies and infrastructure have enabled Nepal to achieve vast improvements in its healthcare KPIs in the past 20 years. For example, neonatal and child mortality rates have declined significantly since 1995. Moreover, Nepal’s consistent track record in improving other health outcomes such as maternal mortality, death rates, and life expectancy is acknowledged internationally. Mortality and Life Expectancy Rates, Nepal, 1995–2015 Subject Unit of Measurement 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 Neonatal mortality Per 1,000 Live Births 47.7 39.3 32.5 26.7 22.2 Infant mortality Per 1,000 Live Births 76.8 59.6 46.3 36.3 29.4 Under-5 mortality Per 1,000 Live Births 107.7 80.6 60 45.4 35.8 Crude birth rate People per 1,000 36 32.1 27.5 22.9 20.2 Death rate People per 1,000 10.4 8.5 7.3 6.7 6.3 Life expectancy at birth Years 58.5 62.3 65.5 68 70 Maternal mortality ratio Per 100,000 660 548 444 349 258 Source: World Health Organization 70 World Health Organization 74 Despite improvements in Nepal’s key healthcare outcomes, the country continues to trail its Asian peers and international benchmarks. For example, while efforts to enhance maternal and neonatal care in rural Nepal have resulted in substantial improvements in maternal mortality rates, yet the maternal mortality ratio in Nepal (at 258 per 100,000 live births) is notably higher than its Asian counterparts in India, Pakistan, Bhutan, and Bangladesh (at 148–178 per 100,000 live births). Challenges in Nepal’s Health Sector In 2007, Nepal’s Interim Constitution recognized access to primary healthcare as a right for every citizen. However, more than a decade later, primary healthcare for all remains an elusive dream for the citizens. In fact, Nepal lags behind its Asian peers and international standards on health service coverage, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Nepal, like many low- and middle-income countries, faces common issues such as: ● Limited access to healthcare, especially in remote rural areas, where patients need to travel long distances to receive quality healthcare ● Chronic shortage of healthcare professionals and reluctance of public servants to serve in remote areas ● Underdeveloped infrastructure limiting access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene practices ● Poverty and illiteracy coupled with the high cost of private healthcare services ● Poor quality of care services at public sector hospitals and institutions Nonetheless, Nepal’s new government aims to change this during its tenure. Acknowledging health as the primary right of every citizen, the government intends to roll out various initiatives (e.g., establishing a 15-bed hospital in every local area, extending health insurance for all citizens) to address these issues. Promise of Digital Initiatives in Health Nepal started its digital journey in the health sector with the launch of integrated Health MIS (HMIS) in 1993. Since then, Nepal has undertaken several initiatives such as the introduction of the telemedicine system. Recently in 2017, the Government of Nepal launched its eHealth Strategy 2017, which provides roadmap for digitalization of health sector in Nepal over the next few years. E-Health Interventions of the Ministry of Health and Population Source: Ministry of Health and Population 75 Existing Digital Initiates in Nepali Health sector Health Management Information System (HMIS) ● Monthly aggregate health statistics being collected ● All 77 districts submitting data digitally ● 1000+ facilities submitting data digitally ● 25 million+ data points captured every year ● A mix of digital and paper based recording & reporting ● Based on the open-source DHIS2 software platform Logistics Management Information System (LMIS) ● Full supply chain MIS for MoHP ● A mix of digital and paper based recording and reporting ● Linked to the procurement system Electronic Health Records (EHR) Systems ● Combination of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and hospital management system ● Currently being used in 3 hospitals including public facilities ● Based on the open-source OpenMRS platform Human Resource Information System (HuRIS) ● System to manage human resources for health ● Database of all public health workers including permanent and temporary hires Health Facility Registry (HFR) ● Unified code provided to all health facilities (public and private) ● System to support linkages of other health information systems Digital technologies have a potential to address critical challenges faced by Nepal’s health sector by improving coverage of quality health services, reducing the cost of healthcare services to deprived sections of society, plugging funding leakages, and optimizing utilization of healthcare skills and resources. While the Government of Nepal has undertaken several initiatives in the health sector, there is a pressing need for the government to adopt additional broad-based initiatives to optimize its resources and attract greater private sector involvement. Case Study – How Novartis’ telemedicine model in Ghana is helping to expand access to quality care in remote rural areas Objective: Expand access to quality care in remote rural areas to reduce transport times and costs to patients while minimizing unnecessary referrals. Model: The telemedicine model was developed around frontline health workers using digital technology to enable centralization of healthcare expertise. Under the model, healthcare professionals at the teleconsultation centers coach and guide less-skilled community health workers in patient care. The initiative is not only empowering community health workers, but also improving the quality of care with a direct impact on patient health outcomes. In 2016, for example, more than half of all teleconsultations were resolved directly by phone, including 31% that avoided referrals. Timelines: 2012 onwards Results: The model pioneered in the Amansi West region through the joint efforts of the Ghana Ministry of Health and Population, the Ghana Health Service, the National Health Insurance Authority, the Ambulance Services of Ghana, Millennium Promise, and the Novartis Foundation. The initiative is now successfully scaling throughout Ghana with strong local ownership by Ghanaian health authorities. 76 Health Sector in Nepal: Pain Points, Priorities, and Digital Solutions Pain Points Government of Nepal’s Priorities Digital as an Enabler Wide rural/urban gap in healthcare facilities ● 83% of Nepal’s population live in villages, while the country’s healthcare infrastructure and caregivers are predominantly in urban areas ● Most private hospitals and institutions in Nepal are concentrated in cities such as Kathmandu, Pokhara, and Biratnagar ● Aims to improve the quality of basic and specialized healthcare services ● Plans to offer free basic health services at the local level; specialized and referral health services from provinces, and modern and specialist health services from central health institutions ● Digital health (e.g., mobile health, telemedicine) can extend the reach of healthcare services to rural areas: o Equipping all healthcare centers in rural areas with high-speed Internet should be the top priority for the government Chronic shortage of health professionals ● Nepal has only 5.4 skilled health professionals per 10,000 population; compared to 24.1 and 14.0 skilled health professionals per 10,000 population in India and Pakistan, respectively ● High brain drain among medical professionals and preference for medical workers to join the private sector ● Set up at least one 15-bed hospital at each local level between 2018 and 2022 ● Hire at least one medical doctor in each local level ● eHealth/mHealth can effectively utilize and expand the reach of healthcare professionals ● Tap into healthcare talent from other countries (e.g., India, the Philippines) to plug the demand- supply gap Access to safe drinking water, poor hygiene habits, and sanitation facilities is a key challenge ● Nepal has the highest mortality rate due to unsafe hygiene, water, and sanitation compared to neighboring countries ● Open defecation is a norm in Nepal (especially in rural areas) o 30% of the Nepali population practice open defecation ● Provision of clean and safe drinking water and sanitation facilities to all citizens is a priority for the new government ● Become an open defecation-free country by 2022 ● Innovative use of digital technologies can boost awareness about the need to follow proper hygiene and sanitation practices ● Technology can enhance access and simplify the usage of public facilities Expensive healthcare services ● Underdeveloped public healthcare infrastructure and poor perception of service quality at public hospitals has led to a surge in ● Improve healthcare services by building quality infrastructure, medical equipment, and human resources ● Economies of scale and lower investment requirements for digital healthcare can help 77 private/household healthcare expenses ● 27% of Nepal’s population spend over 10% of their household income on healthcare ● Extend health insurance program to cover all Nepalese lower the cost of healthcare services Mismanagement of funds and supplies in rural Nepal ● Mismanagement of funds and government subsidies, inadequate supply of essential drugs, and budget limitations restrict the government’s ability to provide proper healthcare facilities for its citizens ● Zero tolerance for corruption ● Leveraging the latest Health Information Management (HIM) and procurement solutions can enhance auditing and compliance processes, minimizing the risk of mismanagement of funds and government subsidies Digital Initiatives Roadmap for the Health Sector The Government of Nepal should consider setting aside at least 10% of its central health budget for Digital Health programs. The Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP) should establish a separate department/task force to drive implementation of Digital Health initiatives, with a focus on the following areas to reap the benefits of digital technologies in the health sector. 1 Technology and Infrastructure 2 Entrepreneurship/PPP 3 Talent and Skills Development ● National Digital Healthcare Platform ● Next-Generation Digital Healthcare Facilities ● Electronic Health Records 2.0 ● Mobile Health Units ● e-Maternal Care ● Drones for delivery of emergency medical supplies ● Ease of doing business in digital healthcare ● Private sector participation in rural healthcare ● Centralized Telemedicine Center Technology and Infrastructure The following initiatives targeting Digital Healthcare are identified as “quick wins” to be implemented as part of the Digital Nepal program.

Drones can be utilized for the delivery of essential medical supplies to remote areas where people are often isolated due to difficult terrain, bad road conditions, and seasonal flooding. Ministry for Communication and Information Technology, Ministry for Health and Population, Ministry for Civil Aviation and Ministry of Home Affairs should work together to draft a policy to allow the drones for medical emergencies. Additionally, the government should consider the use of drones in the health sector for disaster management and preparedness. Stakeholders ● Ministry of Health and Population ● Ministry of Communication and Information Technology ● Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation ● Ministry of Home Affairs (for drone license) ● Department of Health Services ● Nepal Academy of Science and Technology ● Provincial Government and Local Level Timelines Long-Term Outcomes ● Help in achieving SDGs related to universal access to healthcare (Social Sustainable Goal # 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages) ● Provide healthcare facilities in rural remote areas with limited / no healthcare infrastructure ● Improve access to healthcare services for Nepali citizens Entrepreneurship/Public-Private Partnerships The Government of Nepal should consider initiating the following policy interventions to create an enabling environment: ● Ease of doing business in digital healthcare: Private sector start-ups and telecom participants play a pivotal role in developing digital health solutions in many markets globally. The Government of Nepal should focus on creating an enabling business environment to encourage private sector players and start-ups to contribute to these priority areas. Focus on improving ease of doing business, developing an ecosystem (e.g., digital payment platforms), tax holidays for NGOs and enterprises focusing on digital health in poor/remote areas. ● Private sector participation in rural healthcare: Private healthcare providers, which primarily focus on urban areas currently, should be encouraged to invest in digital healthcare programs to capture a broader market and contribute to the society as part of their Corporate Social 82 Responsibility (CSR) effort. Consider necessary policy interventions (e.g., tax benefits) to attract greater private sector involvement Talent and Skills Development Chronic shortage of healthcare professionals, brain drain to foreign countries, and reluctance of caregivers to join medical facilities in remote areas are restricting the government’s ability to improve the quality and coverage of healthcare services. To address these challenges, Nepal needs to systematically scale-up the capacity of its healthcare system by increasing the intake of students in existing medical colleges and opening new medical colleges to meet demand. Additionally, Nepal can leverage ICT solutions (e.g., Centralized Telemedicine Center) for skills development of its healthcare professionals in remote areas. 03.03.37.00 Centralized Telemedicine Center Solution A telemedicine model developed around frontline health workers, with digital technology allowing for the centralization of healthcare expertise. Under the model, healthcare professionals at the teleconsultation center of a major public hospital in Kathmandu can coach and guide less-skilled community health workers from various healthcare facilities in Nepal. Stakeholders ● Ministry of Health and Population ● Department of Health Services ● Ministry of Communication and Information Technology ● Nepal Telecommunications Authority ● Hospitals Timelines Immediate Outcomes ● Systematically enhance capabilities of frontline healthcare workers, which will in turn, result in improvement in the quality of healthcare services to the citizens Case study: Telecom operator partners with Sri Lankan hospitals to build a digital health Platform In 2016, Dialog, a leading telecom operator in Sri Lanka, entered a joint venture with Asiri Hospital Holdings to set up a Digital Health platform. Following the success of this initiative, two more hospitals in Sri Lanka joined the effort in March 2018. The joint venture connects more than 1,500 doctors in over 80 hospitals via its digital health platform, accessible through doc.lk, by dialing 990 or the Doc990 app. Doc990 currently offers a range of medical services including channeling doctor sessions at hospitals island-wide for physical consultations, the Tele Doctor Service where consultants can be contacted over the phone, medicine delivered to the doorstep, and access to lab reports from selected laboratories via the Doc990 web portal. The Doc990 app is integrated with all mobile operators and banks for multiple payment options such as add-to-bill, eZ Cash, Genie, Amex, Visa, and MasterCard. 83 Nepal vs Selected Asian Countries: Comparison of Major Healthcare KPIs Unit of Measurement Nepal India Pakistan Bhutan Sri Lanka China Japan Malaysia Singapore Korea Rep Thailand Bangladesh Skilled health professional density, 2005–2013 Per 10,000 population 5.4 24.1 14 12.4 23.2 31.5 137.9 44.7 77.1 71.5 24.7 5.7 Maternal mortality ratio, 2015 Per 100,000 births 258 174 178 148 30 27 5 40 10 11 20 176 Skilled birth attendance, 2007–2017 % 58 86 55 89 99 100 100 99 100 100 99 50 Under-five mortality and neonatal mortality rate, 2016 Per 1000 births 34.5 43 78.8 32.4 9.4 9.9 2.7 8.3 2.8 3.4 12.2 34.2 Health Service Coverage Index, 2015 Index* 46 56 40 59 62 76 80 70 80 80 75 46 Financial protection, 2007–2015 % of population spending large health expenditure 27.4 17.3 1 N/A 2.9 17.7 6.2 N/A N/A 13.5 3.4 13.6 Mortality rate due to unsafe hygiene, water, and sanitation, 2016 per 100,000 population 19.8 18.6 19.6 4 1.2 0.6 0.2 0.4 <0.1 1.8 3.5 11.9 All vaccine coverage, 2016 % of population 25 76 53 90 99 99 93 99 88 97 95 93 Domestic general government health expenditure 2015 % of general government expenditure 5.5 3.4 3.7 9.1 7.9 10.1 N/A 8.3 12 12.9 16.6 2.8 Access to safe drinking water, 2015 % of population 27 N/A 36 34 N/A N/A 97 92 100 98 N/A 56 Total health expenditure, 2014–2015 % of GDP 6.2 4.7 2.6 3.6 3.5 5.5 10.2 4.2 4.9 7.4 4.1 2.8 Total expenditure on health per capita, 2014– 2015 US$ 135 267 129 281 369 731 3727 1040 4047 2531 600 88 Life expectancy at birth, 2016 Years 70.2 68.8 66.5 70.6 75.3 76.4 84.2 75.3 82.9 82.7 75.5 72.7 Source: WHO; UNICEF Legend: Green-Amber-Red Scale, where dark green signifies best-in-class performance, while dark red signifies worst-in-class performance 84 Education Overview Nepal’s education sector has made notable strides in the past 20 years. Between 1991 and 2017, the country’s net primary school enrolment rates grew from 68.0% to 94.7%,71 making it one of the few developing countries to reach near gender parity. Education is a key priority sector for Nepal, accounting for the largest share of the total national budget at ~10.1%72 in FY2018/19, registering 11.8% CAGR over the past five years (2014/15–2018/19) to reach NPR134.5 billion (US$1.23 billion).73 Development of the sector appears to be a crucial imperative to drive Nepal’s progress from least developed country status to a developing nation by 2022. Access to education is even more critical given the country’s large youth base, with ~32% of its total population aged 14 and below.74 To support its vision, the Government of Nepal is pursuing revisions to its education policy aiming for inclusiveness by making education up to secondary level compulsory and free. Key Education Targets75 ● Investment of at least 20% of the national budget each year in education ● All school-age children to be enrolled in school in the next two years 71 UNESCO 72 Calculated using figures in the Budget Speech for FY 2018/19, Ministry of Finance 73 Calculated using figures in the Budget Speech for FY 2018/19, Ministry of Finance 74 UNESCO Institute for Statistics, Data for the Sustainable Development Goals by Country 75 Joint Election Manifesto Source: Central Budgets (Government of Nepal) 85 ● All citizens to be literate in the next five years ● ICT usage to be made compulsory in schools ● E-library to be established and students to be provided modern education materials (e.g., laptops and textbooks) ● Higher education to be specialized by involving students in research and innovation ● Gurukuls, Monasteries, Gumbas, Madrasas, and open and alternative education programs to be affiliated with the national education system Source: Joint Election Manifesto (Please note this list is not exhaustive) The government has also formulated supporting policies, grants, funding schemes, and investment incentives, as well as turned to foreign aid to improve its primary education metrics. Key Government Policies School Sector Development Plan (SSDP), 2016– 2023 Five-year Roadmap Aims for inclusive and equitable access, participation, and learning outcomes of the education system through: ● Investment of ~US$10.66 billion from 2016–2023 in multiple areas including teacher management and professional development; school governance and management; institutional capacity development; disaster risk reduction; school safety, monitoring, evaluation, and assessment; examination and accreditation, ICT, and health and nutrition ● Support from the EU for the program with a recent funding injection of €6 million (~NPR700 million) directly to the Government of Nepal In April 2018, the Minister for Education, Science and Technology unveiled a 10-point, five-year roadmap which includes plans to: ● Improve the quality of the education sector; structural and organizational reforms; primary child education; common commitments; quality of public education; regulation of private education system; higher education; open education; science and technology; and good governance and management Despite these initiatives, the quality of education in Nepal falls short of international standards due to inadequate funding, socio economic issues leading to child labor, uneven development between rural and urban areas, lack of basic infrastructure, shortage of trained teachers, unemployability of graduates due to outdated coursework, and insufficient learning materials. This has led to an increase in student mobility among the urban and wealthy population, with many youths moving to other countries to study. While the country has achieved near-universal enrolments at the primary level (135.4% in 2016), it drops significantly at the secondary (69.5% in 2016) and tertiary levels (11.8% in 2016), indicating substantial dropout rates at higher levels of education.

Prohibitively expensive fees and limited presence of 76 UNESCO Institute for Statistics, Data for the Sustainable Development Goals by Country 77 UNESCO Institute for Statistics, Data for the Sustainable Development Goals by Country 87 private schools are resulting in inequitable access to education and widening the gap between the haves and have-nots ● Poor availability of funding and government support due to an inefficient industry structure, red tape, and corruption ● High dropout rates due to socioeconomic conditions and widespread poverty in rural areas, resulting in children working in menial jobs instead of attending school and creating issues such as child labor and child marriages The government is demonstrating its focus on addressing these challenges during its tenure by establishing actionable targets for the sector in the current and subsequent budgets. Promise of Digital Initiatives in the Education Sector Near-universal penetration of mobile and Internet and availability of low-cost smartphones and tablets provide a favorable enabling environment for integrating ICT into education. Nepal’s large youth demographic who are comfortable using technology stand to benefit greatly from technology-based delivery and access to education. The benefits of the use of digital technologies in education are well documented with many success stories and proven results. Nepal should seek to learn from the multiple projects underway across developing countries in Asia and Africa. Nepal has launched a slew of technology initiatives, including strengthening ICT infrastructure at schools and universities; ICT-enabled teaching and learning; and integrating education management information system (EMIS) as part of the SSDP 2016–2023 Program. However, stronger technology push coupled with skills development and awareness programs may be required to address persistent challenges, strengthen institutional capacity, bridge the digital divide in the country, and maximize the impact of ICT in the sector. Nepal is actively pursuing ICT programs for education with progress in several areas: ICT: A Key Component of the SSDP 2016–2023 Agenda Key targets include: ● Providing ICT teaching-learning materials to strengthen interactive teaching approaches ● Establishing ICT learning centers at model schools ● Preparing ICT teaching and learning materials initially for Science, Math, and English ● Providing ICT infrastructure and teaching-learning materials ● Implementing the unified computerized accounting software (CGAS) in the Ministry of Education system ● Introducing school-based integrated EMIS, including an Equity Index, school profiles, and unique student IDs to enhance the effectiveness of governance and management Key achievements include: ● Establishment of computer labs and Internet connectivity in District Education Offices (DEO) and selected schools ● Launch of websites by central agencies, regional education directorates, and 77 DEOs ● Development of interactive digital learning materials for students in Grades 2 to 6 in Nepali, Math, English, and Science Open Learning Exchange (OLE) Nepal: Established in September 2007, OLE Nepal integrates technology in classrooms and the teaching-learning process.

families financially ● Ensure compulsory education for all school-age children ● Education up to secondary level is made free gradually rewards in the classroom to increase engagement ● Introduce interactive learning modules in rural areas on specific subjects, hobbies, and women empowerment initiatives Inadequate funding Public institutions often face delays in obtaining sufficient government support and funding, possibly due to an inefficient education structure: ● Currently, the sector is supported by the central government, with regional/provincial governments having limited control and resources ● Red tape, corruption, and bureaucratic processes exacerbate the issue In April 2018, the Minister for Education, Science and Technology unveiled a 10- point, five-year roadmap which includes structural and organizational reforms to improve the efficiency of the sector ● eGovernment solutions that automate tasks undertaken by public officials, reducing spending leaks and improving transparency ● Introduce an automated, mobile-based customer management system for institutions to file complaints and track resolutions in case of delays in receiving support ● Use common Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems across departments and industry hierarchies to enable information sharing Physical safety issues Since the devastating earthquake of April 2015, education authorities in Nepal have yet to open the new academic session in several districts owing to the quake’s adverse impacts: ● Over 16,000 classrooms at ~6,000 public schools were destroyed, over 7,000 classrooms have major cracks while 12,000 have repairable cracks81 ● The government is drafting policies relating to disaster risk reduction and safety under the SSDP program ● The National Strategy for Disaster Risk Management in Nepal also highlights the role the education sector can play in reducing the vulnerability and exposure posed by natural hazards ● Use cloud-based back-up and disaster recovery solutions as well as sensor technology to predict and mitigate the effects of natural disasters ● Use of laptops and handheld devices by students could help maintain learning continuity in case schools or universities are inaccessible Poor quality of vocational training and lack of employability Nepali students face significant challenges in finding employment after graduation due to gaps between skills gained and industry needs: In September 2017, the World Bank approved a US$60 million credit to support the second phase of the Enhanced Vocational Education and Training ● Use of online testing tools to assess student capabilities and interests, and recommend courses accordingly ● Introduce technology-assisted learning modules, e.g., an institute in the UK introduced a renovation project in its 80 UNESCO Institute for Statistics, Data for the Sustainable Development Goals by Country 81 Independent news articles 91 ● Studies focusing on rote learning are not interactive and do not prepare students to tackle real-world situations ● Teachers lack skills in scientific teaching methods ● Vocational education curriculum is irrelevant and out-of-date Project in Nepal, called EVENT II that is: ● Designed to improve equitable access to market- relevant training programs and strengthen the delivery of Technical Education and Vocational Training (TEVT) vocational class that used film and Padlet to develop students’ functional Math and English skills in construction Digital Initiatives Roadmap for the Health sector While the Government of Nepal allocates a substantial share of its budget to the education sector, cohesiveness between initiatives remains a challenge.

Other ongoing initiatives by Vodafone in the region include Vodacom e-schools and the KA Lite open-source platform. Expected Outcome: Vodafone is targeting to help three million children and youth through the program by 2020. 97 Energy A well-developed energy sector is critical for the sustainable development of the Nepali society. While per capita energy consumption in the country is significantly less than its Asian peers, robust industrial growth and rising per capita income has resulted in significant increase in energy demand. This trend is likely to continue over the next few years. Historically, Nepal has relied on traditional energy sources to cater to its energy requirements. Bio-mass continues to remain the primary energy source for approximately 80% of the citizens, but the steady rise in population, increasing energy demand and decreasing forest areas, raise concerns over the availability of fuel wood energy. Other important sources of energy include oil and petroleum products contributing 10% of energy requirements, followed by coal and hydro. Severe power shortfall in Nepal in the past few decades has led to a chronic imbalance between power supply and consumption. Electricity supply quality in Nepal is among the lowest in the world, ranking 137th out of 147 countries.82 Aggressive expansion in the country’s population, agricultural, and industrial activities have resulted in higher demand for power, worsening the severity of power shortages. Similar to other countries in the region, the rate of electrification in Nepal is approximately 76%. However, significant disparities in electricity access between rural and urban areas exist with only 61% of the rural population having access to electricity, compared to 94% of the urban population.83 Nepal is a net energy importer, with 34.76% of its energy needs imported from India.84 As energy generation via the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) is insufficient to meet domestic demand, Nepal supplements its energy sources by importing from India, and through Independent Power Producers (IPPs). Nepal’s rich hydro resources are estimated to be able to support power generation up to 42,000 MW.85 However, by the end of 2016, its total installed hydropower capacity was only 802.4 MW, equivalent to less than 2% of its total generation potential. 82 Asian Development Bank (ADB) 83 Energizing Development (EnDev) 84 NEA 2017 85 Asian Development Bank (ADB) 98 Recent Developments in the Energy Sector The Government of Nepal continues to actively pursue measures to overcome load shedding and energy shortage issues in the country. Following the appointment of a new director at the NEA and strong government support, Nepal became load shedding free in May 2018 from improvements in the efficiency of supply and demand management. Having resolved load shedding issues for both household and industrial users, the NEA is currently focusing on maintaining consistent power supply with quality and safety as priorities. The NEA is also taking bold steps to strengthen its financial position through organizational restructuring exercises as well as introducing transparent transfer modality and other measures to improve services, reduce power wastage, and collect outstanding revenues. Recognizing the need to develop its energy sector to reduce poverty and reinvigorate the economy, the government is prioritizing energy development projects with multiple targets set over the next few years. It is also actively driving efforts to develop hydropower capabilities through initiatives such as the Nepal Power Investment Summit 2018. Additionally, the Nepal government is focusing beyond traditional energy resources. The government intends to leverage its abundant natural resources such as, hydro, solar, wind, and bio-mass to meet the country’s energy demands and reduce the power deficit. To promote and upscale the production of renewable energy sources, the Nepal government formed the Alternative Energy Promotion Centre (AEPC), supported by the Renewable Energy for Rural Livelihood (RERL) project. Case study – Bhutan’s ambitious hydropower developments to become a net exporter of energy Over a 10-year period (2005–2015), Bhutan, a developing nation with similar topography to Nepal, increased its electricity production from 460 MW to 1606 MW,86 mainly generated through hydropower. Bhutan’s electricity exports grew from US$78 million in 2005 to US$176 million in 2017, contributing to 40% of its total exports and generating 25% of the government’s revenue. Four out of five of its major hydropower projects are financed by the Indian government, with the fifth financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and loans from Indian banks. The investment arrangement helps to cover the financial and construction risks of hydropower projects, with India committing to purchase surplus electricity reflecting production costs plus 15%.87 Rapid development in the energy sector is reinvigorating Bhutan’s economy, with gross GDP projected to record 9.9% in the fiscal year ending 2018. Although current and future revenues generated from energy exports are forecast to cover the cost of hydropower investments, the Bhutan government is taking measures to monitor its hydropower-related costs closely. Under a 5-year plan, the government has stipulated that hydropower debt should not exceed 40% of hydropower earnings, while non-hydropower debt is limited to 35% of GDP. Challenges in Nepal’s Energy Sector The Himalayas cover approximately 75% of land in Nepal providing the country with ample water resources and a favorable terrain for electricity production. Despite its power generation potential, Nepal is a net importer of electricity. In meeting the growing demand for energy, Nepal’s electricity imports increased at an average annual growth rate (AAGR) of 20.4% between 2011 and 2016, while NEA’s electricity generation grew at 0.3% annually over the same period. Key hurdles facing Nepal’s energy sector include: ● Acute power shortfall, particularly during the dry season when water flow drops, adversely affecting hydropower generation 86 Hydro World 87 Nikkei Asian Review, Aug 2017 99 ● Inefficiency in energy transmission through high technical and non-technical losses resulting in one of the highest energy losses in the world ● Inadequate energy preserving and storage facilities, which further worsen the issue of energy security in the country. ● High level of leakage and wastage due to theft ● Underexploited hydropower capacity with Nepal only using a fraction of its commercially exploitable potential ● Despite its abundant hydropower resources, Nepal has one of the highest electricity tariffs in the world ● Regulatory barriers associated with foreign investments (including those in energy development projects), and land acquisition (private landowners for construction of transmission lines) ● Inadequate financial and operational performance of the Nepal Electricity Authority Energy in Nepal: Pain Points, Priorities, and Digital Solutions Pain Points Government of Nepal’s Priorities Digital as an Enabler Inadequate power generation ● Nepal has a high dependence on energy imports from India as the NEA only meets 40% of Nepal’s energy needs (2017) ● Energy generation in Nepal fluctuates depending on water flow due to heavy reliance on hydropower, resulting in lower supply during the winter when demand is typically the highest ● Increase electricity consumption per capita over the next 10 years from 110kw/h to 1500kw/h ● Establish a center to implement large-scale PPP hydropower projects and provide relevant transaction advice. Additionally, the government intends to diversify power generation to include other sources such as biomass, solar, wind, and solid waste ● Digitally streamlined PPP application processes to mobilize foreign investment in the development of large-scale hydropower projects and high- voltage transmission lines ● Smart grid solutions to develop necessary power distribution infrastructure ● Smart building/energy management solutions for the public sector and large enterprises to reduce power consumption Limited rural electrification ● Large disparity in electricity access with only 72% of the rural population having access to electricity, compared to 96% in urban areas ● Complete electrification throughout the country by 2021 ● Smart power (e.g., cloud-based operating systems, applications integration) can extend electricity and energy reach to rural areas through better management High transmission energy losses ● Nepal has one of the highest electricity output losses globally, recording 22.9% in 2017 during the transmission and distribution process ● Technical losses such as energy dissipation in the ● NEA is leading several projects to improve grid infrastructure and increase efficiencies including the Smart Metering Smart Grid ● Smart grids and Smart meters to conduct system loss analysis to reduce power losses by leveling, reducing or improving the quality and efficiency of power flows 100 transmission lines and non- technical losses such as faulty meters and unmetered energy are key contributors for the output loss Project and the GIS Smart Grid Project ● Advanced analytics solutions to track energy consumption and check power thefts Inefficiency of the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) ● In FY2016/2017, the NEA incurred a net loss of approximately US$8.98 million ● The increasing cost of power purchased from IPPs could destabilize the agency’s financial position further ● Concerns over the NEA’s ability to meet contractual obligations in power development projects due to its financial standing ● Measures to restructure the NEA and improve the efficiency of related organizations ● Plans to evaluate and adjust electricity tariff rates, power purchase rates, and wheeling charges according to climate and time, to reduce costs and boost energy distribution efficiency ● Use of digital technologies in meter reading collection (smart meters), payment collection, customers services to improve operational efficiency ● Field force automation solutions for optimal use of field forces such as technicians and meter readers Case study: Digital tech addressing Brazil’s power theft crisis The rising incidence of electricity theft in Brazil was costing its government billions in lost revenue. On average, 8% of energy in Brazil was being stolen from the grid each year, reaching a staggering 40% in some areas. Solution: Siemens used the innovative Smart Meter software to access, collect, and process data from smart meters, integrating the platform with the billing and management system to ensure efficient energy billing to users. From the analysis of consistent data, Siemens was also able to identify the culprits as being a group of small and mid-sized enterprises that were using stolen energy to reduce their overheads. By building complicated user profiles, smart algorithms continuously compare an estimated consumption pattern to the amount of energy coming from the grid. The system can also detect any anomalies in electricity use, which is then inspected. 88 Digital Initiatives Roadmap for the Energy Sector The Government of Nepal should consider increasing its focus on digital investments in the energy sector to maximize its ability to meet power demands and generation potential through the following recommended initiatives: 1 Technology and Infrastructure 2 Entrepreneurship/PPP 3 Talent and Skills Development ● Smart Metering ● GIS Smart Grid Project ● Pan-Nepal roll-out of NEA’s- Any Branch Payment System (ABPS) ● NEA Official Mobile App 2.0 ● Smart Building/Energy Management Project ● Digitally streamlined licensing and PPP application processes ● NEA e-Learning Platform ● Contract Management Information System 88 Siemens 101 ● NEA Field Force Automation Solutions ● NEA Customer Service Portal Technology and Infrastructure The recommended initiatives to expand technology-based electricity generation and distribution capacity in Nepal are as follows: 05.01.46.00 Smart Metering Solution Introduction of smart meters can help reduce energy losses and improve operational efficiencies through data and trend analysis.

Stakeholders ● Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation ● Nepal Electricity Authority ● Department of Electricity Development Timelines Outcomes Immediate ● Improved customer interaction and satisfaction ● Increased efficiency in attending to customer queries ● Faster response time and consistency across all channels Case study: Smart grid technology reducing power outages in Bosnia and Herzegovina To the people of Brcko, Bosnia and Herzegovina, frequent power outages were a way of life affecting businesses, schools, and homes. During storms or technical failures, residents could lose power for extended periods. USAID and its partners, the US Energy Association, Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, and Brcko Komunalna, the electric utility serving the Brcko district of Bosnia and Herzegovina, joined forces to support a smart grid technology pilot project between September 2015 and September 2016 that dramatically improved the reliability of electricity supply in Brcko. Schweitzer Engineering’s technology could instantly identify the location of power outages caused by storms and technical failures on Brcko’s distribution lines. Previously, during a power outage, employees would have to drive or walk along the power lines until they found the problem. The new technology not only reduces the number of trucks and employees needed to restore services, but also improves customer services while reducing emissions and costs associated with the use of diesel-powered backup generators. The project has reduced the frequency and duration of electricity outages. Over the project period, customers on an affected line reported a 51% drop in the number of outages, and 58% reduction – or about 8 hours – in the duration of outages compared with the same period the previous year.89 Entrepreneurship/Public-Private Partnerships The Government of Nepal acknowledges the importance of private sector involvement and investment to fully develop Nepal’s hydropower capacity. In considering public-private partnerships (PPPs) hydropower generation models, the government should also work to address constraints to private investments in infrastructure, including regulatory barriers (e.g., simplifying licensing procedures, forest clearance, and land acquisition procedures). ● Digitally streamlined licensing and PPP application processes A digitally streamlined PPP application process creates a conducive environment for private sector mobilization and foreign investment in the development of large-scale hydropower projects and high-voltage transmission lines. 89 USAID 105 Additionally, the Department of Electricity Development should digitalize the process of license allocation, in order to ensuring transparency and expedite the process.

The travel and tourism sector is a primary source of revenue, foreign exchange, and employment for the country, contributing 7.8% to total GDP and 6.6% to total employment (translating into ~1,027,000 jobs) as at 2017.91 Given the sector’s direct positive impact on Nepal’s economic growth, the government is stepping up efforts to promote travel and tourism through an array of market-friendly policies, targeted marketing campaigns, and investment programs. Key initiatives fall under its new policy, the National Tourism Strategy 2016–2025, which envisages a fivefold increase in annual arrivals by 2025.92 An immediate focus area of the government is the Visit Nepal 2020 program that aims to attract two million tourists and generate one million job opportunities in the sector by 2020.93 Key Government Initiatives in Tourism: National Tourism Strategy 2016–2025 Visit Nepal 2020 Envisages a fivefold increase in annual arrivals and 9.29% growth in the sector’s contribution to GDP by 2025. Also aims to add 4,000 hotel rooms in Kathmandu by 2018–2019. An immediate focus area of the government, Visit Nepal 2020 aims to attract two million tourists and create one million jobs in the sector by 2020. Attracting Tourists from Regional Countries Partnerships with International Organizations The Government of Nepal is encouraging tourism, mainly from China, its largest tourist The government has partnered with the World Bank’s International Finance Corp (IFC) and FMO, a Netherlands-based development bank, 91 World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), Data Gateway, Nepal, 92 Debanjana Bhattacharya, “Nepal Tourism launches new National Tourism Strategy”, Travel News Digest, August 30, 2016, 93 Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation, Tourism Vision 2020 Policy Document, May 2009. 108 demographic, with the launch of its customized website in Chinese language. to build critical infrastructure including a US$6 million, green-field, three-star hotel in Kathmandu, under the Fairfield brand.94 Encouraging Private Investments in the Tourism Sector Driven by policies to boost the tourism sector, the hospitality industry in Nepal is in an expansionary mode to accommodate the influx of tourists, with domestic and foreign investors announcing plans to invest NPR60 billion (US$0.55 billion) in hotel projects across the country in 2016. Prominent initiatives include the re-entry of Indian hotel chain, Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces, into Nepal to operate a new lodge in Chitwan; ongoing construction by InterContinental Hotels and the Sheraton Group in various regions in Nepal; and expansion of several local hotel companies including Nepal Hospitality Group, Muktishree Group, and Glacier Hotel. All figures are rounded. The base year is 2013; Source: World Travel & Tourism Council Despite the government-led efforts, growth has been relatively slow, with tourist arrivals to Nepal at a five-year CAGR of only ~4.2% (2013–2017), reaching 940,218 tourists in 2017,95 primarily owing to the country’s underdeveloped infrastructure. To achieve its 2020 target of two million tourists, arrivals will need to increase multifold, at a CAGR of 28.6%, requiring the government to intensify initiatives to boost the sector. Challenges in Nepal’s Tourism Sector While the Government of Nepal aspires to strengthen the tourism sector’s productivity, income, and image internationally, it continues to trail other countries in the region due to several inherent challenges. In 2017, the sector accounted for ~7.8% of Nepal’s GDP, compared to 21.2% in Thailand, 11.6% in Sri Lanka, and 8.9% for countries in South Asia.96,97 Critical challenges in Nepal’s tourism and hospitality sector include: 94 The Himalayan Times, “IFC, FMO invest $5.5m in Fairfield Marriot Hotel”, June 21, 2017. 95 Nepal Tourism Statistics 2017 Publication, Ministry of Culture, Tourism & Civil Aviation. 96 World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), Data Gateway, Nepal. 97 South Asia includes India, Myanmar, China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Laos, and Nepal. CAGR (2013–2017): 4.2% CAGR (2017–2020F): 28.6% 109 ● Poor infrastructure to support tourism activities, including congested airports, poor quality of roads and facilities, and weak IT infrastructure to support digital initiatives. The massive April 2015 earthquake that severely damaged many of the country’s historic sites further exacerbate this problem ● Lack of effective marketing and promotional activities to promote Nepal as a tourist destination, possibly due to lack of funds ● Tourists’ negative perceptions about safety and security risks due to past instances of political turmoil, terrorism from neighboring countries, and natural disasters ● Shortage of skilled and professional workforce, with most tour guides speaking very little English, weakening the image of Nepal as a tourism destination internationally ● Tourists to Nepal often complain about the lack of reliable, up-to-date information on tourist spots, weather conditions, and activities available ● Low focus on promoting domestic tourism, leading to lost revenue opportunities for the sector The new government intends to revitalize the tourism sector during its tenure by rolling out a 100-day action plan to address various challenges. Key areas under the action plan include: Technology and Innovation ● Digitalize and consolidate archives of national importance; catalog, tag, and upload 11,550 of 31,000 handwritten manuscripts, along with 655,000 images preserved at the National Archives ● Form a think tank to gather suggestions and feedback regularly, and draft a concept paper on mobilizing tourism attachés in five major markets Administrative ● Establish a secretariat to oversee Visit Nepal 2020 ● Form a committee to determine the actual contribution of the tourism sector to Nepal’s economy ● Resolve the dispute over the use of modern materials to rebuild the archeological heritage monuments and reconstruct. ● Draft a formal Casino Act to streamline the gambling business and address the evasion of royalties and taxes by casino operators Infrastructure ● Finalize the modality of the proposed Nijgadh International Airport in Bara within 100 days ● Build a Guerrilla Trail and Yarsa Trail at least 10km long to offer a unique trekking experience ● Develop model tourist destinations in all seven provinces of Nepal such as Ilam, Janakpur, Makwanpur, Pokhara, Rupandehi, Mugu, and Kailali Promise of Digital Initiatives in the Tourism Sector Increasing connectivity driven by the proliferation of Internet and mobile devices and growing affordability of digital technologies are transforming the nature of tourism and consumer demand. Globally, ICT penetration is typically high in the travel, tourism, and hospitality sector, with the automation of almost every process from research, price comparison and ticketing to booking and reservations. Nepal can learn from other countries successfully implementing digital tourism technologies to address the inherent challenges of its tourism sector. Use of digital technologies in the tourism sector presents new revenue streams for Nepal through increased profitability of its various stakeholders and generates significant benefits for society through a reduction in environmental footprint, better safety and security, and cost and time savings. Nepal appears to be in the early stages of ICT implementation. Currently, digitalization efforts are limited to website development for the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation (MoCTCA) and Department of Tourism while the hospitality industry operates basic CRM and revenue management systems. Nepal 110 has a long way ahead to gain measurable benefits from ICT through the large-scale implementation of digital initiatives in tourism. Tourism Sector in Nepal: Pain Points, Priorities, and Digital Solutions Pain Points Government of Nepal’s Priorities Digital as an Enabler Inadequate infrastructure Airports Nepal has only one international airport – Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA), considered among the worst in the world according to tourist reviews98 due to: ● Small size with just one runway and limited capacity, resulting in overcrowding and baggage collection issues ● The runway is developing cracks and potholes, worsening congestion and causing flight delays ● Lack of basic amenities like toilets, cleanliness, and e-ticketing services ● Untrained and unskilled employees The airport is the first point of contact for tourists. As such, any negative impression could hamper tourist growth in the country. Under the 100-day action plan, the government has announced several measures to revitalize its airport, including: ● Increasing the operation hours of TIA from the current 17 hours/day to over 20 hours/day ● Completing 40% of the physical infrastructure of Gautam Buddha International Airport in Bhairahawa and 50% physical progress by June 2018 ● Purchasing six Twin Otter aircrafts to serve remote areas There are also plans to complete construction of the Pokhara Airport by 2020.99 ● Use of digital signages and touchscreen kiosks to provide tourism information ● Advertise tourism-related offers and alerts via free Wi- Fi services at the airport ● Digitize immigration, Customs and visa processes through the use of automated gateways to scan passports, visas, and boarding passes ● Use of e-visas and digital immigration records to move toward paperless immigration processes which are faster and could alleviate congestion at airports Road infrastructure ● Congestion in popular tourist areas due to the poor quality of roads and traffic mismanagement ● Lack of last-mile connectivity in remote, hard-to-reach areas ● Weak regulation of driving licenses is a major contributor to the presence of unsafe, inexperienced drivers on the road, presenting significant reputational and safety risks ● In Jan 2017, ~US$1.35 million grant was allocated to procure a 150-kilowatt solar power plant to power e-vehicles plying the World Heritage Site of Lumbini, to reduce congestion and pollution ● The government has commenced construction of the Kathmandu Nijgadh Fast Track road ● Use of smart traffic management and intelligent lighting control systems for real-time and predictive traffic information ● Vehicle tracking and monitoring using RFID tags ● Use of GPS technology by cabs transporting tourists to check road conditions 98 Dr Perry Haan, “Tourism issues involving Nepal’s economy”, Watertown Public Opinion, August 17, 2017. 99 Address by the Right Honorable President of Nepal, Mrs Bidya Devi Bhandari, to the Joint Session of both Houses of the Federal Parliament, May 21, 2018. 111 Facilities ● Shortage of tourist facilities like ATMs, information centers, currency exchanges outside mainstream tourist spots ● Inadequate information on health, hygiene, and ecology ● Limited connectivity in popular trekking areas, resulting in the inability to track tourists in case of emergencies ● Under the Visit Nepal 2020 campaign, the government is investing in the development of additional tourist facilities and infrastructure ● Equip self-service kiosks in tourist centers ● Enable booking through mobile and web channels ● Install Wi-Fi hotspots ● Develop websites and portals with comprehensive tourism information 4. IT infrastructure to support digitalization ● Inability to perform digital payments due to poor integration between payment systems of banks, mobile wallets, and merchants; and lack of facilitation for foreign currency payments ● Highly fragmented databases and poor integration between airports, tourism authorities, travel agencies, and hotels ● In May 2017, Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) reviewed its retail payment systems to identify regulatory gaps and barriers, as well as to develop a national retail payment strategy, to support digital payments ● Implement centralized IT systems such as Global Distributed Software (GDS) and reservation management systems to connect all licensed agencies with the government to enable information sharing Limited tourism information availability ● Lack of information on tourism destinations, health and hygiene, natural hazards, changes in biodiversity, and ecology ● Tourism websites, books, and brochures are limited; and those that are available are scattered, not updated regularly or reliable As tourism is an information-intensive business, poor data access could weaken Nepal’s position in the global tourism industry. ● Nepal Tourism Board (NTB) has launched its official tourism website, with detailed information on tourist attractions, activities, events, climate, and local transport options ● Develop an official website and mobile application for the NTB with regular updates on attractions, weather, travel, accommodation, and e- ticketing ● Equip tourist centers with self-service information kiosks, digital signages, and maps Lack of effective marketing strategies Despite its rich cultural heritage and terrain, Nepal is not at the top of the travel list for most tourists owing to several factors: ● Lack of promotional activities advertising Nepal as a tourism destination ● The government has introduced several tourism campaigns including Visit Nepal 2018, Campaign HAN, and Himalayan Travel Mart 2018 ● Launch a customized website in Chinese language to attract visitors from China who form a majority of Nepal’s tourists ● Use augmented reality apps to provide tourism information, navigation, guides, and translations ● Virtual reality technology to recreate tours, showcase accommodation, and advertise hotels 112 ● Lack of opportunity to fully capitalize on the country’s mountaineering, pilgrimage, medical tourism, and ecotourism features, indicating lost revenue channels ● The government’s inability to diversify tourism products, possibly due to lack of funding ● Poor grievance-handling for tourists across multiple channels such as email, social media and phone. ● In 2017, the NTB signed up with BBC World, Reuters, and TripAdvisor to display promotional videos of Nepal through the media channels ● Deploy online marketing, SEM/SEO tools including targeted ads for travelers ● Social media marketing, peer reviews, and user- generated content build brand value and attract visitors ● Automate customer service and outsource grievance handling to specialized IT providers Shortage of skilled workforce in the tourism sector As the majority of the country’s skilled talent have migrated overseas for work, Nepal’s tourism sector is forced to hire unskilled people from rural areas with little experience; gender equality issues and socio-cultural factors also prevent women from working in the sector ● Nepal Academy of Tourism and Hotel Management offers Bachelor’s and Master’s Degrees in Hospitality Management, as well as Bachelor’s Degree in Travel and Tourism ● The Government plans to set up training centers to coach tourist guides, and a Tourism University to offer higher education in tourism to meet human capital demand ● Use of automated tour guides that connect to visitors’ mobile phones and provide historical information, reducing the need for physical tour guides ● Monuments and heritage sites can be connected with sensor/IoT technology, QR codes, and RFID tags to provide information Low focus on domestic tourism Majority of tourism policies in Nepal target foreign tourists with little being done to promote domestic tourism, leading to: ● Growth in outbound tourism as Nepalese travel overseas during the holiday season (October–November) ● Loss of opportunity to tap into the rising disposable incomes and spending power of Nepalese ● Government-led initiatives to improve infrastructure and marketing/promotional activities could benefit both international and domestic tourism ● Ongoing programs by NTB to boost domestic tourism such as Travel Nepal and Photo Nepal to promote Nepali tourism using photography; Safa Nepal to foster cleanliness around heritage sites, and Chulo Nepal to publicize Nepali food and hygiene conditions ● Create websites/helplines in local Nepali languages to cater to the diverse ethnic local population ● Train local entrepreneurs, particularly in rural tourists hotspots like Manang, Mustang, Rara Lake, and Ghandruk, to boost domestic tourism Digital Initiatives Roadmap for the Tourism Sector The Government of Nepal should consider formulating a comprehensive model for the tourism industry, encompassing infrastructure, attractions, accessibility, amenities, and ancillary services, along with key technology tools. 113 Following digital initiatives are identified to unlock the potential of Nepal’s tourism sector: 1 Technology and Infrastructure 2 Entrepreneurship/PPP 3 Talent and Skills Development ● Welcome Nepal Website and Mobile App 2.0 ● Electronic Visas & Immigration Process Improvement ● Multilingual Helpline ● Augmented and Virtual Reality tours ● Electronic Tour Guides ● Omnichannel Marketing ● Tourist Security Infrastructure ● Entry of travel startup and foreign companies ● Public private investments and partnerships with sharing economy players ● Training programs for local guides ● Tie-ups with educational institutions Technology and Infrastructure The following initiatives seek to address the gaps in insufficient tourism infrastructure.

Talent and Skills Development The tourism sector in Nepal is unorganized and highly fragmented with several small-scale players. Due to its non-technical nature, most workers in the sector, while skillful, come from rural areas and do not have proper education. As part of its goal to formalize the sector and improve infrastructure, the government needs to introduce language training and ICT education programs to improve the quality of human capital. ● Training programs for local guides Create a structured training program for local tour guides in the areas of communication (English and other languages), technical know-how (e.g., operate trekking equipment), driving, and professional etiquette, among others.

Source: Press Information Bureau, Government of India, January 12, 2018 120 Finance Despite the size of its economy, Nepal has a relatively diversified financial services sector. As at July 2017, there are 28 commercial banks in Nepal with a paid up capital of NPR8 billion, 40 development banks, and 32 finance companies. As one of the largest contributors to Nepal’s economy, the financial services sector contributed 23% of GDP in FY2016. It is also one of the largest employers in the country with commercial banks alone employing nearly 30,000 people in July 2017. A key driver for the financial services sector is the high volume of remittances sent to Nepal by the thousands of Nepalese working abroad since the 1990s. Remittances in 1995 accounted for 1.3% of GDP, growing to an estimated US$6.6 billion, about 31.3% of the country’s GDP in 2016.100 While the sector consists of a diverse range of financial institutions, Nepal has yet to reap the benefits of a mature financial services sector as a large section of Nepali society remains unbanked and unable to access these services. Only 47.72% of adults in Nepal are formally banked through an account with a financial institution.101 As a result, Nepal continues to be a cash economy with most transactions occurring outside its financial system. Nepal’s sizeable unbanked population is its biggest hurdle to achieving financial inclusion in the country. In addressing this issue, the Government of Nepal and the Nepal Rastra Bank – Central Bank of Nepal (NRB) should consider promoting financial inclusion initiatives as a critical growth enabler and undertaking policy interventions to encourage banks and other financial institutions to expand their presence in remote areas. An increase in the number of financial institution branches could improve financial access in Nepal. Challenges in Nepal’s Financial Sector A large unbanked population and predominantly cash economy are the biggest barriers to the development of the financial services sector in Nepal. More than half of Nepali citizens do not have a bank account, with consumption of financial solutions remaining low even for people with access to financial services. 100 World Bank 101 World Bank 121 Fast Facts 45% of Nepali citizens are formally banked Only half of bank account holders withdrew money from their accounts in the past year 15% of salaried employees receive their wages through a bank account 9% of Nepali citizens own debit cards 1% of Nepali citizens own credit cards 16% Nepali citizens have made or received a digital payment Source: World Bank, 2017 Banking fees, low literacy levels, and inaccessibility of bank services in rural areas due to poor infrastructure are vital factors mainly hampering the uptake of formal financial services in Nepal. Lack of legal identity documentation has also been reported to be a barrier to creating bank accounts. Source: Global Findex Database – World Bank Overall, the financial ecosystem in Nepal is still in its infancy due to several challenges hindering its adoption: ● Sizeable unbanked population due to a multitude of issues including: ‒ Difficulty in accessing physical bank branches (especially in remote, rural areas). As at March 2018, only 394 of the 753 Local levels formed under the new federal structure have bank branches. Additionally, ATM and commercial branch penetration in Nepal is significantly lower than that of most other countries in the region 122 ‒ High cost of financial services and lack of proof-of-identity (or know your customer, KYC) documents limiting access to financial services for the poor and deprived sections of society ● Underdeveloped digital financial services ecosystem with low credit and debit card penetration, low use of digital payments, online and mobile banking, and restrictive government policies (e.g., low maximum limit of digital payments) ● Widespread preference for informal financial channels (e.g., informal remittance transfer systems) that results in reduced resources for the Government to make productive investments, encourages tax evasion, and negatively impacts governance and exchange reserves ● Lack of financial and digital literacy Source: World Bank, 2016; * Sri Lanka data is for 2015 Promise of Digital Initiatives in the Financial Sector With Internet penetration rate at 63%, Nepal is well positioned to benefit from digital financial services. These solutions (e.g., mobile/Internet banking, mobile wallets, online digital payments) have the potential to address challenges such as difficulties accessing banks and the high cost of services. Globally, financial services institutions, IT companies, and telecom operators are joining forces to increase digital inclusion to drive socioeconomic growth. Given the nearly ubiquitous mobile penetration in Nepal, intelligent finance solutions combining digital technologies and telecom operators’ nationwide presence can be a feasible way to boost financial inclusion in the country. Nepal should learn from the success of mobile wallets in many African nations to expand digital inclusion and socioeconomic growth. Development of the digital financial services ecosystem at existing banks and financial services institutions is integral to driving all aspects of the economy. In 2002, Kumari Bank pioneered digital payment services in Nepal with the introduction of Internet banking services for its customers. In recognizing the proven opportunities digital payment services offer, more digital solutions are beginning to become available in Nepal from traditional financial institutions and fintech start-ups such as eSewa, IMEPay, Khalti, and iPay. The Government of Nepal considers financial inclusion as a critical lever to driving socioeconomic growth, and as a result, has undertaken these recent measures: ● FY2018–19 budget allocation to digitize government payments and revenue collection (e.g., tax payments via mobile application) ● Launch of opening bank accounts campaign targeting every Nepali citizen ● Formulating and implementing necessary laws and regulations for electronic transactions to facilitate and govern digital payments Case study: Kenya M-Pesa transforming the economy through mobile money services102 Objective: Using mobile money technology to offer financial services in rural and marginalized areas. Model: The M-Pesa mobile payment platform launched in March 2007 as a product developed by Vodafone, in partnership with Sagentia, by integrating a mobile wallet with Safaricom’s rating, billing, and provisioning systems. The onboarding of customers on the platform was achieved by replacing the SIM of registered Safaricom users with the M-Pesa enabled SIM. Users load money into the mobile wallet by depositing cash with an agent to obtain e-Float currency. The digital currency is then used for payments or transferred to other users through encrypted SMS. 102 Vodafone; Safaricom; MIT 123 The platform currently acts as a mobile wallet offering money deposits, payments, balance checking, cash withdrawal, and international money transfer services at a minimal cost. Besides Kenya, digital wallet services are also available in Tanzania, Afghanistan, India, Romania, Egypt, Albania, and South Africa. M-Pesa’s success in Africa can be attributed to its focus on micropayments, targeting consumers at the base of the banking sector pyramid. By offering convenient digital money transfer regardless of the value of the transaction, M-Pesa has achieved widespread adoption throughout the financial ecosystems in its markets. Before M-Pesa was introduced in Kenya, the nearest bank was on average 9.4 km away from users. As at 2017, 96% of Kenya’s population can access financial services using their mobile phones, with an M-Pesa agent an average of 1.4km away. In the first half of 2017, transactions through M-Pesa amounted to 48.76% of Kenya’s GDP. By the end of 2017, Vodacom processed US$7.3 billion worth of M-Pesa transactions globally per month. Today, its widespread usage in Kenya has been credited with raising 2% of Kenyan households out of extreme poverty through access to mobile money services between 2008 and 2016. It also plays a crucial role in offering opportunities to small businesses as well as a range of financial services such as international transfers, loans, and health provisions using mobile. Financial Sector in Nepal: Pain Points, Priorities, and Digital Solutions Pain Points Government of Nepal’s Priorities Digital as an Enabler Difficulties in accessing banks ▪ As at 2017, about 81%103 of Nepal’s population lives in rural areas, with 20% of Nepali adults citing the distance they need to travel to banks as the main reason for not opening a bank account ▪ Ensure BFIs establish rural branches first to be eligible to set up outlets in urban areas ▪ Offer interest-free loans to assist BFIs to expand into remote districts ▪ Increased adoption of digital transactions and payments to minimize the need to visit bank branches Large unbanked population ● Only 40% of Nepali citizens are formally banked ● 26% of the adult population in Nepal are illiterate, impairing their ability to engage with financial services ● A quarter of the adult population lack a citizenship certificate, making them ineligible to apply for formal banking channels ● Mostly homogenous products offered by financial services providers (FSPs) do not meet the needs of consumers across various segments ● Low-income consumer market with highly seasonal and irregular ● Introduction of microfinance institutions in Nepal to target the financially excluded, particularly in rural areas ● NRB is currently implementing a five-year strategic action plan (2012–2016) with financial inclusion as a strategic priority ● Introduction of an e-mapping system to prioritize approval of new bank branches or channel points in unbanked areas ● Launch digital payment systems in Nepal to help Nepali citizens leapfrog conventional banking systems to the digital payment system ● Promote convenience of digital payment systems to build adoption momentum in Nepal o With the adoption of digital payment methods, the distance between end users and the nearest bank will no longer be an inhibiting factor with the integration of formal financial services 103 World Bank 124 incomes have unique needs for FSPs High fees incurred from banking services ▪ Banking services in Nepal charge relatively high fees for financial services. ▪ Consider reducing transaction service charges to encourage digital payment adoption ▪ Offer subsidies to banks to offset the costs incurred through payments ▪ Adoption of digital processes throughout the financial system to streamline processes, and in turn, reduce the cost of banking services at financial institutions Preference for informal remittance methods ● Informal channels to remit funds to Nepal, such as the hundi or hawala system which is popular among Nepalese overseas mainly due to the hefty fees incurred through formal channels o Foreign Exchange Management Department (FEMD), under the NRB, regulates the entire remittance industry in Nepal ● Digitalization of payment modes through partnerships with financial institutions to reduce the cost of remittance and encourage more Nepalese to remit money digitally Slow user adoption of digital platforms ● Complex user interface ● Language barriers ● The complexity of products offered ● Actively encouraging the adoption of digital payment systems via development of a common platform for strengthening digital payment system in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) region ● Reduction in the number of steps to make payments and reload mobile wallet ● Simplification of user interface ● Platforms available in multiple languages Maximum limit for digital transactions ● NRB has introduced various limits for digital payments such as credit/debit card, mobile banking, Internet banking and mobile wallet restricting the payments that can be made digitally as well as the remittance amounts from abroad ● The transaction limit for mobile payments has been set NPR10,000 (US$146) a day, in stark contrast to M-Pesa’s maximum transaction of US$686 ● NRB has expressed that the limits may be adjusted to accommodate industry requirements ● NRB should increase the limit on digital transactions to encourage more transactions ● Currently Citizen Certificate (Nagarikta) Database can be taken as reference for KYC until Digital National ID rollout. Possible policy reform might be required to take this into action. Digital Initiatives Roadmap for the Financial Sector Digital offers a plethora of opportunities in driving financial inclusion, from improving access to financial services to improving tax collection. The Government is taking measures toward achieving this, such 125 as digitalizing all government transactions to boost the adoption of digital payments. It has also started distributing social security allowances and all other government-to-citizen payments through banks to encourage financial inclusion. 1 Technology and Infrastructure 2 Entrepreneurship/PPP 3 Talent and Skills Development ● National Payment Gateway ● Credit Ratings (Individual or Corporate Accounts) ● Database management of Nepalese migrants ● Mobile Wallet Services ● Encourage digital payments in Nepal ● Development of single window for business and industry promotion ● Development and promotion of ecommerce and ITeS ecosystem ● Digital Payments Campaign Technology and Infrastructure The following initiatives targeting financial services sector can be implemented in Nepal to boost financial inclusion: 07.01.62.00 National Payment Gateway Solution Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) is mulling over introducing a national payment gateway to monitor digital payment system and transactions nationwide. National payment gateway will integrate different payment channels to simplify the electronic payment process and lower the cost of interbank transactions in Nepal. It will also encourage foreign payment systems to join the national payment gateway. Over the past few years Nepal has witnessed a sharp rise in the mobile payment system and made rapid technological advancements, making it the right time for NRB to introduce the national payment system. Stakeholders ● Ministry of Finance ● Nepal Rastra Bank ● Ministry of Communication and Information Technology ● National Information Technology Center ● Financial Comptroller General Office Timelines Outcomes Immediate ● National payment gateway will reduce the cost of interbank financial transactions, thereby making financial services more affordable ● Will help in developing a safe and efficient national payment system ● Drive adoption of digital financial transactions in Nepal 126 07.01.63.00 Credit Ratings (Individual or Corporate Accounts) Solution Currently Nepal does not have a formal credit rating system for individuals and corporate accounts. As Nepal’s financial ecosystem matures, its necessary for the country to develop a robust credit rating system, which can be leveraged by financial institutions to make informed decisions while providing loans to individuals and corporates, thereby reducing loan defaults and non-performing assets. Ministry of Finance can consider establishing a government backed credit bureau under the aegis of Nepal Rastra Bank, or encourage the entry of private credit bureaus like Equifax, TransUnion and Experian. Stakeholders ● Ministry of Finance ● Nepal Rastra Bank Timelines Outcomes Medium-Term ● Enable financial institutions to make informed decisions for sanctioning loans ● Reduce loan defaults and non-performing assets 07.01.64.00 Information management system of Nepali migrant workers Solution Overseas employment is one of the main factors for international migration in Nepal. The Department of Foreign Employment (DoFE) issued 786,564 new permits, for more than 100 destination countries as per labor migration for employment status report 2015/2016 – 2016/2017. Migration of people poses a complex global challenge to the government which has policy implications like labor market participation and integration and also border management. Relevant high quality data will help in designing implementing and evaluating policies that will be beneficial for humanitarian, social and economic wellbeing of the country and migrants. Furthermore, prospective migrants can register online through web-based migrant data management system and get help in emergency situations.

Entrepreneurship/Public-Private Partnerships The Government of Nepal should undertake the following policy interventions to create an enabling environment for digital financial services: 07.02.65.00 Mobile Wallet Services Solution Globally, telecom operators play an essential role in the financial services sector with the rollout of digital financial services such as M-Pesa and mobile wallets. NRB and Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA) should work together to draft a policy framework that allows the involvement of telecom operators and IT companies in promoting financial inclusion in Nepal. Telecom operators can be given the licenses to operate e-wallet/digital financial services using existing telco KYC for authentication purposes. Stakeholders ● Ministry of Finance ● Ministry of Communication and Information Technology ● Nepal Telecommunications Authority ● Nepal Rastra Bank Timelines Outcomes Immediate ● Help in achieving SDGs related to the capacity of domestic financial institutions to encourage and expand access to banking, insurance and financial services for all (SDG Target 8.10) ● This will enable telecom operators to leverage their existing nationwide network of retailers to increase the reach of financial services in remote / rural areas. 07.02.66.00 Encourage digital payments in Nepal Solution Only 15% of Nepali wage earners receive their salaries in their accounts. The Government of Nepal should consider introducing policies that encourage employers (public and private sectors) to transfer wages and other payments directly to employees and suppliers using financial services. The government should mandate the compulsory transfer of salaries beyond a minimum threshold level to bank accounts. Until the rollout of a national biometric ID card, the onus of helping employees in opening bank accounts should lie with the employers. Similar policies can be considered for other private and public sector payments. Stakeholders ● Ministry of Finance ● Nepal Rastra Bank 128 Timelines Outcomes ● Ministry of Communication and Information Technology ● National Information Technology Center Medium Term ● Help in achieving SDGs related to the capacity of domestic financial institutions to encourage and expand access to banking, insurance and financial services for all (SDG Target 8.10) ● The digital payment system will lead to greater financial inclusion by reaching remote areas. ● It will boost the overall economy of the country by providing convenient access to a diverse range of financial products and services for individuals as well as small, medium and large businesses. 07.01.67.00 Development of single window for business and industry promotion Solution Implementation of a single window system will enhance the trading community's convenience and efficiency as traders will be able to submit their regulatory documents at a single site or location. The regulatory documents may be customs declarations, applications for import/export permits, and other supporting documents such as certificates of origin and trading invoices. Through electronic interface like government portals or websites, traders can meet their service delivery at a single delivery point which will reduce transaction cost of regulation and also transparency in services. Stakeholders ● Government - Customs - Permit-issuing agencies - Ministries (and other trade monitoring bodies ● Banking and insurance community Timelines Outcomes Medium Term ● e-single window and paperless trading ● Cross-border data harmonization and exchange ● National data harmonization ● Document simplification and alignment ● Reduced transaction cost ● Improved customer satisfaction 07.01.68.00 Development and promotion of ecommerce and ITeS ecosystem Solution Development of a focused strategic framework for the promotion of entrepreneurial activities around ecommerce and IT enabled services in Nepal.

Initiatives in the ecommerce domain can further be complemented by developing related skills among small businesses, promoting digital entrepreneurship and innovation management, developing government e-procurement and e-trade networks to encourage enterprises and entrepreneurs to adopt online transactions, and raise the overall digital literacy and general awareness of all stakeholders about e-commerce. Stakeholders ● Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies Nepal Chamber of Commerce ● FNCCI ● Handicraft Association of Nepal ● Private sector businesses Timelines Outcomes Medium Term ● Employment generation and economic growth resulting from the growth in ITeS (BPO, KPO and BPMs) ● Enhanced growth level in the trade of goods and services through ecommerce ● SDG Goal 9. Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation ● SGD Goal 17. Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Talent and Skills Development In addition to infrastructure support, talent and skills development is essential to ensuring the successful adoption of digital payments in Nepal. To support the digital payments ecosystem, the country requires skilled programmers, financial technology experts, and operational support teams. Retailers also need to be sufficiently trained in managing digital payment systems to ensure the smooth flow of payments. These challenges can be addressed by training the local talent pool through partnerships with digital payment services providers to familiarize them with the system. The government could also launch educational campaigns to build awareness among consumers on the benefits of digital payments and financial inclusion to ensure the effectiveness of the other initiatives implemented. 07.03.69.00 Digital payments campaign Solution Advertisements on social media and radio/television that highlight the advantages of using digital payments.

However, it is modernizing rapidly with urban population growing 6% annually since the 1970s.104 Urbanization in Nepal is dominated by a few large and mid-sized cities with population concentrated mostly in the Kathmandu Valley. The urban population distribution is uneven across the country with high urban growth in the Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara Valley, Inner Terai Valleys, and several markets and border towns located on highways. Urbanization is likely to accelerate in the future, as Nepalese increasingly move from rural areas to cities in search of better opportunities and facilities. This trend toward urban migration presents both opportunities and challenges for urban development and municipal authorities: ● Urbanization as an engine for growth: To contribute to more sustainable growth across regions, it is essential for Nepal to develop other urban towns to decongest the more popular cities (e.g., Kathmandu, Pokhara) ● Need for investments in urban infrastructure: Rapid urbanization can place immense pressure on an already weak urban infrastructure (especially water supply, sewage and drainage, waste management, public transport, and public safety). Urban development authorities and municipal corporations in Nepal need to systematically upgrade infrastructure to cope with the surge in demand 104 Asian Development Bank 133 Urban development and municipal authorities in Nepal need to focus on the following five infrastructure development pillars to deal with growing requirements and citizen expectations: Challenges in Nepal’s Urban Infrastructure The wide deficits in basic urban infrastructure and quality benchmarking in leading cities in Nepal are highlighted by the poor quality of water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, transport, and safety. Nepal ranks poorly on urban infrastructure when compared with other countries in the region. Nepal was ranked 100 among 140 countries on infrastructure in the Global Competitive Index 2015–2016.105 The gaps in urban infrastructure have been a result of poor urban planning, inorganic growth of urban cities, and below-par quality standards – subsequently devastated by the twin earthquakes in 2015. State of Urban Infrastructure in Nepal Water and Sanitation Despite an abundance of fresh water resources, most cities in Nepal battle with chronic water management challenges ● Nepal has 2.7% of fresh water reserves globally which makes the country the second after Brazil with the highest water reserves106 ● Low quality and quantity of drinking water in cities with only 32.9% of households in the urban Terai regions having access to piped water supply107 Sanitation infrastructure in Nepal is also poor compared with its peers ● Only 56.1% of urban households have access to a sanitation system with only 88.2% of households having access to a toilet108 Waste Management Unplanned waste management system with poor collection and open dumping practices: 105 Global Competitive Index 2015-16, World Economic Forum 106 International Institute of Water Management 107 National Urban Development Strategy (NUDS), 2017 108 National Urban Development Strategy (NUDS), 2017 Pillars for Urban Development in Nepal Roads and Traffic Disaster Management Waste Management Water & Sanitation Public Transport 134 ● The Kathmandu Valley discards about 1,000 tons of solid waste per day of which only 900 tons are collected Lack of landfill sites for waste management: ● Of the 58 municipalities in Nepal, only 6 have sanitary landfill sites while only 5 practice controlled waste dumping109 Public Transport Public transport in Nepal is still in its nascent stages with limited investments from the Government of Nepal in developing the sector. Road transport (buses) system is unorganized and managed by private operators resulting in low reliability and quality of services. Kathmandu Valley and a few developed metros are in dire need of a public transportation system that is reliable, safe, and comfortable. The government should consider creating a multi-modal transport system consisting of bus, rail and/or metro networks. Road and Traffic Lack of resources and investment as well as topological structure (hilly terrain) are major challenges for road infrastructure improvement. Construction and maintenance of roads remain a challenge. Narrow and unplanned roads, unreliable public transport, and increasing private ownership of vehicles are worsening traffic congestion and air pollution. Disaster Management Nepal has a high vulnerability to disasters due to its topology and fragile geology. Natural disasters such as floods and landslides are a regular phenomenon in Nepal. Globally, the country ranks 4th, 11th, and 30th in its level of vulnerability to climate change, earthquakes, and flood risks, respectively.110 Disaster planning and management are critical functions for Nepal’s urban development and municipal authorities due to looming dangers associated with natural disasters.

The 2015 earthquake highlighted several shortcomings including outdated systems, poor data management and weak search, and rescue capacity ● Nepal is developing a new disaster management act, and national strategic plan of action, in line with the framework adopted in Sendai, Japan ● The government formulated a Post Disaster Recovery Framework (2016-2020) and Post Disaster Needs Assessment to provide a systematic, structured, and prioritized framework for implementing recovery and reconstruction, following the 2015 earthquake ● Settlements at high risk relocation and unified settlement development working method 2075 ● National Disaster Management Plan for effective disaster preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation ● IoT based early warning and monitoring systems for disaster management and planning ● Emergency telecommunications equipment for better disaster response and recovery ● Use of drones for delivery of relief supplies, damage assessment, and communications Promise of Digital Initiatives in the Urban Infrastructure Sector Use of digital technology to improve the functioning and efficiency of cities and municipalities has become a well-known strategy for urban planning worldwide. Nepal can pick up valuable lessons and best practices from ongoing programs demonstrating positive results in Asia’s developing countries. The proliferation of enabling technologies such as analytics, mobile, cloud, and broadband, as well as declining cost of sensors, hardware, and IoT devices, are also expected to create significant opportunities for Nepal to integrate digital technology for infrastructure development. As part of its National Urban Development Strategy (NUDS) 2017, the country has laid down plans to modernize urban planning including land use, housing, transportation, and energy, and construct smart cities in Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, and Kirtipur. This is likely to enable Nepal to improve efficiencies, enhance visibility, boost governance mechanisms, and build robust connectivity, and open up new investment opportunities for infrastructure and real estate development in the country. Intelligent urban planning is expected to translate into measurable benefits The global smart waste management market is estimated to be worth US$2.37 billion by 2021, at a robust CAGR of 16.9% over 2016–2021.113 113 Smart Waste Management Market by Solution, Markets and Markets, August 2016 138 In order to provide universal access to water and sanitation by 2030 globally, every US$1 invested in water and sanitation will generate US$4.30 in economic returns through increased productivity.114 The global Intelligent Transportation Systems market is estimated to be a US$72.32 billion industry by 2022,115 contributing to improved road safety, greater sustainability of vehicles, and environmental protection. Emergency preparedness initiatives by UNICEF and the World Food Program (WFP) in selected developing countries has saved a total of US$12 million toward future humanitarian response and created net savings of US$6.4 million, on an investment of US$5.6 million.116 Digital Initiatives Roadmap for the Urban Infrastructure Sector The Government of Nepal should focus on infrastructure development and up gradation using ICT solutions, which is expected to promote economic growth and provide quality services. 1 Technology and Infrastructure 2 Entrepreneurship/PPP 3 Talent and Skills Development ● Water ATMs ● Smart metering for water ● Intelligent Waste Management System ● Automated Waste sorting ● Municipality Mobile Application ● Connected Public Transport / Public Transport Mobile Application ● Intelligent Traffic Management ● Intelligent Parking Lot Management ● Intelligent Toll Booths ● National Disaster Management System ● Ride Sharing ● PPP for urban planning and infrastructure ● Disaster Management Training Technology and Infrastructure Recommended initiatives for infrastructure upgrade with a Smart city vision of to address key social and environmental challenges in cities and municipalities: 114 The Toilet Board Coalition Report, The Circular Sanitation Economy, November 2017 115 Global Intelligent Transportation Systems Market, Analysis and Forecast: 2017–2022, Research and Markets, April 2017 116 BCG, The ROI of Emergency Preparedness 139 08.01.70.00 Water ATMs Solution Install water ATMs in selected public places in Nepal such as market areas, bus stands, railway stations, and airports, where people can purchase fresh, hygienic bottled water by paying a token sum (say, NPR2 for 300ml of water) ● Consider a pilot implementation in the Kathmandu district, and subsequently expand into other municipalities ● Look at a similar initiative undertaken by the Delhi Jal Board in India, as an example for implementation Stakeholders ● Ministry of Water Supply ● Department of Water Supply and Sewage ● Provincial Government and Local Level ● Municipal Association of Nepal ● Water and Energy Commission Secretariat Timelines Immediate Outcomes ● Help achieve the following goals under SDG 6 to “ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all”: ‒ Achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all ‒ 99% household access to basic water supplies   ● Provide clean and safe drinking water at a low cost for the poor population ● Reduce wastage and induce accountability through tracking and monitoring of consumption and dispensing, as well as recycling of water ● Price transparency and flexibility due to cashless dispensing and pay- per-use approach 08.01.71.00 Smart metering for water Solution Replace analog meters with smart digital meters for automatic reading collection.

Shenzhen’s land size is less than 2,000km2, with just over 600km of roads. It has the highest vehicle density in China with an average of about 530 vehicles per km. Solution: Shenzhen’s Traffic Police Bureau collaborated with Huawei to implement innovative ICT solutions to manage road congestion, under an initiative known as Traffic Brain, which included: ● Ultra-broadband traffic network: Leverage Huawei’s high-speed Optical Transport Network (OTN) that enables transmission at 400 Gbit/s, data storage of over 20 PB, and data processing capacity for tens of billions of elements to support the data needs of Shenzhen’s police network ● Data analysis of city-wide traffic: Installation of a road monitoring system that can detect traffic conditions through license plate identification, video surveillance, and other methods with a detection accuracy rate of up to 95%. Collects 700 million pieces of vehicle data monthly, and integrates nearly 40 TB of data from 78 internal and external system databases ● AI-assisted law enforcement: Use of AI technology and big data analytics platform to check for traffic violations, processing up to 10 million images per day. The technology enabled the department to identify vehicle features and traffic violation images at an accuracy rate of more than 95% ● Crime fighting efficiency using big data: Use of a big data platform and traffic analysis modeling engine by the Traffic Police Bureau to generate reports for disqualified driving, drunk driving, and cars with multiple violations. Intelligence could be generated within 30 minutes, from seven days previously ● Increase in road capacity: Set up of a real-time surveillance system for all signal-equipped intersections in Shenzhen, and precise traffic signal control mode based on the traffic time-space software engine. Collection of data via converged checkpoints and roaming police cars to establish lanes through intersections and organize traffic flow through big data management, enabling the city to increase road capacity by about 8% Results: Investigated and closed 37,055 cases of serious violations and detained 874 vehicles with fake or cloned license plates. Vehicles with cloned or fake license plates, scrapped vehicles, and vehicles with multiple violations have now almost disappeared from the streets of Shenzhen. 146 Going forward: The Shenzhen Traffic Police Bureau plans to develop smart police terminals based on 5G technologies; conduct analysis of historical data by means of traffic simulation to predict traffic volume in each corner of the city and; invest CNY3 billion (USD453 million) to upgrade all checkpoint systems, including an improved high-definition video system, so that its coverage rate will exceed 70%. Entrepreneurship/Public-Private Partnerships ● Ride Sharing Ride sharing platforms have the potential to emerge as a strong alternative to the weak public transport system in Nepal. The government should encourage the entry of ride sharing service providers like Uber and Ola. Alternatively, municipal corporations can also consider developing their own ride sharing platforms to ensure efficient utilization of existing taxis. Stakeholders: o Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transportation o Department for Transport Management Timelines: Immediate Outcome: o Reduce passenger wait times and vehicle pollution o Improve traffic conditions by reducing the number of vehicles on roads o Allows taxi drivers to work shorter shifts o Greater security of passengers due to real time monitoring and tracking of vehicles ● PPP for urban planning and infrastructure Undertake public-private partnerships for urban planning and infrastructure, including offering incentives, preferential procurement terms, and tax free investments to the private sector For disaster management, partner with local NGOs and international organizations in areas such as aid programs, disaster planning, relief efforts Stakeholders: o Ministry of Home Affairs o Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation o Ministry of Communication and Information Technology o Department for Transport Management o Survey Department o Nepal Telecommunications Authority o Council of Technical Education and Vocational Training o Nepal Army/ Nepal Police/ APF o Local levels o NGOs/ INGOs o ISPs Timelines: Medium Term Outcome: o Gain access to capital and new technology o Improve service delivery efficiency o Distribute risks between the government and private sectors Selected examples of smart urban infrastructure projects in Nepal: 147 Ncell initiatives in disaster management In July 2016, NCell signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM) to send early warning alerts through SMS to its customers living in areas with a high risk of flood and landslides, including West Rapti, Narayani, Kankai, Koshi, Bagmati, Karnali, Babai, and Kamala River. ● DHM was tasked to provide SMS content to Ncell, which would be triggered based on water levels in rivers. Ncell would immediately send early warning SMS from short code numbers based on the real- time situation. Upon receiving the message about the dangerous water levels, people could then move to government-designated safe locations. Once the water levels returned to normal, SMS alerts would be sent again to inform the people that there is no immediate risk Ncell also initiated various steps to assist disaster victims as part of its CSR efforts. Initiatives included: ● The contribution of NPR 201 million and basic utilities, following the torrential rains that triggered landslides and flooding in 2017 ● An offer of bonus talk time to Sindhupalchowk’s flood and landslide affected customers Multi-level automated car parking system in Dharmapath and Teku Construction of an automated parking system in Kathmandu Metropolitan City within two years at the cost of NPR90 million under a PPP model. Talent and Skills Development Illiteracy is a major challenge in the country, and may become a barrier for the effective implementation and operation of smart solutions in transport, water and sanitation practices, waste management, and disaster preparedness. The government should consider the following projects: 08.03.80.00 Disaster Management Training Solution Training government employees at all levels – central, state, district, and village – in protocols, use of technology and emergency communications during disasters. Also provide training, drills, and exercises to the military and police in rescue and search operations ● Allow participation of the private sector and NGOs in the training programs ● Promote greater awareness and sharing of best practices through conferences and workshops ● Leverage regional Emergency Operation Centers (proposed above) to impart training Stakeholders ● Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training Timelines Long-Term Outcomes ● Increase the employability of population and encourage job creation ● Improve awareness and preparedness among general population 148 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Mapping in Digital Nepal In global context SDGs has been defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The Sustainable Development agenda rests on three pillars - Economic, Social and Environment. For implementing SDGs framework, there are four core factors at stake, which are as follows - Identification of priorities, Intervention of policy instruments, Investment of resources and Institutional readiness. SDGs helps to promote a long- term approach to addressing global challenges that are not typical just for some countries but are faced by most and require joint actions. Having a long-term agenda and targets that has been agreed upon by 193 countries, promotes sustainability of actions and reinforces commitment of the states regardless of changes in the national political context. Based on the Millennium Declaration of the UNGA (September 2000), Nepal pledged to adopt the eight MDGs. The SDGs eventually replaced the MDGs, hence continuing Nepal’s commitment to it. As presented by the Sustainable Development Goals National Report117, Nepal aspires to emerge as an inclusive, equitable, and prosperous middle-income country by 2030 with the spirit of a welfare state. The country aims for sustainable poverty reduction and human development with low vulnerability and higher human security and has set the goal of graduating from LDC status by 2022. Nepal has been an active member of the global initiative for sustainable development goals and has taken up the SDGs as a national priority for the nation. Nepal has made significant progress on meeting the targets of the SDGs, and most of the national projects have embedded the SDGs into their outcomes. The Digital Nepal framework attempts to do the same in aligning the Digital Nepal initiatives with the SGDs118. The Digital Nepal Program will be a catalyst in helping Nepal achieve its vision of meeting the SDGs by 2030. The Digital Nepal Program will accelerate Nepal’s socio-economic growth and will significantly contribute towards the long term development of Nepal. 117 NPC, Sustainable Development Goals 2016-2030, National (Preliminary) Goals 118 See Annexure V for the SDGs Mapping with Digital Nepal Initiatives 149 Recommendations 1.0 Governance framework for Digital Nepal The success of the Digital Nepal Program will remain contingent upon an operational and delivery framework anchored in sufficiently mandated institutional arrangement befitting the scope and depth of the program. The overarching scope of the program with all its attendant ramifications offers a challenging context within which the institutional and delivery arrangements need to be positioned. Along those lines, we envision an institutional and delivery framework for the execution of the Digital Nepal Program that would provide for the highest level of political oversight and a mechanism for operationalizing political and bureaucratic commitments that have been forthcoming since its conceptual phase. The diagram below depicts the recommended institutional arrangement with the Prime Minister chairing the Digital Nepal National Steering Committee for driving the mission agenda and the Minister for Communication and Information Technology serving as the Vice-Chair. The Member Secretary of the Steering Committee shall be the Secretary of the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology. Comprising of high level sectorial government representatives as members, the National Steering Committee (NSC) will be primarily responsible for providing leadership and oversight in relation to ensuring congruence of the program with national development objectives, goals and priorities. The steering committee will be supported by the National Implementation Committee (NIC) under the chairmanship of the Secretary of the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology. The Member Secretary of NIC will be the IT Division Chief of the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology. NIC will be primarily responsible for delivery, execution and coordination support for projects and activities carried out under the Digital Nepal Program with periodic reporting arrangements to the National Steering Committee. NIC will oversee the activities of sector specific sub-committees to be formed at sectorial agencies covered under the Digital Nepal program. The Committee will meet on a quarterly basis and the coordinator of each sub-committee (sector) will provide updates on the execution and progress of the initiatives in the respective sectors. They will also discuss inter- departmental issues and potential areas of collaboration. A Digital Nepal Program Management Office (DNPMO) will also be created to support the NIC in terms of directly overseeing execution of projects and activities, providing project support and coordination services as well as carrying out monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities. This committee will be led by the IT Division Chief of the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology. This committee will also comprise IT, governance, program management and monitoring experts along with representatives from the private sector and development partners. As indicated earlier, it is recommended that dedicated functional entities in the form of sub-committees be created within the lead agencies representing each of the sector identified to serve as sector specific implementation units of the Digital Nepal Program. Sectorial agencies identified as key stakeholders must reflect activities relating to the Digital Nepal Program in their strategic frameworks, annual plans and resource allocation priorities. These sector focused committees will hold monthly meetings to discuss the progress of the selected initiatives, issues and challenges in their execution. 150 Digital Nepal – National Governance Committee Digital Nepal – Steering Committee Agriculture Healthcare Education Energy Tourism Finance Urban Infrastructure Digital Foundation Strategic Level Implementation Level National Digital Healthcare Platform Next-Generation Digital Facilities (Healthcare) Electronic Health Records 2.0 Mobile Health Units e-Maternal Care Drones for Delivery of Emergency Medical Supplies Centralized Telemedicine Center Smart Classroom OLE Nepal 2.0 Online Learning Platform Rent-a-Laptop Program EMIS 2.0 Centralized Admission System Biometric Attendance and CCTV Cameras Mobile Learning Centers in Rural Areas Smart metering GIS Smart Grid Project Pan-Nepal roll-out of NEA- Any Branch Payment System (ABPS) NEA Official Mobile App 2.0 Smart Building/Energy Management Project NEA Field Force Automatic Solutions NEA Customer Service Portal NEA e-Learning Center Contract Management Information System Welcome Nepal Website 2.0 Welcome Nepal Mobile App Electronic visas & Immigration Process Improvement Multilingual helpline Augmented and Virtual Reality Tours Electronic tour guides Ominichannel marketing Tourist Security Infrastructure National Payment Gateway Credit Ratings (Individual and corporate Accounts) Database Management of Nepalese Migrants Policy interventions to allow telecom operators to offer mobile wallets Encourage digital payments in Nepal Development of Single window for Business & Industry Promotion Development and promotion of eCommerce Water ATMs Smart metering for water Intelligent Waste Management Automated waste sorting Municipality Mobile Application Connected public transport Public/ Transport mobile app Multi-model Smart cards Intelligent traffic management Intelligent parking lot management Intelligent toll booths Establish the Internet as an essential service Improve spectrum availability, Management and Optimization Take the lead in 5G Networks deployments National Optical Fiber Network High-speed Internet connectivity for efficient delivery of Public services Special Economic Zones for ICT sector Government of Nepal App eGovernance 2.0 …….

Budget and time overruns of IT and automation projects in government agencies are all too common. In addition, cases of misalignment of automation project activities with expected outcomes also abound pointing towards lack of a strong project oversight and monitoring mechanism. These challenges will be substantially compounded in the context of an all- encompassing mission like Digital Nepal if the projects executed under the program are not subjected to structured monitoring and continually evaluated for their impacts. Along those lines, it is strongly recommended that a strong monitoring and evaluation framework be developed and built into the overall structure of the initiative. The following exhibit depicts key elements of a broad M&E framework for the Digital Nepal Program. Proposed Digital Nepal M&E Framework 152 3.0 Review of policy and regulatory environment Policy and regulatory environment constitute one of the key components of critical success factors underpinning the Digital Nepal Program. The largely cross-sectoral nature of the program with its potential for transformative impacts across sectors demand a thorough analysis of policy and regulatory environment, identification of any gaps therein and re-orientation of policy instruments towards the goals and objectives of the program. It is recommended that the following policy areas be thoroughly reviewed in relation to creating an environment conducive to the success of the Digital Nepal Program: 3.1 Intellectual Property Rights policy regime The successful execution of Digital Nepal Program is expected to spur innovation leading to the growth of knowledge services industry resulting in intensified creation of digital assets. In order to ensure that digitally enabled creation of value across socio-economic spectrum remains sustained by being anchored on strong incentive regime, it is imperative to assess Nepal's IPR policy and regulatory framework in relation to the demands of the emerging digital economy. This will be particularly important from the perspective of creating an ecosystem favorable to innovation, fostering a vibrant start-up and entrepreneurship environment. 3.2 Data protection, security and privacy Expanding digital footprint emanating from the program and the extent to which all this stands to permeate social and economic interactions would invariably underscore the need for a robust framework for ensuring trust in digital interactions for all the stakeholders involved. Data protection, security and privacy constitute three crucial pillars for strengthening the overall trust regime in an emergent digital economy. It is imperative therefore that a thorough assessment of existing policy provisions on data protection, security and privacy in Nepal is carried out with a view to creating an ecosystem favorable for the uptake of digital solutions deployed through the Digital Nepal Program. 3.3 Telecommunication and broadband Connectivity will be one of the foundational pillars of the Digital Nepal Program. Even though overall connectivity footprint in Nepal is growing, thanks in part to increased competitive intensity in the sector, observations reveal that its expansion has largely remained skewed in distribution and issues across access, availability and affordability dimensions continue to remain challenging. For example, retail broadband prices continue to remain high in relation to Nepal's GNI per capita and a sizable portion of Nepal’s population is yet to enjoy the benefits of quality broadband connections including access to 4G networks. Given that one of the program's key aspirations is to take a regional lead in the 5G deployment space, it is important to assess overall policy and regulatory environment governing the telecommunication and broadband sector in Nepal, especially along spectrum governance, competition and universal service obligation dimensions. 3.4 Digital payments policy and regulations Among others, the extent to which digital enablement of financial transactions among participating entities become available and used will increasingly underpin the value that Digital Nepal Program will ultimately be able to generate across Nepal's socio-economic spectrum. Creation of a nationwide digital payments regime is one area that will need focused policy attention going forward. The need for a highly secure, interoperable and efficient digital payments system cannot be overemphasized if significant benefits are to be reaped from the digitalization of services. Among others, key questions that need to be asked in this area are a) whether or not policy and regulatory frameworks exist in the country to enable secure and interoperable digital payments regime and b) whether or not the existing policy and regulatory instruments are in sync with frenetic pace of innovation happening in digital payments domain. 153 3.5 Private sector participation The Digital Nepal Program envisages the private sector as one of its key actors. The success of the program will, to a considerable extent, be dependent upon an efficient public-private partnership arrangement in the execution of the program. Measures must be undertaken to ensure that avenues of private sector participation in the program are clearly identified. Along those lines, it will be important to review existing public procurement policies and practices with a view to lowering barriers to entry of Nepali private sector in projects implemented under the ambit of the Digital Nepal Program. The Digital Nepal Program is expected to spur domestic demand for digital services of varying nature presenting the private sector with the opportunity to grow and be competitive. The role of the private sector will remain crucial in driving innovation and entrepreneurship and providing significant value to the Nepali economy within the program framework. One of the policy areas that need to be looked into is whether there exists a favorable innovation and start-up ecosystem in Nepal. 4.0 Promote Digital inclusion Digital Nepal must be an all-inclusive program in order for it to generate far reaching outcomes and impacts that it envisages to generate. As it is, exclusion in access to digital technologies and resources has its roots in socio-economic fault lines that exist in Nepali society. This underscores the need for targeted strategies aimed at enabling the excluded and marginalized communities and individuals to participate in the emerging digital economy. Digital inclusion of individuals result in inclusion in information, process and opportunities in all areas. Thus, it can be a tool for the government to become closer to its citizens and make state deliveries more effective. It can minimize inequality and promote efficiency by providing access to basic information and services. As digital technology diversifies and grows in an unanticipated speed, the magnitude of the digital divide among the users of technology is simultaneously creating a newer status quo. It is crucial to harness the potentials of digital inclusion of the excluded and marginalized groups not only to achieve the goals of growth, equality and cooperation, but also to tackle the deep structures of exclusion. The exclusion is more critical for individuals with a disability, old age, remote residency and women restricted by social norms. Simultaneously, measures must be taken to strengthen the availability of accessible Knowledge, Information and Communication for Persons with Disabilities in alignment with the principles enshrined in The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), of which Nepal is a signatory. Among others, the program must factor in the complementarity between physical accessibility and ICT/digital accessibility and seek to formulate strategies accordingly. The focus should be on strengthening broad based digital accessibility relating to the application and integration of enhanced and technology- facilitated processes to meet the specific needs of those who are usually excluded. 154 5.0 Future proofing the mission: emerging and disruptive technologies and business models The frenetic pace of innovation happening in the digital arena stands to further deepen transformative processes in the way governments and societies function around the world in the days ahead. For example, AI, robotics and automation stand poised to fundamentally redefine job markets, productivity and economic competitiveness with profound implications for developing world economies. Similarly, IoT offers compelling prospects of game changing levels of context awareness embedded in systems that will fundamentally reshape our collective abilities to analyze and respond to events. Crypto currencies hold the potential of profoundly shaking up the financial sector where the traditional bastions of fiscal regulatory power might find themselves woefully ill-equipped to stay relevant. The emerging block chain technology offers the promise of exponentially enhanced trust perception in digital transactions while ushering in an era of smart contracts with far reaching and game changing implications. In addition, the growth in near ubiquitous connectivity is also fundamentally reshaping business models -ushering in a whole new concept of sharing economy. The strategic framework underpinning the Digital Nepal Program must factor in the role these transformative innovations will ultimately play in Nepal's digital economy space. While concrete plans need to be in place to assess the implications and challenges of these innovations and their attendant disruptive potentials, the need for strategies aimed at harnessing tremendous prospects offered by these technological innovations should attract a large share of policy attention in the days ahead. Specific programs need to be launched to promote innovations around these emerging technologies. Research capacities of universities need to be strengthened and the building of robust business incubation, innovation and start-up ecosystem must be accorded a very high strategic priority if Digital Nepal mission is to be future proofed. Equally important is the need to factor in the role that big data analytics can play in fundamentally reshaping policy making processes. 6.0 Mapping digital initiatives to all 3 tiers of government The success of digital Nepal mission will remain solely contingent on the extent to which this broad framework outlining the digital initiatives are mapped out to new political reality of Nepal – i.e., Nepal’s transition from unitary system of government to a federal one with Provincial Government and Local Level constitutionally empowered to take full charge of their socio-economic development agenda. It is imperative therefore to ensure that strategies are developed to fully on-board Provincial Government and Local Level as key pillars of mission execution and concrete follow-up measures are taken to map digital initiatives to all 3 tiers of the government. 155 Annexure I: Integrated Action Matrix Digital Foundation 156 DI-ID Digital Initiatives (DI) Programs / Projects Prio rity Indicators Assumptions Expected Outcome Time- frame Timeline (Year) Focal Agency Supporting Actors 1 2 3 4 5 01.01.01.00 Establish the Internet as an essential services P2 Broadband Internet access classified as an essential service Wide-scale political support exists for the initiative Internet becomes universally available within the country Medium -Term 1 1 1 MoCIT MoLJPA, NTA, ISPs, Telecom Operators Major Activities 01.01.01.01 Carry out policy, regulatory and legislative reforms needed to ensure that access to the Internet is established as an essential service, Internet access is broadly available and individuals are protected against unreasonable restriction on access to information and Internet and freedom of expression on Internet is protected. 1 MoCIT NTA 01.01.01.02 Review and incorporate necessary changes in the Broadband policy and other Policy documents to secure congruence with constitutional provisions on the Internet. 1 MoCIT NTA 01.01.01.03 Formulate and launch mission oriented programs to ensure universal access to the internet throughout the country in alignment with the National ICT Policy and National Broadband Policy. 1 1 MoCIT NTA 01.01.01.04 Review Universal Service Obligation (USO) provisions and market mechanism to ensure on-demand access and availability of Internet access to all desiring users throughout the country. 1 1 MoCIT NTA 01.01.01.05 Set a timeline by when the Internet as a essential service could be ensured and incorporated into the legal provisions of Nepal. 1 MoCIT House of Representatives, MoLJPA 01.01.01.06 Strengthen mechanism to ensure that proper recourse is available for consumers if they are denied QoS commitments made by the Internet and Telecom service providers. 1 NTA MoCIT, ISPs, Telecom Operators 157 DI-ID Digital Initiatives (DI) Programs / Projects Prio rity Indicators Assumptions Expected Outcome Time- frame Timeline (Year) Focal Agency Supporting Actors 1 2 3 4 5 01.01.02.00 Improve spectrum availability, management and optimization P1 Spectrum governance and allocation regime significantly improved to the satisfaction of key stakeholders - Spectrum issues continue to receive timely policy attention by MoCIT/NTA - Wide stakeholder participation in spectrum governance and allocation strategy is ensured All citizen be covered by reliable mobile broadband services Medium -Term 1 x x x x MoCIT, NTA Service Providers Major Activities 01.01.02.01 Take stock of underutilized or un-allocated radio frequency spectrum in consultation with the industry and concerned stakeholders with a view to inform policy decision on efficient spectrum regulation. 1 NTA MoCIT 01.01.02.02 Review the National Frequency Plan with a view to ensuring the availability of spectrum to service providers and its allocation in a transparent manner through market related processes.

Council           1     Executive Summary      Background   Bordering two of the world’s fastest-growing economies – India and China – Nepal has eight of the world’s   highest mountains, an abundance of natural resources, and multidimensional cultural heritage attracting   tourists globally. Despite having these enticing features, Nepal has not been able to tap its growth potential   due to prolonged political uncertainty.    That stated, Nepal has made significant progress on reforms with the adoption of a new Constitution in   2015, transitioning from a unitary to federal state, and election of a stable government. The new   government’s priorities are centered on development and targeted initiatives to realize its goal of attaining   developing nation status by 2022, and middle-income country status by 2030.   The Prime Minister of Nepal, Khadga Prasad Oli, has outlined his vision of “Prosperous Nepal, Happy   Nepali” with broad objectives to address some of the basic challenges facing the country.  Key focus areas   include:    Building capabilities to grow the country’s tourism sector    Focusing on rapid build-out of infrastructure – water, transportation, and energy    Ending absolute poverty, illiteracy, and unemployment    Providing health insurance and free health care for every citizen    Accelerating post-earthquake reconstruction efforts    Curbing the flow of young talent leaving the country    Increasing farming productivity      Digital Journey   Nepal has enjoyed incredible success in digital adoption compared to its neighbors, with mobile penetration   exceeding 100% and Internet penetration reaching 63%. According to the NTA, there was an addition of   2.25 million new Internet users in 2017 alone, translating into approximately 250 new Internet users every   hour.   Nepal is expected to lead Internet penetration by 2025 in comparison to major economies such as China   and India, given its growth trend over the next few years. The growing popularity of social media is a crucial   driver for Internet adoption in Nepal, coming second only to Bhutan in South Asia in social media   penetration. As at January 2018, Nepal has nearly 9.3 million Facebook users. Entertainment and video   sharing are other popular use cases with more than 6.4 million registered users on YouTube.        What is Digital Nepal?  The early success with Internet and mobile provide the impetus for Nepal to leverage the potential of digital   technologies to drive accelerated growth.               2     The Digital Nepal Framework is a blueprint that provides a roadmap to how digital initiatives can:   ● Contribute to economic growth   ● Find innovative ways to solve major challenges facing society in a shorter period with fewer   resources   ● Identify opportunities for Nepal to participate in the global economy   The digital initiatives have been selected based on:    ● Alignment with the vision of Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali   ● Demonstrated success in other similar developing markets   ● Ability to execute in the local environment   The Digital Nepal Framework encompasses:   ● One Nation   ● Eight Sectors   ● 80 Digital Initiatives      The Digital Nepal program is designed to enable Nepal to harness its growth potential   by leveraging disruptive technologies and driving socioeconomic growth. The program   is expected to deliver an impact of up to NPR 800 billion by 2022                   3     Methodology   Digital Nepal program is designed with six steps strategic methodology. The methodology gives the path   from development of Digital Nepal framework document, implementation and continuous engagement   of stakeholder to implement the vision of integrating ICT into Nepal’s development.            Eight Sectors and Eighty Digital Initiatives   Under the Digital Nepal framework, eight sectors – digital foundation, agriculture, health, education, energy,   tourism, finance and urban infrastructure – have been identified based on close engagement with   stakeholders.       Eighty digital initiatives are identified which aims to propel socioeconomic growth in Nepal by addressing   crucial challenges while unlocking the growth potential in each of the eight key sectors. All identified 80        4     digital initiatives are discussed with all concerned stakeholders in workshops and feedback process   setup by MoCIT.

The Government of Nepal needs to focus on the following priority areas to create an enabling environment   for the success of Digital Nepal initiatives:   Technology and Infrastructure Entrepreneurship/PPP  Talent and Skills   Development   Digital connectivity needs to   be a key priority. Possible   actions include:   ● Make Internet access a   fundamental right for every   citizen   ● Improve the availability of   spectrum to the operators to   enhance service coverage   and quality   ● Take leadership in driving 5G   adoption in South Asia   ● Establish a nationwide fiber   network   Encourage private sector   participation. Possible actions   include:   ● Digitally streamline PPP   application system to   mobilize private investment   ● Tax holidays and incentives   for investment in Digital   Nepal program   ● Startup accelerator program   to build a strong ecosystem   for nurturing innovation and   entrepreneurship   Improve digital education.   Possible actions include:   ● Compulsory IT education in   schools and colleges   ● Increase the education   system’s capacity to impart   advanced ICT education   ● ICT literacy programs for   rural communities and   underprivileged Nepalese   ● Ongoing communication and   celebration of digital stories   of success   Facilitate the development of a   robust financial ecosystem.   Possible actions include:   ● Encourage digital payments   ● Attract investments in fintech   by encouraging the growth of   startups and telecom   companies to offer services to   drive financial inclusion   Encourage foreign direct   investment in priority areas.   Possible actions include:   ● Fast-track FDI applications   for Digital Nepal initiatives   ● 100% FDI and easier   repatriation of funds for   Digital Nepal initiatives   Making public servants   digitally-ready will be   essential. Possible actions   include   ● Digital skills training for   public sector employees           6     Nepal in Context      Background   Bordering two of the world’s fastest-growing economies – India and China – Nepal has eight of the world’s   highest mountains, an abundance of natural resources (mainly fresh water), and multidimensional cultural   heritage attracting tourists globally. Despite these enticing features, Nepal has not been able to tap into its   growth potential due to prolonged political uncertainty, trade disruptions, and natural disasters (such as the   twin earthquakes in 2015 and floods in 2017). Political instability had become a part of life for Nepali   citizens, with the country changing its government up to 20 times since the introduction of democracy in   1990.1   That stated, Nepal has made significant progress on reforms with the adoption of a new Constitution in   2015, transitioning from a unitary to federal state, and election of a stable government.    ● The country’s first-ever Local level elections for state assemblies and the Federal Parliament in   2017 marked a crucial and decisive move toward federalism and political stability.    ● The new Constitution aims to turn around the economic and political situation, ensure double-digit   economic growth over the next 10 years,2 create an inclusive, pluralistic democracy, and mixed-  market economy.    ● One of the key goals of the government is to graduate from its Least Developed Country (LDC)   status by 2022 to become a middle-income economy by 2030.3 As such, the government has   implemented several long-run policies and programs centered on the UN’s Sustainable   Development Goals (SDGs).       Macroeconomic Environment   Nepal registered a steady GDP growth of 5% from 2010–2015. However, the massive earthquake of April   2015 significantly impacted the country’s economic development and GDP growth in FY 2015/16, dropping   to 0.6%.                                                               1  UNESCO   2  Constitution of Nepal, 2015   3  Envisioning Nepal 2030/ National Planning Commission, 2017        7     ● In 2016–2017, growth picked up significantly to 7.5%, driven by a good harvest, significant foreign   aid, normalization of trade activities, and improved electricity supply management. In 2017, Nepal   was ranked the third fastest growing economy in the world in terms of GDP growth.4   ● Moving forward, growth is likely to normalize to pre-earthquake levels at approximately 5.3%,   sustained by increased spending in infrastructure reconstruction and development. However, this   could be offset by a slowdown in remittance inflow due to a decline in the number of outgoing   migrants.      GDP (US$ billion) and GDP Growth (%), at Constant Prices, Nepal, 2013/14–2021/22F      Note: F indicates forecasts    Source: Nepal's Macro Environment and Key Industry Prospects, 2017–2022       Nepal is considered one of the least developed countries in the world with low per capita income. Its low   economic growth rates compared to other countries in the region is a cause for concern as well.        *Based on Atlas Method; Source: Basic Statistics 2018, Asian   Development Bank (ADB)      Source: World Development Indicators, World Bank                                                                              4  World Economic Forum        8     Criteria for Graduation from LDC Category   The graduation threshold for any two of the following three graduation criteria must be met over two   consecutive triennial reviews for graduation from LDC status:   Graduation Criteria Nepal Progress vs. Criteria   Per capita income  GNI per capita >US$ 1,242    (three-year average)  US$ 753 (avg. 2015–2017)*   Human assets Human Assets Index (HAI) >66 68.7 (2015)   Economic vulnerability  Economic Vulnerability Index (EVI)   <32  26.2 (2015)   Source: UN Committee for Development Policy; *GNI per capita, Atlas method (current US$)   While Nepal’s Gross National Income (GNI) per capita is well below the threshold for graduation out   of the LDC category, the country’s significant progress in human asset- and economic vulnerability-  related KPIs have made it eligible for graduation from LDC.     However, Nepal has decided not to rely on the non-income criteria framed by the United Nations to   graduate from the LDC category, fearing that such a transition would reduce the flow of foreign aid   and deprive the country of other international support measures.       The expected economic growth rate of 5%–6% is unlikely to help Nepal to achieve its objectives of:    Meeting income criteria for graduation from the LDC category by 2022    Becoming a middle-income country by 2030   To realize its aspiration to become a middle-income country by 2030, Nepal will require substantial   infrastructure development alongside a consistent growth rate of 8% to 10% annually.      Maintaining a GDP growth rate of 8% to 10% will require broad-based   growth spanning infrastructure development, supporting policies, fiscal   reforms, and greater foreign participation      Agriculture remains the mainstay of the Nepali economy, accounting for the largest share of total value-  add at ~32.1%.   ● Future growth is projected to be led by the reconstruction of damaged irrigation facilities and   sufficient agricultural supplies. However, unseasonal rainfall in August 2017 that resulted in severe   flooding and landslides, and affected paddy production has created significant food shortages   which may slowdown sector growth.   Trade, transport, and construction are other sectors experiencing strong momentum in Nepal.    ● Wholesale and retail trade and transport sectors have picked up with the normalization of trade   activities and are expected to grow further in the import-driven economy.   ● Construction sector growth in 2017–2018 is expected to be boosted by continued momentum in   post-earthquake reconstruction and large infrastructure projects.        9        GDP by Industry (%), Nepal, 2017–2018      Source: Nepal's Macro Environment and Key Industry Prospects, 2017–2022      Foreign Direct Investment   The Government of Nepal has taken several steps in recent years to encourage foreign direct investment   (FDI) in the country. It issued the new Foreign Investment and One-Window Policy 2015, replacing the   Foreign Investment and One-Window Policy 1992, and organized the Nepal Investment Summit 2017 with   the objective of attracting FDI.      Source: Nepal Rastra Bank   As a result of these efforts, FDI in Nepal grew by an astounding 128% to reach NPR 13.5 billion in 2017.5   However, Nepal has not been able to harness the full potential of FDI investments with net FDI contribution   at only 0.8% of GDP.6 To optimize FDI investments, the Government of Nepal should continue its efforts   to attract foreign investors to bridge funding gaps in targeted sectors, and enable technology transfer and   sharing of best practices from other economies.                                                                          5 Nepal Rastra Bank  6 World Bank        10     Inflation Rate   Following significant volatility in the past five years, the inflation rate in Nepal had stabilized, reaching a   13-year low in 2017, aided by declining food prices and moderation in the cost of non-food items. In 2018,   the inflation rate reported a marginal spike due to a sharp rise in vegetable prices; going forward, it is   forecast to remain at 5%.    In recent months, strong trade linkages with India have resulted in Nepal’s inflation trend mimicking that of   India.        Source: Nepal's Macro Environment and Key Industry Prospects, 2017–2022      Population   High population growth in Nepal has long been regarded as one of the critical challenges inhibiting   economic growth. The country’s population almost doubled between 1960 and 1990. However, the   expansion of mass education, rising economic opportunities, urbanization, growth in female labor force   participation, and delayed marriages are leading to declines in fertility rates and slowing population growth.

This is primarily due to socioeconomic conditions where almost 80% of Nepal’s   population lives in rural areas, have large families, very small landholdings, and lack access to primary   healthcare, education, safe drinking water, sanitation, and other necessities.    The earthquake in 2015 that caused widespread devastation coupled with high dependence on agriculture   and geographical issues such as rugged terrain, lack of rainfall, and poor soil quality has further        11     exacerbated the situation. Huge disparities and inequalities continue to exist between regions and   underprivileged social groups.   Despite the dismal situation, Nepal has gained significant ground in alleviating poverty in the past five   years, primarily due to high amounts of remittances from Nepalese who have migrated overseas; Nepal   has among the highest foreign remittances in the world at US$6.6 billion, equivalent to 31.3% of the   country’s GDP in 2016.7      Poverty Statistics, Nepal   Metrics 1995/96 2003/04 2010/11   Population living below international poverty line (US$1.90 a day) 61.9% 46.1% 15.0%   Population living below international poverty line (US$3.10 a day) 86.6% 75.5% 50.8%   Population living below national poverty line 41.8% 30.9% 25.2%      Source: World Bank; Nepal Central Bureau of Statistics       Literacy Rate   Nepal has made remarkable progress in   improving its education system, increasing net   primary school enrolment rates from 68.0% to   94.7% from 1991–2017.8 Government efforts   such as the School Sector Development   Program (SSDP) and ICT implementation   through Open Learning Exchange (OLE) Nepal   and Open IDEO programs have closed the   gender and age gaps in education considerably   – one in five elderly people are able to read and   write.   However, with an adult literacy rate of ~59.6%,   Nepal continues to rank the lowest among key South   Asian countries, as the majority of youth still struggle to   gain access to education, particularly at the secondary and tertiary levels. To overcome this, the   government needs to devise better incentives and monitoring mechanisms to ensure the efficient   implementation of its various programs.                                                                  7  Pew Research Center and World Bank, 2017   8  UNESCO   Source: World Bank        12     Literacy Rate (%)*, Nepal vs Selected Asian   Countries9   Enrolment Ratio (%), Nepal vs Selected Asian   Countries, 201610   *Latest available census data in the country      High Rural Population   Despite rapid urbanization in recent years, Nepal remains one of the least urbanized countries in the world.   The World Bank estimates that only one-fifth of the Nepali population lives in urban areas, while more than   80% of the population resides in rural areas.          Source: World Bank   Most infrastructure and socioeconomic development in Nepal are centered in a few large cities, while   people in remote rural areas continue to struggle with poor infrastructure and limited access to basic   services such as healthcare, education, and financial services. As a result, Nepal trails its South Asian   peers in economic growth and SDGs with high poverty and low adult literacy rates. Nepal needs to adopt   a holistic approach to investing in its socioeconomic growth aspirations. It is important for the Government   of Nepal to focus on extending the reach of its services and development agenda to rural areas to drive   inclusive growth and achieve its vision of “Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepali”.                                                                      9  Data for the Sustainable Development Goals by Country, UNESCO Institute for Statistics    10  Data for the Sustainable Development Goals by Country, UNESCO Institute for Statistics        13     State of Digital Adoption in Nepal      Policy and Regulatory Foundation for Digital Nepal     A number of policy and regulatory frameworks governing the ICT sector provide a basic foundation   for the Digital Nepal framework. For example, the National ICT Policy introduced in 2015 seeks to   enhance the vision of transforming Nepali society into knowledge and information based society by   harnessing rapid advances in the ICT sector. Similarly, the National Broadband Policy announced in   2016 puts forth a framework for stimulating broadband access and availability across the country.   Among others, policy emphasis that has been placed on effectively leveraging Universal Service   Access Funds as a means of bridging digital divide will provide a strong mechanism for expanding   broadband access to communities beyond urban areas if implemented effectively.   While effective implementation of these policy instruments can substantially complement Digital   Nepal Program, it will be important to understand the role of a holistic policy regime that transcends   ICT domain. For example, there could be a need to revisit investment and trade policies to secure   large scale private sector participation in various sectors within the digital economy such as   (ecommerce, sharing economy and IT enabled services). Similarly, it will be important to carry out   broad based policy gap analysis so as to ensure that Digital Nepal Program is grounded on sound   policy frameworks.   In addition to a number of policy and regulatory frameworks including the National ICT Policy,   National Broadband Policy and Electronic Transaction Act, the government has also developed the   Government Enterprise Architecture (GEA) and Nepal e-Governance Interoperability Framework   (NeGIF) which mark some of the foundational initiatives for enabling roll-out of citizen centric digital   services and systems that are interoperable and provide a framework for seamless integration.    These frameworks do have applicability beyond the realm of centralized roll-out of digitally enabled   government services and could easily be adapted to provincial and Local level settings reflecting new   political reality of the federal system of governance. In addition, the Government Websites   Design/Development and Management Guidelines published in 2068 could also help ensure   standardization in the way contents for public consumption are presented by government agencies.    The Digital Nepal initiative must assess and evaluate these frameworks and the supporting   government endorsed guidelines concerning automation and digitalization of government services   and suggest improvements if necessary.              14        Mobile-first Economy   In the past, the expansion of telecommunication infrastructure in Nepal was restricted due to multiple   challenges including difficult topography, adverse economic conditions, and political instability. In the past   decade, however, the country has seen notable improvements in the telecommunication landscape driven   by investments from leading mobile network operators Telecom and Ncell.    Like many other Asian countries, the mobile services industry in Nepal has recorded remarkable growth in   the past four to five years. Mobile penetration increased exponentially to 113% in 2017 from 21% in 2009,11   with the robust growth expected to sustain in the next five years.

Website development,   social media marketing, content management, web design, and e-mail marketing have become one of the   fastest modes of disseminating information.       E-commerce Set to Flourish   As at May 2017, there are more than 56,286 registered websites in Nepal, including 40,000 commercial   websites.15 Many businesses and organizations leverage digital marketing to enhance their online   presence and promote their business globally.    The growth of e-commerce in Nepal is inhibited due to the lack of a supporting ecosystem such as limited   digital payment options. However, this is changing with the emergence of fintech start-ups such as eSewa   and Khalti which are expected to disrupt the payments landscape.      Digital to Unlock Potential for Nepal   Digital adoption in Nepal is higher than ever with near-universal mobile adoption and almost 60% Internet   penetration. While Nepalese are adopting Internet-based services at a rapid pace, case studies for   adoption in the public sector and enterprises are scarce. Nepal lacks a support ecosystem such as digital                                                               12 Nepal’s ICT Development and Broadband Policy, 2015  13 Hootsuite  14 Social Blade  15 Nepal Country Commercial Guide, Export.gov         17     payments and online banking which are critical for the development of a digital society. As a result, Nepali   society has not been able to reap the full benefits of the ongoing digital revolution.   Emerging business models and disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and the   Internet of things (IoT) are transforming the way work is done. These digital technologies are allowing   governments and enterprises globally to unlock the potential to achieve exponential growth.      Digital as a Catalyst for Exponential Accelerated Growth         There are strong linkages between digital adoption and GDP growth. According to a World Bank report,   every 10% increase in Internet penetration in a country results in incremental economic growth of 1.3%.16   The impact is more pronounced once the penetration reaches critical mass.      Source: World Bank; International Telecommunication Union (ITU); Nepal Telecommunications Authority   Nepal needs to expand at a significantly higher rate (8%–10%) than current projections (~5%) to have a   realistic chance of meeting the income criteria for elevation from the LDC category by 2022 and becoming   a middle-income country by 2030. Disruptive digital technologies have the potential to enable Nepal to fast-  track its socioeconomic growth. The Digital Nepal framework intends to guide Nepal in identifying critical   digital initiatives that can allow it to meet its growth potential.                                                                  16 Exploring the Relationship Between Broadband and Economic Growth, World Bank, 2016        18     By leveraging disruptive technologies to drive socioeconomic growth, the   Digital Nepal program will allow Nepal to unlock its growth potential and   become a developing country by 2022 and a middle-income nation by 2030.                       19     Some of the digital initiatives undertaken by the Government of Nepal   Digital Foundation   Digital Signature   Stakeholders: MoCIT, OCC   Optical Fiber Networking   Stakeholders: MoCIT, NTA, Telecom Companies   Different types of Internet technology (VSAT)   Stakeholders: MoCIT, NTA   Virtual Private Network (VPN) Connections   Stakeholders: MoCIT, NDCL   Nepal Vital Registration   Stakeholders: MoFAGA, MoHA    Supported by: World Bank   Cyber security and Data Center   Stakeholders: MoHA, MoCIT, NITC, NP   Supported by: KOICA   Supply, delivery, installation & testing microwave radio for mid hill   Stakeholders: MoCIT, NTC   Agriculture   Call centers for supporting farmers (Kisan Call Centers)   Stakeholders: MoFAGA, MoCIT NITC, NTA   Mobile apps: Support Farmers on plant health and other agriculture related news and alerts   Stakeholders: MoALD, MoCIT, NITC   Agriculture Atlas of Nepal   Stakeholders: MoALD, ICIMOD   Supported by: ICIMOD   Pilot Program of Climate Resilience: Agriculture Management Information System   Stakeholders: World Bank, MoALD   Land Usage Monitoring and Analysis   Stakeholders: MoALD, MoLCPA    Use of GIS and remote sensing along with the use of ICT   Stakeholders: MoALD, MoLCPA    Land use zoning maps based on soil quality and crop suitability   Stakeholders: MoALD and MoLCPA    National Geographic Information Infrastructure   Stakeholders: MoLCPA, Survey Department   Management information system of tea and coffee sub-sector of Nepal   Stakeholders: National Tea and Coffee Development Board   Supported by: European Union        20     Digital training method to framers for pesticides analysis   Stakeholders: MoALD   Mobile application on tomato and kausi kheti (house terrace farming)   Stakeholders: Vegetable Crops Development Centre, MoALD   Supported by: ICT in Agriculture Nepal, UNDP   NARC Krishi application launched by Nepal Agriculture Research Council   Stakeholders: MoALD   Proper price tracking system   Stakeholders: MoALD, NDCL   Food and Safety (Pesticide Tracking)   Stakeholders: MoALD, DFTQC   Online Seedling Order System   Stakeholders: Vegetable Crops Development Centre   Land Record Information Management System (LRIMS)   Stakeholders: MoLCPA, DoLMA   Supported by: GoN, ADB   National Geoportal   Stakeholders: MoLCPA, MoFE, DoR, DoMG   Bhumi Sushaasan Application   Stakeholders: MoLCPA   Digitization of Land Parcels   Stakeholders: DoLIA   Scanning of Field book and Plot Register   Stakeholders: DoLIA   Application for calculation registration fee and capital gains tax   Stakeholders: DoLIA   Spatial Application Extension Software    Stakeholders: DoLIA   Parcel Editor software   Stakeholders: Cadastral survey division, Survey department   Health   E-Childcare   Stakeholders: MoHP   ELMI's- Electronic Logistics Management Information System   Stakeholders: DoHS   HMIS-Health Management Information System   Stakeholders: DoHS   Early Warning and Reporting System   Stakeholders: Epidemiology and Disease Control Division   Health Infrastructure Information System   Stakeholders: DoHS        21     DHIS2 Tracker   Stakeholders: DoHS   SMS Messaging   Stakeholders: National Health Education Information Communication Centre   Mobile Health   Stakeholders: MoHP, Family welfare division   MDIS-Malaria and Disease Information System   Stakeholders: Epidemiology and disease control division created by EKbana   Telemedicine   Stakeholders: Patan Hospital   Education   GPS Mapping is in practice since 2070–2071   Stakeholders: MoEST   Energy   Energy Consumption pricing (Smart Pricing according to usage of the electricity)   Stakeholders: NEA, ETFC   Smart Licensing   Stakeholders: NEA   GIS Smart Grid   Stakeholders: NEA, NTGA   Tourism   Reliable Tourism Information System   Stakeholders: MoCTCA, Tourism Board Nepal   TIMs Card Chip (Trekker’s Information Management system)   Stakeholders: MoCTCA, Tourism Board Nepal, TAAN   Finance   National Payment Gateway   Stakeholders: MoF, MoCIT, NITC, NRB   Secure Payment System (Reduce cost of financial transfer/ withdrawal from any ATM's   should be free of cost).

The   Government of Nepal needs to undertake initiatives for driving digital adoption and facilitating the   establishment of a reliable ICT infrastructure through PPPs.   Digital Connectivity Needs to be a Key Priority   Digital connectivity in Nepal has improved considerably in the past few years due to the rapid adoption of   mobile Internet. However, it continues to lag behind its neighbors and developed economies in the overall   development of the ICT sector.   As a result, strengthening digital connectivity needs to be a key priority for the Government of Nepal. In   coordination with MoCIT and in consultation with other concerned stakeholders following actions are   identified to improve digital connectivity:   ● Make Internet access a fundamental right for every citizen   ● Improve availability of spectrum to operators to enhance service coverage and quality         24     ● Take leadership in driving 5G adoption in South Asia    ● Establish a nationwide fiber network     Facilitate Development of a Robust Financial Ecosystem   Digital payments and financial transactions conducted through smartphones and mobile devices are now   a vital cog in modern financial infrastructure. A strong digital finance ecosystem can facilitate the evolution   of new business models and digital start-ups, generating new job opportunities and enabling faster   economic growth. Digital financial services also have the potential to encourage financial inclusion by   allowing previously unbanked population access to these services.   Nepal has an underdeveloped financial ecosystem with low penetration of digital financial services. As a   result, facilitating the development of a robust financial ecosystem needs to be a priority of the government.   Possible actions in this direction include:   ● Promoting digital payments    ● Attracting investments in fintech by encouraging the growth of start-ups and telecom companies that   offer services to drive financial inclusion    Entrepreneurship/PPP   The Digital Nepal program would require significant investments, which the government alone cannot   provide. Public-private partnerships and foreign investments need to play a major role in Digital Nepal by   bringing technological expertise and capital infusion for sustainability and scalability of the program.   The government should initiate necessary policy interventions to encourage private sector participation in   the Digital Nepal program. It could consider taking the following steps to improve the ease of doing business   in priority areas:   Private Sector Participation   Possible actions include:   ● Rolling out a digitally streamlined PPP application system for mobilizing private investment in Digital   Nepal    ● Offering tax holidays for investments in critical areas (e.g., companies focusing on Smart Health in   remote rural areas can be given a three-year tax holiday)    ● Providing a startup accelerator program to build a strong ecosystem for nurturing innovation and   entrepreneurship in tackling key challenges and generating large-scale job opportunities   Foreign Investments   Foreign investment can help Nepal leverage skills and insights from similar initiatives undertaken by foreign   investors in other parts of the world. Possible actions to attract foreign investments include:      ● Fast-tracking FDI applications for Digital Nepal initiatives through a single window system   ● Increasing FDI limits and easier repatriation of funds (e.g., 100% FDI for Digital Nepal initiatives)   Talent and Skills Development    Digital Nepal program aims to open up opportunities for socioeconomic growth by addressing challenges   in various sectors and enabling Nepal to enter an era of high economic growth. Investment in enhancing   the digital skills of the Nepalese is critical to reap the real benefits of the Digital Nepal program. Possible   actions include:   ● Investing in digital education   ● Training public servants in digital skills         25     Improve Digital Education   The Government of Nepal should consider the following efforts to enhance the digital skills of the   Nepalese:      ● Compulsory IT education for schools and colleges   ● Geospatial/GIS education for schools and colleges   ● Systematically strengthen Nepal’s education system’s capacity to impart advanced ICT   education   ● ICT literacy programs aimed at combating digital exclusion in rural communities and   underprivileged Nepalese   Digital Skills Training of Public Servants   Making public servants digitally ready is essential to the success of the Digital Nepal program. The   government should ensure the establishment of IT training teams in all government agencies to impart   digital training for its staff. It can also consider leveraging the proposed National eLearning Platform to train   its employees on new systems and technologies introduced in their respective departments.               26     Digital Nepal Framework: 1 – 8 – 80   Vision    Digital based Social economic prosperity   Mission    To harness digital technologies as a catalyst to positively transform government, society and   economy    Objectives    To strengthen the foundation for a knowledge-based society and digital economy    To provide a framework for action aimed at leveraging digital technologies to achieve   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)   Under the Digital Nepal framework, eight sectors – digital foundation, agriculture, health, education,   energy, tourism, finance and urban infrastructure – have been identified based on close engagement with   stakeholders. The framework aims to guide Nepal on its journey toward becoming a digital state.       Digital Foundation: Digital foundation is the foundation of the Digital Nepal program. While Internet   penetration in Nepal has risen sharply in the past few years, a large section of Nepalese remains digitally   uninitiated due to concerns around affordability, access, and digital illiteracy. The program intends to bridge   this gap by providing broader access to connectivity using public-private partnerships and government   initiatives.    Agriculture: Digital Nepal initiatives in the agriculture sector encompass technological solutions aimed at   maximizing yield and minimizing agricultural input. The use of agritech solutions is anticipated to boost   farm productivity and sustainability to meet growing food consumption, and in turn, increase farmers’   incomes.        27     Health: Digital Nepal initiatives in health aim to assist the country in meeting its objectives of providing   quality basic healthcare to all citizens. The program intends to leverage digital technologies (e.g.,   videoconferencing, e-learning, and mobile health) to address issues relating to access, affordability, and   quality of healthcare for the Nepalese.   Education: Digital Nepal initiatives in education aim to prepare human capital to capture new economic   opportunities through the creation of an enhanced teaching and learning environment. This entails the use   of digital technologies to support teaching, enrich the learning experience, and improve educational   outcomes.   Energy: Digital initiatives in the energy sector aim to create a sustainable energy infrastructure to not only   reduce costs but also reinforce energy networks. Smart solutions include customer-centric solutions, smart   transmissions, and distribution networks, with interconnectivity playing an important role.     Tourism: Digital initiatives in the tourism sector seek to promote Nepal globally, attract visitors to the   country, and create employment opportunities for the Nepalese. It involves the use of omnichannel   marketing solutions, e-commerce, and disruptive technologies such as augmented reality to promote   tourism, build human capital skills in the tourism sector, and offer better tourist experiences.   Finance: Digital Nepal initiatives in promoting the financial services sector target the sizeable unbanked   population by leveraging digital technology and telecoms infrastructure. Given the strong linkages between   financial inclusion and economic prosperity, Nepal is poised to benefit considerably from the use of fintech,   broadening access to financial services to nearly 55% of the country’s unbanked population.      Urban Infrastructure: Digital Nepal initiatives in urban infrastructure aim to leverage disruptive   technologies to improve the quality of life in Nepal’s urban cities by improving essential services, such as   water management, solid waste management, public transport, and traffic management.      Eighty digital initiatives are identified across eight critical sectors to guide Nepal as it   embarks on its digital transformation journey. The 80 digital initiatives aims to propel   socioeconomic growth in Nepal by addressing crucial challenges while unlocking the   growth potential in each of the eight key sectors.   1 Country – 8 Sectors – 80 Digital Initiatives          28     GDP Impact of US$8 billion   It is estimated the complete impact of Digital Nepal initiatives to the tune of US$8 billion (NPR800 billion)   upon complete implementation of programs across different sectors. The estimation is arrived on after   analysis of following key points-     Capital investment in ICT has been a key driver of global growth   World Bank study indicates that ICT has been a major growth driver across different economies   globally during the period of 1995-2014. The impact of ICT in terms of capital infusion has been   more profound in developed economies, where it averaged 27%, compares to developing   economies averaging 14%. During the same period, it was also observed that developed   economies spent close to 10% of capital on labor quality compared to developing economies   spending 3% only.17    Government spending on ICT project roll-out and maintenance   Capital infusion in form of government funding across different programs which is estimated to be   over US$300 million for a period of 10 years. The capital investment is expected to drive the   economic growth with help of telecom market. Potential points of investment are tenders for   equipment and infrastructure roll-out, maintenance, skilling and re-skilling and revenue stream. E.g.   Nepal has launched a US$35.5 million worth project to increase broadband connectivity in hilly and   rural areas. Similar projects in future can improve direct and indirect employment.18    E-Governance and Cost Savings   Government is often the leading ICT beneficiary in a developing or low-income economy. Some of   the important areas have been e-governance, revenue streamlining, education and healthcare.   Health care alone can help the government save up to 20% with use of telemedicine and remote   consultations19. E-governance across developing economies such as India has helped government   reach remote areas and streamlined processes across every aspect, reducing the cost of delay and   inefficiency.     Job creation and skill development   ICT infrastructure and internet-based economy has the potential to boost the Nepal job-market   across different verticals. Telecom and e-commerce are already proving to be early job facilitator   across different levels.  Nepal’s e-commerce sector is valued close to US$30 million, which is   experiencing growth at over 40% per annum. Nepal’s e-commerce revenue by 2023 is expected to   cross US$192 million annually at current growth rates.20 Telecom sector is another major employer,   which has the potential to growth Nepal’s job market in form of skilled workforce requirement for   technical work, installation, maintenance. Growth across internet and ICT based verticals will   enable a larger IT-BPO sector in Nepal. A shift to service economy has the potential to add another   US$4.0 billion in the fifth year of implementation, with potential cumulative impact of close to   US$10.5 billion across 5-years.                                                                  17 Accelerating Growth, World Development Report 2016  18 http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2018-10-11/digital-2020.html   19 Broadband: A Platform for Progress, Broadband Commission 2011  20 http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2018-04-17/nepals-employment-rate-highest-in-south- asia.html         29         ICT as Enabler in Agriculture   Nepal’s agricultural sector can benefit from early stage of ICT adoption in form of inclusive programs   and community-based projects. Getting the commodity markets online can help farmers track prices   in real-time, enabling better price for yield. Similarly, community centers with internet and media   connection can help modern agricultural methods reach rural and hilly areas via tele-conferencing.   Using common platforms for selling yield can help reduce distribution costs. There are similar   inclusive technologies in place in Africa, India and Bangladesh which have enabled farmers to attain   better yields and prices.    Capital Deepening   Major investment and growth in ICT technologies has been observed to lead subsequent increase   in workforce efficiency and lower equipment cost, resulting in overall capital savings in in long-run.   This results in greater savings for further investment in other business or socio-economic areas.21         Investment for Digital Nepal   Digital Nepal project will require a large-scale investment with an aggressive plan to achieve the desired   benefits. World Bank mentions 10% increase in penetration of broadband to have impact of 1.19% on   high-income economies and 1.35% on low- and middle-income economies. Similarly, a 10% increase   in penetration of mobile devices is expected to have an impact of 0.21% and 0.40% for high-income   and low- and middle-income economies respectively. Nepal’s current internet penetration at close to   60% is mostly 2G based, which needs to be replaced with 3G/4G and broadband fixed line connection   in order to harness the benefits. Analysis of select economies estimates the required direct investment   from Government to be close around US$350 million over 10 years.22   The investment in next 5-years could be on higher proportion to facilitate the rapid build-up of basic   infrastructure in form of fiber cables, telecom set-up, skilling and re-skilling, R&D, industry development,   inclusion of rural areas into IT network and implementation of e-governance programs.

The main focus and responsibility for government would be to expand the infrastructure   outside the urban centers, as private players may find it economically unviable due to longer gestation   period.   Digital Nepal and Employment Opportunities   ICT infrastructure and internet-based economy will boost Nepal’s job market across different verticals.   Some of the fast-growing verticals directly impacted by ICT in Nepali economy are e-Commerce,   telecom, IT-BPO, banking and finance. Digital Nepal project is expected to help grow Nepal’s GDP by   3.2% at the end of initial implementation period.   Telecom and e-commerce are already proving to be early job facilitator across different levels. This is   likely to be driven by:      Growth of Service sector   Internet economy can boost the employment opportunities in service sector and hence, increase   the GDP contribution per capita labor employed. Countries like India, Malaysia, Vietnam,   Philippines have experienced exponential growth with help of service sector. In Nepal, per capita   service sector contribution to GDP is more than seven-times compared to agriculture23. E-  commerce studies in India and China have highlighted that for each direct job created, there are   three jobs created in allied and indirect form.24 Nepal’s service economy can potentially absorb   close to 1.3 million additional workforce in 5 years, most of which would be diverted from agriculture.       MSMEs leveraging ICT and internet technology    ICT evolution has been a major factor in equalizing the playing-field for smaller businesses and   entrepreneurs. It has substantially lowered the entry-barriers compared to conventional business   models, while providing a larger market audience. This                                                                23 World Bank Data, 2017  24 Impact of e-commerce on employment in India, Dec 2016, KPMG    4.90 4.96 5.02 5.09 5.12 5.22  4.90 5.42  5.74 6.07  6.40 6.48  0.00 0.46 0.71 0.98  1.28 1.26  0  1000  2000  3000  4000  5000  6000  0.00  1.00  2.00  3.00  4.00  5.00  6.00  7.00  2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023  G D  P  I  m p  a ct   ,  U  S $   m il  li o  n  N u  m b  e r   o f   jo b  s.  i  n  m  il li  o n  Employment Growth in Services- GDP Impact  Employment in Service  Emloyment in Services with Digital Nepal  Additional Jobs ( in mn)  Additional GDP Contribution (in US$ million)       31      E-commerce   Growth in online market sellers is expected to contribute the Nepalese economy in big way. Nepal’s   e-commerce industry is value at US$30 million and is expected to grow at more than 41%. The   number of online sellers and platforms connecting to e-commerce is growing exponentially. The   employment impact for the sector has been estimated to be 1:4, where four indirect jobs are created   for each direct job. Increase in online seller base also creates additional 12 jobs in support services   as delivery, customer service, warehousing etc.    Technology Start-ups and App ecosystem    Nepal’s startup sector is still in infancy and app ecosystem has only started to see growth in past   couple of years. With improvement in IT infrastructure, the start-up sector can enable the app   ecosystem in Nepal, which is combined with mobile-devices can unlock an entire new segment of   employment. The impact on job market has been impressive where for each job in App economy   created 2.9 jobs in direct, indirect and induced forms.     Evolution of internet and IT-BPO growth   Nepal’s IT space has about 500 companies with most of them with most of them focused on IT and   ITES. Tech start-up scene in Nepal has been around for some time but has failed to catch up. The   sector has started to grow with more focus from government and boost in the IT infrastructure. IT-  BPO can be catalyst to Nepal’s tech-based job creation on the lines of neighboring India, Philippines   and Vietnam while adding to services sector.     Strengthening of innovation Ecosystem   Internet and ICT are considered as key enablers for innovation and R&D in modern times, helping   to bring together isolated wells of disruption. Homegrown innovation ecosystem is the key to   attracting foreign investment and also enabling disruptive growth across key sectors as banking,   finance, inclusive innovation, agriculture, skill development education, while creating new   employment opportunities in process.    Industry and Construction    With increase in telecommunication infrastructure deployment, direct job markets across   construction and engineering will see growth. The nature of jobs is expected to be a mix of skilled   blue collared jobs and white collar jobs. Additional employment opportunities in field of support   activities as logistics and supply would also emerge. Domestic telecom and ICT industry will see   job creation in form of maintenance and sales of hardware. Further development of infrastructure   can encourage domestic manufacturing      Caveat   The mentioned growth figures in the report are estimates based in specific assumption on condition of   current state of economy, future policy direction, governance efficiency and other independent market   factors that can influence economic conditions. The goals are achievable when simultaneous changes   can be brought about in governance pattern and decision-making.   Nepal’s ICT sector has been a key victim of lack of proper project implantation and slow utilization of   project funds. There are also challenges with physical infrastructure in terms of roads and rails, which   can prove to be hindrance. With expects simultaneous efforts in the direction of overcoming these   challenges to gain optimal benefit out of Digital Nepal project.        32     Appendix    Current Position of Nepal   Growing popularity of social media and online communication platforms using smart phones has played   important role in rising penetration of internet across Nepal. Internet penetration in Nepal stood at 57%   in 2017, higher than South Asian average of 36%. Mobile connectivity in Nepal stood at 125% of the   population, which is higher than the regional average of 91%, which includes India at 90% of the   population. However less than 1/3rd of mobile connections in Nepal are 3G/4G which limits the user   usage and experience with mobile internet.

Internet maturity across developed economies was observed to have   contributed to an increase in real GDP by US$500 per capita on an average during 15-year study. The   graph below shows the rate of internet penetration vs the per capita income of economies. Here the   gap between Nepal’s current and potential per capita income can be observed relative to that of China,   Philippines and Mexico.       Source: World Bank; International Telecommunication Union (ITU); Nepal Telecom Authority      Though Nepal has as a high internet penetration, per capita income remains low compared to most of   its peers. The internet penetration in Nepal is primarily driven by 2G networks, accounting for 2/3rd of   the connection, while broadband connectivity including mobile and fixed remains below 30%. The   broadband services are dominated by mobile broadband which accounts for more than 65% of   0  20  40  60  80  Nepal Bangladesh India Vietnam Philippines  S co  re  o  n  s  ca le   o f   1 0  0 ICT Indicator for Nepal Compared to select countries   ( 2017)  Consumer Readiness Availability of Relevant Content Mobile Network Infra       34     broadband connections25. The situation highlights lack of developed ICT ecosystem which can provide   greater benefits in terms of revenue, job-creation and overall social well-being. Nepal has lacked   presence of substantial IT outsourcing or BPO business which thrive on ICT infrastructure and local   talent. A key requirement for large scale IT businesses to flourish has been robust underlying IT   infrastructure and civic facilities as electric-power supply.   ICT and GDP Contribution   World Bank report titled ‘Exploring the relationship between broadband and Economic Growth’ in 2016   highlights the direct correlation between different ICT technologies with GDP growth across developing   and developed economies. The report infers on the basis of 10 percentage point increase in penetration   across different ICT technologies as fixed landline connection, mobile phone, internet (wired, wireless)   and broadband connection. The sectorial analysis of each of these vertical revealed a different level of   impact on economies GDP growth. Broadband was observed to have the highest impact with 1.19% on   high-income economies and 1.35% on low- and middle-income economies, while mobile has lowest   impact with 0.21% and 0.40% for high-income and low- and middle-income economies respectively.26   ICT development has also been a direct contributor to GDP growth globally. Study conducted for the   period of 1995 to 2014, indicated that ICT capital was responsible for about 20% growth across global   economies on an average. It contributed the most to developed economies, with average of 27% across   39 countries studied. The average contribution across 91 developing countries was close to 14% for   the same period.27   The report was based on studies carried out across different countries at different level of economic   progress. Whilst broadband was a key growth factor in most of the economies, the report also found   that mobile penetration was a key driver as well for some of the lower income economies.   Internet Economy   Internet has increasingly become a major direct contributor to GDP, accounting more than 3.4% across   large and developed economies. The impact of internet has also accelerated the economic growth   across developed and developing economies. For the period during 2005-09, internet’s contribution in   select developed economies was 21% and in large developing economies it was 11%. The variation in   level of contribution depended on the scale of technology development and overall eco-system maturity.    Matured economies with more balanced systems and platforms in place were able to harness more   economic benefits, while the developing economies had few challenges due to gaps, e.g. coverage of   population, platforms and adoption, which limited the benefits.    The middle economies as Malaysia, Turkey experienced greater benefits, but not on the same scale as   matured economies. Impact of internet has been substantial in terms of creating and replacing jobs.   The McKinsey Global SME Survey estimates an average of 2.6 jobs created for every job eliminated.   Study on French economy revealed internet to have created 1.2 million jobs where it eliminated 500,000   jobs over 1995 t0 2009, with ratio of 2.4 jobs for every job lost.28                                                                     25 https://www.nepalitelecom.com/2018/04/3g-4g-and-ftth-drives-broadband-penetration-in-nepal.html   26 Exploring the Relationship Between Broadband and Economic Growth, WDR 2016, World Bank   27 Accelerating Growth, World Development Report 2016  28 The Great Transformer: The impact of Internet on Economic Growth and Prosperity, McKinsey Global  Institute, October 2011   https://www.nepalitelecom.com/2018/04/3g-4g-and-ftth-drives-broadband-penetration-in-nepal.html      35     Potential Impact on Nepal   Growth in ICT can directly impact Nepal’s GDP value in coming years with a paradigm shift in   employment across sectors. Internet penetration in Nepal grew during 2014-2017 by 21% of population.   However, with slower internet connection more prevalent, the focus is now on upgrading the   infrastructure to broadband and 4G levels. Current broadband penetration is close to 30% mostly over   3G/4G mobile connections. Nepal government had targeted 45% coverage across households by   broadband by 2018 and all the VDCs29 under broadband Master Plan 2020. Additional penetration of   broadband internet can aid Nepal’s GDP by 2.8-3.3% for each 10% penetration achieved, it is    estimated a slower growth in overall internet penetration growth, but expects development of broadband   in the existing network areas. Improved broadband coverage can help Nepal realize more than 3% GDP   value addition over next 5-years. ICT evolution in India led to 17% increase in internet traffic which   during 2015-16 lead to absolute increase in GDP by USD103 billion, whereas increase in mobile of   same scale would add have added US$41.4 billion.30         Okun’s Law   Okun’s Law explores and defines the relationship between employment and GDP growth. The law   based on empirical evidences mentions that every time GDP grows 2% faster than the normal growth   rate31, 1 percentage point of employment is created. The law also has been applied with GNI,   employment rises by 1%, GNI increases by 3%. Research data by different sources also presents a   strong co-relation between job creation and GDP of up to 0.7 to 0.82. 323334                                                                  29 VDC- Village Development Center  30 Estimating the value of new-generation internet-based applications in India, July 2017, ICRIER-Broadband  India Forum   31 Normal Growth rate- the potential growth rate of economy under current condition without external  disruption  32 https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/12/okuns-law.asp   33 https://marketrealist.com/2015/02/job-creation-gdp-growth-go-hand-hand   34 https://www.enterprise-development.org/what-works-and-why/evidence-framework/link-between- employment-and-economic-growth/    25.26  36.30  0.00  5.00  10.00  15.00  20.00  25.00  30.00  35.00  40.00  0  5000  10000  15000  20000  25000  30000  35000  40000  2017 2022  G D  P  V  a lu  e , i  n  U  S $   b il  li o  n  S e  ct o  r  w  is e   c o  n tr  ib tu  io n   t o   G D  P ,  in  U  S $   c u  rr e  n t   y e  a rs  Porjected GDP Growth DIgital Nepal,  US$ million  Services Industry Agriculture GDP ( current US$, billion)  https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/12/okuns-law.asp https://marketrealist.com/2015/02/job-creation-gdp-growth-go-hand-hand https://www.enterprise-development.org/what-works-and-why/evidence-framework/link-between-employment-and-economic-growth/ https://www.enterprise-development.org/what-works-and-why/evidence-framework/link-between-employment-and-economic-growth/      36     Impact on Job Market   Nepal’s e-commerce sector is valued close to US$30 million, which is experiencing growth at over 40%   per annum. Nepal’s e-commerce revenue by 2023 is expected to cross US$192 million annually at   current growth rates. The industry has proved to have huge impact on job-creation throughout the   supply chain across different economies, including large economies as India and China, with more than   2/3rd of the jobs in logistics, ware-housing and last-mile delivery. Direct jobs created by the start-up and   e-commerce sector grew by CAGR of 50% for 2012-2015 period and is expected to continue the same   through to 2021. Nepal’s job sector has huge potential to boost from the same, as it has an under   developed logistics infrastructure and lacks in last-mile delivery. The seller base for Nepal’s online   business has been on the growth.   Telecom is another area which has been consistent with positive impact on job creation. The   opportunities exist across telecom installation, equipment manufacturing, distribution, maintenance etc.   India expects more 20 million jobs in telecom sector by 2025, driven by fiber network plans, BTS   installations, WiFi projects, and domestic telecom industry. Nepal as of now imports most of its   equipment and has an untapped potential3536373839   Potential Impact of Service Sector in Nepal   As of 2017, Nepal’s 70% of the population is employed in agricultural activities and contributes 26.41%   of GDP. Services employ 20.1% of workforce while contributing 51.6% of GDP. For 2017, per capita   employment in service yielded GDP value addition of US$8,468.56 in PPP, compared to US$1,212.05   by agricultural and allied sectors.    The shift from agriculture to services across workforce has been linear and consistent over last few   years. Growth in ICT and internet economy can absorb the annual addition of workforce into service   economy at increasing rate, creating more value per capita. Every year more than 500,000 youth are   entering into Nepal’s job market, translating into need of at least 286,900 jobs to sustain the current   rate of employment.40    It is predicted additional job opportunities created across service sector across different vertical of   economy, there is a potential growth of 1 percentage point of workforce working in service sector. In 5   years, the potential impact of workforce employed in service economy reaching 25% of total active   workforce is predicted to be more than US$12 billon. This comes at assumption of decline in total   employment in agriculture to 65% from 2017 level of 70%. Further benefits can be realized from Digital   payments, App ecosystem, and improvement in agro-value chain, smart logistics, education and   development of knowledge economy.                                                                     35 World Bank, Frost and Sullivan Analysis  36 http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2018-04-17/nepals-employment-rate-highest-in-south- asia.html   37 https://www.ibef.org/industry/telecommunications.aspx   38 http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2018-10-11/digital-2020.html   39 https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/nationwide-broadband-service-by-2020/   40 World Bank   http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2018-04-17/nepals-employment-rate-highest-in-south-asia.html http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2018-04-17/nepals-employment-rate-highest-in-south-asia.html https://www.ibef.org/industry/telecommunications.aspx http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2018-10-11/digital-2020.html https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/nationwide-broadband-service-by-2020/      37           Impact of ICT in job market across select verticals   E-commerce – Nepal’s e-commerce has been limited to the Capital and key urban centers, while   logistics challenges keep it out of rural areas. The e-commerce sector is still in its early stages, with   estimates to be US$25 million in 2017 and is experiencing rapid growth. Growth in e-commerce   platforms has the potential to accelerate FMCG, services and other small goods market, resulting in   SME growth and employment. Indian e-commerce industry growing at 41% CAGR is expected to add   1.45 million jobs by 2021which employed only 23,500 in 2012. More than 2/3rd of the jobs will be in   logistics and warehousing which is available to semi-skilled and skilled workforce.    Growth in seller base will add another 10 million new jobs. It is estimated that one job in e-commerce   generates 3 jobs in allied sectors. The most important driving force for Indian e-commerce has been   growth in smaller cities and towns, which have emerged as both demand and supply centers.41   Daraz Nepal’s major e-commerce website stated that it aims to grow the online sellers from 1200 to   5000 during 2018-19. The indicative job impact has been observed to be of 1:4 ratio, where increase in   1 online seller creates 4 direct jobs and while 12 indirect jobs are created in support services as delivery,   customer services, warehousing etc. For a seller count of 5000, the potential impact on job market could   be more than 75,000 new jobs across different levels. Boost in e-commerce can drive homegrown IT   sector of Nepal, adding additional services jobs to the economy.   Information and Communication technology (ICT) - Growth in ICT sector has multi-dimensional   benefit for the economy. ICT inclusive of mobile, fixed line and internet is capable of boosting economy   across different areas. Growth in ICT coverage and integration across different business sectors can   boost in efficiency, bring in network effects and create enhanced logistics. IT-BPO services in Nepal   can expand further, which remains an untapped area. Digital platforms for agriculture can boost   production, improve supply chain and help farmers connect directly with markets.   Start-ups and App ecosystem- Nepal’s IT space has about 500 companies with most of them focused   on IT and ITES. Tech start-up scene in Nepal has been around for some time but has failed to catch   up. Key challenges being finance, overall customer base and tech readiness of customers. The sector   has started to grow with more focus from government and boost in the IT infrastructure. Startups can   be catalyst to Nepal’s tech-based job creation on the lines of neighboring India. In 2015, startups in                                                               41 Impact of e-commerce on employment in India, Dec 2016, KPMG   26.7 27.98 29.37 30.98  32.77  26.70 28.45  30.58 33.10  36.08  0%  2%  3% 3%  3%  0%  1%  1%  2%  2%  3%  3%  4%  0  10  20  30  40  2018 2019 2020 2021 2022  In cr  e m  e n  ta l   G D  P  g  ro w  th  G D  P   (   i n   U S  $  b  il li  o n  ) Digital Nepal Impact- GDP Growth  BAU Digital Nepal Incremental GDP Growth       38     India attracted close to US$5 billion in investment, creating 80,000 direct jobs at different skill-levels.   Indian app ecosystem contributes more than US$20 billion in 2015-16 which is expected to rise to   US$270 billion by 2020. The impact on job market has been impressive where for each job in App   economy created 2.9 jobs in direct, indirect and induced forms42. Nepal is yet to be anywhere near to   realizing the full-potential of its app-ecosystem.   Investment Estimation   Digital India, an accelerated ICT development program with additional budget to the tune of US$17   billion for the period of 2015-2025 is forecasted to help Indian GDP by 20-30% of additional growth by   2025. The additional value add to GDP is to come from increased revenue, job creation, foreign and   domestic investments and gained efficiency across sectors. Indian budget on ICT has been growing   increasingly with further projects being added under the Digital India umbrella. The expected impact on   GDP has been measured to the tune of US$500 billion to US$1 trillion by 2025, achievable by   simultaneous development across different verticals impacting growth and usage of ICT. Relative   comparison of ICT projects across Southeast Asian economies have also been taken into account while   putting in the estimated investment and potential benefits for Nepal.    However, Nepal, still in the early stages of ICT adoption in several services and manufacturing sector   and having smaller economy and geographical size would require the budget to be a lot lesser. It is   estimated the overall direct government expenditure to be close to the US$350 million for Nepal to   achieve an accelerated growth in different aspects of ICT over a period of 10 years. The estimates have   been made by taking into account Nepal’s GDP and Purchasing Power Parity.    The investment in next 5-years should be on higher proportion to facilitate the rapid build-up of basic   infrastructure in form of fiber cables, telecom set-up, skilling and re-skilling, R&D, industry development   etc. Current budget of Nepal in rural and hilly ICT development is US$105 million, which is expected to   be spent on optical fiber and rural internet development. Currently Nepal has assigned US$35.5 million   for lying of optical fiber networks in hilly and rural areas. The biggest challenge for Nepal’s ITC   infrastructure has been slow rate of expenditure which was 2.6% of total budget till 2015.      Example/ Case Studies on impact of internet / ICT in some Asian countries –   South East Asia   Southeast Asia has emerged as a leading hub of internet fueled growth and has seen rise of ICT based   economy. More developed economies as Singapore and Malaysia have been driving the internet-based   services. Developing economies as Vietnam and Philippines have emerged as leading destinations in   IT outsourcing and BPO industry.    As highlighted by Google Temasek report 2018, the region is expected to see more than 1.7 million   full- time with growth in internet economy by 2025. The number of people employed in high-skilled   internet sector will double from 100,000 to 200,000 while creating opportunities in sectors as e-  commerce and ride-hailing services along with high-skill jobs, the number of jobs will triple from the jobs   created in 2018. The value of internet economy in the region among six major countries has been   growing at accelerating rate, doubling from 2015 to 2018 reaching US$72 million. The size of internet’s   contribution is expected to be US$240 million by 2025, which is US$40 billion more than last year’s   estimate from Google Temasek.                                                               42 Estimating the value of new-generation internet based applications in India, July 2017, ICRIER-Broadband  India Forum        39     The growth is expected to be driven by combined efforts of government policies and infrastructure   spend in ICT and supporting areas, along with massive private investment in form of venture and angel   funding, R&D and user readiness. The growth across key sectors during 2015-2018 was –    E-commerce – recorded a growth rate of 62% CAGR     Online Travel – recorded a growth rate of 15% CAGR    Online Media – recorded a growth rate of 44% CAGR    Ride Hailing– recorded a growth rate of 39% CAGR   During the same period contribution to GDP across SEA by internet more than doubled from 1.3% to   2.8%. Among the six major economies, highest contribution was to Vietnam with 4%, while lowest was   in Philippines where it contributed 1.6% of GDP.   Vietnam   Vietnam’s internet sector has led the growth in GDP contribution across Southeast Asia with 4%, while   it also has one of the highest CAGR of 35% for growth revenue. Vietnam had raised it focus on IT   development and started investment in infrastructure along with policy support to encourage global   businesses and entrepreneurs to start operations in Vietnam. Since 2000, its IT sector has expanded   from close to being absent to more than 14,000 IT companies across hardware, software and digital   content. With its expanding IT skilled labor-force, Vietnam became the 2nd largest IT partner for Japan   in 2015.   In 2015, Vietnam adopted IT Master plan 2020 with aim of boosting the IT sector and accelerating GDP   growth. Plan also emphasized on Vietnam coming under top 55 countries of ICT index of ITU.    Philippines   Philippines experienced the lowest contribution from internet economy to its GDP with 1.6%, and   recorded a growth of 30% during 2015-18. Over the last decade Philippines has emerged as an IT   outsourcing hub in SEA, with strong growth in BPO sector. In 2015, Manila became the only city to be   among top 7 Outsourcing Destinations outside India. In 2015, Manila’s BPO sector provided   employment to more than 1 million people, while generating revenue over US$20 billion and expected   to be around US$23 billion for 2016 while employing 1.1 million people. The program during 2011-16   saw US$1 revenue create half-equivalent wealth.43 Further under employment, every full-time job   created 3.2 indirect jobs.   Philippine Government had been actively engaging in policy and infrastructure development for   sustainable long-term growth across IT-BPM industry, while recognizing ICT as a key enabler to achieve   the target for sector. BPO was identified as 10 high-potential areas for development in 2011-16   Philippine Development Plan.

The project mentioned two categories of connections under the plan-     High Speed Broadband (HSBB)- for residential household and businesses across select   geographic areas, connection speed to be 10-100 Mbps, with final speed for connection in   economic centers and businesses being 1Gbps.    Broadband to General Population (BBGP) - connection for general public with speeds from 256   Kbps-2 Mbps46, reaching up to 10 Mbps.   Project was designed to be spread across 10 years and in two-phases. Agreement on investment and   implementation was signed between Ministry of Energy, Water and Communication (KTAK) and   Telekom Malaysia (TM) under Public-Private Partnership (PPP). The program aimed to provide last   mile connectivity using Fibre-to-the-home (FTTH), Ethernet-to-the-Home (ETTH) and Very High Speed   Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL2) to homes and businesses across the country.    Investment in the project over 10 years was estimated to be US$3.23 billion in 2008, of which US$685   million was to be contributed by Government of Malaysia and US$2.54 billion was to come from   Telekom Malaysia itself.   First phase of the project was rolled out in mid-2008 to 2012, with aim to achieve 50% broadband   penetration across households by 2010 and total of 1.3 million households are to be covered by 2012.   The economic impact of HSBB and its sub-projects were immediate and visible. By 2010, HSBB   project contributed 1% to GDP and 135,000 new-jobs. The jobs were spread across core-telecom   sector, internet and contract under infrastructure lay-out.   Second-phase of the plan, HSBB 2 was rolled-out in 2015, with a budget of US$ 885 million47 distributed   across expansion of HSBB network and simultaneously upgrading existing copper-lines (sub-urban   broadband) to be HSBB compatible for next 10 years. Contribution of TM was to be total of US$535   million and that of government to be US$350 million.484950   Expected Benefits Projected by 2020-     Total gross national income contribution to be US$15.1 billion    Income from potential spill-over effect up to USD2.33 billion from communication content and   infrastructure sector.    In 2020, expected job creation to be 43,162.   Further investment – Malaysian government has launched the National Fiberisation and Connectivity   Plan (NFCP) with a budget of US$ 240 million expects to boost the internet speeds to 30Mbps in 5 –  years while lowering the broadband access cost for residents.                                                               45 http://itbpm-roadmap2022.ibpap.org/   46 minimum internet connection speed for broadband 2008   47 Conversion rate as of December 2015, 1USD=RM4.30  48 http://www.mida.gov.my/home/2937/news/tm-to-invest-rm2.3bil   49 International Broadband Initiatives in Malaysia, July 2014, MCMC  50 HSBB: Malaysia’s Drive for High Speed Broadband, Jan 2009, my Convergence, MCMC   http://itbpm-roadmap2022.ibpap.org/ http://www.mida.gov.my/home/2937/news/tm-to-invest-rm2.3bil      41     India    In 2011, India’s internet contributed 1.6% to GDP (US$30 billion) which was on the lower side compared   to 1.9% GDP contribution that had been observed in many other developing economies.  Internet   economy contributed 3.2%, 5% and 6% in 2013, 2016 and 2017 respectively to Indian GDP, and is   expected to reach 7.5% of the GDP5152. The accelerated growth is expected to come from large scale   long-term plans put in place by Indian government to facilitated wider and more robust coverage of   broadband and mobile internet across country. The Government of India has increased its focus on   digital economy in wake of its assumptions that for a developing economy like India with multitude of   opportunities in digital arena, 10% increase in broadband will have a greater effect of 3.3% of GDP53.   Some of the flagship programs are –    Digital India – Launched in July 2015, it is an umbrella project under which the Government of India   (GoI) has proposed to invest in country’s ICT sector across different domains and spheres of   governance and daily life. The project aims to propel India into a knowledge economy, with help of   digital infrastructure development in form of broadband penetration, e-Governance, modern   irrigation, skill development and capacity building to support future digital economy. Some of the   key projects are Smart Cities, Bharat Net, Public Wi-Fi hotspots, Universal Access to mobile,   Common Services Centers etc. The overall project benefits are to be realized across large gamut   of socio-economic fabric of India.    o Initial estimated of the project put the cost close to US$17 billion spread across 10 years   in different cost areas under key Ministries- DeiTy and DOT. Implementation of projects   under Digital India been calculated to have an impact of USD 500-1000 billion annually by   2025. The key sectors leading it would be banking & finance, health care, agriculture,   energy, infrastructure and education. CMAI association of India projects number of jobs   created to be more than 100 million, with 17 million in direct and 85 million indirect.   The improvement in infrastructure is expected to propel India, currently ranked 134, into   top 50 nations in ICT development index of ITU.545556 57    National Digital Communications Policy, May 2018- aims to provide fixed broadband fiber   connections to 50% of the household and internet coverage to all areas by 2022. The initiative aims   to create 4 million additional jobs under digital and communication sectors. The plan also covers   important aspect of skill development by targeting 1 million individuals for new-economy skills. The   initiative aims to attract increased investments to the tune of US$100 billion on improved skill-level,   enhanced global value chain integration and accelerated progress towards Industry 4.0.    The Bharat Net project is being implemented in two phases with a total cost of US$7 billion (INR   45,000 crores )58 . The project aims to connect 250,000 Indian villages with help of Wi-Fi-hotspots   and broadband connections. The completion of project is expected to yield US$65 billion as   contribution to GDP.                                                                  51 https://media-publications.bcg.com/BCG-TiE-Digital-Volcano-Apr2017.pdf   52 http://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/EnglishPolicy-NDCP.pdf   53 https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/what-is-bharatnet-project-and-how-it-could-add- whopping-amount-of-rs-4-5-lakh-crore-to-indias-gdp/931358/   5454 http://www.cmai.asia/digitalindia/pdf/Digital-India-DeITY-Details.pdf   55 https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/digital-india-will-be-a-game-changer/24953/   56 https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/in/Documents/technology-media- telecommunications/in-tmt-digital-india-unlock-opportunity-noexp.pdf   57 NDCP 2018: The future looks bright, Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) blog  58 Exchange rate April 2017- https://in.investing.com/currencies/usd-inr-historical-data    https://media-publications.bcg.com/BCG-TiE-Digital-Volcano-Apr2017.pdf http://dot.gov.in/sites/default/files/EnglishPolicy-NDCP.pdf https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/what-is-bharatnet-project-and-how-it-could-add-whopping-amount-of-rs-4-5-lakh-crore-to-indias-gdp/931358/ https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/technology/what-is-bharatnet-project-and-how-it-could-add-whopping-amount-of-rs-4-5-lakh-crore-to-indias-gdp/931358/ http://www.cmai.asia/digitalindia/pdf/Digital-India-DeITY-Details.pdf https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/digital-india-will-be-a-game-changer/24953/ https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/in/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/in-tmt-digital-india-unlock-opportunity-noexp.pdf https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/in/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/in-tmt-digital-india-unlock-opportunity-noexp.pdf https://in.investing.com/currencies/usd-inr-historical-data      41     Digital Foundation      Digital foundation sector intends to empower Nepali people to benefit from the on-going digital   transformation by focusing on the following three pillars:   ● Digital Connectivity,   ● Digital Skills, and   ● Digital Governance      Digital Foundation: Empowering Nepalese   Focus Areas   Digital Connectivity Digitally Skills Digital Governance   ‒ Ensuring quality of digital   connectivity   ‒ Ensuring reliability and   quality of digital services   ‒ Creating a digitally-ready   society       ‒ Job creation   ‒ Transform the way   government machinery   works   ‒ Investing in citizen-facing   functions/ technologies      Overview of Digital Foundation      Digital   Connectivity   Digital connectivity in Nepal has improved considerably in the past five years, with an   exponential increase in access to mobile services. Mobile connections and mobile   Internet penetration in Nepal almost doubled between 2012 and 2017, with penetration   crossing 100%.    2012 2017   Mobile penetration 60% 134%59   Mobile Internet penetration 21% 57%                                                               59 MIS Report (16 December, 2017 – 14 January, 2018), Nepal telecommunications Authority         42     Growth in mobile penetration in Nepal has been mostly driven by significant   investments made by leading mobile network operators in expanding their network   footprints, and increasing affordability of mobile devices and services. Mobile operators   have made large investments in their data networks60, with 3G network coverage in   Nepal increasing from 25% in 2013 to reach 65% in 2017. The top three   telecommunications operators in Nepal also launched 4G services in 2017. According   to NTA, the number of 4G subscribers in Nepal currently stands at 2,144,887.       Source: NTA   However, fixedline and fixed broadband networks in Nepal continue to remain   underdeveloped with limited coverage outside large cities.    Digital Skills Digital Literacy   The full potential of the Internet remains untapped with a high level of digital illiteracy   among Nepalese, especially for low-income and less educated users. In spite of an   increasing role of digital technologies across all spheres, digital education is yet to find   its place in Nepali education system with more than 90% of the schools in Nepal not   having digital connectivity and ICT devices.61      ICT Sector   The ICT sector, comprising Internet, telephone, mobile, IT-enabled services (ITeS) and   business process outsourcing (BPO), is among the fastest growing in Nepal. The sector   has a large role to play in driving socioeconomic growth, as it applies to all sectors and   potential to create a large number of jobs. Due to its potential, the Nepal government   has taken steps to liberalize the sector by allowing 100% FDI investment in the ITeS   and BPO sector, and 80% FDI in the telecommunications sector.       Nepali outsourcing companies offer services at reasonable prices compared to other   South Asian BPO companies in India, China, and the Philippines. There are more than   6,000 BPO companies in the country of which only 256 are legally registered as at   2017. Nepal offers distinct advantages as a BPO destination due to its lower   salaries/cost base and lower employee turnover. However, Nepal has not been able to   completely exploit the full potential of the ICT sector.   Digital   Governance   Governments are typically one of the largest technology users in a country, and   therefore able to promote adoption and industry growth by delivering public services   digitally. Promotion of digital governance forms one of the key pillars of Digital Nepal                                                               60 MIS Report, NTA, August 2018  61 UNESCO, 2014        43     Program. Digital governance in Nepal can build upon a number of on-going initiatives   such as the government PKI, national ID, automation of vital registration of citizens,   automation of land registration processes, and election data repository in electronic   format, among others. eGovernance and digitalization of public services have emerged   as a key priority of the Government of Nepal. Initiating several steps in this direction,   Nepal’s ranking on the E-Government Development Index improved from 165th in 2014   to 117th in 2018.       Source: UN      Challenges in Nepal’s Digital Foundation Sector   While Nepal has made great strides in rapidly expanding mobile and Internet connections, a significant   section of Nepali society continues to remain digitally uninitiated. Key challenges include:   ● Availability and coverage: Almost one-third of Nepal’s population is not covered by 3G networks   while 4G networks cover less than 20% of the population. Fixed broadband networks are limited to   large cities   ● Low digital literacy: Low digital literacy, especially among the rural poor, widening the digital divide   ● Absence of relevant content: Lack of information in the local language targeting the Nepali-  speaking population   ● Limited spectrum availability: Nepal ranks 148th out of 167 countries (score of 39.1 out of 100)   on spectrum in GSMA’s Mobile Connectivity Index 2017   ● High cost of broadband services         Despite rapid growth in mobile connections, Nepal remains a follower in overall ICT development:   ● ITU ranked Nepal 140th out of 176 countries in its ICT Development Index (IDI) for 2017   ● GSMA ranked Nepal 137th out of 167 countries its Mobile Connectivity Index for 2017.

There is a strong link between improvements in digital connectivity and economic growth. Studies find   that every 10% increase in broadband penetration results in a 1.3% rise in GDP. As a result, Nepal   should undertake necessary steps to improve digital connectivity and create digitally ready society,   which are critical to tap the potential of the ongoing digital transformation. These investments will also   result in jobs through BPO and ITeS industry, and the emergence of new business models.      Digital Initiatives Roadmap to Digital Foundation in Nepal   Following digital initiatives are identified to address challenges of the digital foundation sector in   Nepal:       1 Technology and    Infrastructure   2 Entrepreneurship/PPP 3 Talent and Skills   Development   ● Establish the Internet as an   essential service   ● Improve spectrum   availability management   and optimization   ● Take the lead in 5G   network deployment   ● National Optical Fiber   Network   ● High-speed Internet   connectivity for efficient   delivery of Public services   ● Special Economic Zones   for ICT sector   ● Government of Nepal App   ● Use of Government   Enterprise Architecture   (GEA)   ● Paperless Government to   promote collaboration   ● Public Wi-Fi Hotspots   ● Digital Innovation and Co-  Creation Hub      ● Digital Skills Development   Initiative   ● Government eLearning   Platform   ● ICT in Education            48     ● National Cyber Security   Center    ● Provincial Data Centers   establishment   ● Nepali language   computational resource   pack    ● National Biometric ID Card    ● Digital Signature      Technology and Infrastructure   Effective implementation of smart connectivity in Nepal with the aim of having a digitally connected   nation will require an upgrade of infrastructure and technology, and universal connectivity on a   nationwide level to reach even the remotest areas. Key projects that the government may consider   include:       01.01.01.00 Establish the Internet as an essential service   Solution Establish the Internet as an essential service means that everyone must be able   to access the Internet to exercise their right to freedom of expression and other   fundamental liberties. It requires the government to ensure that Internet access is   broadly available and prevents it from unreasonably restricting an individual's   access to information and the Internet.   Several countries including Costa Rica, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, and   Spain have adopted the Internet as a fundamental right. In most of these countries,   telecom operators must provide each permanent residence and business office   with access to a reasonably priced and high-quality connection with a downstream   rate of at least 1 Mbit/s.

The MoCIT and Office of the   Controller of Certificate (OCC) declared the official adoption and validity of digital   signature in Nepal on December 2015.   In spite of these initiatives, digital signatures is yet to see wide scale adoption in   Nepal. Digital signatures are likely to play an important role as Nepal adopts digital   financial services.         56     The Government of Nepal through Nepal Rastra Bank should take steps to   encourage higher adoption of digital signatures in the financial services sector.   Digital signatures can be used by the financial services sector for issuing various   documents and certificates in digital form. Additionally, the government should   integrate digital signatures for various e-Government initiatives such as Inland   Revenue Department, Office of Company Registrar (OCR), Public Procurement   Management Office (PPMO), etc.         Focus Area Digital Governance   Stakeholders ● Ministry of Finance   ● Nepal Rastra Bank   ● Office of Controller of Certificate   ● Ministry of Communication and Information Technology   ● National Information Technology Center   Timelines   Outcomes   Long-Term   ● Introduction of Digital Signatures into online banking process will deliver   significant and quantifiable results in terms of reduction in cost, security,   speed of transaction completion, and enhanced customer satisfaction   ● Digital Signature will enable companies and organizations to take part in   Government e-Tendering process, ensuring that the online transactions   are secure, convenient, and transparent       Entrepreneurship/Public-Private Partnerships   01.02.16.00 Digital Innovation and Co-creation Hub   Solution The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, Department of   Education and provincial universities can collaborate to develop the digital   innovation and co-creation hubs in all provinces. The objective of the hub should   be to foster development of the digital startup ecosystem.      It should serve as a platform to enable start-ups to have access to high-speed   broadband and fiber-optic connectivity, funding (private and government), R&D   facilities, collaboration with province universities and other education institutes. It   should work towards open innovation hubs, research labs, incubators, and   accelerators to foster cooperation between educational institutes and the corporate   world on student internships and business-based projects:   ● Organize lectures, workshops, and seminars for university students to   highlight the latest workplace trends and skills enhancement   ● Interact with industry players to redesign education curriculum   Focus Area Digital Skills   Stakeholders  ● Ministry of Communication and Information Technology  ● Ministry of Finance  ● Department of Education  ● Department of Information Technology  ● Universities / University Grant Commission        57     ● Foundations  ● Private sector   Timelines Medium-Term   Outcomes ● Development of supporting eco-system for start-ups   ● Reduce brain drain by creating entrepreneurs and increasing job   opportunities in Nepal    ● Foster innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship   ● Promote thought leadership and help improve the employability of   students, particularly at the university and vocational level   ● Close the gap between education and practical job skills in the country      Case study: Global GiGA Island Initiative - Digital Bangladesh   Korea Telecom (KT)’s GiGA Island is a corporate CSR initiative that aims to enhance the quality of life and provide   better access in terms of education, culture, and healthcare for people who live in remote areas, such as highlands   and islands, by providing high-speed Internet and ICT solutions.   Moheshkhali is a small island located in the southeast of the Bay of Bengal with a total population of 250,000. Due   to geographical limitations and poor telecommunications environment, residents of the island had limited access   to public services including education, medical services, and information.    KT connected the Moheshkhali Island to the inland areas by installing GiGA Microwave wireless network   technology and used copper-based giga-level Internet solution GiGA Wires to circulate network traffic within the   island. With the GiGA Microwave, the island could successfully receive 500 Mbps Internet service, while the GiGA   Wire enables Internet speeds of up to 100 Mbps. The project enabled more than 30% of residents in Moheshkhali   to communicate with the world through high-speed Internet.         Talent and Skills Development   01.03.17.00 Digital Skills Development Initiative    Solution Consider PPPs with local and international NGOs to provide digital literacy   training to digitally uninitiated sections of society.

Source: Ministry of Finance, Government of Nepal      Almost three-fourths of Nepal’s population relies on agriculture for their livelihood, making the sector a   vital component of the nation’s growth agenda. The Government of Nepal considers farming and   agriculture as critical to achieving its socioeconomic growth aspirations, allocating nearly 4%–5% of its   annual budget to the sector. There are multiple government-led initiatives to drive agriculture sector   productivity with a target to achieve self-sufficiency in food production in the near future.        Challenges in Nepal’s Agriculture Sector   Despite continued policy interventions and government focus, progress remains slow and restricted to   a few regions in Nepal owing to inherent issues such as high dependence on climate, difficulty obtaining   credit and financing, poor distribution infrastructure, and limited access to extension and advisory   services.                                                                65 World Bank        60     Nepal’s agricultural imports are also growing, showing negative trade balance especially with India. The   import of agricultural produce, e.g., cereals, vegetables, and fruits has also surged in the past few years.      Source: Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), Government of Nepal   Other challenges the agriculture sector faces include:   ● Poor access to agricultural inputs and supply, including bottlenecks in obtaining necessary   equipment, seeds, breeds and knowledge on agricultural and livestock best practices,   particularly in remote rural areas.   ● Low yields and declining productivity, especially for principal crops and livestock products such   as rice, due to lack of irrigation facilities, smaller land holdings, and reliance on subsistence   farming; Nepal has much lower agricultural yield compared to other developing countries in the   region.   ● Inadequate access to agricultural markets and end customers due to underdeveloped   transport, infrastructure, and distribution facilities, increasing the risk of exploitation of farmers   by intermediaries.   ● Limited access to financial services, including loans and crop insurance.   ● Labor shortages as more rural workers migrate to cities in search of better opportunities.   The government is seeking to digitize and modernize the sector to address these issues.

However, there are only marginal improvements to the yields of most farmers. Majority of   farmers continue to use traditional processes and tools that depend heavily on historical norms and   have not evolved for centuries.   As the barrier of entry for farming technology drops and digital tools such as cloud, computer systems,   connectivity, and open source software become increasingly affordable, the government can deliver        61     these technologies to farmers more cost effectively. Authorities should also look at India’s Digital India   program, as a case example for implementation.   The agriculture sector has made some progress in the use of soil health cards, modern irrigation   methods (e.g., sprinkle irrigation technology), mobile apps to access agricultural information, and e-  commerce platforms. However, the initiatives seem too few and far between and focused on easily   accessible regions, while hard-to-reach mountainous areas continue to be underserved.    Future success would be contingent on a consolidated and centralized ICT policy, led by the state or   the central governments, with concerted efforts targeting specific pain points. Use of modern agriculture   technologies is likely to provide measurable returns to Nepal, with analysts estimating technologies   such as precision agriculture to improve yields on existing agricultural land by ~70%.66      Case Study: India’s plan to digitalize agriculture benefiting stakeholders across the agricultural value   chain and increasing farmers’ incomes   In February 2018, the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, unveiled an agricultural strategy aimed at   boosting farmers’ incomes, increasing minimum support price, and reducing wastage and production cost.    Objectives    Double farmers’ incomes by 2022    Double private corporate investments in farming from the current 2% of agricultural investments    Indian farms to become outsourcing hubs for global supermarket chains   Initiatives    Encouraging the entry of private companies by relaxing investment rules in contract farming,   transport, marketing, warehousing, and food processing.    Creating a unified National Agriculture Market (NAM) to regulate the agriculture market. Through real-  time electronic auctioning of commodities and integrated assaying, weighing, storage, and payment   systems, the system will enable the participation of both farmers and consumers in the market.    Initiating completion of 99 irrigation schemes delayed over the past 25–30 years by investing ~INR80,   000 crores; ~50% of the schemes are to be completed in 2018.    Launching Startup Agri India to support agritech entrepreneurs striving to improve the efficiency of   the agricultural process; organizing hackathons among leading technology institutes in India to   generate out-of-the-box ideas for agriculture.    Directing a mandatory transfer of 50% of all cropped areas under new insurance schemes.

Total healthcare   expenditure in Nepal as a percentage of GDP grew from 4% in 2006 to exceed 6% in 2015,   comparatively higher than its neighbors such as India, Pakistan, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka with healthcare   spending at 2.6% and 4.7% of GDP.70    The rise in healthcare expenditure and continued focus by the government in enhancing healthcare   policies and infrastructure have enabled Nepal to achieve vast improvements in its healthcare KPIs in   the past 20 years. For example, neonatal and child mortality rates have declined significantly since   1995. Moreover, Nepal’s consistent track record in improving other health outcomes such as maternal   mortality, death rates, and life expectancy is acknowledged internationally.        Mortality and Life Expectancy Rates, Nepal, 1995–2015   Subject Unit of Measurement 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015   Neonatal mortality Per 1,000 Live Births 47.7 39.3 32.5 26.7 22.2   Infant mortality Per 1,000 Live Births 76.8 59.6 46.3 36.3 29.4   Under-5 mortality  Per 1,000 Live Births 107.7 80.6 60 45.4 35.8   Crude birth rate People per 1,000 36 32.1 27.5 22.9 20.2   Death rate People per 1,000 10.4 8.5 7.3 6.7 6.3   Life expectancy at birth Years 58.5 62.3 65.5 68 70   Maternal mortality ratio Per 100,000 660 548 444 349 258      Source: World Health Organization                                                               70   World Health Organization        74     Despite improvements in Nepal’s key healthcare outcomes, the country continues to trail its Asian peers   and international benchmarks. For example, while efforts to enhance maternal and neonatal care in   rural Nepal have resulted in substantial improvements in maternal mortality rates, yet the maternal   mortality ratio in Nepal (at 258 per 100,000 live births) is notably higher than its Asian counterparts in   India, Pakistan, Bhutan, and Bangladesh (at 148–178 per 100,000 live births).       Challenges in Nepal’s Health Sector    In 2007, Nepal’s Interim Constitution recognized access to primary healthcare as a right for every   citizen. However, more than a decade later, primary healthcare for all remains an elusive dream for the   citizens. In fact, Nepal lags behind its Asian peers and international standards on health service   coverage, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).     Nepal, like many low- and middle-income countries, faces common issues such as:    ● Limited access to healthcare, especially in remote rural areas, where patients need to travel   long distances to receive quality healthcare   ● Chronic shortage of healthcare professionals and reluctance of public servants to serve in   remote areas   ● Underdeveloped infrastructure limiting access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene   practices   ● Poverty and illiteracy coupled with the high cost of private healthcare services   ● Poor quality of care services at public sector hospitals and institutions   Nonetheless, Nepal’s new government aims to change this during its tenure. Acknowledging health as   the primary right of every citizen, the government intends to roll out various initiatives (e.g., establishing   a 15-bed hospital in every local area, extending health insurance for all citizens) to address these   issues.        Promise of Digital Initiatives in Health    Nepal started its digital journey in the health sector with the launch of integrated Health MIS (HMIS) in   1993. Since then, Nepal has undertaken several initiatives such as the introduction of the telemedicine   system. Recently in 2017, the Government of Nepal launched its eHealth Strategy 2017, which provides   roadmap for digitalization of health sector in Nepal over the next few years.     E-Health Interventions of the Ministry of Health and Population      Source: Ministry of Health and Population        75        Existing Digital Initiates in Nepali Health sector   Health Management   Information System (HMIS)   ● Monthly aggregate health   statistics being collected   ● All 77 districts submitting   data digitally   ● 1000+ facilities submitting   data digitally   ● 25 million+ data points   captured every year   ● A mix of digital and paper   based recording & reporting   ● Based on the open-source   DHIS2 software platform   Logistics Management   Information System (LMIS)   ● Full supply chain MIS for   MoHP   ● A mix of digital and paper   based recording and   reporting   ● Linked to the procurement   system   Electronic Health Records   (EHR) Systems   ● Combination of Electronic   Medical Records (EMR) and   hospital management   system   ● Currently being used in 3   hospitals including public   facilities   ● Based on the open-source   OpenMRS platform   Human Resource Information System   (HuRIS)   ● System to manage human resources for   health   ● Database of all public health workers   including permanent and temporary hires   Health Facility Registry (HFR)   ● Unified code provided to all health facilities   (public and private)   ● System to support linkages of other health   information systems      Digital technologies have a potential to address critical challenges faced by Nepal’s health sector by   improving coverage of quality health services, reducing the cost of healthcare services to deprived   sections of society, plugging funding leakages, and optimizing utilization of healthcare skills and   resources.    While the Government of Nepal has undertaken several initiatives in the health sector, there is a   pressing need for the government to adopt additional broad-based initiatives to optimize its resources   and attract greater private sector involvement.    Case Study – How Novartis’ telemedicine model in Ghana is helping to expand access to quality care in   remote rural areas   Objective: Expand access to quality care in remote rural areas to reduce transport times and costs to patients   while minimizing unnecessary referrals.    Model: The telemedicine model was developed around frontline health workers using digital technology to enable   centralization of healthcare expertise. Under the model, healthcare professionals at the teleconsultation centers   coach and guide less-skilled community health workers in patient care. The initiative is not only empowering   community health workers, but also improving the quality of care with a direct impact on patient health outcomes.   In 2016, for example, more than half of all teleconsultations were resolved directly by phone, including 31% that   avoided referrals.   Timelines: 2012 onwards   Results: The model pioneered in the Amansi West region through the joint efforts of the Ghana Ministry of Health   and Population, the Ghana Health Service, the National Health Insurance Authority, the Ambulance Services of   Ghana, Millennium Promise, and the Novartis Foundation. The initiative is now successfully scaling throughout   Ghana with strong local ownership by Ghanaian health authorities.           76        Health Sector in Nepal: Pain Points, Priorities, and Digital Solutions      Pain Points Government of Nepal’s Priorities  Digital as an Enabler   Wide rural/urban gap in healthcare facilities   ● 83% of Nepal’s population live   in villages, while the country’s   healthcare infrastructure and   caregivers are predominantly   in urban areas   ● Most private hospitals and   institutions in Nepal are   concentrated in cities such as   Kathmandu, Pokhara, and   Biratnagar   ● Aims to improve the quality of   basic and specialized healthcare   services   ● Plans to offer free basic health   services at the local level;   specialized and referral health   services from provinces, and   modern and specialist health   services from central health   institutions   ● Digital health (e.g., mobile   health, telemedicine) can   extend the reach of healthcare   services to rural areas:   o Equipping all healthcare   centers in rural areas with   high-speed Internet should   be the top priority for the   government   Chronic shortage of health professionals   ● Nepal has only 5.4 skilled   health professionals per   10,000 population; compared   to 24.1 and 14.0 skilled health   professionals per 10,000   population in India and   Pakistan, respectively   ● High brain drain among   medical professionals and   preference for medical   workers to join the private   sector    ● Set up at least one 15-bed   hospital at each local level   between 2018 and 2022   ● Hire at least one medical doctor   in each local level   ● eHealth/mHealth can effectively   utilize and expand the reach of   healthcare professionals   ● Tap into healthcare talent from   other countries (e.g., India, the   Philippines) to plug the demand-  supply gap   Access to safe drinking water, poor hygiene habits, and sanitation facilities is a key challenge   ● Nepal has the highest   mortality rate due to unsafe   hygiene, water, and sanitation   compared to neighboring   countries   ● Open defecation is a norm in   Nepal (especially in rural   areas)   o 30% of the Nepali   population practice open   defecation    ● Provision of clean and safe   drinking water and sanitation   facilities to all citizens is a   priority for the new government   ● Become an open defecation-free   country by 2022   ● Innovative use of digital   technologies can boost   awareness about the need to   follow proper hygiene and   sanitation practices   ● Technology can enhance   access and simplify the usage   of public facilities    Expensive healthcare services   ● Underdeveloped public   healthcare infrastructure and   poor perception of service   quality at public hospitals has   led to a surge in   ● Improve healthcare services by   building quality infrastructure,   medical equipment, and human   resources   ● Economies of scale and lower   investment requirements for   digital healthcare can help        77     private/household healthcare   expenses    ● 27% of Nepal’s population   spend over 10% of their   household income on   healthcare   ● Extend health insurance   program to cover all Nepalese   lower the cost of healthcare   services    Mismanagement of funds and supplies in rural Nepal   ● Mismanagement of funds and   government subsidies,   inadequate supply of essential   drugs, and budget limitations   restrict the government’s   ability to provide proper   healthcare facilities for its   citizens   ● Zero tolerance for corruption   ● Leveraging the latest Health   Information Management   (HIM) and procurement   solutions can enhance   auditing and compliance   processes, minimizing the risk   of mismanagement of funds   and government subsidies         Digital Initiatives Roadmap for the Health Sector   The Government of Nepal should consider setting aside at least 10% of its central health budget for   Digital Health programs.

Drones can be utilized for the delivery   of essential medical supplies to remote areas where people are often isolated due   to difficult terrain, bad road conditions, and seasonal flooding.   Ministry for Communication and Information Technology, Ministry for Health and   Population, Ministry for Civil Aviation and Ministry of Home Affairs should work   together to draft a policy to allow the drones for medical emergencies.   Additionally, the government should consider the use of drones in the health   sector for disaster management and preparedness.

The Government of Nepal should focus on creating an enabling business environment to  encourage private sector players and start-ups to contribute to these priority areas.     Focus on improving ease of doing business, developing an ecosystem (e.g., digital payment     platforms), tax holidays for NGOs and enterprises focusing on digital health in poor/remote  areas.     ● Private sector participation in rural healthcare: Private healthcare providers, which primarily   focus on urban areas currently, should be encouraged to invest in digital healthcare programs  to capture a broader market and contribute to the society as part of their Corporate Social        82     Responsibility (CSR) effort. Consider necessary policy interventions (e.g., tax benefits) to  attract greater private sector involvement                  Talent and Skills Development   Chronic shortage of healthcare professionals, brain drain to foreign countries, and reluctance of   caregivers to join medical facilities in remote areas are restricting the government’s ability to improve   the quality and coverage of healthcare services.    To address these challenges, Nepal needs to systematically scale-up the capacity of its healthcare   system by increasing the intake of students in existing medical colleges and opening new medical   colleges to meet demand. Additionally, Nepal can leverage ICT solutions (e.g., Centralized   Telemedicine Center) for skills development of its healthcare professionals in remote areas.          03.03.37.00 Centralized Telemedicine Center   Solution A telemedicine model developed around frontline health workers, with digital   technology allowing for the centralization of healthcare expertise.    Under the model, healthcare professionals at the teleconsultation center of a   major public hospital in Kathmandu can coach and guide less-skilled community   health workers from various healthcare facilities in Nepal.

The joint venture connects more than 1,500 doctors in over 80 hospitals via its digital health   platform, accessible through doc.lk, by dialing 990 or the Doc990 app.    Doc990 currently offers a range of medical services including channeling doctor sessions at hospitals island-wide   for physical consultations, the Tele Doctor Service where consultants can be contacted over the phone, medicine   delivered to the doorstep, and access to lab reports from selected laboratories via the Doc990 web portal.    The Doc990 app is integrated with all mobile operators and banks for multiple payment options such as add-to-bill,   eZ Cash, Genie, Amex, Visa, and MasterCard.           83     Nepal vs Selected Asian Countries: Comparison of Major Healthcare KPIs        Unit of  Measurement   Nepal India Pakistan Bhutan  Sri   Lanka  China Japan Malaysia Singapore   Korea  Rep   Thailand Bangladesh   Skilled health  professional density,  2005–2013   Per 10,000  population   5.4 24.1 14 12.4 23.2 31.5 137.9 44.7 77.1 71.5 24.7 5.7   Maternal mortality ratio,  2015   Per 100,000 births 258 174 178 148 30 27 5 40 10 11 20 176   Skilled birth attendance,  2007–2017   % 58 86 55 89 99 100 100 99 100 100 99 50   Under-five mortality and  neonatal mortality rate,  2016   Per 1000 births 34.5 43 78.8 32.4 9.4 9.9 2.7 8.3 2.8 3.4 12.2 34.2   Health Service  Coverage Index, 2015   Index* 46 56 40 59 62 76 80 70 80 80 75 46   Financial protection,  2007–2015   % of population  spending large  health expenditure   27.4 17.3 1 N/A 2.9 17.7 6.2 N/A N/A 13.5 3.4 13.6   Mortality rate due to  unsafe hygiene, water,  and sanitation, 2016   per 100,000  population   19.8 18.6 19.6 4 1.2 0.6 0.2 0.4 <0.1 1.8 3.5 11.9   All vaccine coverage,  2016   % of population 25 76 53 90 99 99 93 99 88 97 95 93   Domestic general  government health  expenditure  2015   % of general  government  expenditure   5.5 3.4 3.7 9.1 7.9 10.1 N/A 8.3 12 12.9 16.6 2.8   Access to safe drinking  water, 2015   % of population 27 N/A 36 34 N/A N/A 97 92 100 98 N/A 56   Total health expenditure,  2014–2015   % of GDP 6.2 4.7 2.6 3.6 3.5 5.5 10.2 4.2 4.9 7.4 4.1 2.8   Total expenditure on  health per capita, 2014– 2015   US$ 135 267 129 281 369 731 3727 1040 4047 2531 600 88   Life expectancy at birth,  2016   Years 70.2 68.8 66.5 70.6 75.3 76.4 84.2 75.3 82.9 82.7 75.5 72.7   Source: WHO; UNICEF   Legend: Green-Amber-Red Scale, where dark green signifies best-in-class performance, while dark red signifies worst-in-class performance                 84     Education       Overview   Nepal’s education sector has made notable strides   in the past 20 years. Between 1991 and 2017, the   country’s net primary school enrolment rates grew   from 68.0% to 94.7%,71 making it one of the few   developing countries to reach near gender parity.   Education is a key priority sector for Nepal,   accounting for the largest share of the total national   budget at ~10.1%72 in FY2018/19, registering 11.8%   CAGR over the past five years (2014/15–2018/19) to   reach NPR134.5 billion (US$1.23 billion).73      Development of the sector appears to be a crucial imperative to drive Nepal’s progress from least   developed country status to a developing nation by 2022. Access to education is even more critical   given the country’s large youth base, with ~32% of its total population aged 14 and below.74   To support its vision, the Government of Nepal is pursuing revisions to its education policy aiming for   inclusiveness by making education up to secondary level compulsory and free.

This has led to an increase   in student mobility among the urban and wealthy population, with many youths moving to other   countries to study.   While the country has achieved near-universal enrolments at the primary level (135.4% in 2016), it   drops significantly at the secondary (69.5% in 2016) and tertiary levels (11.8% in 2016), indicating   substantial dropout rates at higher levels of education.

However, initiatives supporting this aspiration do not appear to be reaching target   areas, given the funding delays institutions face and coordination challenges among the main   stakeholders in the sector. This has placed Nepal at a disadvantageous position vis-à-vis other Asian   developing countries.

Prohibitively expensive fees and limited presence of                                                               76   UNESCO Institute for Statistics, Data for the Sustainable Development Goals by Country   77  UNESCO Institute for Statistics, Data for the Sustainable Development Goals by Country        87     private schools are resulting in inequitable access to education and widening the gap   between the haves and have-nots   ● Poor availability of funding and government support due to an inefficient industry structure,   red tape, and corruption    ● High dropout rates due to socioeconomic conditions and widespread poverty in rural areas,   resulting in children working in menial jobs instead of attending school and creating issues   such as child labor and child marriages   The government is demonstrating its focus on addressing these challenges during its tenure by   establishing actionable targets for the sector in the current and subsequent budgets.       Promise of Digital Initiatives in the Education Sector   Near-universal penetration of mobile and Internet and availability of low-cost smartphones and tablets   provide a favorable enabling environment for integrating ICT into education. Nepal’s large youth   demographic who are comfortable using technology stand to benefit greatly from technology-based   delivery and access to education.   The benefits of the use of digital technologies in education are well documented with many success   stories and proven results. Nepal should seek to learn from the multiple projects underway across   developing countries in Asia and Africa.   Nepal has launched a slew of technology initiatives, including strengthening ICT infrastructure at   schools and universities; ICT-enabled teaching and learning; and integrating education management   information system (EMIS) as part of the SSDP 2016–2023 Program.   However, stronger technology push coupled with skills development and awareness programs may   be required to address persistent challenges, strengthen institutional capacity, bridge the digital divide   in the country, and maximize the impact of ICT in the sector.   Nepal is actively pursuing ICT programs for education with progress in several areas:   ICT: A Key Component of the SSDP 2016–2023 Agenda   Key targets include:   ● Providing ICT teaching-learning materials to strengthen   interactive teaching approaches   ● Establishing ICT learning centers at model schools   ● Preparing ICT teaching and learning materials initially   for Science, Math, and English   ● Providing ICT infrastructure and teaching-learning   materials   ● Implementing the unified computerized accounting   software (CGAS) in the Ministry of Education system   ● Introducing school-based integrated EMIS, including an   Equity Index, school profiles, and unique student IDs to   enhance the effectiveness of governance and   management    Key achievements include:   ● Establishment of computer labs and   Internet connectivity in District   Education Offices (DEO) and selected   schools    ● Launch of websites by central   agencies, regional education   directorates, and 77 DEOs    ● Development of interactive digital   learning materials for students in   Grades 2 to 6 in Nepali, Math, English,   and Science      Open Learning Exchange (OLE) Nepal: Established in September 2007, OLE Nepal integrates technology in   classrooms and the teaching-learning process. Key programs include:        88     ● E-Paath: Interactive educational software that includes multimedia learning modules based on the   national curriculum of Nepal; developed 600+ learning modules for teachers   ● E-Pustakalaya: An open, digital library comprising 6,000+ books   ● Teacher training: Focuses on IT literacy, child-centric interactive teaching, and integrating ICT-based   instruction; has trained 600+ teachers in the program   ● Technology infrastructure: Helps install school network consisting of servers and Wi-Fi, and provide low-  power, low-cost, durable equipment; has deployed 5,000+ laptops in 100+ schools      OpenIDEO: An open innovation platform that works with local organizations in Nepal to provide funding and   support, targeting the education sector in rural areas. Key programs include:   ● Picosoft: Rural Internet service provider in Nepal which offers high-speed Internet services using Super   Wi-Fi (TV White Space) technology to schools in rural areas where cable and ADSL Internet are not   available; also provides state-of-the-art computer labs and develops localized content for ICT in education   in partnership with Kull Labs   ● REED Nepal: NGO that

universities in   urban areas lack proper facilities   and funding to maintain laboratory   materials and curriculum to keep   pace with new technologies   The government plans to   reduce the urban-rural digital   divide and improve   infrastructure through:    ● Use of new technology and   improvements to education   standards   ● Set up of Rural   Telecommunication Fund   to provide free high-speed   Internet services to   community schools   ● Use of wireless and satellite   technologies to connect   institutions’ IT infrastructure in   hard-to-reach remote areas   ● Deploy high-density networks   at urban schools and university   campuses to support the   uninterrupted running of   devices, IT tools, and   applications   Disparities in education development   and access   ● Huge differences in quality and   provision of infrastructure between   rural and urban areas, with   development mainly concentrated in   cities like Kathmandu   ● Even within cities, gaps exist between   private and public institutions, with the   former having superior quality of   education, teachers, and   infrastructure   ● Low number of private institutions in   urban areas and high fees make   private education inaccessible to rural   and middle-class students   ● Social inequalities prevent students   belonging to lower castes and   underprivileged groups from attending

structure:   ● Currently, the sector is supported by   the central government, with   regional/provincial governments   having limited control and resources   ● Red tape, corruption, and   bureaucratic processes exacerbate   the issue   In April 2018, the Minister for   Education, Science and   Technology unveiled a 10-  point, five-year roadmap   which includes structural and   organizational reforms to   improve the efficiency of the   sector   ● eGovernment solutions that   automate tasks undertaken by   public officials, reducing   spending leaks and improving   transparency   ● Introduce an automated,   mobile-based customer   management system for   institutions to file complaints   and track resolutions in case of   delays in receiving support   ● Use common Customer   Relationship Management   (CRM) and Enterprise   Resource Planning (ERP)   systems across departments   and industry hierarchies to   enable information sharing   Physical safety

The program helped more than 400,000 students and thousands of teachers in the learning process.      Entrepreneurship/Public-Private Partnerships   While the education sector in Nepal shows immense potential to grow, challenges related to the   country’s scale and diversity could impact its progress. Partnerships with technology innovators could   go a long way in addressing various challenges and improving the implementation of initiatives. The   government should consider the following approaches to create a conducive environment for   entrepreneurship in the sector:   ● Promote entry of edutech start-ups: Encourage private sector participation in the education   sector, particularly in higher education to boost competitiveness and innovation:  o Consider offering incentives, grants, subsidies and tax breaks to companies and start-  ups engaging in the education sector.   Solutions from start-up and niche online/ digital education providers should address specific   challenges facing the sector.

Other ongoing initiatives by   Vodafone in the region include Vodacom e-schools and the KA Lite open-source platform.   Expected Outcome: Vodafone is targeting to help three million children and youth through the   program by 2020.               97     Energy      A well-developed energy sector is critical for the sustainable development of the Nepali society. While   per capita energy consumption in the country is significantly less than its Asian peers, robust industrial   growth and rising per capita income has resulted in significant increase in energy demand. This trend   is likely to continue over the next few years.   Historically, Nepal has relied on traditional energy sources to cater to its energy requirements. Bio-mass   continues to remain the primary energy source for approximately 80% of the citizens, but the steady   rise in population, increasing energy demand and decreasing forest areas, raise concerns over the   availability of fuel wood energy. Other important sources of energy include oil and petroleum products   contributing 10% of energy requirements, followed by coal and hydro.   Severe power shortfall in Nepal in the past few decades has led to a chronic imbalance between power   supply and consumption. Electricity supply quality in Nepal is among the lowest in the world, ranking   137th out of 147 countries.82 Aggressive expansion in the country’s population, agricultural, and   industrial activities have resulted in higher demand for power, worsening the severity of power   shortages. Similar to other countries in the region, the rate of electrification in Nepal is approximately   76%. However, significant disparities in electricity access between rural and urban areas exist with only   61% of the rural population having access to electricity, compared to 94% of the urban population.83   Nepal is a net energy importer, with 34.76% of its energy needs imported from India.84 As energy   generation via the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) is insufficient to meet domestic demand, Nepal   supplements its energy sources by importing from India, and through Independent Power Producers   (IPPs). Nepal’s rich hydro resources are estimated to be able to support power generation up to 42,000   MW.85 However, by the end of 2016, its total installed hydropower capacity was only 802.4 MW,   equivalent to less than 2% of its total generation potential.                                                                           82 Asian Development Bank (ADB)  83 Energizing Development (EnDev)  84 NEA 2017  85 Asian Development Bank (ADB)        98        Recent Developments in the Energy Sector    The Government of Nepal continues to actively pursue measures to overcome load shedding and   energy shortage issues in the country. Following the appointment of a new director at the NEA and   strong government support, Nepal became load shedding free in May 2018 from improvements in the   efficiency of supply and demand management. Having resolved load shedding issues for both   household and industrial users, the NEA is currently focusing on maintaining consistent power supply   with quality and safety as priorities. The NEA is also taking bold steps to strengthen its financial position   through organizational restructuring exercises as well as introducing transparent transfer modality and   other measures to improve services, reduce power wastage, and collect outstanding revenues.   Recognizing the need to develop its energy sector to reduce poverty and reinvigorate the economy, the   government is prioritizing energy development projects with multiple targets set over the next few years.   It is also actively driving efforts to develop hydropower capabilities through initiatives such as the Nepal   Power Investment Summit 2018.   Additionally, the Nepal government is focusing beyond traditional energy resources. The government   intends to leverage its abundant natural resources such as, hydro, solar, wind, and bio-mass to meet   the country’s energy demands and reduce the power deficit. To promote and upscale the production of   renewable energy sources, the Nepal government formed the Alternative Energy Promotion Centre   (AEPC), supported by the Renewable Energy for Rural Livelihood (RERL) project.      Case study – Bhutan’s ambitious hydropower developments to become a net exporter of energy    Over a 10-year period (2005–2015), Bhutan, a developing nation with similar topography to Nepal, increased its   electricity production from 460 MW to 1606 MW,86 mainly generated through hydropower. Bhutan’s electricity   exports grew from US$78 million in 2005 to US$176 million in 2017, contributing to 40% of its total exports and   generating 25% of the government’s revenue.   Four out of five of its major hydropower projects are financed by the Indian government, with the fifth financed by   the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and loans from Indian banks. The investment arrangement helps to cover the   financial and construction risks of hydropower projects, with India committing to purchase surplus electricity   reflecting production costs plus 15%.87   Rapid development in the energy sector is reinvigorating Bhutan’s economy, with gross GDP projected to record   9.9% in the fiscal year ending 2018. Although current and future revenues generated from energy exports are   forecast to cover the cost of hydropower investments, the Bhutan government is taking measures to monitor its   hydropower-related costs closely. Under a 5-year plan, the government has stipulated that hydropower debt should   not exceed 40% of hydropower earnings, while non-hydropower debt is limited to 35% of GDP.      Challenges in Nepal’s Energy Sector   The Himalayas cover approximately 75% of land in Nepal providing the country with ample water   resources and a favorable terrain for electricity production. Despite its power generation potential, Nepal   is a net importer of electricity. In meeting the growing demand for energy, Nepal’s electricity imports   increased at an average annual growth rate (AAGR) of 20.4% between 2011 and 2016, while NEA’s   electricity generation grew at 0.3% annually over the same period.    Key hurdles facing Nepal’s energy sector include:   ● Acute power shortfall, particularly during the dry season when water flow drops, adversely   affecting hydropower generation                                                               86 Hydro World  87 Nikkei Asian Review, Aug 2017        99     ● Inefficiency in energy transmission through high technical and non-technical losses resulting in   one of the highest energy losses in the world   ● Inadequate energy preserving and storage facilities, which further worsen the issue of energy   security in the country.   ● High level of leakage and wastage due to theft   ● Underexploited hydropower capacity with Nepal only using a fraction of its commercially   exploitable potential   ● Despite its abundant hydropower resources, Nepal has one of the highest electricity tariffs in   the world   ● Regulatory barriers associated with foreign investments (including those in energy   development projects), and land acquisition (private landowners for construction of   transmission lines)   ● Inadequate financial and operational performance of the Nepal Electricity Authority      Energy in Nepal: Pain Points, Priorities, and Digital Solutions      Pain Points Government of Nepal’s Priorities  Digital as an Enabler   Inadequate power generation   ● Nepal has a high dependence   on energy imports from India as   the NEA only meets 40% of   Nepal’s energy needs (2017)    ● Energy generation in Nepal   fluctuates depending on water   flow due to heavy reliance on   hydropower, resulting in lower   supply during the winter when   demand is typically the highest   ● Increase electricity   consumption per capita over   the next 10 years from   110kw/h to 1500kw/h   ● Establish a center to   implement large-scale PPP   hydropower projects and   provide relevant transaction   advice. Additionally, the   government intends to diversify   power generation to include   other sources such as   biomass, solar, wind, and solid   waste    ● Digitally streamlined PPP   application processes to   mobilize foreign investment in   the development of large-scale   hydropower projects and high-  voltage transmission lines   ● Smart grid solutions to develop   necessary power distribution   infrastructure   ● Smart building/energy   management solutions for the   public sector and large   enterprises to reduce power   consumption       Limited rural electrification   ● Large disparity in electricity   access with only 72% of the   rural population having access   to electricity, compared to 96%   in urban areas   ● Complete electrification   throughout the country by   2021   ● Smart power (e.g., cloud-based   operating systems, applications   integration) can extend   electricity and energy reach to   rural areas through better   management    High transmission energy losses   ● Nepal has one of the highest   electricity output losses   globally, recording 22.9% in   2017 during the transmission   and distribution process   ● Technical losses such as   energy dissipation in the   ● NEA is leading several   projects to improve grid   infrastructure and increase   efficiencies including the    Smart Metering Smart Grid   ● Smart grids and Smart meters   to conduct system loss analysis   to reduce power losses by   leveling, reducing or improving   the quality and efficiency of   power flows        100     transmission lines and non-  technical losses such as faulty   meters and unmetered energy   are key contributors for the   output loss    Project and the GIS Smart   Grid Project   ● Advanced analytics solutions to   track energy consumption and   check power thefts   Inefficiency of the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA)   ● In FY2016/2017, the NEA   incurred a net loss of   approximately US$8.98 million   ● The increasing cost of power   purchased from IPPs could   destabilize the agency’s   financial position further    ● Concerns over the NEA’s ability   to meet contractual obligations   in power development projects   due to its financial standing    ● Measures to restructure the   NEA and improve the   efficiency of related   organizations   ● Plans to evaluate and adjust   electricity tariff rates, power   purchase rates, and wheeling   charges according to climate   and time, to reduce costs and   boost energy distribution   efficiency   ● Use of digital technologies in   meter reading collection   (smart meters), payment   collection, customers services   to improve operational   efficiency   ● Field force automation   solutions for optimal use of   field forces such as   technicians and meter readers      Case study: Digital tech addressing Brazil’s power theft crisis   The rising incidence of electricity theft in Brazil was costing its government billions in lost revenue. On average,   8% of energy in Brazil was being stolen from the grid each year, reaching a staggering 40% in some areas.    Solution: Siemens used the innovative Smart Meter software to access, collect, and process data from smart   meters, integrating the platform with the billing and management system to ensure efficient energy billing to users.   From the analysis of consistent data, Siemens was also able to identify the culprits as being a group of small and   mid-sized enterprises that were using stolen energy to reduce their overheads. By building complicated user   profiles, smart algorithms continuously compare an estimated consumption pattern to the amount of energy coming   from the grid. The system can also detect any anomalies in electricity use, which is then inspected. 88      Digital Initiatives Roadmap for the Energy Sector    The Government of Nepal should consider increasing its focus on digital investments in the energy   sector to maximize its ability to meet power demands and generation potential through the following   recommended initiatives:      1 Technology and   Infrastructure   2 Entrepreneurship/PPP 3 Talent and Skills   Development   ● Smart Metering   ● GIS Smart Grid Project   ● Pan-Nepal roll-out of   NEA’s- Any Branch   Payment System (ABPS)   ● NEA Official Mobile App   2.0   ● Smart Building/Energy   Management Project   ● Digitally streamlined   licensing and PPP   application processes      ● NEA e-Learning Platform   ● Contract Management   Information System                                                                  88 Siemens        101     ● NEA Field Force   Automation Solutions   ● NEA Customer Service   Portal   Technology and Infrastructure   The recommended initiatives to expand technology-based electricity generation and distribution   capacity in Nepal are as follows:      05.01.46.00 Smart Metering    Solution Introduction of smart meters can help reduce energy losses and improve   operational efficiencies through data and trend analysis.

During storms or technical failures, residents could lose power for extended periods.   USAID and its partners, the US Energy Association, Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, and Brcko Komunalna,   the electric utility serving the Brcko district of Bosnia and Herzegovina, joined forces to support a smart grid   technology pilot project between September 2015 and September 2016 that dramatically improved the reliability of   electricity supply in Brcko.   Schweitzer Engineering’s technology could instantly identify the location of power outages caused by storms and   technical failures on Brcko’s distribution lines. Previously, during a power outage, employees would have to drive   or walk along the power lines until they found the problem. The new technology not only reduces the number of   trucks and employees needed to restore services, but also improves customer services while reducing emissions   and costs associated with the use of diesel-powered backup generators. The project has reduced the frequency   and duration of electricity outages. Over the project period, customers on an affected line reported a 51% drop in   the number of outages, and 58% reduction – or about 8 hours – in the duration of outages compared with the same   period the previous year.89      Entrepreneurship/Public-Private Partnerships   The Government of Nepal acknowledges the importance of private sector involvement and investment   to fully develop Nepal’s hydropower capacity. In considering public-private partnerships (PPPs)   hydropower generation models, the government should also work to address constraints to private   investments in infrastructure, including regulatory barriers (e.g., simplifying licensing procedures, forest   clearance, and land acquisition procedures).   ● Digitally streamlined licensing and PPP application processes    A digitally streamlined PPP application process creates a conducive environment for private   sector mobilization and foreign investment in the development of large-scale hydropower   projects and high-voltage transmission lines.                                                               89 USAID        105      Additionally, the Department of Electricity Development should digitalize the process of   license allocation, in order to ensuring transparency and expedite the process.

The travel and tourism sector is a primary source of revenue, foreign exchange, and employment for   the country, contributing 7.8% to total GDP and 6.6% to total employment (translating into ~1,027,000   jobs) as at 2017.91 Given the sector’s direct positive impact on Nepal’s economic growth, the   government is stepping up efforts to promote travel and tourism through an array of market-friendly   policies, targeted marketing campaigns, and investment programs.    Key initiatives fall under its new policy, the National Tourism Strategy 2016–2025, which envisages a   fivefold increase in annual arrivals by 2025.92 An immediate focus area of the government is the Visit   Nepal 2020 program that aims to attract two million tourists and generate one million job opportunities   in the sector by 2020.93   Key Government Initiatives in Tourism:   National Tourism Strategy 2016–2025 Visit Nepal 2020   Envisages a fivefold increase in annual arrivals   and 9.29% growth in the sector’s contribution to   GDP by 2025. Also aims to add 4,000 hotel   rooms in Kathmandu by 2018–2019.   An immediate focus area of the government, Visit   Nepal 2020 aims to attract two million tourists   and create one million jobs in the sector by 2020.   Attracting Tourists from Regional Countries Partnerships with International Organizations   The Government of Nepal is encouraging   tourism, mainly from China, its largest tourist   The government has partnered with the World   Bank’s International Finance Corp (IFC) and   FMO, a Netherlands-based development bank,                                                               91   World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), Data Gateway, Nepal, https://tool.wttc.org.    92  Debanjana Bhattacharya, “Nepal Tourism launches new National Tourism Strategy”, Travel News Digest, August 30, 2016,   http://www.travelnewsdigest.in/2016/08/nepal-tourism-launches-new-national-tourism-strategy.   93   Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation, Tourism Vision 2020 Policy Document, May 2009.   https://tool.wttc.org/ http://www.travelnewsdigest.in/2016/08/nepal-tourism-launches-new-national-tourism-strategy      108     demographic, with the launch of its customized   website in Chinese language.    to build critical infrastructure including a US$6   million, green-field, three-star hotel in   Kathmandu, under the Fairfield brand.94   Encouraging Private Investments in the Tourism Sector    Driven by policies to boost the tourism sector, the hospitality industry in Nepal is in an expansionary   mode to accommodate the influx of tourists, with domestic and foreign investors announcing plans   to invest NPR60 billion (US$0.55 billion) in hotel projects across the country in 2016.    Prominent initiatives include the re-entry of Indian hotel chain, Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces, into   Nepal to operate a new lodge in Chitwan; ongoing construction by InterContinental Hotels and the   Sheraton Group in various regions in Nepal; and expansion of several local hotel companies   including Nepal Hospitality Group, Muktishree Group, and Glacier Hotel.         All figures are rounded. The base year is 2013; Source: World Travel & Tourism Council       Despite the government-led efforts, growth has been relatively slow, with tourist arrivals to Nepal at a   five-year CAGR of only ~4.2% (2013–2017), reaching 940,218 tourists in 2017,95 primarily owing to the   country’s underdeveloped infrastructure. To achieve its 2020 target of two million tourists, arrivals will   need to increase multifold, at a CAGR of 28.6%, requiring the government to intensify initiatives to boost   the sector.      Challenges in Nepal’s Tourism Sector    While the Government of Nepal aspires to strengthen the tourism sector’s productivity, income, and   image internationally, it continues to trail other countries in the region due to several inherent   challenges. In 2017, the sector accounted for ~7.8% of Nepal’s GDP, compared to 21.2% in Thailand,   11.6% in Sri Lanka, and 8.9% for countries in South Asia.96,97 Critical challenges in Nepal’s tourism and   hospitality sector include:                                                               94  The Himalayan Times, “IFC, FMO invest $5.5m in Fairfield Marriot Hotel”, June 21, 2017.   95  Nepal Tourism Statistics 2017 Publication, Ministry of Culture, Tourism & Civil Aviation.   96  World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), Data Gateway, Nepal.    97  South Asia includes India, Myanmar, China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Laos, and Nepal.   CAGR (2013–2017):  4.2%   CAGR (2017–2020F): 28.6%        109     ● Poor infrastructure to support tourism activities, including congested airports, poor quality of   roads and facilities, and weak IT infrastructure to support digital initiatives. The massive April   2015 earthquake that severely damaged many of the country’s historic sites further   exacerbate this problem   ● Lack of effective marketing and promotional activities to promote Nepal as a tourist   destination, possibly due to lack of funds   ● Tourists’ negative perceptions about safety and security risks due to past instances of political   turmoil, terrorism from neighboring countries, and natural disasters   ● Shortage of skilled and professional workforce, with most tour guides speaking very little   English, weakening the image of Nepal as a tourism destination internationally   ● Tourists to Nepal often complain about the lack of reliable, up-to-date information on tourist   spots, weather conditions, and activities available    ● Low focus on promoting domestic tourism, leading to lost revenue opportunities for the sector   The new government intends to revitalize the tourism sector during its tenure by rolling out a 100-day   action plan to address various challenges. Key areas under the action plan include:   Technology and Innovation   ● Digitalize and consolidate archives of national importance; catalog, tag, and upload 11,550 of 31,000   handwritten manuscripts, along with 655,000 images preserved at the National Archives   ● Form a think tank to gather suggestions and feedback regularly, and draft a concept paper on   mobilizing tourism attachés in five major markets   Administrative   ● Establish a secretariat to oversee Visit Nepal 2020   ● Form a committee to determine the actual contribution of the tourism sector to Nepal’s economy   ● Resolve the dispute over the use of modern materials to rebuild the archeological heritage monuments   and reconstruct.   ● Draft a formal Casino Act to streamline the gambling business and address the evasion of royalties   and taxes by casino operators    Infrastructure   ● Finalize the modality of the proposed Nijgadh International Airport in Bara within 100 days   ● Build a Guerrilla Trail and Yarsa Trail at least 10km long to offer a unique trekking experience   ● Develop model tourist destinations in all seven provinces of Nepal such as Ilam, Janakpur, Makwanpur,   Pokhara, Rupandehi, Mugu, and Kailali      Promise of Digital Initiatives in the Tourism Sector   Increasing connectivity driven by the proliferation of Internet and mobile devices and growing   affordability of digital technologies are transforming the nature of tourism and consumer demand.   Globally, ICT penetration is typically high in the travel, tourism, and hospitality sector, with the   automation of almost every process from research, price comparison and ticketing to booking and   reservations. Nepal can learn from other countries successfully implementing digital tourism   technologies to address the inherent challenges of its tourism sector.   Use of digital technologies in the tourism sector presents new revenue streams for Nepal through   increased profitability of its various stakeholders and generates significant benefits for society through   a reduction in environmental footprint, better safety and security, and cost and time savings. Nepal   appears to be in the early stages of ICT implementation. Currently, digitalization efforts are limited to   website development for the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation (MoCTCA) and Department   of Tourism while the hospitality industry operates basic CRM and revenue management systems. Nepal        110     has a long way ahead to gain measurable benefits from ICT through the large-scale implementation of   digital initiatives in tourism.         Tourism Sector in Nepal: Pain Points, Priorities, and Digital Solutions      Pain Points Government of Nepal’s Priorities Digital as an Enabler   Inadequate infrastructure   Airports   Nepal has only one international airport   – Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA),   considered among the worst in the world   according to tourist reviews98 due to:   ● Small size with just one runway and   limited capacity, resulting in   overcrowding and baggage collection   issues   ● The runway is developing cracks and   potholes, worsening congestion and   causing flight delays   ● Lack of basic amenities like toilets,   cleanliness, and e-ticketing services   ● Untrained and unskilled employees   The airport is the first point of contact for   tourists. As such, any negative   impression could hamper tourist growth   in the country.   Under the 100-day action plan, the   government has announced several   measures to revitalize its airport,   including:   ● Increasing the operation hours of   TIA from the current 17 hours/day   to over 20 hours/day   ● Completing 40% of the physical   infrastructure of Gautam Buddha   International Airport in Bhairahawa   and 50% physical progress by June   2018   ● Purchasing six Twin Otter aircrafts   to serve remote areas   There are also plans to complete   construction of the Pokhara Airport by   2020.99   ● Use of digital signages and   touchscreen kiosks to   provide tourism information   ● Advertise tourism-related   offers and alerts via free Wi-  Fi services at the airport    ● Digitize immigration,   Customs and visa   processes through the use   of automated gateways to   scan passports, visas, and   boarding passes   ● Use of e-visas and digital   immigration records to move   toward paperless   immigration processes   which are faster and could   alleviate congestion at   airports   Road infrastructure   ● Congestion in popular tourist areas   due to the poor quality of roads and   traffic mismanagement    ● Lack of last-mile connectivity in   remote, hard-to-reach areas    ● Weak regulation of driving licenses is   a major contributor to the presence of   unsafe, inexperienced drivers on the   road, presenting significant   reputational and safety risks   ● In Jan 2017, ~US$1.35 million   grant was allocated to procure a   150-kilowatt solar power plant to   power e-vehicles plying the World   Heritage Site of Lumbini, to reduce   congestion and pollution   ● The government has commenced   construction of the Kathmandu   Nijgadh Fast Track road   ● Use of smart traffic   management and intelligent   lighting control systems   for  real-time and predictive   traffic information   ● Vehicle tracking and   monitoring  using RFID tags   ● Use of GPS technology by   cabs transporting tourists to   check road conditions                                                               98   Dr Perry Haan, “Tourism issues involving Nepal’s economy”, Watertown Public Opinion, August 17, 2017.    99  Address by the Right Honorable President of Nepal, Mrs Bidya Devi Bhandari, to the Joint Session of both Houses of the   Federal Parliament, May 21, 2018.        111     Facilities   ● Shortage of tourist facilities like   ATMs, information centers, currency   exchanges outside mainstream   tourist spots   ● Inadequate information on health,   hygiene, and ecology   ● Limited connectivity in popular   trekking areas, resulting in the   inability to track tourists in case of   emergencies   ● Under the Visit Nepal 2020   campaign, the government is   investing in the development of   additional tourist facilities and   infrastructure   ● Equip self-service kiosks in   tourist centers   ● Enable booking through   mobile and web channels   ● Install Wi-Fi hotspots   ● Develop websites and   portals with comprehensive   tourism information   4. IT infrastructure to support   digitalization   ● Inability to perform digital payments   due to poor integration between   payment systems of banks, mobile   wallets, and merchants; and lack of   facilitation for foreign currency   payments   ● Highly fragmented databases and   poor integration between airports,   tourism authorities, travel agencies,   and hotels   ● In May 2017, Nepal Rastra Bank   (NRB) reviewed its retail payment   systems to identify regulatory gaps   and barriers, as well as to develop   a national retail payment strategy,   to support digital payments   ● Implement centralized IT   systems such as Global   Distributed Software (GDS)   and reservation   management systems to   connect all licensed   agencies with the   government to enable   information sharing   Limited tourism information availability     ● Lack of information on tourism   destinations, health and hygiene,   natural hazards, changes in   biodiversity, and ecology   ● Tourism websites, books, and   brochures are limited; and those that   are available are scattered, not   updated regularly or reliable As   tourism is an information-intensive   business, poor data access could   weaken Nepal’s position in the global   tourism industry.         ● Nepal Tourism Board (NTB) has   launched www.welcomenepal.com,   its official tourism website, with   detailed information on tourist   attractions, activities, events,   climate, and local transport options   ● Develop an official website   and mobile application for   the NTB with regular   updates on attractions,   weather, travel,   accommodation, and e-  ticketing   ● Equip tourist centers with   self-service information   kiosks, digital signages, and   maps   Lack of effective marketing strategies   Despite its rich cultural heritage and   terrain, Nepal is not at the top of the   travel list for most tourists owing to   several factors:    ● Lack of promotional activities   advertising Nepal as a tourism   destination   ● The government has introduced   several tourism campaigns   including Visit Nepal 2018,   Campaign HAN, and Himalayan   Travel Mart 2018   ● Launch a customized website in   Chinese language to attract   visitors from China who form a   majority of Nepal’s tourists   ● Use augmented reality apps   to provide tourism   information, navigation,   guides, and translations   ● Virtual reality technology to   recreate tours, showcase   accommodation, and   advertise hotels   http://www.welcomenepal.com/      112     ● Lack of opportunity to fully capitalize   on the country’s mountaineering,   pilgrimage, medical tourism, and   ecotourism features, indicating lost   revenue channels   ● The government’s inability to   diversify tourism products, possibly   due to lack of funding   ● Poor grievance-handling for tourists   across multiple channels such as   email, social media and phone.   ● In 2017, the NTB signed up with   BBC World, Reuters, and   TripAdvisor to display promotional   videos of Nepal through the   media channels   ● Deploy online marketing,   SEM/SEO tools including   targeted ads for travelers   ● Social media marketing,   peer reviews, and user-  generated content build   brand value and attract   visitors   ● Automate customer service   and outsource grievance   handling to specialized IT   providers   Shortage of skilled workforce in the tourism sector   As the majority of the country’s skilled   talent have migrated overseas for work,   Nepal’s tourism sector is forced to hire   unskilled people from rural areas with   little experience; gender equality issues   and socio-cultural factors also prevent   women from working in the sector   ● Nepal Academy of Tourism and   Hotel Management offers   Bachelor’s and Master’s Degrees in   Hospitality Management, as well as   Bachelor’s Degree in Travel and   Tourism   ● The Government plans to set up   training centers to coach tourist   guides, and a Tourism University to   offer higher education in tourism to   meet human capital demand   ● Use of automated tour   guides that connect to   visitors’ mobile phones and   provide historical   information, reducing the   need for physical tour   guides   ● Monuments and heritage   sites can be connected with   sensor/IoT technology, QR   codes, and RFID tags to   provide information    Low focus on domestic tourism   Majority of tourism policies in Nepal   target foreign tourists with little being   done to promote domestic tourism,   leading to:   ● Growth in outbound tourism as   Nepalese travel overseas during the   holiday season (October–November)   ● Loss of opportunity to tap into the   rising disposable incomes and   spending power of Nepalese   ● Government-led initiatives to   improve infrastructure and   marketing/promotional activities   could benefit both international and   domestic tourism   ● Ongoing programs by NTB to boost   domestic tourism such as Travel   Nepal and Photo Nepal to promote   Nepali tourism using photography;   Safa Nepal to foster cleanliness   around heritage sites, and Chulo   Nepal to publicize Nepali food and   hygiene conditions   ● Create websites/helplines in   local Nepali languages to   cater to the diverse ethnic   local population    ● Train local entrepreneurs,   particularly in rural tourists   hotspots like Manang,   Mustang, Rara Lake, and   Ghandruk, to boost   domestic tourism         Digital Initiatives Roadmap for the Tourism Sector   The Government of Nepal should consider formulating a comprehensive model for the tourism industry,   encompassing infrastructure, attractions, accessibility, amenities, and ancillary services, along with key   technology tools.            113           Following digital initiatives are identified to unlock the potential of Nepal’s tourism sector:      1 Technology and   Infrastructure   2 Entrepreneurship/PPP 3 Talent and Skills   Development   ● Welcome Nepal Website   and Mobile App 2.0   ● Electronic Visas &   Immigration Process   Improvement   ● Multilingual Helpline   ● Augmented and Virtual   Reality tours   ● Electronic Tour Guides   ● Omnichannel Marketing   ● Tourist Security   Infrastructure   ● Entry of travel startup and   foreign companies   ● Public private investments   and partnerships with   sharing economy players   ● Training programs for local   guides   ● Tie-ups with educational   institutions          Technology and Infrastructure   The following initiatives seek to address the gaps in insufficient tourism infrastructure.

Stakeholders:    o Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation   o Department of Tourism  o Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transportation  o Department of Roads   Timelines: Medium Term      Outcome:    o Improve tourist experience, thereby attracting more tourists to Nepal  o Job creation on account of new business models and services such as Hop-on Hop-off   buses and ride sharing.      Talent and Skills Development   The tourism sector in Nepal is unorganized and highly fragmented with several small-scale players.   Due to its non-technical nature, most workers in the sector, while skillful, come from rural areas and do   not have proper education.   As part of its goal to formalize the sector and improve infrastructure, the government needs to introduce   language training and ICT education programs to improve the quality of human capital.   ● Training programs for local guides   Create a structured training program for local tour guides in the areas of communication   (English and other languages), technical know-how (e.g., operate trekking equipment), driving,   and professional etiquette, among others.      Stakeholders:    o Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation   o Department of Tourism  o Ministry of Education, Science and Technology  o Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training   Timelines: Medium Term   Outcome:    o Improve tourist experience as tour guides become more professional in their conduct  o Increase the skills base and employability of the local workforce   ● Tie-ups with educational institutions   Set up specialized learning institutes that offer courses in hotel and travel management to cope  with demand for travel professionals. These institutes can consider alliances with existing hotels  to provide practical, on-the-job training to existing employees in the tourism sector.   Stakeholders:    o Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation   o Ministry of Education, Science and Technology  o Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training  o Universities        119     Timelines: Long Term   Outcome:    o Support the “Visit Nepal 2020” vision of creating one million jobs in the sector by 2020         Case Study: Government-led initiatives and digital programs improving India’s tourism infrastructure    Government Schemes   “Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik”   (UDAN)   A regional airport development and connectivity scheme aimed at   improving transport connectivity to several major tourist spots, including   investments in last-mile road and air connectivity in underserved areas.

Source: Press Information Bureau, Government of India, January 12, 2018        120     Finance      Despite the size of its economy, Nepal has a relatively diversified financial services sector. As at July   2017, there are 28 commercial banks in Nepal with a paid up capital of NPR8 billion, 40 development   banks, and 32 finance companies. As one of the largest contributors to Nepal’s economy, the financial   services sector contributed 23% of GDP in FY2016. It is also one of the largest employers in the country   with commercial banks alone employing nearly 30,000 people in July 2017.    A key driver for the financial services sector is the high volume of remittances sent to Nepal by the   thousands of Nepalese working abroad since the 1990s. Remittances in 1995 accounted for 1.3% of   GDP, growing to an estimated US$6.6 billion, about 31.3% of the country’s GDP in 2016.100   While the sector consists of a diverse range of financial institutions, Nepal has yet to reap the benefits   of a mature financial services sector as a large section of Nepali society remains unbanked and unable   to access these services. Only 47.72% of adults in Nepal are formally banked through an account with   a financial institution.101 As a result, Nepal continues to be a cash economy with most transactions   occurring outside its financial system.    Nepal’s sizeable unbanked population is its biggest hurdle to achieving financial inclusion in the country.   In addressing this issue, the Government of Nepal and the Nepal Rastra Bank – Central Bank of Nepal   (NRB) should consider promoting financial inclusion initiatives as a critical growth enabler and   undertaking policy interventions to encourage banks and other financial institutions to expand their   presence in remote areas. An increase in the number of financial institution branches could improve   financial access in Nepal.      Challenges in Nepal’s Financial Sector    A large unbanked population and predominantly cash economy are the biggest barriers to the   development of the financial services sector in Nepal. More than half of Nepali citizens do not have a   bank account, with consumption of financial solutions remaining low even for people with access to   financial services.                                                                   100 World Bank    101 World Bank        121     Fast Facts   45% of Nepali citizens are   formally banked   Only half of bank account   holders withdrew money   from their accounts in the   past year   15% of salaried employees   receive their wages through   a bank account   9% of Nepali citizens own   debit cards   1% of Nepali citizens own   credit cards   16% Nepali citizens have   made or received a digital   payment       Source: World Bank, 2017   Banking fees, low literacy levels, and inaccessibility of bank services in rural areas due to poor   infrastructure are vital factors mainly hampering the uptake of formal financial services in Nepal. Lack   of legal identity documentation has also been reported to be a barrier to creating bank accounts.       Source: Global Findex Database – World Bank   Overall, the financial ecosystem in Nepal is still in its infancy due to several challenges hindering its   adoption:   ● Sizeable unbanked population due to a multitude of issues including:   ‒ Difficulty in accessing physical bank branches (especially in remote, rural areas). As at   March 2018, only 394 of the 753 Local levels formed under the new federal structure   have bank branches. Additionally, ATM and commercial branch penetration in Nepal is   significantly lower than that of most other countries in the region           122     ‒ High cost of financial services and lack of proof-of-identity (or know your customer,   KYC) documents limiting access to financial services for the poor and deprived sections   of society   ● Underdeveloped digital financial services ecosystem with low credit and debit card   penetration, low use of digital payments, online and mobile banking, and restrictive   government policies (e.g., low maximum limit of digital payments)   ● Widespread preference for informal financial channels (e.g., informal remittance transfer   systems) that results in reduced resources for the Government to make productive   investments, encourages tax evasion, and negatively impacts governance and exchange   reserves   ● Lack of financial and digital literacy   Source: World Bank, 2016; * Sri Lanka data is for 2015       Promise of Digital Initiatives in the Financial Sector   With Internet penetration rate at 63%, Nepal is well positioned to benefit from digital financial services.   These solutions (e.g., mobile/Internet banking, mobile wallets, online digital payments) have the   potential to address challenges such as difficulties accessing banks and the high cost of services.   Globally, financial services institutions, IT companies, and telecom operators are joining forces to   increase digital inclusion to drive socioeconomic growth. Given the nearly ubiquitous mobile penetration   in Nepal, intelligent finance solutions combining digital technologies and telecom operators’ nationwide   presence can be a feasible way to boost financial inclusion in the country. Nepal should learn from the   success of mobile wallets in many African nations to expand digital inclusion and socioeconomic growth.       Development of the digital financial services ecosystem at existing banks and financial services   institutions is integral to driving all aspects of the economy. In 2002, Kumari Bank pioneered digital   payment services in Nepal with the introduction of Internet banking services for its customers. In   recognizing the proven opportunities digital payment services offer, more digital solutions are beginning   to become available in Nepal from traditional financial institutions and fintech start-ups such as eSewa,   IMEPay, Khalti, and iPay.    The Government of Nepal considers financial inclusion as a critical lever to driving socioeconomic   growth, and as a result, has undertaken these recent measures:   ● FY2018–19 budget allocation to digitize government payments and revenue collection (e.g.,   tax payments via mobile application)   ● Launch of opening bank accounts campaign targeting every Nepali citizen   ● Formulating and implementing necessary laws and regulations for electronic transactions to   facilitate and govern digital payments       Case study: Kenya M-Pesa transforming the economy through mobile money services102   Objective: Using mobile money technology to offer financial services in rural and marginalized areas.   Model: The M-Pesa mobile payment platform launched in March 2007 as a product developed by Vodafone, in   partnership with Sagentia, by integrating a mobile wallet with Safaricom’s rating, billing, and provisioning systems.   The onboarding of customers on the platform was achieved by replacing the SIM of registered Safaricom users   with the M-Pesa enabled SIM. Users load money into the mobile wallet by depositing cash with an agent to obtain   e-Float currency. The digital currency is then used for payments or transferred to other users through encrypted   SMS.                                                               102 Vodafone; Safaricom; MIT        123     The platform currently acts as a mobile wallet offering money deposits, payments, balance checking, cash   withdrawal, and international money transfer services at a minimal cost. Besides Kenya, digital wallet services are   also available in Tanzania, Afghanistan, India, Romania, Egypt, Albania, and South Africa.   M-Pesa’s success in Africa can be attributed to its focus on micropayments, targeting consumers at the base of   the banking sector pyramid. By offering convenient digital money transfer regardless of the value of the transaction,   M-Pesa has achieved widespread adoption throughout the financial ecosystems in its markets.   Before M-Pesa was introduced in Kenya, the nearest bank was on average 9.4 km away from users. As at 2017,   96% of Kenya’s population can access financial services using their mobile phones, with an M-Pesa agent an   average of 1.4km away.   In the first half of 2017, transactions through M-Pesa amounted to 48.76% of Kenya’s GDP. By the end of 2017,   Vodacom processed US$7.3 billion worth of M-Pesa transactions globally per month.    Today, its widespread usage in Kenya has been credited with raising 2% of Kenyan households out of extreme   poverty through access to mobile money services between 2008 and 2016. It also plays a crucial role in offering   opportunities to small businesses as well as a range of financial services such as international transfers, loans,   and health provisions using mobile.      Financial Sector in Nepal: Pain Points, Priorities, and Digital Solutions      Pain Points Government of Nepal’s Priorities Digital as an Enabler   Difficulties in accessing banks   ▪ As at 2017, about 81%103 of   Nepal’s population lives in rural   areas, with 20% of Nepali   adults citing the distance they   need to travel to banks as the   main reason for not opening a   bank account   ▪ Ensure BFIs establish rural   branches first to be eligible to   set up outlets in urban areas   ▪ Offer interest-free loans to   assist BFIs to expand into   remote districts   ▪ Increased adoption of digital   transactions and payments to   minimize the need to visit bank   branches   Large unbanked population   ● Only 40% of Nepali citizens are   formally banked   ● 26% of the adult population in   Nepal are illiterate, impairing their   ability to engage with financial   services   ● A quarter of the adult population   lack a citizenship certificate,   making them ineligible to apply   for formal banking channels   ● Mostly homogenous products   offered by financial services   providers (FSPs) do not meet the   needs of consumers across   various segments   ● Low-income consumer market   with highly seasonal and irregular   ● Introduction of microfinance   institutions in Nepal to target   the financially excluded,   particularly in rural areas   ● NRB is currently implementing   a five-year strategic action plan   (2012–2016) with financial   inclusion as a strategic priority   ● Introduction of an e-mapping   system to prioritize approval of   new bank branches or channel   points in unbanked areas   ● Launch digital payment systems   in Nepal to help Nepali citizens   leapfrog conventional banking   systems to the digital payment   system   ● Promote convenience of digital   payment systems to build   adoption momentum in Nepal   o With the adoption of digital   payment methods, the distance   between end users and the   nearest bank will no longer be   an inhibiting factor with the   integration of formal financial   services                                                               103 World Bank        124     incomes have unique needs for   FSPs   High fees incurred from banking services   ▪ Banking services in Nepal   charge relatively high fees for   financial services.      ▪ Consider reducing transaction   service charges to encourage   digital payment adoption   ▪ Offer subsidies to banks to   offset the costs incurred   through payments   ▪ Adoption of digital processes   throughout the financial system   to streamline processes, and in   turn, reduce the cost of banking   services at financial institutions    Preference for informal remittance methods   ● Informal channels to remit funds   to Nepal, such as the hundi or   hawala system which is popular   among Nepalese overseas   mainly due to the  hefty fees   incurred through formal   channels   o Foreign Exchange   Management Department   (FEMD), under the NRB,   regulates the entire remittance   industry in Nepal   ● Digitalization of payment modes   through partnerships with   financial institutions to reduce   the cost of remittance  and   encourage more Nepalese to   remit money digitally   Slow user adoption of digital platforms   ● Complex user interface   ● Language barriers   ● The complexity of products   offered   ● Actively encouraging the   adoption of digital payment   systems via development of a   common platform for   strengthening digital payment   system in the South Asian   Association   for Regional Cooperation   (SAARC) region   ● Reduction in the number of   steps to make payments and   reload mobile wallet   ● Simplification of user interface   ● Platforms available in multiple   languages   Maximum limit for digital transactions   ● NRB has introduced various limits   for digital payments such as   credit/debit card, mobile banking,   Internet banking and mobile   wallet restricting the payments   that can be made digitally as well   as the remittance amounts from   abroad   ● The transaction limit for mobile   payments has been set   NPR10,000 (US$146) a day, in   stark contrast to M-Pesa’s   maximum transaction of US$686    ● NRB has expressed that the   limits may be adjusted to   accommodate industry   requirements    ● NRB should increase the limit   on digital transactions to   encourage more transactions   ● Currently Citizen Certificate   (Nagarikta) Database can be   taken as reference for KYC   until Digital National ID rollout.   Possible policy reform might be   required to take this into action.      Digital Initiatives Roadmap for the Financial Sector    Digital offers a plethora of opportunities in driving financial inclusion, from improving access to financial   services to improving tax collection. The Government is taking measures toward achieving this, such        125     as digitalizing all government transactions to boost the adoption of digital payments. It has also started   distributing social security allowances and all other government-to-citizen payments through banks to   encourage financial inclusion.      1 Technology and   Infrastructure   2 Entrepreneurship/PPP 3 Talent and Skills   Development   ● National Payment   Gateway   ● Credit Ratings (Individual   or Corporate Accounts)   ● Database management of   Nepalese migrants    ● Mobile Wallet Services   ● Encourage digital   payments in Nepal   ● Development of single   window for business and   industry promotion   ● Development and   promotion of ecommerce   and ITeS ecosystem   ● Digital Payments   Campaign       Technology and Infrastructure   The following initiatives targeting financial services sector can be implemented in Nepal to boost   financial inclusion:       07.01.62.00 National Payment Gateway    Solution Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) is mulling over introducing a national payment   gateway to monitor digital payment system and transactions nationwide.    National payment gateway will integrate different payment channels to simplify   the electronic payment process and lower the cost of interbank transactions in   Nepal. It will also encourage foreign payment systems to join the national   payment gateway. Over the past few years Nepal has witnessed a sharp rise   in the mobile payment system and made rapid technological advancements,   making it the right time for NRB to introduce the national payment system.   Stakeholders ● Ministry of Finance   ● Nepal Rastra Bank   ● Ministry of Communication and Information Technology   ● National Information Technology Center    ● Financial Comptroller General Office   Timelines   Outcomes   Immediate   ● National payment gateway will reduce the cost of interbank financial   transactions, thereby making financial services more affordable   ● Will help in developing a safe and efficient national payment system   ● Drive adoption of digital financial transactions in Nepal           126     07.01.63.00 Credit Ratings (Individual or Corporate Accounts)   Solution Currently Nepal does not have a formal credit rating system for individuals and   corporate accounts. As Nepal’s financial ecosystem matures, its necessary for   the country to develop a robust credit rating system, which can be leveraged   by financial institutions to make informed decisions while providing loans to   individuals and corporates, thereby reducing loan defaults and non-performing   assets.   Ministry of Finance can consider establishing a government backed credit   bureau under the aegis of Nepal Rastra Bank, or encourage the entry of   private credit bureaus like Equifax, TransUnion and Experian.     Stakeholders ● Ministry of Finance    ● Nepal Rastra Bank   Timelines   Outcomes          Medium-Term   ● Enable financial institutions to make informed decisions for sanctioning   loans   ● Reduce loan defaults and non-performing assets            07.01.64.00 Information management system of Nepali migrant workers   Solution Overseas employment is one of the main factors for international migration in   Nepal. The Department of Foreign Employment (DoFE) issued 786,564 new   permits, for more than 100 destination countries as per labor migration for   employment status report 2015/2016 – 2016/2017.    Migration of people poses a complex global challenge to the government   which has policy implications like labor market participation and integration   and also border management.   Relevant high quality data will help in designing implementing and evaluating  policies that will be beneficial for humanitarian, social and economic  wellbeing of the country and migrants.  Furthermore, prospective migrants can register online through web-based  migrant data management system and get help in emergency situations.

Entrepreneurship/Public-Private Partnerships   The Government of Nepal should undertake the following policy interventions to create an enabling   environment for digital financial services:      07.02.65.00 Mobile Wallet Services   Solution Globally, telecom operators play an essential role in the financial services sector   with the rollout of digital financial services such as M-Pesa and mobile wallets.    NRB and Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA) should work together to   draft a policy framework that allows the involvement of telecom operators and IT   companies in promoting financial inclusion in Nepal. Telecom operators can be   given the licenses to operate e-wallet/digital financial services using existing telco   KYC for authentication purposes.   Stakeholders ● Ministry of Finance    ● Ministry of Communication and Information Technology   ● Nepal Telecommunications Authority   ● Nepal Rastra Bank   Timelines   Outcomes   Immediate    ● Help in achieving SDGs related to the capacity of domestic financial   institutions to encourage and expand access to banking, insurance and   financial services for all (SDG Target 8.10)   ● This will enable telecom operators to leverage their existing nationwide   network of retailers to increase the reach of financial services in remote   / rural areas.          07.02.66.00 Encourage digital payments in Nepal   Solution Only 15% of Nepali wage earners receive their salaries in their accounts. The   Government of Nepal should consider introducing policies that encourage   employers (public and private sectors) to transfer wages and other payments   directly to employees and suppliers using financial services.   The government should mandate the compulsory transfer of salaries beyond a   minimum threshold level to bank accounts. Until the rollout of a national biometric   ID card, the onus of helping employees in opening bank accounts should lie with   the employers. Similar policies can be considered for other private and public   sector payments.

This entails the review of current policy and regulatory frameworks,        129     strengthening digital payments regime for on-line transactions along security   and interoperability dimensions, formulating policy incentives for the growth of   ITeS sector, skills development, strengthening of intellectual property   protection regime, reviewing consumer protection laws and strengthening   delivery and fulfillment logistics infrastructure, among others. Initiatives in the   ecommerce domain can further be complemented by developing related skills   among small businesses, promoting digital entrepreneurship and innovation   management, developing government e-procurement and e-trade networks to   encourage enterprises and entrepreneurs to adopt online transactions, and   raise the overall digital literacy and general awareness of all stakeholders   about e-commerce.

Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize  the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development     Talent and Skills Development   In addition to infrastructure support, talent and skills development is essential to ensuring the successful   adoption of digital payments in Nepal. To support the digital payments ecosystem, the country requires   skilled programmers, financial technology experts, and operational support teams. Retailers also need   to be sufficiently trained in managing digital payment systems to ensure the smooth flow of payments.   These challenges can be addressed by training the local talent pool through partnerships with digital   payment services providers to familiarize them with the system.   The government could also launch educational campaigns to build awareness among consumers on   the benefits of digital payments and financial inclusion to ensure the effectiveness of the other initiatives   implemented.      07.03.69.00 Digital payments campaign    Solution Advertisements on social media and radio/television that highlight the advantages   of using digital payments.

However, it is modernizing rapidly with   urban population growing 6% annually since the 1970s.104    Urbanization in Nepal is dominated by a few large and mid-sized cities with population concentrated   mostly in the Kathmandu Valley. The urban population distribution is uneven across the country with   high urban growth in the Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara Valley, Inner Terai Valleys, and several markets   and border towns located on highways.   Urbanization is likely to accelerate in the future, as Nepalese increasingly move from rural areas to   cities in search of better opportunities and facilities. This trend toward urban migration presents both   opportunities and challenges for urban development and municipal authorities:    ● Urbanization as an engine for growth: To contribute to more sustainable growth across   regions, it is essential for Nepal to develop other urban towns to decongest the more popular   cities (e.g., Kathmandu, Pokhara)       ● Need for investments in urban infrastructure: Rapid urbanization can place immense   pressure on an already weak urban infrastructure (especially water supply, sewage and   drainage, waste management, public transport, and public safety). Urban development   authorities and municipal corporations in Nepal need to systematically upgrade infrastructure   to cope with the surge in demand                                                                104   Asian Development Bank        133     Urban development and municipal authorities in Nepal need to focus on the following five infrastructure   development pillars to deal with growing requirements and citizen expectations:                            Challenges in Nepal’s Urban Infrastructure    The wide deficits in basic urban infrastructure and quality benchmarking in leading cities in Nepal are   highlighted by the poor quality of water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, transport, and   safety.    Nepal ranks poorly on urban infrastructure when compared with other countries in the region. Nepal   was ranked 100 among 140 countries on infrastructure in the Global Competitive Index 2015–2016.105   The gaps in urban infrastructure have been a result of poor urban planning, inorganic growth of urban   cities, and below-par quality standards – subsequently devastated by the twin earthquakes in 2015.   State of Urban Infrastructure in Nepal     Water and   Sanitation   Despite an abundance of fresh water resources, most cities in Nepal   battle with chronic water management challenges   ● Nepal has 2.7% of fresh water reserves globally which makes   the country the second after Brazil with the highest water   reserves106   ● Low quality and quantity of drinking water in cities with only   32.9% of households in the urban Terai regions having access   to piped water supply107   Sanitation infrastructure in Nepal is also poor compared with its peers    ● Only 56.1% of urban households have access to a sanitation   system with only 88.2% of households having access to a   toilet108        Waste   Management   Unplanned waste management system with poor collection and open   dumping practices:                                                               105   Global Competitive Index 2015-16, World Economic Forum   106  International Institute of Water Management   107 National Urban Development Strategy (NUDS), 2017  108   National Urban Development Strategy (NUDS), 2017   Pillars for Urban Development in Nepal   Roads and   Traffic  Disaster   Management                      Waste   Management  Water &   Sanitation   Public   Transport         134     ● The Kathmandu Valley discards about 1,000 tons of solid waste   per day of which only 900 tons are collected   Lack of landfill sites for waste management:   ● Of the 58 municipalities in Nepal, only 6 have sanitary landfill   sites while only 5  practice controlled waste dumping109        Public   Transport   Public transport in Nepal is still in its nascent stages with limited   investments from the Government of Nepal in developing the sector.   Road transport (buses) system is unorganized and managed by private   operators resulting in low reliability and quality of services.   Kathmandu Valley and a few developed metros are in dire need of a   public transportation system that is reliable, safe, and comfortable. The   government should consider creating a multi-modal transport system   consisting of bus, rail and/or metro networks.        Road and   Traffic   Lack of resources and investment as well as topological structure (hilly   terrain) are major challenges for road infrastructure improvement.    Construction and maintenance of roads remain a challenge. Narrow and   unplanned roads, unreliable public transport, and increasing private   ownership of vehicles are worsening traffic congestion and air pollution.        Disaster   Management   Nepal has a high vulnerability to disasters due to its topology and fragile   geology. Natural disasters such as floods and landslides are a regular   phenomenon in Nepal. Globally, the country ranks 4th, 11th, and 30th in   its level of vulnerability to climate change, earthquakes, and flood risks,   respectively.110   Disaster planning and management are critical functions for Nepal’s   urban development and municipal authorities due to looming dangers   associated with natural disasters.

The 2015 earthquake   highlighted several shortcomings   including outdated systems,   poor data management and   weak search, and rescue   capacity   ● Nepal is developing a new   disaster management act, and   national strategic plan of action,   in line with the framework   adopted in Sendai, Japan   ● The government formulated a   Post Disaster Recovery   Framework (2016-2020) and   Post Disaster Needs   Assessment to provide a   systematic, structured, and   prioritized framework for   implementing recovery and   reconstruction, following the   2015 earthquake   ● Settlements at high risk   relocation and unified settlement   development working method   2075   ● National Disaster   Management Plan for   effective disaster   preparedness, response,   recovery, and mitigation    ● IoT based early warning and   monitoring systems for   disaster management and   planning   ● Emergency   telecommunications   equipment for better disaster   response and recovery   ● Use of drones for delivery of   relief supplies, damage   assessment, and   communications      Promise of Digital Initiatives in the Urban Infrastructure Sector   Use of digital technology to improve the functioning and efficiency of cities and municipalities has   become a well-known strategy for urban planning worldwide. Nepal can pick up valuable lessons and   best practices from ongoing programs demonstrating positive results in Asia’s developing countries.   The proliferation of enabling technologies such as analytics, mobile, cloud, and broadband, as well as   declining cost of sensors, hardware, and IoT devices, are also expected to create significant   opportunities for Nepal to integrate digital technology for infrastructure development.   As part of its National Urban Development Strategy (NUDS) 2017, the country has laid down plans to   modernize urban planning including land use, housing, transportation, and energy, and construct smart   cities in Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, and Kirtipur.   This is likely to enable Nepal to improve efficiencies, enhance visibility, boost governance mechanisms,   and build robust connectivity, and open up new investment opportunities for infrastructure and real   estate development in the country.   Intelligent urban planning is expected to translate into measurable benefits   The global smart waste management market is estimated to be worth US$2.37 billion by 2021, at a robust CAGR   of 16.9% over 2016–2021.113                                                               113   Smart Waste Management Market by Solution, Markets and Markets, August 2016        138     In order to provide universal access to water and sanitation by 2030 globally, every US$1 invested in water and   sanitation will generate US$4.30 in economic returns through increased productivity.114   The global Intelligent Transportation Systems market is estimated to be a US$72.32 billion industry by 2022,115   contributing to improved road safety, greater sustainability of vehicles, and environmental protection.

Shenzhen’s land size is less than 2,000km2, with just over 600km of   roads. It has the highest vehicle density in China with an average of about 530 vehicles per km.   Solution: Shenzhen’s Traffic Police Bureau collaborated with Huawei to implement innovative ICT solutions to   manage road congestion, under an initiative known as Traffic Brain, which included:   ● Ultra-broadband traffic network: Leverage Huawei’s high-speed Optical Transport Network (OTN)   that enables transmission at 400 Gbit/s, data storage of over 20 PB, and data processing capacity for   tens of billions of elements to support the data needs of Shenzhen’s police network   ● Data analysis of city-wide traffic: Installation of a road monitoring system that can detect traffic   conditions through license plate identification, video surveillance, and other methods with a detection   accuracy rate of up to 95%. Collects 700 million pieces of vehicle data monthly, and integrates nearly   40 TB of data from 78 internal and external system databases   ● AI-assisted law enforcement: Use of AI technology and big data analytics platform to check for traffic   violations, processing up to 10 million images per day. The technology enabled the department to   identify vehicle features and traffic violation images at an accuracy rate of more than 95%   ● Crime fighting efficiency using big data: Use of a big data platform and traffic analysis modeling   engine by the Traffic Police Bureau to generate reports for disqualified driving, drunk driving, and cars   with multiple violations. Intelligence could be generated within 30 minutes, from seven days previously   ● Increase in road capacity: Set up of a real-time surveillance system for all signal-equipped   intersections in Shenzhen, and precise traffic signal control mode based on the traffic time-space   software engine. Collection of data via converged checkpoints and roaming police cars to establish   lanes through intersections and organize traffic flow through big data management, enabling the city   to increase road capacity by about 8%   Results: Investigated and closed 37,055 cases of serious violations and detained 874 vehicles with fake or   cloned license plates. Vehicles with cloned or fake license plates, scrapped vehicles, and vehicles with multiple   violations have now almost disappeared from the streets of Shenzhen.        146     Going forward: The Shenzhen Traffic Police Bureau plans to develop smart police terminals based on 5G   technologies; conduct analysis of historical data by means of traffic simulation to predict traffic volume in each   corner of the city and; invest CNY3 billion (USD453 million) to upgrade all checkpoint systems, including an   improved high-definition video system, so that its coverage rate will exceed 70%.         Entrepreneurship/Public-Private Partnerships   ● Ride Sharing   Ride sharing platforms have the potential to emerge as a strong alternative to the weak public   transport system in Nepal. The government should encourage the entry of ride sharing service   providers like Uber and Ola. Alternatively, municipal corporations can also consider developing   their own ride sharing platforms to ensure efficient utilization of existing taxis.       Stakeholders:   o Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transportation   o Department for Transport Management   Timelines: Immediate   Outcome:    o Reduce passenger wait times and vehicle pollution  o Improve traffic conditions by reducing the number of vehicles on roads  o Allows taxi drivers to work shorter shifts  o Greater security of passengers due to real time monitoring and tracking of vehicles   ● PPP for urban planning and infrastructure   Undertake public-private partnerships for urban planning and infrastructure, including offering  incentives, preferential procurement terms, and tax free investments to the private sector   For disaster management, partner with local NGOs and international organizations in areas  such as aid programs, disaster planning, relief efforts    Stakeholders:   o Ministry of Home Affairs  o Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation  o Ministry of Communication and Information Technology   o Department for Transport Management  o Survey Department  o Nepal Telecommunications Authority   o Council of Technical Education and Vocational Training  o Nepal Army/ Nepal Police/ APF  o Local levels  o NGOs/ INGOs  o ISPs   Timelines: Medium Term   Outcome:    o Gain access to capital and new technology  o Improve service delivery efficiency  o Distribute risks between the government and private sectors       Selected examples of smart urban infrastructure projects in Nepal:        147     Ncell initiatives in disaster management   In July 2016, NCell signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Department of Hydrology and   Meteorology (DHM) to send early warning alerts through SMS to its customers living in areas with a high risk of   flood and landslides, including West Rapti, Narayani, Kankai, Koshi, Bagmati, Karnali, Babai, and Kamala River.   ● DHM was tasked to provide SMS content to Ncell, which would be triggered based on water levels in   rivers. Ncell would immediately send early warning SMS from short code numbers based on the real-  time situation. Upon receiving the message about the dangerous water levels, people could then move   to government-designated safe locations. Once the water levels returned to normal, SMS alerts would   be sent again to inform the people that there is no immediate risk   Ncell also initiated various steps to assist disaster victims as part of its CSR efforts. Initiatives included:   ● The contribution of NPR 201 million and basic utilities, following the torrential rains that triggered   landslides and flooding in 2017   ● An offer of bonus talk time to Sindhupalchowk’s flood and landslide affected customers   Multi-level automated car parking system in Dharmapath and Teku   Construction of an automated parking system in Kathmandu Metropolitan City within two years at the cost of   NPR90 million under a PPP model.      Talent and Skills Development   Illiteracy is a major challenge in the country, and may become a barrier for the effective implementation   and operation of smart solutions in transport, water and sanitation practices, waste management, and   disaster preparedness. The government should consider the following projects:       08.03.80.00 Disaster Management Training   Solution Training government employees at all levels – central, state, district, and village –   in protocols, use of technology and emergency communications during disasters.   Also provide training, drills, and exercises to the military and police in rescue and   search operations   ● Allow participation of the private sector and NGOs in the training   programs   ● Promote greater awareness and sharing of best practices through   conferences and workshops   ● Leverage regional Emergency Operation Centers (proposed above) to   impart training   Stakeholders ● Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training   Timelines Long-Term   Outcomes ● Increase the employability of population and encourage job creation   ● Improve awareness and preparedness among general population            148     Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Mapping in Digital Nepal      In global context SDGs has been defined as development that meets the needs of the present without   compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The Sustainable Development   agenda rests on three pillars - Economic, Social and Environment. For implementing SDGs framework,   there are four core factors at stake, which are as follows - Identification of priorities, Intervention of   policy instruments, Investment of resources and Institutional readiness. SDGs helps to promote a long-  term approach to addressing global challenges that are not typical just for some countries but are faced   by most and require joint actions. Having a long-term agenda and targets that has been agreed upon   by 193 countries, promotes sustainability of actions and reinforces commitment of the states regardless   of changes in the national political context.    Based on the Millennium Declaration of the UNGA (September 2000), Nepal pledged to adopt the eight   MDGs. The SDGs eventually replaced the MDGs, hence continuing Nepal’s commitment to it. As   presented by the Sustainable Development Goals National Report117, Nepal aspires to emerge as an   inclusive, equitable, and prosperous middle-income country by 2030 with the spirit of a welfare state.   The country aims for sustainable poverty reduction and human development with low vulnerability and   higher human security and has set the goal of graduating from LDC status by 2022. Nepal has been an   active member of the global initiative for sustainable development goals and has taken up the SDGs as   a national priority for the nation. Nepal has made significant progress on meeting the targets of the   SDGs, and most of the national projects have embedded the SDGs into their outcomes. The Digital   Nepal framework attempts to do the same in aligning the Digital Nepal initiatives with the SGDs118. The   Digital Nepal Program will be a catalyst in helping Nepal achieve its vision of meeting the SDGs by   2030. The Digital Nepal Program will accelerate Nepal’s socio-economic growth and will significantly   contribute towards the long term development of Nepal.                                                                         117 NPC, Sustainable Development Goals 2016-2030, National (Preliminary) Goals  118 See Annexure V for the SDGs Mapping with Digital Nepal Initiatives        149     Recommendations      1.0 Governance framework for Digital Nepal   The success of the Digital Nepal Program will remain contingent upon an operational and delivery   framework anchored in sufficiently mandated institutional arrangement befitting the scope and depth of   the program. The overarching scope of the program with all its attendant ramifications offers a   challenging context within which the institutional and delivery arrangements need to be positioned.       Along those lines, we envision an institutional and delivery framework for the execution of the Digital   Nepal Program that would provide for the highest level of political oversight and a mechanism for   operationalizing political and bureaucratic commitments that have been forthcoming since its   conceptual phase.      The diagram below depicts the recommended institutional arrangement with the Prime Minister chairing   the Digital Nepal National Steering Committee for driving the mission agenda and the Minister for   Communication and Information Technology serving as the Vice-Chair. The Member Secretary of the   Steering Committee shall be the Secretary of the Ministry of Communication and Information   Technology. Comprising of high level sectorial government representatives as members, the National   Steering Committee (NSC) will be primarily responsible for providing leadership and oversight in relation   to ensuring congruence of the program with national development objectives, goals and priorities.       The steering committee will be supported by the National Implementation Committee (NIC) under the   chairmanship of the Secretary of the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology. The   Member Secretary of NIC will be the IT Division Chief of the Ministry of Communication and Information   Technology. NIC will be primarily responsible for delivery, execution and coordination support for   projects and activities carried out under the Digital Nepal Program with periodic reporting arrangements   to the National Steering Committee. NIC will oversee the activities of sector specific sub-committees to   be formed at sectorial agencies covered under the Digital Nepal program. The Committee will meet on   a quarterly basis and the coordinator of each sub-committee (sector) will provide updates on the   execution and progress of the initiatives in the respective sectors. They will also discuss inter-  departmental issues and potential areas of collaboration.       A Digital Nepal Program Management Office (DNPMO) will also be created to support the NIC in terms   of directly overseeing execution of projects and activities, providing project support and coordination   services as well as carrying out monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities. This committee will be led   by the IT Division Chief of the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology. This committee   will also comprise IT, governance, program management and monitoring experts along with   representatives from the private sector and development partners.      As indicated earlier, it is recommended that dedicated functional entities in the form of sub-committees   be created within the lead agencies representing each of the sector identified to serve as sector specific   implementation units of the Digital Nepal Program. Sectorial agencies identified as key stakeholders   must reflect activities relating to the Digital Nepal Program in their strategic frameworks, annual plans   and resource allocation priorities. These sector focused committees will hold monthly meetings to   discuss the progress of the selected initiatives, issues and challenges in their execution.           150     Digital Nepal –    National Governance Committee   Digital Nepal – Steering Committee   Agriculture Healthcare Education Energy Tourism Finance  Urban   Infrastructure  Digital   Foundation   Strategic Level   Implementation   Level   National Digital Healthcare   Platform   Next-Generation Digital   Facilities (Healthcare)     Electronic Health Records   2.0   Mobile Health Units    e-Maternal Care   Drones for Delivery of   Emergency Medical Supplies   Centralized Telemedicine   Center   Smart Classroom    OLE Nepal 2.0   Online Learning Platform    Rent-a-Laptop Program   EMIS 2.0   Centralized Admission   System   Biometric Attendance and   CCTV Cameras   Mobile Learning Centers in   Rural Areas      Smart metering   GIS Smart Grid Project   Pan-Nepal roll-out of NEA-   Any Branch Payment   System (ABPS)   NEA Official Mobile App 2.0   Smart Building/Energy   Management Project   NEA Field Force Automatic   Solutions   NEA Customer Service   Portal   NEA e-Learning Center    Contract Management   Information System      Welcome Nepal Website   2.0   Welcome Nepal Mobile   App   Electronic visas &   Immigration Process   Improvement    Multilingual helpline   Augmented and Virtual   Reality Tours   Electronic tour guides   Ominichannel marketing   Tourist Security   Infrastructure   National Payment   Gateway   Credit Ratings (Individual   and corporate Accounts)    Database Management of   Nepalese Migrants    Policy interventions to   allow telecom operators   to offer mobile wallets   Encourage digital   payments in Nepal   Development of Single   window for Business &   Industry Promotion   Development and   promotion of eCommerce   Water ATMs   Smart metering for water   Intelligent Waste   Management    Automated waste sorting   Municipality Mobile   Application   Connected public transport   Public/ Transport mobile   app   Multi-model Smart cards   Intelligent traffic   management    Intelligent parking lot   management    Intelligent toll booths   Establish the Internet as an   essential service   Improve spectrum   availability, Management   and Optimization   Take the lead in 5G Networks   deployments  National Optical Fiber   Network  High-speed Internet   connectivity for efficient   delivery of Public services  Special Economic Zones for   ICT sector  Government of Nepal App  eGovernance 2.0 …….

Budget and time overruns of IT and automation projects in   government agencies are all too common. In addition, cases of misalignment of automation project   activities with expected outcomes also abound pointing towards lack of a strong project oversight and   monitoring mechanism. These challenges will be substantially compounded in the context of an all-  encompassing mission like Digital Nepal if the projects executed under the program are not subjected   to structured monitoring and continually evaluated for their impacts.  Along those lines, it is strongly   recommended that a strong monitoring and evaluation framework be developed and built into the overall   structure of the initiative. The following exhibit depicts key elements of a broad M&E framework for the   Digital Nepal Program.      Proposed Digital Nepal M&E Framework                        152     3.0 Review of policy and regulatory environment  Policy and regulatory environment constitute one of the key components of critical success factors   underpinning the Digital Nepal Program. The largely cross-sectoral nature of the program with its   potential for transformative impacts across sectors demand a thorough analysis of policy and regulatory   environment, identification of any gaps therein and re-orientation of policy instruments towards the goals   and objectives of the program.   It is recommended that the following policy areas be thoroughly reviewed in relation to creating an   environment conducive to the success of the Digital Nepal Program:   3.1 Intellectual Property Rights policy regime   The successful execution of Digital Nepal Program is expected to spur innovation leading to the growth   of knowledge services industry resulting in intensified creation of digital assets. In order to ensure that   digitally enabled creation of value across socio-economic spectrum remains sustained by being   anchored on strong incentive regime, it is imperative to assess Nepal's IPR policy and regulatory   framework in relation to the demands of the emerging digital economy. This will be particularly important   from the perspective of creating an ecosystem favorable to innovation, fostering a vibrant start-up and   entrepreneurship environment.    3.2 Data protection, security and privacy   Expanding digital footprint emanating from the program and the extent to which all this stands to   permeate social and economic interactions would invariably underscore the need for a robust   framework for ensuring trust in digital interactions for all the stakeholders involved. Data protection,   security and privacy constitute three crucial pillars for strengthening the overall trust regime in an   emergent digital economy. It is imperative therefore that a thorough assessment of existing policy   provisions on data protection, security and privacy in Nepal is carried out with a view to creating an   ecosystem favorable for the uptake of digital solutions deployed through the Digital Nepal Program.   3.3 Telecommunication and broadband    Connectivity will be one of the foundational pillars of the Digital Nepal Program. Even though overall   connectivity footprint in Nepal is growing, thanks in part to increased competitive intensity in the sector,   observations reveal that its expansion has largely remained skewed in distribution and issues across   access, availability and affordability dimensions continue to remain challenging. For example, retail   broadband prices continue to remain high in relation to Nepal's GNI per capita and a sizable portion of   Nepal’s population is yet to enjoy the benefits of quality broadband connections including access to 4G   networks. Given that one of the program's key aspirations is to take a regional lead in the 5G   deployment space, it is important to assess overall policy and regulatory environment governing the   telecommunication and broadband sector in Nepal, especially along spectrum governance, competition   and universal service obligation dimensions.   3.4 Digital payments policy and regulations   Among others, the extent to which digital enablement of financial transactions among participating   entities become available and used will increasingly underpin the value that Digital Nepal Program will   ultimately be able to generate across Nepal's socio-economic spectrum. Creation of a nationwide digital   payments regime is one area that will need focused policy attention going forward. The need for a highly   secure, interoperable and efficient digital payments system cannot be overemphasized if significant   benefits are to be reaped from the digitalization of services. Among others, key questions that need to   be asked in this area are a) whether or not policy and regulatory frameworks exist in the country to   enable secure and interoperable digital payments regime and b) whether or not the existing policy and   regulatory instruments are in sync with frenetic pace of innovation happening in digital payments   domain.        153     3.5 Private sector participation    The Digital Nepal Program envisages the private sector as one of its key actors. The success of the   program will, to a considerable extent, be dependent upon an efficient public-private partnership   arrangement in the execution of the program.  Measures must be undertaken to ensure that avenues   of private sector participation in the program are clearly identified. Along those lines, it will be important   to review existing public procurement policies and practices with a view to lowering barriers to entry of   Nepali private sector in projects implemented under the ambit of the Digital Nepal Program.    The Digital Nepal Program is expected to spur domestic demand for digital services of varying nature   presenting the private sector with the opportunity to grow and be competitive. The role of the private   sector will remain crucial in driving innovation and entrepreneurship and providing significant value to   the Nepali economy within the program framework. One of the policy areas that need to be looked into   is whether there exists a favorable innovation and start-up ecosystem in Nepal.      4.0 Promote Digital inclusion  Digital Nepal must be an all-inclusive program in order for it to generate far reaching outcomes and   impacts that it envisages to generate. As it is, exclusion in access to digital technologies and resources   has its roots in socio-economic fault lines that exist in Nepali society. This underscores the need for   targeted strategies aimed at enabling the excluded and marginalized communities and individuals to   participate in the emerging digital economy. Digital inclusion of individuals result in inclusion in   information, process and opportunities in all areas. Thus, it can be a tool for the government to become   closer to its citizens and make state deliveries more effective. It can minimize inequality and promote   efficiency by providing access to basic information and services.    As digital technology diversifies and grows in an unanticipated speed, the magnitude of the digital divide   among the users of technology is simultaneously creating a newer status quo. It is crucial to harness   the potentials of digital inclusion of the excluded and marginalized groups not only to achieve the goals   of growth, equality and cooperation, but also to tackle the deep structures of exclusion. The exclusion   is more critical for individuals with a disability, old age, remote residency and women restricted by social   norms. Simultaneously, measures must be taken to strengthen the availability of accessible Knowledge,   Information and Communication for Persons with Disabilities in alignment with the principles enshrined   in The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), of which Nepal is a signatory.   Among others, the program must factor in the complementarity between physical accessibility and   ICT/digital accessibility and seek to formulate strategies accordingly. The focus should be on   strengthening broad based digital accessibility relating to the application and integration of enhanced   and technology- facilitated processes to meet the specific needs of those who are usually excluded.                 154     5.0 Future proofing the mission: emerging and disruptive technologies and   business models  The frenetic pace of innovation happening in the digital arena stands to further deepen transformative   processes in the way governments and societies function around the world in the days ahead. For   example, AI, robotics and automation stand poised to fundamentally redefine job markets, productivity   and economic competitiveness with profound implications for developing world economies. Similarly,   IoT offers compelling prospects of game changing levels of context awareness embedded in systems   that will fundamentally reshape our collective abilities to analyze and respond to events. Crypto   currencies hold the potential of profoundly shaking up the financial sector where the traditional bastions   of fiscal regulatory power might find themselves woefully ill-equipped to stay relevant. The emerging   block chain technology offers the promise of exponentially enhanced trust perception in digital   transactions while ushering in an era of smart contracts with far reaching and game changing   implications. In addition, the growth in near ubiquitous connectivity is also fundamentally reshaping   business models -ushering in a whole new concept of sharing economy.   The strategic framework underpinning the Digital Nepal Program must factor in the role these   transformative innovations will ultimately play in Nepal's digital economy space. While concrete plans   need to be in place to assess the implications and challenges of these innovations and their attendant   disruptive potentials, the need for strategies aimed at harnessing tremendous prospects offered by   these technological innovations should attract a large share of policy attention in the days ahead.   Specific programs need to be launched to promote innovations around these emerging technologies.   Research capacities of universities need to be strengthened and the building of robust business   incubation, innovation and start-up ecosystem must be accorded a very high strategic priority if Digital   Nepal mission is to be future proofed. Equally important is the need to factor in the role that big data   analytics can play in fundamentally reshaping policy making processes.       6.0 Mapping digital initiatives to all 3 tiers of government   The success of digital Nepal mission will remain solely contingent on the extent to which this broad   framework outlining the digital initiatives are mapped out to new political reality of Nepal – i.e., Nepal’s   transition from unitary system of government to a federal one with Provincial Government and Local   Level constitutionally empowered to take full charge of their socio-economic development agenda. It is   imperative therefore to ensure that strategies are developed to fully on-board Provincial Government   and Local Level as key pillars of mission execution and concrete follow-up measures are taken to map   digital initiatives to all 3 tiers of the government.               155     Annexure I: Integrated Action Matrix                        Digital Foundation            156     DI-ID   Digital Initiatives   (DI)    Programs /   Projects    Prio  rity  Indicators Assumptions   Expected   Outcome   Time-   frame   Timeline    (Year)   Focal   Agency   Supporting    Actors          1 2 3 4 5     01.01.01.00 Establish the   Internet as an   essential services   P2 Broadband   Internet access   classified as an   essential   service   Wide-scale political   support exists for   the initiative   Internet   becomes   universally   available within   the country   Medium  -Term   1 1 1   MoCIT MoLJPA, NTA, ISPs,   Telecom Operators    Major Activities          01.01.01.01 Carry out policy, regulatory and legislative reforms needed to ensure that access to the   Internet is established as an essential service, Internet access is broadly available and   individuals are protected against unreasonable restriction on access to information and   Internet and freedom of expression on Internet is protected.   1     MoCIT NTA   01.01.01.02 Review and incorporate necessary changes in the Broadband policy and other Policy   documents to secure congruence with constitutional provisions on the Internet.   1     MoCIT NTA   01.01.01.03 Formulate and launch mission oriented programs to ensure universal access to the   internet throughout the country in alignment with the National ICT Policy and  National   Broadband Policy.    1 1   MoCIT NTA   01.01.01.04 Review Universal Service Obligation (USO) provisions and market mechanism to ensure   on-demand access and availability of Internet access to all desiring users throughout the   country.     1 1  MoCIT NTA   01.01.01.05 Set a timeline by when the Internet as a essential service could be ensured and   incorporated into the legal provisions of Nepal.       1  MoCIT House of Representatives,   MoLJPA   01.01.01.06 Strengthen mechanism to ensure that proper recourse is available for consumers if they   are denied QoS commitments made by the Internet and Telecom service providers.       1 NTA MoCIT, ISPs, Telecom   Operators        157     DI-ID   Digital Initiatives   (DI)    Programs /   Projects    Prio  rity  Indicators Assumptions   Expected   Outcome   Time-   frame   Timeline    (Year)   Focal   Agency   Supporting    Actors          1 2 3 4 5     01.01.02.00 Improve spectrum   availability,   management and   optimization   P1 Spectrum   governance and   allocation   regime   significantly   improved to the   satisfaction of   key   stakeholders   - Spectrum issues   continue to receive   timely policy   attention by   MoCIT/NTA   - Wide stakeholder   participation in   spectrum   governance and   allocation strategy   is ensured   All citizen be   covered by   reliable mobile   broadband   services   Medium  -Term   1 x x x x MoCIT,   NTA   Service Providers    Major Activities          01.01.02.01 Take stock of underutilized or un-allocated radio frequency spectrum in consultation with   the industry and concerned stakeholders with a view to inform policy decision on efficient   spectrum regulation.   1     NTA MoCIT   01.01.02.02 Review the National Frequency Plan with a view to ensuring the availability of spectrum   to service providers and its allocation in a transparent manner through market related   processes.

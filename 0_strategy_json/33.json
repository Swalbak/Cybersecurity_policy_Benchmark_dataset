Action Plan (non-public) 49 Glossary 51 4 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V The national cybersecurity strategy for the period up to 2025 sets out the guidelines underlying the projects that the Government intends to implement in order to secure cyber- space at all levels. It goes hand-in-hand with the digital transformation that characterises our economy and our society. We are going through exceptional times in more than one way. We are witnessing the large-scale deployment of new technologies such as the fifth generation of mobile net- works or new applications in the field of arti- ficial intelligence. Existing digital infrastruc- tures in Luxembourg, Europe and the world have been consolidated, enabling greater con- nectivity for more people with undeniable gains in reliability and availability, even though much remains to be done to ensure that no one is left behind in this digital revo- lution. At the same time, cybercriminals and other threat actors are taking advantage of these changes and using the new develop- ments to increase attempts at intrusion, sabo- tage or online theft. Building on the experience acquired in the context of the third strategy adopted in April 2018 and mindful to taking into account the numerous facets of cybersecurity, the new strategy was drawn up by a multidisciplinary working group chaired by the High Commission for National Protection and consisting of rep- resentatives of the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs, the Ministry of Economy, the EIG SECURITYMADEIN.LU, the Department of Media, Telecommunications and Digital Policy (SMC), the State Intelligence Service, the Luxembourg Regulatory Institute (ILR), the Directorate of Defence, the Government IT Centre (CTIE), the governmental CERT (GOVCERT) and the National Agency for Information Systems Security (ANSSI). The aim of the cybersecurity strategy is to enable all actors to participate fully in a digi- tal society and to access the new technologies in a secure environment. The measures that will be implemented in this context are designed in the first place to ensure that Internet users are aware and to strengthen their trust in the digital world. Furthermore, they consist in consolidating and strengthen- ing the security and resilience of digital net- works and infrastructures. Lastly, the strategy seeks to take account of cybersecurity as a factor of economic attractiveness and to com- plement the strategy of dynamisation that characterises the digital sector towards the continued development of a high-perfor- mance digital economy.

All these crises have complex but undeniable relationships with information and communica- tion technologies and systems: society’s depend- ence on the Internet and connectivity is growing. At the same time, the attack surface is becoming more diverse with the introduction of new tech- nologies, while geopolitical rivalries are impact- ing the security of the digital space. Malicious acts are undertaken by a multitude of state and non-state actors against diverse targets: govern- ment administrations, businesses and citizens are victims of such acts. With the massive introduction of fifth generation (5G) mobile data transmission, which promises to revolutionise connectivity worldwide, both for industrial and mission-critical applications and users/citizens, society will benefit from unprece- dented speed of access to information and data availability, through a sharp increase in data rates, increased responsiveness thanks to a sharp reduction in latency and a significant improve- ment in connectivity capabilities. The transition to increasingly mobile technologies – the wide- spread use of smartphones and other portable, ever more affordable technologies is just one example – and the ever-increasing reliance on cloud computing solutions, as well as the contin- ued development of the Internet of Things mean that human societies are increasingly connect- ed but at the same time increasingly depend- ent on the availability and reliability of their data. Advances in quantum computing research suggest that the race between encryption and decryption technologies will continue. This underlines the collective responsibility of political actors, ICT experts and industry, as well as citizens of all ages to become more independ- ent and to use technology wisely, and even to demand trusted services and tools that meet their needs. The dissemination of disinformation, hate speech or conspiracy theories undermines citizens’ trust in their governments and often threatens social peace. Influencing operations – for political dest- abilisation purposes as well as for the purpose of increasing private income – such as micro-target- ing on social networks, were unimaginable a few years ago: they have now become commonplace in the contemporary landscape of threats. The development of a new national cybersecuri- ty strategy is a prime opportunity to review the state’s posture on information security aware- ness. In a spirit of openness and collaboration, the new strategy has been submitted for con- sultation to stakeholders at the national level: relevant ministries and administrations, private companies, professional information security researchers and civil society organisations. While technological progress harbours risks, it also bears opportunities to be seized. The use of blockchain technology for many different appli- cations makes it possible to develop trust solu- tions in political contexts where trust can be a scarce commodity. This Cybersecurity Strategy outlines how an integrated and comprehensive information security approach enables the gov- ernment, private enterprises and citizens to fully seize the opportunities offered by the digital revolution. Improvements in the performance of cyber intrusion warning and response systems offered by, among other things, advanced algo- rithmic applications make life more difficult for advanced persistent threat groups; measures for mitigating denial of service attacks help thwart or cushion the disruptive effect on networks, applications, or other digital services. Luxembourg will engage more proactively in positive cooperation initiatives at global level, such as in the United Nations Secretary-General’s Digital Cooperation Action Plan. At European level, the EU’s digital hub is in a process of con- solidation in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The national cybersecurity ecosystem is boom- ing. This strategy is part of a continuous process of improving coordination and procedures in the field of information security and builds on the lessons learned from the three previous national strategies. · I N T R O D U C T I O N : M A I N T R E N D S A N D T H R E AT S · 7 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V I I . N AT I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R AT E G Y I V ( 2 0 2 1 - 2 0 2 5 ) 8 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V The first obligation of the State is to protect its citizens and guarantee their fundamen- tal rights and freedoms. In a society that is permanently connected to the Internet and multi-dependent on computer networks and systems, there are many risks and threats to living together and to the rights of each individual. The protection of this civic space in line with all human rights – civil, political, economic, social, cultural, and environmen- tal – is the first objective of this strategy. As formulated by the United Nations in its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, “leaving no one behind”, this fundamental principle of the social contract applies both in cyberspace and in the physical world. This pillar encompasses both data protection and privacy as well as the security of – already omnipresent – virtual meeting places, which have become truly indispensable in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. S T R AT E G I C O B J E C T I V E S : Luxembourg’s fourth national strategy builds on the foundations of the three previous strategies. It comprises three strategic objectives, which each have several strategic priorities. Multiple concrete and measurable actions, which are set out in an internal monitoring table (available upon request from info@hcpn.etat.lu), are grouped under each priority. I. Building trust in the digital world and protecting human rights online II. Consolidating the security and resilience of digital infrastructures in Luxembourg III. Developing of a reliable, sustainable and secure digital economy 1 .

Developing professional curricula adapted to today’s society and raising awareness of cybersecurity professions makes this area tangible for citizens. This will make it easier for young people in the process of obtaining their certificates or studies, as well as for adults in the process of retraining, to design a digital career and project themselves into the future. Curricula and research plans are developed under points 4 and 5 of this strategy. • Diversity and inclusion will be promoted in the field of cybersecurity, in support of initiatives such as Women in Digital Empowerment or civil society projects, in particular to encourage people from population groups that are under-repre- sented in the sector (including women and girls, as well as people of migrant back- grounds or beneficiaries of international protection) to pursue training or careers in cybersecurity. • Cybersecurity and online safety aware- ness will find their place in the context of the inter-ministerial working group for digital inclusion, which targets audiences that are far from the digital sphere. The subject is also addressed in the “digital confidence” strategic focus of the national action plan for digital inclusion and is a fundamental element of education for digital citizenship. 10 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V I.5 PEN-TESTING, BUG BOUNTIES AND RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE OF VULNERABILITIES I.6 COMBATING CYBERCRIME I.7 SECURE DEMOCRATIC AND CIVIC PARTICIPATION • The Government will propose the neces- sary legislative changes and initiatives to make possible or deepen different approaches in order to improve cyberse- curity by using the collective intelligence of security researchers, private companies active in the search for vulnerabilities and any users who discover a security breach. The possibility of creating, in the near future, a platform at GOVCERT.LU that encourages researchers to report bugs, especially those associated with vulnera- bilities, will be analysed. • A coordination body will be established between law enforcement and cyberse- curity entities, in accordance with their respective mandates and missions. This forum will, inter alia, provide an avenue for strategic and operational analysis of the impact of the threat of organised crime and cybercrime activity and the interrelationship between cybercrime and cybersecurity. It will also seek synergies in combating different forms of Internet crime, including the fight against sexual exploitation and abuse of children. • Cooperation with Europol/EC3, as well as with other relevant international organ- isations (e.g. Interpol, UNODC) will be strengthened, taking into account the needs and capacities of the different actors involved. • Emphasis will be placed on the prevention of influence operations and disinformation conveyed by digital means (hybrid threats). Guidelines will be drawn up for businesses to detect and counter the consequences of crises caused by such campaigns. 11 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V II.1 STRENGTHENING THE SECURITY AND RESILIENCE OF THE STATE’S DIGITAL PROCESSES AND INFOR- MATION AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS II.2 SECURE AND CONTROLLED USE OF THE PUBLIC CLOUD AT STATE LEVEL • The security and resilience of digital pro- cesses and the underlying critical informa- tion and communication systems will be strengthened: - the information portal guichet.lu and myguichet.lu - the State’s electronic messaging plat- form - the videoconferencing system - the remote access system - fixed and mobile terminal equipment - the DNS system. • The opportunity of implementing an encryption solution for the exchange of sensitive messages, classified up to RESTRICTED level, will be evaluated as part of a Proof of Concept. • The opportunity of implementing a nation- al secure instant messaging solution, ini- tially intended for government depart- ments and agents, will be examined as part of a Proof of Concept. The “LuxChat” solution will be based on a federated archi- tecture with end-to-end message encryp- tion and will be implemented via open- source software. • In order to respond to the challenges of digital technology in a coordinated and thoughtful manner, the government adopt- ed a cloud strategy in 2016. Investments and the establishment of central services at State level and making them available to State customers via private cloud services such as “Govcloud”, are the preferred route. • Given the advances in the world of digi- talisation, the use of the public cloud is becoming essential in certain areas. The governance framework for the use of pub- lic Cloud services at State level or in the provision of public services will be defined, considering, in particular, the aspects of security, data protection, location and retention, dependencies and the potential risks of infringement upon government sovereignty and essential services. The availability, integrity and confidentiality of data are the objectives of cybersecurity: faced with the numerous cyber incidents observed daily, as well as the risks and threats observed on the horizon, the Government has chosen to pri- oritise strengthening the security and resilience of digital infrastructures as a second strategic objective. The protec- tion of vital infrastructures and essential services is one of the key activities of this objective, as is the wide range of activities of the various operational entities. 1 . 2 O B J E C T I V E I I : S T R E N G T H E N I N G T H E S E C U R I T Y A N D R E S I L I E N C E O F D I G I T A L I N F R A S T R U C T U R E S I N L U X E M B O U R G 12 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V II.3 ENSURING DIGITAL SOVEREIGNTY II.5 CYBER SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS (CYBER WEATHER) AND CYBER INTELLIGENCE II.4 CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT OF INCIDENT DETECTION AND MANAGEMENT • In cooperation with its partners in the European Union, the Luxembourg govern- ment will continue its efforts to ensure dig- ital sovereignty at national and European level. Reflections on this subject will be conducted among all public sector stake- holders, involving, according to their needs and mandates, stakeholders from industry, research, or civil society. • Better shared situational awareness will enable all stakeholders to act in an informed and concerted manner to ensure a level of security appropriate to the cur- rent state of threat. • Within the framework of the Cyber Weather initiative launched by GOVCERT, the Luxembourg CERTs, based upon a dynamic analysis of notified incidents, regularly constitute an inventory at the national level. In close collaboration with all the players involved, the inventory will be gradually expanded by incorporating information from other available sources (sectoral ISACs, SOCs, intrusion detection probes, risk analyses, etc.). • The systematic analysis of the information gathered, combined with the analysis of the modus operandi of the attacks, will enable a better understanding of the state of the threat (cyber intelligence) and the identification of concrete and actionable recommendations for prevention and pre- paredness. • The State entities concerned will ensure coherent and exploitable dissemination of current threats to public and private oper- ators and professionals in the ICT sector on the one hand, and, on the other hand, will ensure the dissemination of security warn- ings with mitigation recommendations to the general public. • The capacity to prevent and detect intru- sions into State networks and information systems will be improved and gradually extended to all critical systems and net- works. • The capacity to process and analyse securi- ty logs will be strengthened. The collection, analysis and correlation of security events are essential for the early detection of attacks, for rapid responses in the event of a compromise, and for subsequent inves- tigation in the event of an incident. The architecture and capabilities of the log- ging system and GOVCERT’s management processes will be continuously adapted to the development of the State’s informa- tion systems. • Systematic recourse to teleworking sig- nificantly increases the area of exposure to attacks. In the event of a security inci- dent and in order to minimise the risks of malicious propagation and data leakage, the use of remote analysis and diagnostic tools will be promoted. 13 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V II.6 RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT II.7 CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION • Since the first national cybersecurity strat- egy, the government has actively promot- ed a risk management culture based on risk analysis and the application of secu- rity measures adapted to the level of risk involved. The scope of this approach will be extended to all sectors and the risk analy- sis tools made available will be adapted to the specific needs of the sectors. • Aggregating risk assessments at the sector and national level will help to identify sys- temic risks within sectors and at national level and to define scenarios for assessing such systemic risks. These scenarios will be made available to the sectors for inclusion in their risk analyses. • The identification and exchange of rele- vant risk scenarios and metrics is a col- lective activity that will be coordinated at State level and documented in the Risk Scenario Sharing Platform (MOSP). This will be accessible as a public service, which in the medium term will substantially contribute to increasing the quality of governance (informed governance) and resilience, and thus the attractiveness of Luxembourg. • The National Filtering Centre for Distributed Denial of Service Attacks (DDOS) will be responsible for systematically monitoring national and global DDOS developments and trends and developing recommenda- tions and best practices for critical infra- structure in the prevention, detection and response to DDOS attacks. • A security operations centre for critical infrastructure will be set up. • For the purpose of protecting against known and emerging threats — of the systematic dissemination of information on exploitable threats, attacks and intru- sion attempts, and of building up shared situational awareness using metrics — it is envisaged to deploy a national network of probes installed at voluntary critical infrastructures in partnership with private sector actors. • GOVCERT will continue to strengthen its capacities, skills and pen testing team. The service currently offered to State adminis- trations and services will be extended to critical infrastructures. 14 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V II.8 SECURITY OF THE NETWORKS AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS OF ESSENTIAL SERVICE OPERATORS II.9 CYBERSECURITY IN THE HEALTH SECTOR II.10 IMPROVEMENT OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CYBER CRISIS MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES • The ILR, as the competent national authori- ty and single point of contact, ensures that operators of essential services manage the security of their networks and information systems. In close cooperation with essen- tial service operators, the ILR will develop the SERIMA risk analysis and management platform, develop sector-specific best prac- tices, initiate awareness campaigns and organise incident management exercises. • Cybersecurity will accompany the accel- erated digitalisation of health services, particularly in the light of developments initiated in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ensuring the security of infor- mation and communication systems, med- ical devices, and more specifically patient data (e.g. the Shared Patient Record) has become a strategic issue. • In close consultation with stakeholders, collaboration with stakeholders in the sec- tor will be intensified, the security and resilience of key information systems and networks will be strengthened, a central- ised Security Event Management System (SIEM) will be implemented, the HealthNet CSIRT will be strengthened, collaborative information sharing on cybersecurity in the health sector will be institutional- ised (ISAC) and the implementation of an operational Security Management Centre (SOC) for the entire health sector will be envisaged. • Luxembourg will continue to participate regularly in international cyber crisis man- agement exercises (e.g. with the EU and NATO). Lessons learned from the exercis- es will be implemented at the national level. The procedures and decision-making structure for diplomatic response to cyber incidents, specifically in the context of EU cooperation and the Cyber Emergency Response Plan will be reviewed. At the national level, exercises for the manage- ment of major cyber incidents impacting critical infrastructures will be carried out making use of the national simulation platform (cyber-range). 15 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V II.11 PROMOTION OF COLLABORATION AND INFORMATION EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS • In close cooperation with ICT Luxembourg and the federations represented there, the State will set up a transversal working group (cyber TWG) to organise, structure and boost exchanges and mutual assis- tance in the cyber field. The aim of this cyber TWG is to exchange information pro- actively and rapidly on attacks with a high propagation potential. • If necessary, the cyber TWG will also coor- dinate the various private incident man- agement teams to boost mutual support. If necessary, the coordination may also be taken over by CIRCL or, in the event of a crisis, by the cyber crisis unit set up by the HCPN. • The Threat Intelligence Sharing Platform (MISP), the Risk Scenario Sharing Platform (MOSP) and any other tools or servic- es identified as necessary, will serve as platforms for information exchange and support a dynamic and rich exchange on threats, vulnerabilities, and any measures to be implemented. II.12 SECURITY OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS AND SERVICES • Security of telecommunications networks and services Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of 11 December 2018 establishing the European Electronic Communications Code will be transposed into national law. Exchange and coordination with telecommunica- tions network operators will be developed, notably with a view to implementing the security measures of the 5G toolkit. II.13 SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY • The State’s responsible entities will con- tinue to work to improve detection and response capabilities to risks and threats throughout the hardware, software, and services supply chain. To this end, they will base themselves on the recommendations and good practices for the State, critical infrastructure operators, OSEs, etc. in this area. II.14 SECURING E-MAIL COMMUNICATIONS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL • E-mail is the major attack vector for spe- cific actions that target users, such as phishing. A set of specific measures will be implemented to further secure e-mail services: - Encouraging e-mail service providers to raise awareness among their customers and offer them the spambee.lu national spam notification solution - Development of an offer to assess the security of e-mail servers by the C3 - Promotion and support for the imple- mentation of the standard for domain protection and authentication of e-mail -DMARC 16 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V II.15 SECURING COMMUNICATIONS AND DATA THROUGH THE USE OF QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES • In June 2019, Luxembourg signed a coop- eration declaration to explore together with the European Commission and the European Space Agency (ESA) the feasi- bility of implementing a secure commu- nication infrastructure based on quantum technology. This infrastructure will consist of a terrestrial part and a space part. Faced with the threat to the integrity of encrypted communications posed by the power of the quantum computer, the “Quantum Communication Infrastructure” (QCI) could be the answer, enabling the secure exchange of encryption keys (quan- tum key distribution, QKD). This infrastruc- ture will be developed and implemented at the national level and then integrated into the European infrastructure. The QCI is initially aimed at users in the public sector with the aim of extending it to the private sector. The following potential uses have been identified: - Critical infrastructures (energy, trans- port, water supply, etc.) - Data centres - Additional level of protection for the “Meluxina” HPC - European Institutions. II.16 OPERATIONALISATION OF THE NATIONAL CYBER DEFENCE STRATEGY • The Defence Directorate of the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs together with the Luxembourg Army have mapped Luxembourg’s cyber defence obligations and national priorities in order to establish a framework to facilitate the transformation of Luxembourg’s defence force into one of the most cyber-secure armed forces by 2030. • By developing cybersecurity capabilities for information and communication systems, Luxembourg’s defence force is working to become a point of reference and to stren- gthen its image as a reliable partner for national entities and international organisa- tions. This long-term objective is supported by strategic objectives such as the cultivation of talent, the strengthening of cooperation in the field of cybersecurity at both national and international level, the integration of Cyber/CIS security in all Luxembourg Defence activities, and research and development. 17 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V III.1 FEDERATION OF THE LUXEMBOURG CYBERSECURITY ECOSYSTEM • In close collaboration with the Ministry of the Economy and Luxinnovation, SECURITYMADEIN.LU will continue to man- age the directory of cybersecurity stake- holders in Luxembourg in order to iden- tify and promote the services available in Luxembourg, to intensify collaboration between stakeholders and to promote this sector at international level. • Luxinnovation and the Ministry of the Economy can, in a targeted manner, attract companies offering specific services that are not yet available in Luxembourg. “Openness, dynamism and reliability”: the Luxembourg Government’s strategy of economic dyna- mism and diversification is largely based on the continuous development of a high-performance digital economy. Cybersecurity is essential for the smooth functioning of the relations, transac- tions, services and other interactions that underpin the digital economy. Relationships based on trust operate at several levels: between the State and citizens, between users and technological tools, and finally between economic partners. The various growth sectors of the Luxembourg econ- omy – industry, finance, technology, knowledge and logistics – all rely on high-performance and reliable IT networks and systems. 1 . 3 O B J E C T I V E I I I : D E V E L O P I N G A R E L I A B L E , S U S T A I N A B L E A N D S E C U R E D I G I T A L E C O N O M Y III.2 FEDERATION OF THE LUXEMBOURG CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH ECOSYSTEM • Through its C3 department (Cybersecurity Competence Center) and in collaboration with relevant research and state actors. SECURITYMADEIN.LU will define cyber- security research priorities and coordi- nate research players. Collaboration with research centres in the Greater Region is being intensified. This will also respond to the proposal for a European regula- tion COM (2018) 630 which provides for the reorganisation of the allocation of European research funds in the field of cybersecurity. 18 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V III.3 DEVELOPMENT OF CERTIFICATION, TESTING AND STANDARDISATION METHODOLOGIES • The Luxembourg Institute for Standard- isation, Accreditation, Safety and Quality of Products and Services (ILNAS) has been appointed as the National Cybersecurity Certification1 Authority (NCCA) in Luxembourg within the framework of Regulation (EU) 2019/881 on Cybersecurity (“Cybersecurity Act – CSA”). In this context, the ILNAS will be in charge of supervision and will ensure that the rules relating to cybersecurity certification schemes, for the purpose of monitoring that ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes comply with the requirements of the European cyber- security certificates issued on the national territory. Where appropriate, the ILNAS will also be responsible for monitoring compli- ance with the obligations of manufacturers or suppliers of ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes that are established on the national territory, and which carry out con- formity self-assessments. • Depending on the identified nation- al needs, the government may decide to appoint another national cybersecurity certification authority to carry out the certification tasks and/or tasks directly related to this. • The ILNAS takes part in various meet- ings of the European Cybersecurity Certification Group established in 2018 by the EU Cybersecurity Act to take into account any information relevant to its supervisory tasks. 1 Levels of insurance A European cybersecurity certification scheme may specify one or more of the following levels of insurance for ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes: “basic”, “substantial” or “high”. The level of insurance corresponds to the level of risk associated with the intended use of the ICT product, ICT service or ICT process, in terms of the likelihood and impact of an incident. Self-assessment A European cybersecurity certification scheme can allow conformity self-assessments to be carried out under the sole responsibility of the manufacturer or supplier of ICT products, ICT services or ICT processes. Conformity self-assessments are only permitted for ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes that present a low risk, a scheme corresponding to the so-called “basic” level of insurance. The manufacturer or supplier of ICT products, ICT services or ICT pro- cesses shall keep at the disposal of ILNAS the European Union declaration of conformity, the technical documentation and all other relevant information relating to the conformity of the ICT products or ICT services with the European certification scheme concerned for the period specified in the scheme. Certification For basic or substantial levels of assurance, certification is carried out by a conformity assess- ment body (CAB), unless a scheme provides that only a public body may issue certificates in duly justified cases (Art. 56.5). CASES, the department of SECURITYMADEIN.LU, the mission of which is to secure SMEs, will serve as the CAB for the elementary level. 19 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V III.5 CAPITALISATION ON THE CYBERSECURITY COMPETENCE CENTRE (C3) • The scope of ROOM#42, the cyber-incident simulator for training incident response teams, will be extended to allow its use in distributed mode, through a dedicated electronic platform. • The deployment of ROOM#42 in the form of a platform will make it possible to interconnect with cyber-range infrastruc- tures, allowing the development of more complex scenarios, bringing the technical teams to deal with simulated incidents closer to their operational realities. • The C3 will continue to develop partner- ships at both national and international level, following the opening of a first “franchise” in Toulouse in May 2019. • In addition to ROOM#42, the C3 will devel- op a method for creating and implement- ing crisis management exercises involving players with heterogeneous levels of com- petence. The corresponding tools will also be made available to the ecosystem. • A national cybersecurity skills and com- petence framework will be established to facilitate the development of cybersecuri- ty skills by economic actors, in particular SMEs. This framework will describe generic roles and corresponding competences and will include a decision support tool. Other services consistent with this framework will be created. • The public-private partnership for the C3 “testing” platform will be developed to help organisations identify areas for improvement from a skills perspective. It should enable the testing of infrastruc- tures, organisations, as well as individu- als. It must also be accompanied by tools and documentation to help understand and interpret the test results. This plat- form will also be made available to the Luxembourg European Digital Innovation Hub, operated by Luxinnovation, to offer a “test before invest” service. • A C3 observatory will be set up, in order to: - Centralise all monitoring, cyber-weathe- ring and information sharing efforts and analyse the data collected; - Produce a regular “bulletin” on relevant and topical subjects for Luxembourg; - Provide information that can be used as a reference for decision-makers in orga- nisations when making choices about resource allocations for cybersecurity. III.6 EUROPEAN CYBERSECURITY EXPERTISE COMMUNITY • Designation of the national coordination centre and contribution to the achievement of the objectives of the European Centre of Industrial Technological and Research Competence in Cybersecurity, notably by actively taking part in the activities of the European Cyber Skills Network. III.4 CREATION OF THE FIRST CYBERSECURITY DATA SPACE IN EUROPE • SECURITYMADEIN.LU will create the first cybersecurity data space in Europe and will thus encourage the actors of the Luxembourg ecosystem and the greater region to exchange and make data avail- able for research and the creation of new cybersecurity products and services. 20 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V III.7 CAPACITY BUILDING AT NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVEL • State actors will continue to work towards the provision of tools, methods, and docu- mentation to facilitate the appropriation of security technologies by the economic sector and civil society in the least devel- oped countries, specifically through coop- eration for the development of local skills (capacity building). • I nt ra - g ove r n m e nt a l “ D i g i t a l 4 Development” efforts will be coordinated by the MAEE Development Cooperation Directorate. The development of Luxembourg’s expertise in capacity build- ing and skills transfer to the countries and regions most in need will be pur- sued through the established channels of Luxembourg Cooperation, as well as through public-private partnerships; the C3 will continue its active participation in the consortium for the establishment of the European Union platform for capaci- ty building on cybersecurity for develop- ing countries (EU CyberNet: eucybernet.eu); • MILCERT.LU strengthens cooperation efforts in the network of military CERTs, particularly in the field of cybersecuri- ty training for military personnel in Luxembourg. • Luxembourg will participate in the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise (GFCE) and other international cooperation initiatives in the field of the provision of cyber expertise. III.8 INTENSIFYING PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY, RESEARCH, AND CIVIL SOCIETY • Research projects will be promoted for the development of secure software and hard- ware with the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT) of the University of Luxembourg. • Creation of partnerships to foster the emer- gence of economically viable cybersecurity innovations. This should involve providing the various partners with a portfolio of services and business models adapted to the nature of the services or products they intend to develop or promote. 21 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V 2 . N AT I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y G O V E R N A N C E F R A M E W O R K 2.1 INTER-MINISTERIAL CYBER PREVENTION AND CYBERSECURITY COORDINATION COMMITTEE 2.2 KEY STATE ENTITIES INVOLVED IN NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY GOVERNANCE • On 6 December 2017, the Government Council approved the creation of an inter-ministerial committee responsible for ensuring national coordination in the field of cyber prevention and cybersecuri- ty (CIC-CPCS). The committee’s task is to ensure the pragmatic and swift coordina- tion of initiatives that are part of cyber-at- tack prevention and cybersecurity. • The CIC-CPCS, which meets on a regular basis under the chairmanship of the High Commissioner for National Protection, has as its mission, in accordance with the spe- cific competences and responsibilities of the entities described below, to: - Ensure the coherence of actions and initiatives undertaken in the fields of cyber-prevention and cyber-security; - Coordinate the implementation of European and international initiatives and measures in the field of cyber-pre- vention and cybersecurity; - Monitor the implementation at national level of policies decided at European and international level; - Advise the Government on cybersecurity and cyber-prevention by identifying the topics and priorities to be developed in this field and the actors responsible for their implementation; - Discuss the positions to be taken by national representatives in European and international fora on cybersecurity and cyber prevention. • The High Commission for National Protection (HCPN) is involved in the man- agement of a cyber crisis. Its action is defined through the emergency response plan for attacks against information sys- tems as soon as the crisis is likely to have serious consequences for some of the ter- ritory or population of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. It also acts as the National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI), the mission of which is to define information security guide- lines and ensure that measures concerning the security of information systems are put in place. The Government Centre for Computer Emergency Response (govern- mental CERT/GOVCERT), which also oper- ates under the responsibility of the HCPN, is involved in the management of large- scale security incidents affecting networks and communication systems. • The Ministry of the Economy is responsible for information security, risk awareness and vulnerabilities in the private sector. In this context, the Economic Interest Group – Security Made in Luxembourg (EIG SECURITYMADEIN.LU), a platform for the promotion of cybersecurity, operates among others the CASES (promotion of information security in companies), the C3 (national centre of expertise in cyberse- curity) and the CIRCL (Computer Incident Response Center Luxembourg) initiatives, the latter also acting as a CERT for pri- vate and non-governmental entities and municipalities. 22 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V • The Ministry of State – Department of Media, Telecommunications and Digital Policy (SMC) follows the European Council’s Working Party on Telecommunications and Information Society and its prepara- tory meetings. It covers the subject of cybersecurity strategy, particularly in the field of electronic communications net- works, under the banner of the Minister for Communications and Media, on behalf of the Ministry of State. • Within the Ministry for Digitalisation, the mission of the Government IT Centre (CTIE) is governed by its amended organic law of 20 April 2009. Within the framework of its remit, its mission includes ensuring the security of information technology, the management of electronic and com- puter equipment and appropriate security, the administration of the State’s comput- er network and the production of secure administrative documents. • The mission of the State Intelligence Service is to seek, analyse and process intelligence relating to cyber threats inso- far as it may be related to espionage, inter- ference, terrorism, extremism with violent propensity, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or defence-related prod- ucts and related technologies. • Two directorates of the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs are concerned: - The Directorate of Political Affairs coor- dinates work on cyber diplomacy. This includes following the activities of the Horizontal Working Party on Cyber Issues of the Council of the European Union, the “EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox” and the cyber-sanctions regime, as well as other cyber diplomacy activities at international level, in particular within the framework of the United Nations. - The Directorate of Defence is committed to this topic because cyber defence is one of NATO’s core tasks, as cyberat- tacks are an important part of hybrid warfare. It should also be noted that NATO and the European Union signed a cyber defence cooperation agreement in February 2016 to address the common challenges faced by both organisations. • The Luxembourg Institute of Regulation (ILR) is the single point of contact for Luxembourg in the implementation of the European Directive on security of networks and information systems (NIS Directive) and the competent authority for all sec- tors referred to in the NIS Law except for the financial sector which remains under the aegis of the Financial Sector Supervisory Commission (“CSSF”). Within this framework, the Institute has been entrusted with new competences in the field of network and information system security as well as in the context of cyber- security. In concrete terms, the Institute’s role as a competent authority is to ensure that the sectors under its responsibility (energy, transport, health, drinking water, digital infrastructure, and digital service providers) achieve a high common level of security in order to assume responsibility for computer incidents or cyberattacks and thus prevent incidents with a significant impact on the availability, confidentiality and integrity of essential services. 23 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V 2.3 CYBERSECURITY LUXEMBOURG, LUXEMBOURG’S CYBERSECURITY ECOSYSTEM The CYBERSECURITY LUXEMBOURG initiative was launched by the Ministry of the Economy to consolidate and improve public-private cooperation in the field of cybersecurity. As the national label of Luxembourg’s cybersecurity ecosystem, CYBERSECURITY LUXEMBOURG brings together and supports all relevant actors from the private and public sectors in the field of cybersecurity, in order to consolidate this crucial pillar of the nation- al economy and to facilitate the interna- tional opening of Luxembourg’s cybersecurity expertise. Endorsed by all market players, the CYBERSECURITY Luxembourg brand represents a common platform at the national and inter- national level. CYBERSECURITY LUXEMBOURG is managed and operated by three entities: • HCPN – as chair of the inter-ministerial committee for ensuring national coordi- nation in the field of cyber prevention and cybersecurity (CIC-CPCS) and coordinator of the national cybersecurity strategy, the HCPN leads the initiative by integrating it into the national strategy and liaising with other relevant public entities. The ANSSI,the national authority for the secu- rity of classified and unclassified informa- tion systems operated by the State, which is dependent on the HCPN, will organise the collection and collation of information from the public entities involved (e.g. CTIE) and will lead the online platform that cov- ers its sphere of competence. • SECURITYMADEIN.LU – The cybersecuri- ty agency for the Luxembourg economy and municipalities will be in charge of the overall coordination of the initiative. SECURITYMADEIN.LU will organise the col- lection and collation, as well as the man- agement of information on the essential services provided by the ecosystem. It will map their availability among the play- ers in the ecosystem and improve the potential collaboration between them. It will also promote, in collaboration with Luxinnovation, the ecosystem within the Greater Region and in Europe. It will co-manage the e-platform and contrib- ute communication and promotional tools, such as the cybersecurity breakfasts, the cybersecurity week, etc. • LUXINNOVATION – this government agen- cy provides companies and public research organisations with a wide range of ser- vices to foster innovation and thus sup- port the Government’s economic develop- ment objectives. The agency ensures that Luxembourg continues to attract invest- ments, companies and knowledge that are perfectly in line with the country’s con- text. Luxinnovation contributes its exper- tise in terms of market knowledge and promotion of the ecosystem at both the national and international level. As coor- dinator of the L-DIH (Luxembourg Digital Innovation Hub) initiative, it will bridge the gap between needs and expertise in cybersecurity (contributing to the relevant parts of the online platform). 24 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V Founded in 2010, the BEE SECURE govern- ment initiative is operated by the ‘Service National de la Jeunesse’ (SNJ) and the ‘Kanner-Jugendtelefon’, in partnership with SECURITYMADEIN.LU, the Grand-Ducal Police and the Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The min- istries involved are the Ministry of National Education, Children and Youth, the Ministry of the Economy and the Ministry of Family and Integration. BEE SECURE is also the Luxembourg repre- sentative of the Safer Internet Center (SIC) co-funded by the European Commission and as such is supported by a network of inter- national counterparts and partners: INSAFE (awareness centres and helplines) and INHOPE (reporting centres for illegal content). Thanks to its experience on the ground in Luxembourg and its established network of partners, BEE SECURE is able to contribute in a concrete way to the empowerment of the user. AIMS OF BEE SECURE: To promote a safer, responsible, and positive use of new information technologies among the general public and, in particular, among three distinct groups of people: - To assist children and young people in their education related to use of new technologies. - Support parents, teachers, and educators as a reference/role models for children/ young people. - Support seniors, for whom demand is growing increasingly ( er.lu/). FIELDS OF ACTION: 1. Awareness raising and information: BEE SECURE disseminates information and advice on responsible use of the Internet. BEE SECURE therefore systematically organises training courses in schools and high schools. BEE SECURE regularly pub- lishes information packs on hot topics (including cyber bullying, disinformation, cyber risks, radicalisation, learning how to use IT tools in a balanced way, etc.) as well as practical guides for children, young people, and their peers. BEE SECURE makes this information available to the general public through its websites, social net- works and the national press. 2. Guidance and advice: The BEE SECURE Helpline is a contact point for questions related to online safety and the responsi- ble use of new communication technolo- gies. It is aimed at the general public and especially to children, young people, par- ents, seniors as well as teachers and edu- cators. The Helpline is a free service, with anonymous and confidential treatment of information. 3. Reporting illegal content: Through the BEE SECURE Stopline, illegal online content can be reported anonymously and confi- dentially. These reports can be classified in one of three categories: child sexual abuse material (CSAM); discrimination, racism or revisionism; or terrorism. The alerts are analysed and, if necessary, will be forward- ed to the relevant authorities. 4. Watch: Regular exchange with children and young people during training courses, analysis of requests on the BEE SECURE Helpline and collaboration with the “Youth and Kids Panels” discussion groups ena- bles BEE SECURE to follow trends close- ly. The exchange with different national and international partners completes the trend monitoring. The results of the trend monitoring will be shared through BEE SECURE ‘RADAR’. 2.4 BEE SECURE GOVERNMENT INITIATIVE 25 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V 3 . P R E PA R E D N E S S , R E S P O N S E A N D R E C O V E R Y M E A S U R E S 3.1 PRESENTATION OF THE CYBER EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN Cyber emergency refers to a situation caused by an incident or an attack that could lead to a major malfunction or even unavailability of communication and information processing systems that threatens the vital interests or essential needs of all or part of the country or the population of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. In principle, crisis management bodies become aware of a cyber incident or attack either through the analysis of information available at the national level or through international channels following existing agreements. As soon as it becomes aware of a cyber inci- dent, the Cyber Risk Assessment Unit (CERC) is alerted and carries out an assessment of the available information. If the incident is likely to have a significant impact, the High Commissioner for National Protection is alert- ed and informs the Prime Minister, Minister of State, who decides whether to activate the Crisis Unit. The Crisis Unit may delegate to an operational unit, in particular the execution, implemen- tation and monitoring of the measures and activities ordered. In the cyber context, the functions of the Operational Unit are generally assumed by the Cyber Risk Assessment Unit (CERC). 26 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V 3.3 THE SCRUBBING CENTRE 3.4 CYBERSECURITY EXERCISES In 2018, Luxembourg created an ambitious public-private partnership to set up a cen- tre for protection against sophisticated Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. This public-private partnership ensures advanced detection of DDoS incidents and allows the filtering of non-legitimate requests in order to ensure the continuity of IT services and the accessibility and reliability of data in the event of an attack. Luxembourg participates in large-scale exer- cises organised by its multilateral partners, notably at EU level (CyberEurope) and NATO level (Locked Shields and Cyber Coalition). A “Cyber Range” platform will be introduced to conduct national and international exercises and to complement the cyber training pro- gramme by developing an advanced training centre. 3.2 PRESENTATION OF CERT’S ACTIVITIES Luxembourg has an active community of pub- lic and private Computer Alert and Response Centres (CERT/CSIRTs), which cooperate at the national and international level to respond rapidly to incidents. The governmental CERT is integrated into the High Commission for National Protection (Ministry of State) and provides a range of services for the public sector and critical infrastructure in order to further increase the resilience of IT systems in its constituency. The governmental CERT also operates a military CERT that promotes synergies, especially in the field of cybersecurity exercises and vul- nerability and intrusion testing. The CIRCL (Computer Incident Response Centre Luxembourg), CERT for the private sector man- aged by the Ministry of Economy, operates various services in the field of threat preven- tion, detection and mitigation, including the Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP). CIRCL acts as a clearinghouse for informa- tion sharing on cyber threats for various sec- tors, providing tools, community leadership, best practices, exchange standards and data for a wide range of communities, placing Luxembourg in a central position for this global threat information sharing. In addi- tion, the CIRCL also acts as a trusted host for several leading information sharing commu- nities, offering hosting and management of dedicated central hubs as well as support and training opportunities for these communities. 27 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V 3.6 COOPERATION AGREEMENTS AT BENELUX LEVEL • The HCPN plans to strengthen strategic coop- eration on cyber crisis management and cybersecurity capacity development with its Benelux counterparts. 3.5 INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND CYBER DIPLOMACY In the field of diplomacy and international relations, Luxembourg is a long-standing advo- cate of the multilateral method and works for positive international cooperation within the framework of international law and interna- tional humanitarian law. International coop- eration in the field of standard-setting makes it possible to discuss and deepen the norms of responsible behaviour of states in cyberspace, following the example of the efforts currently underway at UN level: engaging in good faith in these international negotiations is one of the strategic elements promoting greater col- lective security. • At UN level, Luxembourg follows in particu- lar the activities currently underway in the General Assembly, within two bodies set up in 2019: on the one hand, through active participation in the work of the Open-ended Working Group on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security, and on the other hand, by following the work of the Group of Governmental Experts on Promoting the Responsible Conduct of States in Cyberspace in the Context of International Security. • The European Union is the most advanced regional integration organisation in the world: Luxembourg participates in the various coop- eration mechanisms set up in the framework of (EU) Directive 2016/1148 on the security of networks and information systems, as well as in cooperation forums for policy formulation and crisis management. - The NCSS IV will have to take on the mission of transposing European obliga- tions at the national level, in particular in regards to the use of the EU diplomat- ic toolbox to respond to malicious cyber acts, as well as the operationalisation of the EU action plan (“Blueprint”) for responses to large-scale cyber incidents. - Luxembourg should have a national pol- icy and the necessary procedures for assigning responsibility for a cyber inci- dent. • The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is one of the most advanced regional organizations in the development of confidence-building measures and cyber cooperation. • The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) has a sophisticated cooperative cyber defence capability. 28 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V 4 .

To achieve this, BEE SECURE - Disseminates information and advice on responsible use of the Internet; - Systematically organises training in schools and colleges; - Regularly publishes information packs on current topics and practical guides for children, young people and their families. • BTS (“Brevet Technique Supérieur”) diploma: - BTS Cloud computing – domaines/services/cloud-computing/ - BTS “Internet of Things” – domaines/services/internet-things/ - BTS Informatique – domaines/services/informatique - 2021/2022: creation of a BTS in the field of cybersecurity, with the aim of train- ing professionals who have a techni- cal profile and can take up operational positions such as SOC operator, incident analyst, cybersecurity officer or junior “penetration tester”. • University of Luxembourg: - Bachelor in Applied Information Technology ( s t u d i e s / fs t m / b a c h e l o r _ i n _ a p p l i e d _ information_technology ) - Master in Information System Security Management ( studies/fstm/master_in_information_ system_security_management) In an effort to engage cybersecurity experts in the future, training curricula need to be updated to include the topic of cybersecurity. At the beginning of secondary school or even Cycle 4, initial introductions should be made to steer future experts in the right direction from the outset. 29 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V 4.2 INITIAL AND ONGOING TRAINING; RE-SKILLING AND UPSKILLING 4.3 RE-SKILLING / UPSKILLING 4.4 NON-FORMAL EDUCATION The growth of the digital market goes hand in hand with strong growth in the need for train- ers and cybersecurity professionals. Training courses and professions are generally still little known or are misunderstood by the gen- eral public and young people when it comes to choosing their studies. They are also not really considered as an option when adults choose to retrain during their working life. In reality, however, there is a wide range of cyber-relat- ed professions; it is constantly changing due to the evolving nature of the digital society, and training and access to such professions are open to all kinds of people. INAP • Cyberattacks and information leaks are a reality. How to prepare? (Room #42) • Information security – training for man- agement of administrations • Information security – tailor-made training by administration • Information security – Initiation - This course will soon be available in e-Learning.

During the LCSC, participants face multiple online challeng- es, specifically designed for them by C3 experts and partners. The most talented of them are selected to build the nation- al team representing the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg at the yearly European Cybersecurity Challenge (ECSC). 30 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V 4.5 AWARENESS-RAISING ACTIVITIES BEE SECURE European Cybersecurity Month • European Cybersecurity Month, or ECSM, is a European awareness raising event organised every year in October at the initiative of ENISA, the European Network and Information Security Agency. In Luxembourg, the contact point for ECSM is the Ministry of the Economy; the events take place during the ‘Luxembourg week’ organised by the Luxembourg cybersecu- rity ecosystem ‘Cybersecurity Luxembourg’ and various local partners. Cybersecurity Week Luxembourg: • The Cybersecurity Week Luxembourg is an advocacy-campaign week featuring differ- ent events and workshops, aiming to raise awareness about cybersecurity risks, to promote cybersecurity among citizens and professionals, and to provide up-to-date information about training and sharing of good practice. During the highlight and closing event, the Gala and Awards Night, the CISO and DPO of the Year awards are given to the most outstanding candidates by a jury of experts and peers in the field. Trustbox CASES: • Providing resources in digital form, such as training courses, documents, tutorials, and workshops, allows for better protec- tion of the privacy and professional life of stakeholders. This is an important addition in some situations, containing documents, video game training, webcasts, and online courses, with the aim of deepening knowl- edge and spreading the message of cyber- security. ANSSI Cyber Security Portal: ANSSI extranet portal reserved for users of the governement information systems: “National” campaigns • IoT – a campaign as important as its sub- ject matter - In the latest cybersecurity strategy, the campaign for the Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart Buildings has been defined and started. However, this remains an important campaign that will remain active for a longer period of time in view of the number of topics to be addressed. Moreover, even though ANSSI and CASES have started the campaign, more play- ers will join and continue with aware- ness raising in order to explain a more general vision regarding cybersecurity for smart equipment. • New cybersecurity campaign on equip- ment disposal - Even if this campaign is not as broad as the Internet of Things (IoT), there is still a lot of confusion about the disposal of smart devices, and how to properly erase data from storage before it is destroyed or redistributed and reused. Several players can join this cam- paign, such as Digital Inclusion, CASES, SuperDrecksKëscht, or other informa- tion security and destruction organi- sations and companies to provide the knowledge and best practices for each company, so that they can recycle their equipment without giving their infor- mation to third parties. 31 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V 5 .

The centre attracts talented researchers from all over the world to work on collaborative projects within the industry and the public sector. Since its launch in 2009, SnT has established partnerships with more than 45 organisations. SnT’s strategic research priorities are: autonomous vehicles, cybersecurity, fintech, Internet of Things, secure and compliant data management, space systems and resources. 32 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V SnT has six research areas that define its work. While cybersecurity is one of SnT’s focus areas, it is also a transversal topic across the most relevant industries in Luxembourg. Fintech: As regulations become increasingly complex, ICT tools are necessary for cost-ef- fective, compliant solutions for the financial, legal, and insurance sectors. Our research teams develop solutions to ensure security and trust in these sectors. Space systems: The revolution in space technology is driving new and innovative business models. Our expertise in satellite communications, autonomous operations, and mission critical software makes us ideally placed to work with players establishing R&D activities in Luxembourg. Autonomous vehicles: Autonomous driving promises to be more efficient than traditional transport, introducing a new era of disruptive change in mobility. We are focused on creat- ing secure and safe infrastructure solutions for this highly complex and dynamic technology. Cybersecurity: Security and trust are key words associated with doing business in Luxembourg, allowing the country to build a financial centre that manages assets many times the size of the national GDP. Cloud-based infrastructures are the future for much of the service-based economy, offering flexibility, scalability, and affordability. These systems must be designed to ensure resilience against faults and human error as well as to resist security attacks. Critical infrastructures present a special challenge, allowing researchers to push the envelope regarding security and resil- ience. Cybercrime and other forms of targeted and advanced persistent threats impose a permanent risk to these systems, and Luxembourg must be at the fore- front of cybersecurity if it is to maintain and strengthen the country’s position internationally. Internet of Things: Whether in use for smart homes, cities, or manufacturing, IoT offers tremendous opportunities to build services to improve our lives. To make this a reality, we are building smart, secure, and private IoT solutions and data analytics. Secure and Compliant Data Management: The new economy is data driven, and current data protection and privacy regula- tions create an opportunity for Luxembourg to establish itself in the domain. Our research into scalability, security, affordability, and compliance for the manage- ment and protection of data is crucial to this initiative. S T R A T E G I C R E S E A R C H A R E A S 33 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V P A R T N E R S H I P P R O G R A M M E SnT is guided by the principle that excellent scientific research can address the most pressing chal- lenges society faces, while supporting industry in developing solutions. This foundation defines its set-up. SnT has a partnership model that enables collaborative research with players from the pri- vate and public sector, addressing relevant challenges based on real-world data and systems. This approach creates a lively ecosystem that feeds the local talent pool and supports the local economy. In the area of cybersecurity, SnT has partnerships with Huawei, CREOS, VAIL, Proximus, QRA, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Department of Cooperation) and MEGENO. Luxembourg/West Africa Lab for Higher Education Capacity Building in Cybersecurity (LuxWAyS) is the latest example of a partnership in cybersecurity. LuxWAyS is an ambitious project for higher education cooperation between Luxembourg and the target countries of Luxembourg cooperation. LuxWAyS aims at training cybersecurity experts (€ 1.5 M – ten PhD students over five years) within the West Africa sub-region in collaboration with the Université Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar (UCAD), Senegal; Université Joseph Ki-Zerbo (UJKZ), Burkina Faso; and the Université Virtuelle du Burkina Faso (UVBF), Burkina Faso. Teams across SnT currently execute more than 40 projects relating to cybersecurity. Furthermore, SnT is the only organisation in Europe with a presence in three of the four H-2020 networks, underlining its reputation in the domain (CONCORDIA, Cybersecurity for Europe, SPARTA). Among SnT’s 15 research groups, five groups focus on cybersecurity: CRITICAL AND EXTREME SECURITY AND DEPENDABILITY (CRITIX) Interim head – Prof. Marcus Voelp R E S E A R C H G R O U P S CritiX pursues state-of-the-art research in a problem area that may be described as extreme computing – computer science and engineering pushed to the extremes of func- tional and non-functional properties of sys- tems. Amongst others, they investigate archi- tectures, middleware, algorithms and proto- cols that may find applicability in distributed systems and networks, which, for example: • Deploy extremely large-scale data sets, flows and computations – considering cloud, big data, complex event processing • Withstand extreme levels of threat, such as advanced persistent threats – consider- ing critical information infrastructures • Need to have extremely low failure prob- ability – considering high-criticality areas such as finance, energy, networking (SDN), or aerospace and autonomous vehicles • Present extreme requirements with regards to data privacy and integrity – considering e-health, genomics, or business/finance 34 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V Resilient modular and distributed computing is a response to the need for a paradigm shift enabling a comprehensive approach to those extreme challenges, from first principles: architecting and designing for simultaneously coping with accidental and malicious disrup- tions; providing protection in an incremental way; and automatically adapting to a dynamic range of scale, severity, and persistence of threats, some of which may be unknown. Paradigms and techniques emerging from this research should endow systems with the capacity of defeating extreme adversarial power, accidental or malicious (severe and continued threats) and sustaining perpetual and unattended operation (in a systematic and automatic way). CRITIX plans on addressing this level of threat drawing from and building on recent research on powerful and innovative automatic secu- rity and dependability techniques, such as fault and intrusion tolerance or Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), trusted computing and architectural hybridisation, secret sharing and secure multi-party computation, self-heal- ing and diversity, or post-compromise secu- rity. Furthermore, the research will leverage enhanced formal verification techniques such as interactive theorem proving, to achieve ultra-high reliance on software used behind roots-of-trust or TCBs.

The mission of the CryptoLUX group is to define, conduct, and disseminate leading-edge research in cryptology (and closely related fields), and to pass the knowledge gained from research on to students and industry partners. CryptoLUX is one of the few academ- ic research teams worldwide that possesses expertise across the full spectrum of cryp- tology, ranging from theoretical foundations to implementation aspects and applications. Our mission and objectives are devised in accordance with the three main goals of the University of Luxembourg, which are teaching, research and knowledge transfer at the high- est international level. Members of CryptoLUX collaborate with top research groups around the world and participate in activities of ECRYPT, the European network of excellence in cryptology. Our current research projects cover a wide variety of topics including algo- rithm design (block ciphers, hash functions, etc.), cryptanalysis, communication security and anonymity, efficient implementations, side-channel attacks, and reverse engineering. Emerging information and communication technologies, such as cloud computing or the Internet of Things, pose a number of unique challenges related to the design and implementation of cryptographic primitives, which has initiated a large body of research in these areas. Nonetheless, the number of cryptanalytic attacks (both traditional ones as well as side-channel attacks) is steadily increasing, and many of these attacks have led to devastating security breaches with fatal consequences. We envisage CryptoLUX posi- tioning itself at the forefront of an interna- tional research community that tackles these challenges and develops innovative solutions for complex security problems based on a solid cryptographic foundation. To achieve this, we strive for a greater understanding of how cryptosystems break (or otherwise fail) in the real world, how they can be designed and implemented to better resist attacks, and how they should be used to build secure systems and networks.

Today, securing a system requires one to understand not only digital communications and pro- tocols but also the human and legal reality where the system is deployed. IRiSC’s research recognizes this change in perspective: its focus on design and analy- sis of secure systems considers holistically both the technical, the social, and the legal frameworks. IRiSC’s research is about, but not limited to, the following areas: • Human-centred cybersecurity • Usability security and user experience • Cyberattacks and cyber defences • Information and system security • Data protection and legal compliance • Ethics and human rights IRiSC researchers follow methodologies that include formal computational methods, as well as quantitative and qualitative research methods. IRiSC researchers have an inter- disciplinary education, combining informa- tion security and social science, physics, or law. They all participate in the research of a cross-disciplinary nature.

Bissyande TRUSTWORTHY SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (TRUX) Prof. Dr. Jacques Klein TruX is a software engineering and software security research group that develops innova- tive approaches and tools to help the research and practice communities build trustworthy software. Trustworthy software has reduced vulnerabilities; when it fails, it can be repaired automatically; when it operates, it can justify its execution drives. TruX explores the huge data on software deve- lopment artefacts (including source code and textual information in repositories, such as bug reports, reviews, etc.) to derive knowledge on how to automate the analysis, construction, and repair of software programs. In particular, TruX conducts research in three main areas: 1. Software security: by developing new tools and approaches to assess and ensure security and privacy properties of software applica- tions. Examples of research activities are the detection of privacy leaks in Android apps or the detection of vulnerabilities in open-source software at “commit time”. 2. Software repair: by devising and implemen- ting novel algorithms, methodologies, and tool support for automatically repairing programs. This is performed by identified bug or vulnera- bility locations and applying code change ope- rations that will enable the programs to satis- fy correctness criterion. TruX is particularly focused on inventing software repair solutions that are in line with practitioners’ constraints. 3. Explainable software: by ensuring that sof- tware engineering solutions to business pro- blems are not black-box solutions but, instead, provide explanations and contextual infor- mation to help end users. This research direc- tion is in line with an emerging requirement in the field of artificial intelligence where models and techniques must be devised in such a way that the results of an AI solution can be understood by human experts. Given the use of AI algorithms in several of our research areas, we also investigate directions on making the analyses tractable. Tools for practitioners: TruX aims at developing both practical and fundamental research solu- tions. Practical, because TruX directly targets practitioners with the ambition to release tools that are relevant for developers. Fundamental, because TruX investigates key open and hard software engineering problems such as the defi- nition of code similarity (e.g. representation lear- ning techniques for semantic code clone identi- fication), the derivation of abstract repair ope- rators that are less prone to test overfitting, etc. 39 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V Other teams also undertake research projects in the area of cybersecurity and the list below provides an overview of these projects: Project acronym Project name Principal investigator Funding body CLOUDMAP Cloud Computing via Homomorphic Encryption and Multilinear Maps J.

Within ITIS, the team involved in cybersecurity has a focus on data privacy and security, cyber system security and informa- tion security management. It comprises 10 researchers with a well-balanced mix of engi- neers, researchers holding a PhD as well as collaborators working on their PhD projects. On the scientific side, the team focuses on modelling, designing, and analysing new algo- rithms, protocols, and systems for cyber-resil- ience. The research activities are mainly sup- ported by funding from the FNR CORE/INTER and EU Horizon 2020 programmes. On the applied side, the research focuses on practical cybersecurity challenges, e.g. application and development of crypto tools and privacy preserving technologies, design and implementation of blockchain technol- ogies to solve security and privacy issues, support to regulator/regulated entities to comply with new and multiple regulations (risk management, compliance, data analyt- ics). Such research activities are supported by private and public partners, FNR CORE/INTER, EU Horizon 2020 and Erasmus +, Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), Luxembourg’s RDI Law, as well as in collaboration with industrial partners. In addition, researchers are involved in academic training, providing lectures in cybersecurity at Master level (University of Luxembourg, University of Lorraine, etc.) as well as in professional training. The previously mentioned research activi- ties of ITIS contribute to the whole National Cybersecurity Strategy. However, there is cur- rently a particular focus on Guideline n°2 of the National Cybersecurity Strategy on Digital Infrastructure Protection. Nevertheless, oth- ers are addressed as well, in line with objec- tives such as creation of new products and services, risk management, training, etc. 41 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V R E S E A R C H A R E A S D A T A S E C U R I T Y A N D D A T A P R I V A C Y LIST has extensive expertise in the foundations of data security and data privacy. Such exper- tise includes cryptographic algorithms and protocols as well as standard and emerging privacy enhancing technologies. Examples are statistical disclosure control and differential privacy. To this end, LIST consistently publishes new scientific results at conferences and in journals. Driven by the nature of RTO, LIST has used this expertise in areas of practical appli- cation. Notably, LIST is working on the design of efficient authenticated and key agreement protocols for IoT devices, the trustworthiness of machine learning solutions with a focus on data-oriented aspects (e.g. data poison- ing and adversarial examples), and security and privacy issues for 5G ecosystems with a focus on API security. In addition, LIST is also working on the security and privacy aspects of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) and blockchain solutions, as well as the applica- tion of such technologies in domains such as dangerous goods transportation and housing. The work carried out by LIST has made it pos- sible to: • Evaluate the security and privacy issues (and more generally trustworthiness) of existing ICT systems, • Enhance the current systems with new algorithms (e.g. homomorphic encryption), protocols (e.g. privacy-preserving machine learning) and processes (e.g. how contact tracing is done), • Apply new technologies such as machine learning and DLT/blockchain to new appli- cation scenarios in a responsible and accountable manner, • File a patent (LU100580 – 12/2017) about a solution dedicated to the protection and valorisation of Internet user profiles. C Y B E R S Y S T E M S E C U R I T Y A N D R E S I L I E N C E Research performed within this thematic is twofold. On the one hand, activities are cen- tred around a full-spectrum cybersecurity awareness. LIST works on an approach to the modelling of the services, organisations, and infrastructures to enable security-related knowledge sharing, integration and better resilience of critical infrastructures and their related essential services. This approach relies on information security management outputs to enable continuous real-time incident pre- vention, detection, reaction, and mitigation. This allows increasing resilience to cyberse- curity threats and potential cascading events, while ensuring a continuous alignment to cybersecurity requirements and finally feed- ing back information security risk analyses. This approach is based on the development of distributed technological artefacts, massive data exploitation and the use of artificial intelligence technologies for real-time cyber- security protection. On the other hand, LIST works on intelligent infrastructures with their IoT devices that are integrated into an edge-, fog- and cloud-com- puting concept, for which high-assurance of resilience against various types of attacks is crucial. In this sense, LIST identifies and spec- ifies the key components, their functions and services, as part of an orchestration frame- work that are needed to ensure pre-defined security levels, and which take the heteroge- neous setup of potential IoT infrastructures into account. Additionally, novel cryptograph- ic mechanisms that will implement the priva- cy-by-design concept in the domain of intel- ligent infrastructures and IoT networks are evaluated and proposed. Blockchain/DLT are seen as the potential base of resilient infra- structures that targets distributed applica- tions in an environment of partners which are not necessarily fully trusted. We are investi- gating use cases that could benefit most from the fundamental properties of blockchain/DLT and trying to create resilient solutions based upon the latest existing frameworks. 42 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V The work carried out by LIST has made it pos- sible to: • develop a risk-based methodology for real- time security monitoring of interdepend- ent services in critical infrastructures, • develop a distributed architecture allow- ing continuous real-time incidents preven- tion, detection, reaction, and mitigation for critical infrastructures, • apply new technologies such as DLT/block- chain in order to create resilient infrastruc- tures for certain use cases. LIST is working on a security risk management framework that is directly linked to the work on resilience, and covers the entire regulato- ry cycle from the processing of security risk management by the regulated entities to the gathering and analysis of risk-related data by the regulator. The aim is to adopt a framework allowing integration of risk management spe- cificities from various regulations and deal with all of them in an integrated manner. The framework has been implemented in a technological platform encompassing a risk management, an incident management, and a data analytics module. The outcome of this work is an improvement of the quality of risk management results and the reduction of the costs involved in compliance. Sector-based and systemic governance of cybersecurity are part of the key benefits of the approach. A special focus in the next two years will be on the extension of models and best practices to the emergence of 5G and to the publication of the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC). In 2021, the regulatory platform will welcome around 100 companies from all sectors. A roadmap for improving methodol- ogies and functionalities is also being devel- oped over the next three years in collabora- tion with an industrial partner, the regulators (ILR in Luxembourg, BIPT in Belgium) and the companies concerned. The work carried out by LIST has made it pos- sible to build: • a set of standard risk analysis models, • a regulatory platform enabling all com- panies in the relevant sectors to manage their risks, report their risks to the regula- tor and notify incidents, • data analytics capabilities at sectoral level for regulators. 43 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V P R O J E C T S A N D P A R T N E R S P R O J E C T S : EU PROJECTS FNR: COLLABORATIVE PROJECTS: • SPARTA (H2020): Developing a method- ology enabling real-time critical infra- structures incidents prevention, detection, reaction and mitigation, and toolkits and frameworks supporting the design, devel- opment and verification of security-criti- cal, large-scale distributed systems form- ing an Intelligent Infrastructure. • TOKEN (H2020): Providing enablers for the introduction of disruptive technologies (namely DLT and blockchain) that contrib- ute to accelerating the transformation of public services towards an open govern- ment model based on the principles of collaboration, transparency, and partici- pation. • NISDUC (CEF): Developing a set of activi- ties aimed at raising awareness, compe- tencies, and capabilities for NIS Directive actors (national authorities, operators of essential services, and digital service pro- viders) together with SECURITYMADEIN.LU, ILR and IBPT. • Housing+ (Erasmus+): Improving academic training in the housing and real estate field among professionals, stakeholders, policymakers and academics through training materials with an interdiscipli- nary, international and new technologies content (i.e., DLT and blockchain), videos and gamification. • DECEPTICON: Developing procedures and tools to support various stakeholders in order to assess the presence of dark pat- terns in online services. • CATALYST: Designing efficient authenti- cated and key agreement protocols for IoT devices and designing of privacy-preserv- ing IoT data analysis protocols. • 5G INSIGHT: Designing novel security mechanisms ranging from attack detec- tion to attack mitigation leveraging novel tools and paradigms such as those based on machine learning (ML), particularly fed- erated and deep learning, to blockchains and deception security, while considering the specific but highly sensitive (in terms of security) case of cross-border areas (i.e., the France-Luxembourg cross-border case). • REGTECH4ILR: Developing a security risk management framework, comprising a regulatory authority part and a regulated entity part. • DG-SEC (DoD): Developing a block- chain-based system to support the author- isation and improvement of security in the execution of the transport of dangerous waste across Europe. • NIS Cooperation (ILR): Work on developing and adapting a security risk management framework to include the sectors of the Law of 28 May 2019 transposing the NIS Directive, taking into account systemic risks in and between sectors. 44 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V RDI LAW PROJECT: SERVICES AND TRAINING: INTERNALLY FUNDED PROJECTS: • POST 5G Secure Experience: Developing a 5G telecom security platform (a com- prehensive Telecom Intrusion Detection System) over three years to protect the POST network and its users from exploits at infrastructure level against Telecom attacks such as SMS spoofing, call and SMS interception, signalling intrusion. • Consultancy on blockchain for INFRACHAIN including the setup of an EBSI (European Blockchain Service Infrastructure) node for Luxembourg. • Professional trainings on security with Uni.lu • PhD thesis on Blockchain in Dangerous Goods Transportation 45 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V COOPERATION PARTNERS (INTERNATIONAL): STAKEHOLDERS: COOPERATION PARTNERS (NATIONAL): • H2020 consortia across Europe • Academia (University of Vienna and AIT), TNO (The Netherlands), SUTD (Singapore), University Paris Saclay (France) • Regulation ecosystem (regulators, regulated entities, and RegTech providers) • ICT organisations. • Authorities (Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs – Defence, CIRCL) • Regulators (ILR in Luxembourg and BIPT in Belgium) • Academia (Uni.lu (MSSI Master, PhD super- vision), SnT) • Technology providers (Westpole, RoamsysNext, Post, Compellio) • I n i t i a t i v e s / A s s o c i a t i o n s / N e t w o r k s (Infrachain, Luxembourg Blockchain Lab, CLUSIL, SDAM alliance) PA R T N E R S : 46 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V I I I .

This has allowed it to gather and share information related to incidents at national level and to share it in the respective constituencies. • Several strands of activities at internation- al level (FIRST.org, TF-CSIRT, CiviCERT, OASIS Open, IETF, NIS CSIRT network, Europol) were pursued with a focus on technical and practical issues of information shar- ing, incident response and automation of relevant processes. • The problems of cybercrime and disin- formation campaigns were addressed in multidisciplinary working groups, set up on an ad-hoc basis and according to cur- rent events and international cooperation, particularly within the European Union. The securing of European elections or the response to extremist tendencies on social networks are two examples of cooperation. The organisations that have contributed to the achievement of the objectives under this guideline are mainly the Ministry of State, the National Youth Service, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of the Economy, Security Made in Luxembourg, Kanner- a Jugendtelefon, the Ministry of the Family, BEE SECURE, GOVCERT, the High Commission for National Protection, the Ministry of European and Foreign Affairs, the Police and the Public Prosecutor’s Office. The third National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCSS III) was structured along three guidelines and its action plan listed 61 concrete actions, the vast majority of which have been implemented. The following is a selection of the results: FIRST GUIDELINE: STRENGTHENING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT 48 N A T I O N A L C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y I V • With the transposition of the European Directive on security of networks and information systems (NIS) and the iden- tification of critical infrastructure by the HCPN, a new foundation for strengthening the resilience of the State’s digital infra- structure was established under the NCSS III. In the field, one of the concrete results was the implementation of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack filtering centre, which mitigates such attacks at high volumes. Thus, additional protection for digital infrastructures and an increase in the resilience of the ICT sector at nation- al level has been achieved. • In the context of the refinement of our cyber crisis management procedures, rel- evant players have participated in major international cyber exercises organised by the European Union and NATO. • In 2018, the Ministry of the Economy pre- pared a data-driven economy strategy (approved by the Government in Council on 26 April 2019). A legal analysis has been carried out in relation to the legis- lative work that still needs to be done. Since then, the Ministry has launched work on the establishment of a trusted third party in the field of pseudonymisation and anonymisation. This work is coordinated with the establishment of the European High Performance Computing Competence Centre (EuroHPC). Cooperation with the National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD) has been initiated to make avail- able in Luxembourg an GDPR code of con- duct for pseudonymisation and anonymi- sation. • A new version of the MONARC platform has been developed and now also includes the possibility to link the risk analysis to requirements frameworks and to automat- ically create statements of applicability (SOA), as foreseen in the ISO/IEC 27001 standard.

Action Plan (non-public) 49  Glossary   51    4  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  The national cybersecurity strategy for the  period up to 2025 sets out the guidelines  underlying the projects that the Government  intends to implement in order to secure cyber- space at all levels. It goes hand-in-hand with  the digital transformation that characterises  our economy and our society.   We are going through exceptional times in  more than one way. We are witnessing the  large-scale deployment of new technologies  such as the fifth generation of mobile net- works or new applications in the field of arti- ficial intelligence. Existing digital infrastruc- tures in Luxembourg, Europe and the world  have been consolidated, enabling greater con- nectivity for more people with undeniable  gains in reliability and availability, even  though much remains to be done to ensure  that no one is left behind in this digital revo- lution. At the same time, cybercriminals and  other threat actors are taking advantage of  these changes and using the new develop- ments to increase attempts at intrusion, sabo- tage or online theft.  Building on the experience acquired in the  context of the third strategy adopted in April  2018 and mindful to taking into account the  numerous facets of cybersecurity, the new  strategy was drawn up by a multidisciplinary  working group chaired by the High Commission  for National Protection and consisting of rep-  resentatives of the Ministry of Foreign and  European Affairs, the Ministry of Economy, the  EIG SECURITYMADEIN.LU, the Department of  Media, Telecommunications and Digital Policy  (SMC), the State Intelligence Service, the  Luxembourg Regulatory Institute (ILR), the  Directorate of Defence, the Government IT  Centre (CTIE), the governmental CERT  (GOVCERT) and the National Agency for  Information Systems Security (ANSSI).  The aim of the cybersecurity strategy is to  enable all actors to participate fully in a digi- tal society and to access the new technologies  in a secure environment. The measures that  will be implemented in this context are  designed in the first place to ensure that  Internet users are aware and to strengthen  their trust in the digital world. Furthermore,  they consist in consolidating and strengthen- ing the security and resilience of digital net- works and infrastructures. Lastly, the strategy  seeks to take account of cybersecurity as a  factor of economic attractiveness and to com- plement the strategy of dynamisation that  characterises the digital sector towards the  continued development of a high-perfor- mance digital economy.   Xavier Bettel   ·  F O R E W O R D  O F  X A V I E R  B E T T E L ,  P R I M E  M I N I S T E R ,   M I N I S T E R  F O R  C O M M U N I C AT I O N S  A N D  M E D I A  ·    5  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  I N T R O D U C T I O N    6  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  The world in 2021 is facing a multitude of inter- national crises, ranging from the health crisis due  to the COVID-19 pandemic, to the climate crisis,  but also a deep crisis related to the social con- tract and political confidence in many countries.  All these crises have complex but undeniable  relationships with information and communica- tion technologies and systems: society’s depend- ence on the Internet and connectivity is growing.  At the same time, the attack surface is becoming  more diverse with the introduction of new tech- nologies, while geopolitical rivalries are impact- ing the security of the digital space. Malicious  acts are undertaken by a multitude of state and  non-state actors against diverse targets: govern- ment administrations, businesses and citizens  are victims of such acts.  With the massive introduction of fifth generation  (5G) mobile data transmission, which promises to  revolutionise connectivity worldwide, both for  industrial and mission-critical applications and  users/citizens, society will benefit from unprece- dented speed of access to information and data  availability, through a sharp increase in data  rates, increased responsiveness thanks to a sharp  reduction in latency and a significant improve- ment in connectivity capabilities. The transition  to increasingly mobile technologies – the wide- spread use of smartphones and other portable,  ever more affordable technologies is just one  example – and the ever-increasing reliance on  cloud computing solutions, as well as the contin- ued development of the Internet of Things mean  that human societies are increasingly connect- ed but at the same time increasingly depend- ent on the availability and reliability of their  data. Advances in quantum computing research  suggest that the race between encryption and  decryption technologies will continue.  This underlines the collective responsibility of  political actors, ICT experts and industry, as well  as citizens of all ages to become more independ- ent and to use technology wisely, and even to  demand trusted services and tools that meet  their needs.  The dissemination of disinformation, hate speech  or conspiracy theories undermines citizens’ trust  in their governments and often threatens social  peace. Influencing operations – for political dest- abilisation purposes as well as for the purpose of  increasing private income – such as micro-target-  ing on social networks, were unimaginable a few  years ago: they have now become commonplace  in the contemporary landscape of threats.  The development of a new national cybersecuri- ty strategy is a prime opportunity to review the  state’s posture on information security aware- ness. In a spirit of openness and collaboration,  the new strategy has been submitted for con- sultation to stakeholders at the national level:  relevant ministries and administrations, private  companies, professional information security  researchers and civil society organisations.  While technological progress harbours risks, it  also bears opportunities to be seized. The use of  blockchain technology for many different appli- cations makes it possible to develop trust solu- tions in political contexts where trust can be a  scarce commodity. This Cybersecurity Strategy  outlines how an integrated and comprehensive  information security approach enables the gov- ernment, private enterprises and citizens to fully  seize the opportunities offered by the digital  revolution. Improvements in the performance of  cyber intrusion warning and response systems  offered by, among other things, advanced algo- rithmic applications make life more difficult for  advanced persistent threat groups; measures for  mitigating denial of service attacks help thwart  or cushion the disruptive effect on networks,  applications, or other digital services.  Luxembourg will engage more proactively in  positive cooperation initiatives at global level,  such as in the United Nations Secretary-General’s  Digital Cooperation Action Plan. At European  level, the EU’s digital hub is in a process of con- solidation in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.  The national cybersecurity ecosystem is boom- ing. This strategy is part of a continuous process  of improving coordination and procedures in the  field of information security and builds on the  lessons learned from the three previous national  strategies.   ·  I N T R O D U C T I O N :  M A I N  T R E N D S  A N D  T H R E AT S  ·    7  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  I I .  N AT I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R AT E G Y   I V  ( 2 0 2 1 - 2 0 2 5 )     8  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  The first obligation of the State is to protect  its citizens and guarantee their fundamen- tal rights and freedoms. In a society that is  permanently connected to the Internet and  multi-dependent on computer networks and  systems, there are many risks and threats  to living together and to the rights of each  individual. The protection of this civic space  in line with all human rights – civil, political,  economic, social, cultural, and environmen- tal – is the first objective of this strategy.  As formulated by the United Nations in its  2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,  “leaving no one behind”, this fundamental  principle of the social contract applies both  in cyberspace and in the physical world. This  pillar encompasses both data protection and  privacy as well as the security of – already  omnipresent – virtual meeting places, which  have become truly indispensable in the era of  the COVID-19 pandemic.  S T R AT E G I C  O B J E C T I V E S : Luxembourg’s fourth national strategy builds on the foundations of the three previous strategies. It  comprises three strategic objectives, which each have several strategic priorities. Multiple concrete  and measurable actions, which are set out in an internal monitoring table (available upon request  from info@hcpn.etat.lu), are grouped under each priority.  I. Building trust in the digital world and protecting human rights online  II. Consolidating the security and resilience of digital infrastructures in Luxembourg  III. Developing of a reliable, sustainable and secure digital economy  1 .

Developing professional curricula  adapted to today’s society and raising  awareness of cybersecurity professions  makes this area tangible for citizens. This  will make it easier for young people in the   process of obtaining their certificates or  studies, as well as for adults in the process  of retraining, to design a digital career  and project themselves into the future.  Curricula and research plans are developed  under points 4 and 5 of this strategy.  • Diversity and inclusion will be promoted  in the field of cybersecurity, in support  of initiatives such as Women in Digital  Empowerment or civil society projects,  in particular to encourage people from  population groups that are under-repre- sented in the sector (including women and  girls, as well as people of migrant back- grounds or beneficiaries of international  protection) to pursue training or careers  in cybersecurity.  • Cybersecurity and online safety aware- ness will find their place in the context  of the inter-ministerial working group for  digital inclusion, which targets audiences  that are far from the digital sphere. The  subject is also addressed in the “digital  confidence” strategic focus of the national  action plan for digital inclusion and is a  fundamental element of education for  digital citizenship.    10  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  I.5 PEN-TESTING, BUG BOUNTIES AND RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE OF VULNERABILITIES  I.6 COMBATING CYBERCRIME  I.7 SECURE DEMOCRATIC AND CIVIC PARTICIPATION  • The Government will propose the neces- sary legislative changes and initiatives  to make possible or deepen different  approaches in order to improve cyberse- curity by using the collective intelligence  of security researchers, private companies  active in the search for vulnerabilities and   any users who discover a security breach.  The possibility of creating, in the near  future, a platform at GOVCERT.LU that  encourages researchers to report bugs,  especially those associated with vulnera- bilities, will be analysed.  • A coordination body will be established  between law enforcement and cyberse- curity entities, in accordance with their  respective mandates and missions. This  forum will, inter alia, provide an avenue  for strategic and operational analysis of  the impact of the threat of organised  crime and cybercrime activity and the  interrelationship between cybercrime and  cybersecurity. It will also seek synergies  in combating different forms of Internet  crime, including the fight against sexual  exploitation and abuse of children.  • Cooperation with Europol/EC3, as well as  with other relevant international organ- isations (e.g.  Interpol, UNODC) will be  strengthened, taking into account the  needs and capacities of the different actors  involved.  • Emphasis will be placed on the prevention  of influence operations and disinformation  conveyed by digital means (hybrid threats).   Guidelines will be drawn up for businesses  to detect and counter the consequences of  crises caused by such campaigns.    11  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  II.1 STRENGTHENING THE SECURITY AND RESILIENCE OF THE STATE’S DIGITAL PROCESSES AND INFOR- MATION AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS  II.2 SECURE AND CONTROLLED USE OF THE PUBLIC CLOUD AT STATE LEVEL  • The security and resilience of digital pro- cesses and the underlying critical informa- tion and communication systems will be  strengthened:  - the information portal guichet.lu and   myguichet.lu - the State’s electronic messaging plat-  form - the videoconferencing system - the remote access system - fixed and mobile terminal equipment - the DNS system.  • The opportunity of implementing an  encryption solution for the exchange  of sensitive messages, classified up to   RESTRICTED level, will be evaluated as part  of a Proof of Concept.  • The opportunity of implementing a nation- al secure instant messaging solution, ini- tially intended for government depart- ments and agents, will be examined as  part of a Proof of Concept. The “LuxChat”  solution will be based on a federated archi- tecture with end-to-end message encryp- tion and will be implemented via open- source software.  • In order to respond to the challenges of  digital technology in a coordinated and  thoughtful manner, the government adopt- ed a cloud strategy in 2016. Investments  and the establishment of central services  at State level and making them available to  State customers via private cloud services  such as “Govcloud”, are the preferred route.  • Given the advances in the world of digi- talisation, the use of the public cloud is  becoming essential in certain areas. The   governance framework for the use of pub- lic Cloud services at State level or in the  provision of public services will be defined,  considering, in particular, the aspects of  security, data protection, location and  retention, dependencies and the potential  risks of infringement upon government  sovereignty and essential services.  The availability, integrity and confidentiality of data are the  objectives of cybersecurity: faced with the numerous cyber  incidents observed daily, as well as the risks and threats  observed on the horizon, the Government has chosen to pri- oritise strengthening the security and resilience of digital  infrastructures as a second strategic objective. The protec- tion of vital infrastructures and essential services is one of  the key activities of this objective, as is the wide range of  activities of the various operational entities.  1 . 2  O B J E C T I V E  I I :   S T R E N G T H E N I N G  T H E  S E C U R I T Y  A N D  R E S I L I E N C E  O F  D I G I T A L  I N F R A S T R U C T U R E S   I N  L U X E M B O U R G     12  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  II.3 ENSURING DIGITAL SOVEREIGNTY  II.5 CYBER SITUATIONAL ANALYSIS (CYBER WEATHER) AND CYBER INTELLIGENCE  II.4 CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT OF INCIDENT DETECTION AND MANAGEMENT  • In cooperation with its partners in the  European Union, the Luxembourg govern- ment will continue its efforts to ensure dig- ital sovereignty at national and European  level. Reflections on this subject will be   conducted among all public sector stake- holders, involving, according to their needs  and mandates, stakeholders from industry,  research, or civil society.  • Better shared situational awareness  will enable all stakeholders to act in an  informed and concerted manner to ensure  a level of security appropriate to the cur- rent state of threat.  • Within the framework of the Cyber  Weather initiative launched by GOVCERT,  the Luxembourg CERTs, based upon a  dynamic analysis of notified incidents,  regularly constitute an inventory at the  national level. In close collaboration with  all the players involved, the inventory will  be gradually expanded by incorporating  information from other available sources  (sectoral ISACs, SOCs, intrusion detection  probes, risk analyses, etc.).  • The systematic analysis of the information  gathered, combined with the analysis of  the modus operandi of the attacks, will  enable a better understanding of the state  of the threat (cyber intelligence) and the  identification of concrete and actionable  recommendations for prevention and pre- paredness.  • The State entities concerned will ensure  coherent and exploitable dissemination of  current threats to public and private oper- ators and professionals in the ICT sector on  the one hand, and, on the other hand, will  ensure the dissemination of security warn- ings with mitigation recommendations to  the general public.  • The capacity to prevent and detect intru- sions into State networks and information  systems will be improved and gradually  extended to all critical systems and net- works.  • The capacity to process and analyse securi- ty logs will be strengthened. The collection,  analysis and correlation of security events  are essential for the early detection of  attacks, for rapid responses in the event of  a compromise, and for subsequent inves- tigation in the event of an incident. The   architecture and capabilities of the log- ging system and GOVCERT’s management  processes will be continuously adapted to  the development of the State’s informa- tion systems.  • Systematic recourse to teleworking sig- nificantly increases the area of exposure  to attacks. In the event of a security inci- dent and in order to minimise the risks of  malicious propagation and data leakage,  the use of remote analysis and diagnostic  tools will be promoted.    13  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  II.6 RISK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT  II.7 CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION  • Since the first national cybersecurity strat- egy, the government has actively promot- ed a risk management culture based on  risk analysis and the application of secu- rity measures adapted to the level of risk  involved. The scope of this approach will be  extended to all sectors and the risk analy- sis tools made available will be adapted to  the specific needs of the sectors.  • Aggregating risk assessments at the sector  and national level will help to identify sys- temic risks within sectors and at national  level and to define scenarios for assessing  such systemic risks. These scenarios will be   made available to the sectors for inclusion  in their risk analyses.  • The identification and exchange of rele- vant risk scenarios and metrics is a col- lective activity that will be coordinated  at State level and documented in the Risk  Scenario Sharing Platform (MOSP). This  will be accessible as a public service, which  in the medium term will substantially  contribute to increasing the quality of  governance (informed governance) and  resilience, and thus the attractiveness of  Luxembourg.  • The National Filtering Centre for Distributed  Denial of Service Attacks (DDOS) will be  responsible for systematically monitoring  national and global DDOS developments  and trends and developing recommenda- tions and best practices for critical infra- structure in the prevention, detection and  response to DDOS attacks.  • A security operations centre for critical  infrastructure will be set up.  • For the purpose of protecting against  known and emerging threats — of the   systematic dissemination of information  on exploitable threats, attacks and intru- sion attempts, and of building up shared  situational awareness using metrics — it  is envisaged to deploy a national network  of probes installed at voluntary critical  infrastructures in partnership with private  sector actors.  • GOVCERT will continue to strengthen its  capacities, skills and pen testing team. The  service currently offered to State adminis- trations and services will be extended to  critical infrastructures.    14  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  II.8 SECURITY OF THE NETWORKS AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS OF ESSENTIAL SERVICE OPERATORS  II.9 CYBERSECURITY IN THE HEALTH SECTOR  II.10 IMPROVEMENT OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CYBER CRISIS MANAGEMENT PROCESSES  AND PROCEDURES  • The ILR, as the competent national authori- ty and single point of contact, ensures that  operators of essential services manage the  security of their networks and information  systems. In close cooperation with essen-  tial service operators, the ILR will develop  the SERIMA risk analysis and management  platform, develop sector-specific best prac- tices, initiate awareness campaigns and  organise incident management exercises.  • Cybersecurity will accompany the accel- erated digitalisation of health services,  particularly in the light of developments  initiated in the context of the COVID-19  pandemic. Ensuring the security of infor- mation and communication systems, med- ical devices, and more specifically patient  data (e.g. the Shared Patient Record) has  become a strategic issue.  • In close consultation with stakeholders,  collaboration with stakeholders in the sec-  tor will be intensified, the security and  resilience of key information systems and  networks will be strengthened, a central- ised Security Event Management System  (SIEM) will be implemented, the HealthNet  CSIRT will be strengthened, collaborative  information sharing on cybersecurity in  the health sector will be institutional- ised (ISAC) and the implementation of an  operational Security Management Centre  (SOC) for the entire health sector will be  envisaged.  • Luxembourg will continue to participate  regularly in international cyber crisis man- agement exercises (e.g. with the EU and  NATO). Lessons learned from the exercis- es will be implemented at the national  level. The procedures and decision-making  structure for diplomatic response to cyber  incidents, specifically in the context of   EU cooperation and the Cyber Emergency  Response Plan will be reviewed. At the  national level, exercises for the manage- ment of major cyber incidents impacting  critical infrastructures will be carried out  making use of the national simulation  platform (cyber-range).    15  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  II.11 PROMOTION OF COLLABORATION AND INFORMATION EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND  PRIVATE SECTORS  • In close cooperation with ICT Luxembourg  and the federations represented there,  the State will set up a transversal working  group (cyber TWG) to organise, structure  and boost exchanges and mutual assis- tance in the cyber field. The aim of this  cyber TWG is to exchange information pro- actively and rapidly on attacks with a high  propagation potential.  • If necessary, the cyber TWG will also coor- dinate the various private incident man- agement teams to boost mutual support.   If necessary, the coordination may also be  taken over by CIRCL or, in the event of a  crisis, by the cyber crisis unit set up by the  HCPN.  • The Threat Intelligence Sharing Platform  (MISP), the Risk Scenario Sharing Platform  (MOSP) and any other tools or servic- es identified as necessary, will serve as  platforms for information exchange and  support a dynamic and rich exchange on  threats, vulnerabilities, and any measures  to be implemented.  II.12 SECURITY OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS AND SERVICES  • Security of telecommunications networks  and services Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of 11  December 2018 establishing the European  Electronic Communications Code will be  transposed into national law. Exchange   and coordination with telecommunica- tions network operators will be developed,  notably with a view to implementing the  security measures of the 5G toolkit.  II.13 SUPPLY CHAIN SECURITY  • The State’s responsible entities will con- tinue to work to improve detection and  response capabilities to risks and threats  throughout the hardware, software, and  services supply chain. To this end, they will   base themselves on the recommendations  and good practices for the State, critical  infrastructure operators, OSEs, etc. in this  area.  II.14 SECURING E-MAIL COMMUNICATIONS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL  • E-mail is the major attack vector for spe- cific actions that target users, such as  phishing. A set of specific measures will  be implemented to further secure e-mail  services: - Encouraging e-mail service providers to   raise awareness among their customers  and offer them the spambee.lu national  spam notification solution   - Development of an offer to assess the  security of e-mail servers by the C3  - Promotion and support for the imple- mentation of the standard for domain  protection and authentication of e-mail  -DMARC    16  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  II.15 SECURING COMMUNICATIONS AND DATA THROUGH THE USE OF QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES  • In June 2019, Luxembourg signed a coop- eration declaration to explore together  with the European Commission and the  European Space Agency (ESA) the feasi- bility of implementing a secure commu- nication infrastructure based on quantum  technology. This infrastructure will consist  of a terrestrial part and a space part.  Faced with the threat to the integrity  of encrypted communications posed by  the power of the quantum computer, the  “Quantum Communication Infrastructure”  (QCI) could be the answer, enabling the  secure exchange of encryption keys (quan-  tum key distribution, QKD). This infrastruc- ture will be developed and implemented at  the national level and then integrated into  the European infrastructure. The QCI is  initially aimed at users in the public sector  with the aim of extending it to the private  sector. The following potential uses have  been identified: - Critical infrastructures (energy, trans-  port, water supply, etc.) - Data centres - Additional level of protection for the   “Meluxina” HPC - European Institutions.  II.16 OPERATIONALISATION OF THE NATIONAL CYBER DEFENCE STRATEGY  • The Defence Directorate of the Ministry  of Foreign and European Affairs together  with the Luxembourg Army have mapped  Luxembourg’s cyber defence obligations and  national priorities in order to establish a  framework to facilitate the transformation  of Luxembourg’s defence force into one of  the most cyber-secure armed forces by 2030.  • By developing cybersecurity capabilities for  information and communication systems,   Luxembourg’s defence force is working to  become a point of reference and to stren- gthen its image as a reliable partner for  national entities and international organisa- tions. This long-term objective is supported  by strategic objectives such as the cultivation  of talent, the strengthening of cooperation  in the field of cybersecurity at both national  and international level, the integration of  Cyber/CIS security in all Luxembourg Defence  activities, and research and development.    17  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  III.1 FEDERATION OF THE LUXEMBOURG CYBERSECURITY ECOSYSTEM  • In close collaboration with the Ministry  of the Economy and Luxinnovation,  SECURITYMADEIN.LU will continue to man- age the directory of cybersecurity stake- holders in Luxembourg in order to iden- tify and promote the services available  in Luxembourg, to intensify collaboration  between stakeholders and to promote this  sector at international level.  • Luxinnovation and the Ministry of the  Economy can, in a targeted manner, attract  companies offering specific services that  are not yet available in Luxembourg.  “Openness, dynamism and reliability”: the Luxembourg Government’s strategy of economic dyna- mism and diversification is largely based on the continuous development of a high-performance  digital economy. Cybersecurity is essential for the smooth functioning of the relations, transac- tions, services and other interactions that underpin the digital economy. Relationships based on  trust operate at several levels: between the State and citizens, between users and technological  tools, and finally between economic partners. The various growth sectors of the Luxembourg econ- omy – industry, finance, technology, knowledge and logistics – all rely on high-performance and  reliable IT networks and systems.  1 . 3  O B J E C T I V E  I I I :   D E V E L O P I N G  A  R E L I A B L E ,  S U S T A I N A B L E  A N D  S E C U R E  D I G I T A L  E C O N O M Y   III.2 FEDERATION OF THE LUXEMBOURG CYBERSECURITY RESEARCH ECOSYSTEM  • Through its C3 department (Cybersecurity  Competence Center) and in collaboration  with relevant research and state actors.  SECURITYMADEIN.LU will define cyber- security research priorities and coordi- nate research players. Collaboration with  research centres in the Greater Region is   being intensified. This will also respond  to the proposal for a European regula- tion COM (2018) 630 which provides for  the reorganisation of the allocation of  European research funds in the field of  cybersecurity.    18  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  III.3 DEVELOPMENT OF CERTIFICATION, TESTING AND STANDARDISATION METHODOLOGIES  • The Luxembourg Institute for Standard- isation, Accreditation, Safety and Quality  of Products and Services (ILNAS) has been  appointed as the National Cybersecurity  Certification1 Authority (NCCA) in  Luxembourg within the framework of  Regulation (EU) 2019/881 on Cybersecurity  (“Cybersecurity Act – CSA”). In this context,  the ILNAS will be in charge of supervision  and will ensure that the rules relating to  cybersecurity certification schemes, for the  purpose of monitoring that ICT products,  ICT services and ICT processes comply with  the requirements of the European cyber- security certificates issued on the national  territory. Where appropriate, the ILNAS will  also be responsible for monitoring compli- ance with the obligations of manufacturers  or suppliers of ICT products, ICT services or   ICT processes that are established on the  national territory, and which carry out con- formity self-assessments.  • Depending on the identified nation- al needs, the government may decide to  appoint another national cybersecurity  certification authority to carry out the  certification tasks and/or tasks directly  related to this.  • The ILNAS takes part in various meet- ings of the European Cybersecurity  Certification Group established in 2018  by the EU Cybersecurity Act to take into  account any information relevant to its  supervisory tasks.  1 Levels of insurance A European cybersecurity certification scheme may specify one or more of the following levels  of insurance for ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes: “basic”, “substantial” or “high”. The  level of insurance corresponds to the level of risk associated with the intended use of the ICT  product, ICT service or ICT process, in terms of the likelihood and impact of an incident.  Self-assessment A European cybersecurity certification scheme can allow conformity self-assessments to be  carried out under the sole responsibility of the manufacturer or supplier of ICT products, ICT  services or ICT processes. Conformity self-assessments are only permitted for ICT products, ICT  services and ICT processes that present a low risk, a scheme corresponding to the so-called  “basic” level of insurance. The manufacturer or supplier of ICT products, ICT services or ICT pro- cesses shall keep at the disposal of ILNAS the European Union declaration of conformity, the  technical documentation and all other relevant information relating to the conformity of the  ICT products or ICT services with the European certification scheme concerned for the period  specified in the scheme.  Certification For basic or substantial levels of assurance, certification is carried out by a conformity assess- ment body (CAB), unless a scheme provides that only a public body may issue certificates in  duly justified cases (Art. 56.5). CASES, the department of SECURITYMADEIN.LU, the mission of  which is to secure SMEs, will serve as the CAB for the elementary level.    19  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  III.5 CAPITALISATION ON THE CYBERSECURITY COMPETENCE CENTRE (C3)  • The scope of ROOM#42, the cyber-incident  simulator for training incident response  teams, will be extended to allow its use  in distributed mode, through a dedicated  electronic platform.  • The deployment of ROOM#42 in the form  of a platform will make it possible to  interconnect with cyber-range infrastruc- tures, allowing the development of more  complex scenarios, bringing the technical  teams to deal with simulated incidents  closer to their operational realities.  • The C3 will continue to develop partner- ships at both national and international  level, following the opening of a first  “franchise” in Toulouse in May 2019.  • In addition to ROOM#42, the C3 will devel- op a method for creating and implement- ing crisis management exercises involving  players with heterogeneous levels of com- petence. The corresponding tools will also  be made available to the ecosystem.  • A national cybersecurity skills and com- petence framework will be established to  facilitate the development of cybersecuri- ty skills by economic actors, in particular   SMEs. This framework will describe generic  roles and corresponding competences and  will include a decision support tool. Other  services consistent with this framework  will be created.  • The public-private partnership for the  C3 “testing” platform will be developed  to help organisations identify areas for  improvement from a skills perspective. It  should enable the testing of infrastruc- tures, organisations, as well as individu- als. It must also be accompanied by tools  and documentation to help understand  and interpret the test results. This plat- form will also be made available to the  Luxembourg European Digital Innovation  Hub, operated by Luxinnovation, to offer a  “test before invest” service.  • A C3 observatory will be set up, in order to: - Centralise all monitoring, cyber-weathe-  ring and information sharing efforts  and analyse the data collected;  - Produce a regular “bulletin” on relevant  and topical subjects for Luxembourg;  - Provide information that can be used as  a reference for decision-makers in orga- nisations when making choices about  resource allocations for cybersecurity.  III.6 EUROPEAN CYBERSECURITY EXPERTISE COMMUNITY  • Designation of the national coordination  centre and contribution to the achievement  of the objectives of the European Centre  of Industrial Technological and Research   Competence in Cybersecurity, notably by  actively taking part in the activities of the  European Cyber Skills Network.  III.4 CREATION OF THE FIRST CYBERSECURITY DATA SPACE IN EUROPE  • SECURITYMADEIN.LU will create the first  cybersecurity data space in Europe and  will thus encourage the actors of the  Luxembourg ecosystem and the greater   region to exchange and make data avail- able for research and the creation of new  cybersecurity products and services.    20  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  III.7 CAPACITY BUILDING AT NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVEL  • State actors will continue to work towards  the provision of tools, methods, and docu- mentation to facilitate the appropriation  of security technologies by the economic  sector and civil society in the least devel- oped countries, specifically through coop- eration for the development of local skills  (capacity building).  • I nt ra - g ove r n m e nt a l  “ D i g i t a l  4  Development” efforts will be coordinated  by the MAEE Development Cooperation  Directorate. The development of  Luxembourg’s expertise in capacity build- ing and skills transfer to the countries  and regions most in need will be pur- sued through the established channels  of Luxembourg Cooperation, as well as   through public-private partnerships; the  C3 will continue its active participation in  the consortium for the establishment of  the European Union platform for capaci- ty building on cybersecurity for develop- ing countries (EU CyberNet: https://www. eucybernet.eu);  • MILCERT.LU strengthens cooperation  efforts in the network of military CERTs,  particularly in the field of cybersecuri- ty training for military personnel in  Luxembourg.  • Luxembourg will participate in the Global  Forum on Cyber Expertise (GFCE) and other  international cooperation initiatives in the  field of the provision of cyber expertise.  III.8 INTENSIFYING PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY, RESEARCH, AND CIVIL SOCIETY  • Research projects will be promoted for the  development of secure software and hard- ware with the Interdisciplinary Centre for  Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT) of the  University of Luxembourg.  • Creation of partnerships to foster the emer- gence of economically viable cybersecurity  innovations. This should involve providing  the various partners with a portfolio of  services and business models adapted to  the nature of the services or products they  intend to develop or promote.    21  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  2 .

The committee’s task is to  ensure the pragmatic and swift coordina- tion of initiatives that are part of cyber-at- tack prevention and cybersecurity.  • The CIC-CPCS, which meets on a regular  basis under the chairmanship of the High  Commissioner for National Protection, has  as its mission, in accordance with the spe- cific competences and responsibilities of  the entities described below, to: - Ensure the coherence of actions and   initiatives undertaken in the fields of  cyber-prevention and cyber-security;  - Coordinate the implementation of  European and international initiatives  and measures in the field of cyber-pre- vention and cybersecurity;  - Monitor the implementation at national  level of policies decided at European  and international level;  - Advise the Government on cybersecurity  and cyber-prevention by identifying the  topics and priorities to be developed in  this field and the actors responsible for  their implementation;  - Discuss the positions to be taken by  national representatives in European  and international fora on cybersecurity  and cyber prevention.  • The High Commission for National  Protection (HCPN) is involved in the man- agement of a cyber crisis. Its action is  defined through the emergency response  plan for attacks against information sys- tems as soon as the crisis is likely to have  serious consequences for some of the ter- ritory or population of the Grand Duchy of  Luxembourg. It also acts as the National  Agency for the Security of Information  Systems (ANSSI), the mission of which  is to define information security guide- lines and ensure that measures concerning  the security of information systems are  put in place. The Government Centre for  Computer Emergency Response (govern- mental CERT/GOVCERT), which also oper- ates under the responsibility of the HCPN,  is involved in the management of large-  scale security incidents affecting networks  and communication systems.  • The Ministry of the Economy is responsible  for information security, risk awareness  and vulnerabilities in the private sector.  In this context, the Economic Interest  Group – Security Made in Luxembourg  (EIG SECURITYMADEIN.LU), a platform for  the promotion of cybersecurity, operates  among others the CASES (promotion of  information security in companies), the C3  (national centre of expertise in cyberse- curity) and the CIRCL (Computer Incident  Response Center Luxembourg) initiatives,  the latter also acting as a CERT for pri- vate and non-governmental entities and  municipalities.    22  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  • The Ministry of State – Department of  Media, Telecommunications and Digital  Policy (SMC) follows the European Council’s  Working Party on Telecommunications  and Information Society and its prepara- tory meetings. It covers the subject of  cybersecurity strategy, particularly in the  field of electronic communications net- works, under the banner of the Minister  for Communications and Media, on behalf  of the Ministry of State.  • Within the Ministry for Digitalisation, the  mission of the Government IT Centre (CTIE)  is governed by its amended organic law  of 20 April 2009. Within the framework  of its remit, its mission includes ensuring  the security of information technology,  the management of electronic and com- puter equipment and appropriate security,  the administration of the State’s comput- er network and the production of secure  administrative documents.  • The mission of the State Intelligence  Service is to seek, analyse and process  intelligence relating to cyber threats inso- far as it may be related to espionage, inter- ference, terrorism, extremism with violent  propensity, proliferation of weapons of  mass destruction or defence-related prod- ucts and related technologies.  • Two directorates of the Ministry of Foreign  and European Affairs are concerned:  - The Directorate of Political Affairs coor-  dinates work on cyber diplomacy. This  includes following the activities of  the Horizontal Working Party on Cyber  Issues of the Council of the European  Union, the “EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox”  and the cyber-sanctions regime, as well  as other cyber diplomacy activities at  international level, in particular within  the framework of the United Nations.  - The Directorate of Defence is committed  to this topic because cyber defence is  one of NATO’s core tasks, as cyberat- tacks are an important part of hybrid  warfare. It should also be noted that  NATO and the European Union signed a  cyber defence cooperation agreement in  February 2016 to address the common  challenges faced by both organisations.  • The Luxembourg Institute of Regulation  (ILR) is the single point of contact for  Luxembourg in the implementation of the  European Directive on security of networks  and information systems (NIS Directive)  and the competent authority for all sec- tors referred to in the NIS Law except  for the financial sector which remains  under the aegis of the Financial Sector  Supervisory Commission (“CSSF”). Within  this framework, the Institute has been  entrusted with new competences in the  field of network and information system  security as well as in the context of cyber- security. In concrete terms, the Institute’s  role as a competent authority is to ensure  that the sectors under its responsibility  (energy, transport, health, drinking water,  digital infrastructure, and digital service  providers) achieve a high common level of  security in order to assume responsibility  for computer incidents or cyberattacks and  thus prevent incidents with a significant  impact on the availability, confidentiality  and integrity of essential services.    23  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  2.3 CYBERSECURITY LUXEMBOURG, LUXEMBOURG’S CYBERSECURITY ECOSYSTEM  The CYBERSECURITY LUXEMBOURG initiative  was launched by the Ministry of the Economy  to consolidate and improve public-private  cooperation in the field of cybersecurity.  As the national label of Luxembourg’s  cybersecurity ecosystem, CYBERSECURITY  LUXEMBOURG brings together and supports  all relevant actors from the private and public  sectors in the field of cybersecurity, in order  to consolidate this crucial pillar of the nation- al economy and to facilitate the interna- tional opening of Luxembourg’s cybersecurity  expertise. Endorsed by all market players, the  CYBERSECURITY Luxembourg brand represents  a common platform at the national and inter- national level.  CYBERSECURITY LUXEMBOURG is managed  and operated by three entities: • HCPN – as chair of the inter-ministerial   committee for ensuring national coordi- nation in the field of cyber prevention and  cybersecurity (CIC-CPCS) and coordinator  of the national cybersecurity strategy, the  HCPN leads the initiative by integrating  it into the national strategy and liaising  with other relevant public entities. The  ANSSI,the national authority for the secu- rity of classified and unclassified informa- tion systems operated by the State, which  is dependent on the HCPN, will organise  the collection and collation of information  from the public entities involved (e.g. CTIE)  and will lead the online platform that cov- ers its sphere of competence.  • SECURITYMADEIN.LU – The cybersecuri- ty agency for the Luxembourg economy  and municipalities will be in charge of  the overall coordination of the initiative.  SECURITYMADEIN.LU will organise the col- lection and collation, as well as the man- agement of information on the essential  services provided by the ecosystem. It will  map their availability among the play- ers in the ecosystem and improve the  potential collaboration between them. It  will also promote, in collaboration with  Luxinnovation, the ecosystem within  the Greater Region and in Europe. It will  co-manage the e-platform and contrib- ute communication and promotional tools,  such as the cybersecurity breakfasts, the  cybersecurity week, etc.  • LUXINNOVATION – this government agen- cy provides companies and public research  organisations with a wide range of ser- vices to foster innovation and thus sup- port the Government’s economic develop- ment objectives. The agency ensures that  Luxembourg continues to attract invest- ments, companies and knowledge that are  perfectly in line with the country’s con- text. Luxinnovation contributes its exper- tise in terms of market knowledge and  promotion of the ecosystem at both the  national and international level. As coor- dinator of the L-DIH (Luxembourg Digital  Innovation Hub) initiative, it will bridge  the gap between needs and expertise in  cybersecurity (contributing to the relevant  parts of the online platform).    24  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  Founded in 2010, the BEE SECURE govern- ment initiative is operated by the ‘Service  National de la Jeunesse’ (SNJ) and the  ‘Kanner-Jugendtelefon’, in partnership with  SECURITYMADEIN.LU, the Grand-Ducal  Police and the Public Prosecutor’s Office of  the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The min- istries involved are the Ministry of National  Education, Children and Youth, the Ministry of  the Economy and the Ministry of Family and  Integration.  BEE SECURE is also the Luxembourg repre- sentative of the Safer Internet Center (SIC)  co-funded by the European Commission and  as such is supported by a network of inter- national counterparts and partners: INSAFE  (awareness centres and helplines) and INHOPE  (reporting centres for illegal content).  Thanks to its experience on the ground in  Luxembourg and its established network of  partners, BEE SECURE is able to contribute in  a concrete way to the empowerment of the  user.  AIMS OF BEE SECURE:  To promote a safer, responsible, and positive  use of new information technologies among  the general public and, in particular, among  three distinct groups of people:   - To assist children and young people in  their education related to use of new  technologies.   - Support parents, teachers, and educators  as a reference/role models for children/ young people.   - Support seniors, for whom demand is  growing increasingly (https://silversurf- er.lu/).  FIELDS OF ACTION:  1. Awareness raising and information: BEE  SECURE disseminates information and  advice on responsible use of the Internet.  BEE SECURE therefore systematically  organises training courses in schools and  high schools. BEE SECURE regularly pub- lishes information packs on hot topics  (including cyber bullying, disinformation,  cyber risks, radicalisation, learning how   to use IT tools in a balanced way, etc.) as  well as practical guides for children, young  people, and their peers. BEE SECURE makes  this information available to the general  public through its websites, social net- works and the national press.  2. Guidance and advice: The BEE SECURE  Helpline is a contact point for questions  related to online safety and the responsi- ble use of new communication technolo- gies. It is aimed at the general public and  especially to children, young people, par- ents, seniors as well as teachers and edu- cators. The Helpline is a free service, with  anonymous and confidential treatment of  information.  3. Reporting illegal content: Through the BEE  SECURE Stopline, illegal online content  can be reported anonymously and confi- dentially. These reports can be classified in  one of three categories: child sexual abuse  material (CSAM); discrimination, racism  or revisionism; or terrorism. The alerts are  analysed and, if necessary, will be forward- ed to the relevant authorities.  4. Watch: Regular exchange with children  and young people during training courses,  analysis of requests on the BEE SECURE  Helpline and collaboration with the “Youth  and Kids Panels” discussion groups ena- bles BEE SECURE to follow trends close- ly. The exchange with different national  and international partners completes the  trend monitoring. The results of the trend  monitoring will be shared through BEE  SECURE ‘RADAR’.  2.4 BEE SECURE GOVERNMENT INITIATIVE    25  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  3 .  P R E PA R E D N E S S ,  R E S P O N S E   A N D  R E C O V E R Y  M E A S U R E S   3.1 PRESENTATION OF THE CYBER EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN  Cyber emergency refers to a situation caused  by an incident or an attack that could lead to  a major malfunction or even unavailability of  communication and information processing  systems that threatens the vital interests or  essential needs of all or part of the country  or the population of the Grand Duchy of  Luxembourg.  In principle, crisis management bodies become  aware of a cyber incident or attack either  through the analysis of information available  at the national level or through international  channels following existing agreements.  As soon as it becomes aware of a cyber inci- dent, the Cyber Risk Assessment Unit (CERC)  is alerted and carries out an assessment of  the available information. If the incident is  likely to have a significant impact, the High  Commissioner for National Protection is alert- ed and informs the Prime Minister, Minister  of State, who decides whether to activate the  Crisis Unit.  The Crisis Unit may delegate to an operational  unit, in particular the execution, implemen- tation and monitoring of the measures and  activities ordered.  In the cyber context, the functions of the  Operational Unit are generally assumed by  the Cyber Risk Assessment Unit (CERC).    26  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  3.3 THE SCRUBBING CENTRE  3.4 CYBERSECURITY EXERCISES  In 2018, Luxembourg created an ambitious  public-private partnership to set up a cen- tre for protection against sophisticated  Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.  This public-private partnership ensures   advanced detection of DDoS incidents and  allows the filtering of non-legitimate requests  in order to ensure the continuity of IT services  and the accessibility and reliability of data in  the event of an attack.  Luxembourg participates in large-scale exer- cises organised by its multilateral partners,  notably at EU level (CyberEurope) and NATO  level (Locked Shields and Cyber Coalition).  A “Cyber Range” platform will be introduced to  conduct national and international exercises  and to complement the cyber training pro- gramme by developing an advanced training  centre.  3.2 PRESENTATION OF CERT’S ACTIVITIES  Luxembourg has an active community of pub- lic and private Computer Alert and Response  Centres (CERT/CSIRTs), which cooperate at the  national and international level to respond  rapidly to incidents.  The governmental CERT is integrated into  the High Commission for National Protection  (Ministry of State) and provides a range of  services for the public sector and critical  infrastructure in order to further increase the  resilience of IT systems in its constituency. The  governmental CERT also operates a military  CERT that promotes synergies, especially in  the field of cybersecurity exercises and vul- nerability and intrusion testing.  The CIRCL (Computer Incident Response Centre  Luxembourg), CERT for the private sector man- aged by the Ministry of Economy, operates  various services in the field of threat preven- tion, detection and mitigation, including the  Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP).  CIRCL acts as a clearinghouse for informa- tion sharing on cyber threats for various sec- tors, providing tools, community leadership,  best practices, exchange standards and data  for a wide range of communities, placing  Luxembourg in a central position for this  global threat information sharing. In addi- tion, the CIRCL also acts as a trusted host for  several leading information sharing commu- nities, offering hosting and management of  dedicated central hubs as well as support and  training opportunities for these communities.    27  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  3.6 COOPERATION AGREEMENTS AT BENELUX LEVEL  • The HCPN plans to strengthen strategic coop- eration on cyber crisis management and  cybersecurity capacity development with its  Benelux counterparts.  3.5 INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND CYBER DIPLOMACY  In the field of diplomacy and international  relations, Luxembourg is a long-standing advo- cate of the multilateral method and works for  positive international cooperation within the  framework of international law and interna- tional humanitarian law. International coop- eration in the field of standard-setting makes  it possible to discuss and deepen the norms of  responsible behaviour of states in cyberspace,  following the example of the efforts currently  underway at UN level: engaging in good faith  in these international negotiations is one of  the strategic elements promoting greater col- lective security.   • At UN level, Luxembourg follows in particu- lar the activities currently underway in the  General Assembly, within two bodies set up  in 2019: on the one hand, through active  participation in the work of the Open-ended  Working Group on Developments in the Field  of Information and Telecommunications in the  Context of International Security, and on the  other hand, by following the work of the Group  of Governmental Experts on Promoting the  Responsible Conduct of States in Cyberspace  in the Context of International Security.  • The European Union is the most advanced  regional integration organisation in the world:  Luxembourg participates in the various coop- eration mechanisms set up in the framework  of (EU) Directive 2016/1148 on the security of  networks and information systems, as well as  in cooperation forums for policy formulation  and crisis management. - The NCSS IV will have to take on the   mission of transposing European obliga- tions at the national level, in particular  in regards to the use of the EU diplomat- ic toolbox to respond to malicious cyber  acts, as well as the operationalisation  of the EU action plan (“Blueprint”) for  responses to large-scale cyber incidents.  - Luxembourg should have a national pol- icy and the necessary procedures for  assigning responsibility for a cyber inci- dent.  • The Organization for Security and Cooperation  in Europe (OSCE) is one of the most advanced  regional organizations in the development  of confidence-building measures and cyber  cooperation.  • The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)  has a sophisticated cooperative cyber defence  capability.     28  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  4 .

To achieve  this, BEE SECURE - Disseminates information and advice on   responsible use of the Internet; - Systematically organises training in   schools and colleges; - Regularly publishes information packs   on current topics and practical guides  for children, young people and their  families.  • BTS (“Brevet Technique Supérieur”) diploma: - BTS Cloud computing – http://bts.lu/  domaines/services/cloud-computing/  - BTS “Internet of Things” – http://bts.lu/ domaines/services/internet-things/  - BTS Informatique – http://bts.lu/ domaines/services/informatique  - 2021/2022: creation of a BTS in the field  of cybersecurity, with the aim of train- ing professionals who have a techni- cal profile and can take up operational  positions such as SOC operator, incident  analyst, cybersecurity officer or junior  “penetration tester”.  • University of Luxembourg:  - Bachelor in Applied Information   Technology (https://wwwen.uni.lu/ s t u d i e s / fs t m / b a c h e l o r _ i n _ a p p l i e d _ information_technology )   - Master in Information System Security  Management (https://wwwen.uni.lu/ studies/fstm/master_in_information_ system_security_management)  In an effort to engage cybersecurity experts  in the future, training curricula need to be  updated to include the topic of cybersecurity.  At the beginning of secondary school or even  Cycle 4, initial introductions should be made  to steer future experts in the right direction  from the outset.    29  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  4.2 INITIAL AND ONGOING TRAINING; RE-SKILLING AND UPSKILLING  4.3 RE-SKILLING / UPSKILLING  4.4 NON-FORMAL EDUCATION  The growth of the digital market goes hand in  hand with strong growth in the need for train- ers and cybersecurity professionals. Training  courses and professions are generally still  little known or are misunderstood by the gen- eral public and young people when it comes to  choosing their studies. They are also not really  considered as an option when adults choose  to retrain during their working life. In reality,  however, there is a wide range of cyber-relat- ed professions; it is constantly changing due  to the evolving nature of the digital society,  and training and access to such professions  are open to all kinds of people.

However, this remains an  important campaign that will remain  active for a longer period of time in view  of the number of topics to be addressed.  Moreover, even though ANSSI and CASES  have started the campaign, more play- ers will join and continue with aware- ness raising in order to explain a more  general vision regarding cybersecurity  for smart equipment.  • New cybersecurity campaign on equip- ment disposal - Even if this campaign is not as broad as   the Internet of Things (IoT), there is still  a lot of confusion about the disposal  of smart devices, and how to properly  erase data from storage before it is  destroyed or redistributed and reused.  Several players can join this cam- paign, such as Digital Inclusion, CASES,  SuperDrecksKëscht, or other informa- tion security and destruction organi- sations and companies to provide the  knowledge and best practices for each  company, so that they can recycle their  equipment without giving their infor- mation to third parties.    31  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  5 .

The centre attracts talented researchers from all  over the world to work on collaborative projects within the industry and the public sector. Since its  launch in 2009, SnT has established partnerships with more than 45 organisations.  SnT’s strategic research priorities are: autonomous vehicles, cybersecurity, fintech, Internet of  Things, secure and compliant data management, space systems and resources.    32  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  SnT has six research areas that define its work. While cybersecurity is one of SnT’s focus areas, it is  also a transversal topic across the most relevant industries in Luxembourg.   Fintech:  As regulations become increasingly complex, ICT tools are necessary for cost-ef- fective, compliant solutions for the financial, legal, and insurance sectors. Our  research teams develop solutions to ensure security and trust in these sectors.  Space systems:  The revolution in space technology is driving new and innovative business models.  Our expertise in satellite communications, autonomous operations, and mission  critical software makes us ideally placed to work with players establishing R&D  activities in Luxembourg.   Autonomous vehicles:  Autonomous driving promises to be more efficient than traditional transport,  introducing a new era of disruptive change in mobility. We are focused on creat- ing secure and safe infrastructure solutions for this highly complex and dynamic  technology.   Cybersecurity:  Security and trust are key words associated with doing business in Luxembourg,  allowing the country to build a financial centre that manages assets many times  the size of the national GDP. Cloud-based infrastructures are the future for much  of the service-based economy, offering flexibility, scalability, and affordability.  These systems must be designed to ensure resilience against faults and human  error as well as to resist security attacks. Critical infrastructures present a special  challenge, allowing researchers to push the envelope regarding security and resil- ience. Cybercrime and other forms of targeted and advanced persistent threats  impose a permanent risk to these systems, and Luxembourg must be at the fore- front of cybersecurity if it is to maintain and strengthen the country’s position  internationally.   Internet of Things:  Whether in use for smart homes, cities, or manufacturing, IoT offers tremendous  opportunities to build services to improve our lives. To make this a reality, we are  building smart, secure, and private IoT solutions and data analytics.   Secure and Compliant Data Management:  The new economy is data driven, and current data protection and privacy regula- tions create an opportunity for Luxembourg to establish itself in the domain. Our  research into scalability, security, affordability, and compliance for the manage- ment and protection of data is crucial to this initiative.  S T R A T E G I C  R E S E A R C H  A R E A S    33  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  P A R T N E R S H I P  P R O G R A M M E  SnT is guided by the principle that excellent scientific research can address the most pressing chal- lenges society faces, while supporting industry in developing solutions. This foundation defines its  set-up. SnT has a partnership model that enables collaborative research with players from the pri- vate and public sector, addressing relevant challenges based on real-world data and systems. This  approach creates a lively ecosystem that feeds the local talent pool and supports the local economy.   In the area of cybersecurity, SnT has partnerships with  Huawei, CREOS, VAIL, Proximus, QRA, Ministry of Foreign  Affairs (Department of Cooperation) and MEGENO.  Luxembourg/West Africa Lab for Higher Education Capacity  Building in Cybersecurity (LuxWAyS) is the latest example of a  partnership in cybersecurity. LuxWAyS is an ambitious project  for higher education cooperation between Luxembourg and  the target countries of Luxembourg cooperation. LuxWAyS  aims at training cybersecurity experts (€ 1.5 M – ten PhD  students over five years) within the West Africa sub-region in  collaboration with the Université Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar  (UCAD), Senegal; Université Joseph Ki-Zerbo (UJKZ), Burkina  Faso; and the Université Virtuelle du Burkina Faso (UVBF),  Burkina Faso.  Teams across SnT currently execute more than 40 projects relating to cybersecurity.   Furthermore, SnT is the only organisation in Europe with a presence in three of the four H-2020  networks, underlining its reputation in the domain (CONCORDIA, Cybersecurity for Europe, SPARTA).  Among SnT’s 15 research groups, five groups focus on cybersecurity:   CRITICAL AND EXTREME SECURITY AND DEPENDABILITY (CRITIX)  Interim head – Prof. Marcus Voelp  R E S E A R C H  G R O U P S  CritiX pursues state-of-the-art research in  a problem area that may be described as  extreme computing – computer science and  engineering pushed to the extremes of func- tional and non-functional properties of sys- tems. Amongst others, they investigate archi- tectures, middleware, algorithms and proto- cols that may find applicability in distributed  systems and networks, which, for example:  • Deploy extremely large-scale data sets,  flows and computations – considering  cloud, big data, complex event processing  • Withstand extreme levels of threat, such  as advanced persistent threats – consider- ing critical information infrastructures  • Need to have extremely low failure prob- ability – considering high-criticality areas  such as finance, energy, networking (SDN),  or aerospace and autonomous vehicles  • Present extreme requirements with regards  to data privacy and integrity – considering  e-health, genomics, or business/finance    34  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  Resilient modular and distributed computing  is a response to the need for a paradigm shift  enabling a comprehensive approach to those  extreme challenges, from first principles:  architecting and designing for simultaneously  coping with accidental and malicious disrup- tions; providing protection in an incremental  way; and automatically adapting to a dynamic  range of scale, severity, and persistence of  threats, some of which may be unknown.  Paradigms and techniques emerging from  this research should endow systems with  the capacity of defeating extreme adversarial  power, accidental or malicious (severe and  continued threats) and sustaining perpetual  and unattended operation (in a systematic  and automatic way).  CRITIX plans on addressing this level of threat  drawing from and building on recent research  on powerful and innovative automatic secu- rity and dependability techniques, such as  fault and intrusion tolerance or Byzantine  fault tolerance (BFT), trusted computing and  architectural hybridisation, secret sharing and  secure multi-party computation, self-heal- ing and diversity, or post-compromise secu- rity. Furthermore, the research will leverage  enhanced formal verification techniques such  as interactive theorem proving, to achieve  ultra-high reliance on software used behind  roots-of-trust or TCBs.

The mission of the CryptoLUX group is to  define, conduct, and disseminate leading-edge  research in cryptology (and closely related  fields), and to pass the knowledge gained  from research on to students and industry  partners. CryptoLUX is one of the few academ- ic research teams worldwide that possesses  expertise across the full spectrum of cryp- tology, ranging from theoretical foundations  to implementation aspects and applications.  Our mission and objectives are devised in  accordance with the three main goals of the  University of Luxembourg, which are teaching,  research and knowledge transfer at the high- est international level. Members of CryptoLUX  collaborate with top research groups around  the world and participate in activities of  ECRYPT, the European network of excellence  in cryptology. Our current research projects  cover a wide variety of topics including algo- rithm design (block ciphers, hash functions,  etc.), cryptanalysis, communication security  and anonymity, efficient implementations,  side-channel attacks, and reverse engineering.  Emerging information and communication  technologies, such as cloud computing or  the Internet of Things, pose a number of  unique challenges related to the design and  implementation of cryptographic primitives,  which has initiated a large body of research  in these areas. Nonetheless, the number of  cryptanalytic attacks (both traditional ones  as well as side-channel attacks) is steadily  increasing, and many of these attacks have  led to devastating security breaches with fatal  consequences. We envisage CryptoLUX posi- tioning itself at the forefront of an interna- tional research community that tackles these  challenges and develops innovative solutions  for complex security problems based on a  solid cryptographic foundation. To achieve  this, we strive for a greater understanding of  how cryptosystems break (or otherwise fail) in  the real world, how they can be designed and  implemented to better resist attacks, and how  they should be used to build secure systems  and networks.

Today,  securing a system requires one to understand  not only digital communications and pro- tocols but also the human and legal reality  where the system is deployed.  IRiSC’s research recognizes this change in  perspective: its focus on design and analy- sis of secure systems considers holistically  both the technical, the social, and the legal  frameworks. IRiSC’s research is about, but not  limited to, the following areas:  • Human-centred cybersecurity  • Usability security and user experience  • Cyberattacks and cyber defences  • Information and system security  • Data protection and legal compliance  • Ethics and human rights  IRiSC researchers follow methodologies that  include formal computational methods, as  well as quantitative and qualitative research  methods. IRiSC researchers have an inter- disciplinary education, combining informa- tion security and social science, physics, or  law. They all participate in the research of a  cross-disciplinary nature.

Bissyande  TRUSTWORTHY SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (TRUX)  Prof. Dr. Jacques Klein  TruX is a software engineering and software  security research group that develops innova- tive approaches and tools to help the research  and practice communities build trustworthy  software. Trustworthy software has reduced  vulnerabilities; when it fails, it can be repaired  automatically; when it operates, it can justify  its execution drives.  TruX explores the huge data on software deve- lopment artefacts (including source code and  textual information in repositories, such as  bug reports, reviews, etc.) to derive knowledge  on how to automate the analysis, construction,  and repair of software programs. In particular,  TruX conducts research in three main areas:  1. Software security: by developing new tools  and approaches to assess and ensure security  and privacy properties of software applica- tions. Examples of research activities are the  detection of privacy leaks in Android apps or  the detection of vulnerabilities in open-source  software at “commit time”.  2. Software repair: by devising and implemen- ting novel algorithms, methodologies, and tool  support for automatically repairing programs.  This is performed by identified bug or vulnera- bility locations and applying code change ope- rations that will enable the programs to satis- fy correctness criterion. TruX is particularly  focused on inventing software repair solutions  that are in line with practitioners’ constraints.  3. Explainable software: by ensuring that sof- tware engineering solutions to business pro- blems are not black-box solutions but, instead,  provide explanations and contextual infor- mation to help end users. This research direc- tion is in line with an emerging requirement  in the field of artificial intelligence where  models and techniques must be devised in  such a way that the results of an AI solution  can be understood by human experts. Given  the use of AI algorithms in several of our  research areas, we also investigate directions  on making the analyses tractable.  Tools for practitioners: TruX aims at developing  both practical and fundamental research solu- tions. Practical, because TruX directly targets  practitioners with the ambition to release tools  that are relevant for developers. Fundamental,  because TruX investigates key open and hard  software engineering problems such as the defi- nition of code similarity (e.g. representation lear- ning techniques for semantic code clone identi- fication), the derivation of abstract repair ope- rators that are less prone to test overfitting, etc.    39  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  Other teams also undertake research projects  in the area of cybersecurity and the list below   provides an overview of these projects:  Project acronym Project name Principal  investigator Funding body  CLOUDMAP Cloud Computing via Homomorphic Encryption and  Multilinear Maps J.

Within ITIS, the team involved in  cybersecurity has a focus on data privacy and  security, cyber system security and informa- tion security management. It comprises 10  researchers with a well-balanced mix of engi- neers, researchers holding a PhD as well as  collaborators working on their PhD projects.  On the scientific side, the team focuses on  modelling, designing, and analysing new algo- rithms, protocols, and systems for cyber-resil- ience. The research activities are mainly sup- ported by funding from the FNR CORE/INTER  and EU Horizon 2020 programmes.   On the applied side, the research focuses  on practical cybersecurity challenges, e.g.  application and development of crypto tools  and privacy preserving technologies, design  and implementation of blockchain technol-  ogies to solve security and privacy issues,  support to regulator/regulated entities to  comply with new and multiple regulations  (risk management, compliance, data analyt- ics). Such research activities are supported by  private and public partners, FNR CORE/INTER,  EU Horizon 2020 and Erasmus +, Connecting  Europe Facility (CEF), Luxembourg’s RDI Law,  as well as in collaboration with industrial  partners. In addition, researchers are involved  in academic training, providing lectures in  cybersecurity at Master level (University of  Luxembourg, University of Lorraine, etc.) as  well as in professional training.  The previously mentioned research activi- ties of ITIS contribute to the whole National  Cybersecurity Strategy. However, there is cur- rently a particular focus on Guideline n°2 of  the National Cybersecurity Strategy on Digital  Infrastructure Protection. Nevertheless, oth- ers are addressed as well, in line with objec- tives such as creation of new products and  services, risk management, training, etc.    41  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  R E S E A R C H  A R E A S D A T A  S E C U R I T Y  A N D  D A T A  P R I V A C Y  LIST has extensive expertise in the foundations  of data security and data privacy. Such exper- tise includes cryptographic algorithms and  protocols as well as standard and emerging  privacy enhancing technologies. Examples are  statistical disclosure control and differential  privacy. To this end, LIST consistently publishes  new scientific results at conferences and in  journals. Driven by the nature of RTO, LIST has  used this expertise in areas of practical appli- cation. Notably, LIST is working on the design  of efficient authenticated and key agreement  protocols for IoT devices, the trustworthiness  of machine learning solutions with a focus  on data-oriented aspects (e.g. data poison- ing and adversarial examples), and security  and privacy issues for 5G ecosystems with a  focus on API security. In addition, LIST is also  working on the security and privacy aspects  of Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) and  blockchain solutions, as well as the applica- tion of such technologies in domains such as  dangerous goods transportation and housing.   The work carried out by LIST has made it pos- sible to:  • Evaluate the security and privacy issues  (and more generally trustworthiness) of  existing ICT systems,  • Enhance the current systems with new  algorithms (e.g. homomorphic encryption),  protocols (e.g. privacy-preserving machine  learning) and processes (e.g. how contact  tracing is done),  • Apply new technologies such as machine  learning and DLT/blockchain to new appli- cation scenarios in a responsible and  accountable manner,  • File a patent (LU100580 – 12/2017) about a  solution dedicated to the protection and  valorisation of Internet user profiles.  C Y B E R  S Y S T E M  S E C U R I T Y  A N D  R E S I L I E N C E  Research performed within this thematic is  twofold. On the one hand, activities are cen- tred around a full-spectrum cybersecurity  awareness. LIST works on an approach to  the modelling of the services, organisations,  and infrastructures to enable security-related  knowledge sharing, integration and better  resilience of critical infrastructures and their  related essential services. This approach relies  on information security management outputs  to enable continuous real-time incident pre- vention, detection, reaction, and mitigation.  This allows increasing resilience to cyberse- curity threats and potential cascading events,  while ensuring a continuous alignment to  cybersecurity requirements and finally feed- ing back information security risk analyses.  This approach is based on the development of  distributed technological artefacts, massive  data exploitation and the use of artificial  intelligence technologies for real-time cyber- security protection.  On the other hand, LIST works on intelligent  infrastructures with their IoT devices that are  integrated into an edge-, fog- and cloud-com- puting concept, for which high-assurance of  resilience against various types of attacks is  crucial. In this sense, LIST identifies and spec- ifies the key components, their functions and  services, as part of an orchestration frame- work that are needed to ensure pre-defined  security levels, and which take the heteroge- neous setup of potential IoT infrastructures  into account. Additionally, novel cryptograph- ic mechanisms that will implement the priva- cy-by-design concept in the domain of intel- ligent infrastructures and IoT networks are  evaluated and proposed. Blockchain/DLT are  seen as the potential base of resilient infra- structures that targets distributed applica- tions in an environment of partners which are  not necessarily fully trusted. We are investi- gating use cases that could benefit most from  the fundamental properties of blockchain/DLT  and trying to create resilient solutions based  upon the latest existing frameworks.    42  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  The work carried out by LIST has made it pos- sible to:  • develop a risk-based methodology for real- time security monitoring of interdepend- ent services in critical infrastructures,  • develop a distributed architecture allow- ing continuous real-time incidents preven- tion, detection, reaction, and mitigation  for critical infrastructures,  • apply new technologies such as DLT/block- chain in order to create resilient infrastruc- tures for certain use cases.  LIST is working on a security risk management  framework that is directly linked to the work  on resilience, and covers the entire regulato- ry cycle from the processing of security risk  management by the regulated entities to the  gathering and analysis of risk-related data by  the regulator. The aim is to adopt a framework  allowing integration of risk management spe- cificities from various regulations and deal  with all of them in an integrated manner.  The framework has been implemented in a  technological platform encompassing a risk  management, an incident management, and  a data analytics module. The outcome of this  work is an improvement of the quality of risk  management results and the reduction of the  costs involved in compliance. Sector-based  and systemic governance of cybersecurity are  part of the key benefits of the approach.  A special focus in the next two years will be  on the extension of models and best practices  to the emergence of 5G and to the publication  of the European Electronic Communications  Code (EECC). In 2021, the regulatory platform  will welcome around 100 companies from all  sectors. A roadmap for improving methodol- ogies and functionalities is also being devel- oped over the next three years in collabora- tion with an industrial partner, the regulators  (ILR in Luxembourg, BIPT in Belgium) and the  companies concerned.   The work carried out by LIST has made it pos- sible to build:  • a set of standard risk analysis models,  • a regulatory platform enabling all com- panies in the relevant sectors to manage  their risks, report their risks to the regula- tor and notify incidents,  • data analytics capabilities at sectoral level  for regulators.    43  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  P R O J E C T S  A N D  P A R T N E R S  P R O J E C T S :  EU PROJECTS  FNR:  COLLABORATIVE PROJECTS:  • SPARTA (H2020): Developing a method- ology enabling real-time critical infra- structures incidents prevention, detection,  reaction and mitigation, and toolkits and  frameworks supporting the design, devel- opment and verification of security-criti- cal, large-scale distributed systems form- ing an Intelligent Infrastructure.  • TOKEN (H2020): Providing enablers for the  introduction of disruptive technologies  (namely DLT and blockchain) that contrib- ute to accelerating the transformation of  public services towards an open govern- ment model based on the principles of  collaboration, transparency, and partici- pation.  • NISDUC (CEF): Developing a set of activi- ties aimed at raising awareness, compe- tencies, and capabilities for NIS Directive  actors (national authorities, operators of  essential services, and digital service pro- viders) together with SECURITYMADEIN.LU,  ILR and IBPT.  • Housing+ (Erasmus+): Improving academic  training in the housing and real estate  field among professionals, stakeholders,  policymakers and academics through  training materials with an interdiscipli- nary, international and new technologies  content (i.e., DLT and blockchain), videos  and gamification.  • DECEPTICON: Developing procedures and  tools to support various stakeholders in  order to assess the presence of dark pat- terns in online services.  • CATALYST: Designing efficient authenti- cated and key agreement protocols for IoT  devices and designing of privacy-preserv- ing IoT data analysis protocols.  •  5G INSIGHT: Designing novel security  mechanisms ranging from attack detec- tion to attack mitigation leveraging novel   tools and paradigms such as those based  on machine learning (ML), particularly fed- erated and deep learning, to blockchains  and deception security, while considering  the specific but highly sensitive (in terms  of security) case of cross-border areas (i.e.,  the France-Luxembourg cross-border case).  • REGTECH4ILR: Developing a security risk  management framework, comprising a  regulatory authority part and a regulated  entity part.  • DG-SEC (DoD): Developing a block- chain-based system to support the author- isation and improvement of security in the  execution of the transport of dangerous  waste across Europe.   • NIS Cooperation (ILR): Work on developing  and adapting a security risk management  framework to include the sectors of the  Law of 28 May 2019 transposing the NIS  Directive, taking into account systemic  risks in and between sectors.    44  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  RDI LAW PROJECT:  SERVICES AND TRAINING:  INTERNALLY FUNDED PROJECTS:  • POST 5G Secure Experience: Developing  a 5G telecom security platform (a com- prehensive Telecom Intrusion Detection  System) over three years to protect the   POST network and its users from exploits  at infrastructure level against Telecom  attacks such as SMS spoofing, call and SMS  interception, signalling intrusion.  • Consultancy on blockchain for INFRACHAIN  including the setup of an EBSI (European  Blockchain Service Infrastructure) node for  Luxembourg.   • Professional trainings on security with  Uni.lu  • PhD thesis on Blockchain in Dangerous  Goods Transportation     45  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  COOPERATION PARTNERS (INTERNATIONAL):  STAKEHOLDERS:  COOPERATION PARTNERS (NATIONAL):  • H2020 consortia across Europe • Academia (University of Vienna and AIT),  TNO (The Netherlands), SUTD (Singapore),  University Paris Saclay (France)  • Regulation ecosystem (regulators, regulated  entities, and RegTech providers)  • ICT organisations.   • Authorities (Ministry of Foreign and  European Affairs – Defence, CIRCL)  • Regulators (ILR in Luxembourg and BIPT in  Belgium)  • Academia (Uni.lu (MSSI Master, PhD super- vision), SnT)  • Technology providers  (Westpole,  RoamsysNext, Post, Compellio)  • I n i t i a t i v e s / A s s o c i a t i o n s / N e t w o r k s  (Infrachain, Luxembourg Blockchain Lab,  CLUSIL, SDAM alliance)  PA R T N E R S :    46  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  I I I .

This has allowed  it to gather and share information related  to incidents at national level and to share  it in the respective constituencies.  • Several strands of activities at internation- al level (FIRST.org, TF-CSIRT, CiviCERT, OASIS  Open, IETF, NIS CSIRT network, Europol)  were pursued with a focus on technical  and practical issues of information shar- ing, incident response and automation of  relevant processes.  • The problems of cybercrime and disin- formation campaigns were addressed in  multidisciplinary working groups, set up  on an ad-hoc basis and according to cur- rent events and international cooperation,  particularly within the European Union.  The securing of European elections or the  response to extremist tendencies on social  networks are two examples of cooperation.  The organisations that have contributed to  the achievement of the objectives under  this guideline are mainly the Ministry  of State, the National Youth Service, the  Ministry of Education, the Ministry of the  Economy, Security Made in Luxembourg,  Kanner- a Jugendtelefon, the Ministry of  the Family, BEE SECURE, GOVCERT, the High  Commission for National Protection, the  Ministry of European and Foreign Affairs,  the Police and the Public Prosecutor’s Office.  The third National Cybersecurity Strategy (NCSS III) was structured along three guidelines and  its action plan listed 61 concrete actions, the vast majority of which have been implemented. The   following is a selection of the results:  FIRST GUIDELINE: STRENGTHENING PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT    48  N A T I O N A L  C Y B E R S E C U R I T Y  S T R A T E G Y  I V  • With the transposition of the European  Directive on security of networks and  information systems (NIS) and the iden- tification of critical infrastructure by the  HCPN, a new foundation for strengthening  the resilience of the State’s digital infra- structure was established under the NCSS  III. In the field, one of the concrete results  was the implementation of the Distributed  Denial of Service (DDoS) attack filtering  centre, which mitigates such attacks at   high volumes. Thus, additional protection  for digital infrastructures and an increase  in the resilience of the ICT sector at nation- al level has been achieved.  • In the context of the refinement of our  cyber crisis management procedures, rel- evant players have participated in major  international cyber exercises organised by  the European Union and NATO.  • In 2018, the Ministry of the Economy pre- pared a data-driven economy strategy  (approved by the Government in Council  on 26 April 2019). A legal analysis has  been carried out in relation to the legis- lative work that still needs to be done.  Since then, the Ministry has launched work  on the establishment of a trusted third  party in the field of pseudonymisation and  anonymisation. This work is coordinated  with the establishment of the European  High Performance Computing Competence  Centre (EuroHPC). Cooperation with the   National Commission for Data Protection  (CNPD) has been initiated to make avail- able in Luxembourg an GDPR code of con- duct for pseudonymisation and anonymi- sation.  • A new version of the MONARC platform  has been developed and now also includes  the possibility to link the risk analysis to  requirements frameworks and to automat- ically create statements of applicability  (SOA), as foreseen in the ISO/IEC 27001  standard.

HAJI MOHAMMAD YASMIN BIN HAJI UMAR MINISTER OF ENERGY AT THE PRIME MINISTER’S OFFICE AS CHAIRMAN OF THE E-GOVERNMENT LEADERSHIP FORUM (EGLF) Information Communication Technology (ICT) is, and always will be, a key enabler in the continuous improvement of Government and its services. To date, our Government has gone through three E‑Government Strategic Plans which was first launched in 2001, and subsequently reviewed and updated in 2005 and 2009 respectively. These plans focused on driving the uptake ICT in the government and has brought about change in the way we communicate and provide services, as well as overseeing the implementation of critical government infrastructure and centralized services. Moving forward, it is imperative that our Government continues to grow and embed technology into all levels. With this in mind, I would like to further push our commitment towards utilizing technology by refocusing and broadening our efforts beyond that of an E-Government towards that of a Digital Government. Our Digital Government Strategy 2015 – 2020 is driven to support the Nation’s vision of Wawasan 2035. We will take a Whole-of-Government approach towards innovation and service provision, leading the digital transformation of the government to make services simpler, faster and more accessible. We will champion the creation of user-friendly services to increase ease-of-use, and will encourage agencies to re‑engineer their business to fully leverage on the ICT to optimize their processes, taking into account the need for improve collaboration across multiple agencies. This requires us to foster a forward‑thinking mindset that will help to increase speed of adoption and raise the proficiency of our government officers. The Digital Government Strategy also presents us with the right opportunity to conduct a review of our existing infrastructure and systems. We must ensure that these infrastructure and systems remain current and are effectively utilized to their full capacity. In addition, data and information are essential building blocks for decision-making. Therefore, we must develop our capabilities and technologies to be able to put our Government data to use and gather valuable insights which can allow us to make informed decisions. In conclusion, I would like to call upon all stakeholders to adopt and adapt their mindsets to achieve the goal of a Digital Government. In this context, all the government agencies must take leading roles for these services. I wish to thank everyone involved in the preparation of this document including all ministries’ leaders, CIOs, CTOs and their representatives for their commitment and invaluable contribution. iv v Contents TITAH  i FOREWORD iii DRIVER  1 PROGRESS TOWARDS A DIGITAL GOVERNMENT 2 VISION  3 MISSION  3 FOCUS AREAS  4 PROGRAMMES  6 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT  10 vi 1 DRIVER WAWASAN 2035 The Digital Government Strategy 2015-2020 is driven by the Wawasan 2035, in which by 2035, we wish to see Brunei Darussalam recognised everywhere for: » The accomplishments of its well-educated people » The quality of life » The dynamic, sustainable economy Information Technology is an enabler for the Nation to achieve Wawasan 2035. Our mission and focus areas are based on the Wawasan 2035 goals, and the programmes aligned to support the activities of the Nation in working towards these goals. 2 PROGRESS TOWARDS A DIGITAL GOVERNMENT 3 VISION A DIGITAL GOVERNMENT TO ACHIEVE WAWASAN 2035 Technology continues to grow at an exceedingly rapid pace. While the Government has been quick to adopt new tools in their current business processes, it is imperative that we continuously analyse the possibilities of change brought about by these new technologies. The vision captures the limitless opportunities created by technology. This Digital Government not only encapsulates initiatives where technology is used as a tool, but also captures the dialog, interactions, and empowerment of the Government and its stakeholders. As a Digital Government, we will continually question the status quo and challenge the conventional way that we conduct our activities to improve the delivery of our services. In doing so, we aim to provide the Nation with the tools and capabilities to achieve sustainable development of the country. We must constantly drive to increase the efficiency, effectiveness, quality and accessibility of information and services that will contribute to economic and social growth, while protecting the environment. MISSION To Lead the Digital Transformation and Make Government Services Simpler, Faster and More Accessible To support greater efficiency and collaboration, and to improve all stakeholders’ experience, Government processes and services require transformation and continuous improvement. Information technology enables the seamless flow of information across the Government, citizens and businesses leading to greater transparency and better insights for informed decision making. 4 FOCUS AREAS Security Service Innovation Collaboration & Integration Optimisation Enterprise Information Management Capability & Mind-set Digital Government 5 ENTERPRISE INFORMATION MANAGEMENT With today’s knowledge driven economy, information is a fundamental building block that can advance a nation. It is critical that the Government manage the explosive growth of data by structuring, describing and governing information assets that can then be used to generate insights that aid decision making. In order to realise our vision and to achieve our mission, six focus areas have been identified. FOCUS DESCRIPTION SERVICE INNOVATION With an increasingly sophisticated and dynamic society, government agencies must develop new and innovative ways to deliver services to citizens and businesses with greater transparency and accountability. COLLABORATION & INTEGRATION Government agencies are required to work together to face an increasingly complex environment. This requires a Whole-Of- Government approach to enhance the collaboration and integration of government business processes. CAPABILITY & MIND-SET People will always remain the key that will lead to the successful implementation of any technology. It is essential to foster a forward-thinking mind-set and collaborative culture. This will help to increase the speed of adopting new systems, rate of utilising systems and proficiency of government officials. OPTIMISATION To keep pace with the rapid development of technology, the government has been implementing various IT systems and platforms. Moving forward, the Government needs to optimise the use of these digital assets to ensure effectiveness, minimised redundancy and maximise value for money. SECURITY Following on from the previous strategic plan 2009-2014, security will remain a key focus area. The Government needs to maintain situational awareness of its digital assets and environment at all times. Adequate measures will be taken to minimise risks and increase capabilities to respond to cyber-incidents effectively. 6 PROGRAMMES Six programmes have been identified to realise the vision and to achieve the Brunei Digital Government Strategy 2015-2020.

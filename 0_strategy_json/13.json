Today, ICT is one of the leading drivers for social-economic growth globally. The Aspiration of the Government of Uganda is to support Uganda’s economic competitiveness growth enabled by ICT. Embedded within, is to achieve a state of harmonized and interoperable digital infrastructure for Government of Uganda as our strategic goal through building the appropriate secure ICT Infrastructure, creating an enabling environment as well as developing and promoting use of e-Government for efficient service delivery. Over the years, the private sector has made similar investments towards incorporation of ICT within their various business models. Pillar three of the Digital Uganda Vision (2020) addresses ‘Cyber Security and Data Privacy’. This pillar provides assurance that digital services are safe, secure, protected, and trusted and when in use. This pillar further seeks to ensure that the country builds capacity for cybersecurity management. In line with this, the information and processes held on this digital infrastructure is critical to the well- functioning of the country. The more we increase our adoption and investment in ICT, the more we increase our risk exposure. This therefore necessitates we adopt cyber security as a culture in our usage of ICT based on the principles of confidentiality, integrity and availability. Currently, the threat towards digital infrastructure and applications is not only eminent but more sophisticated, persistent and disastrous. With this in mind, countries are increasing improving their cyber security focus to protect their digital infrastructure as well as defend against cyber-attacks. At the national level, Government of Uganda has led several cyber security initiatives aimed towards improving Uganda’s information security maturity level. In light of the above, the complex and interconnected nature of the cyber space is such that ensuring holistic cyber security becomes a shared responsibility between the Government, Private Sector and other stakeholders. Part of our country’s national critical information infrastructure is run by the private sector. A resilient National approach towards Cyber Security requires the involvement of all key stakeholders (both state and non-state actors), whether at national and international level based on collaboration, which is the intent of this strategy. The development of this strategy has been a collaborative initiative within the public and private ICT sub sector stakeholders. The National Cyber Security Strategy sets the direction for improvement of our National Cyber Security capabilities to achieve the highest cyber security maturity level. As we implement this strategy, we will be promoting trust amongst our citizens in the usage of ICT enabled services, defending our digital infrastructure against threats as well as contributing to international cyber security. The Strategy further demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that our adoption of ICT supports the country’s improved competitiveness. ______________________________________ Hon. Dr. Chris Baryomunsi Minister for ICT & National Guidance 6 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Over the years, the Government of Uganda has placed the requisite enabling environment to facilitate the growth of the information and communication technologies (ICT) sector. Uganda has invested in a national fibre-optic backbone to promote social and economic development by availing cost effective, reliable and high-speed connectivity to the businesses and citizens. In the last ten years, Uganda's ICT sector has grown at an exponential rate, owing largely to a favorable policy and legal climate that has resulted in increased investment, expansion of ICT infrastructure, innovation, and expansion of ICT products and services. The potential for the total transformation of the economy and the attendant social impact is best demonstrated by the pervasive expansion and use of mobile money services in Uganda. Mobile money transactions facilitated via telecommunication company platforms more than [1] doubled in value to US $26 billion in 2020, from $9 billion in 2015 [2]. The recent Uganda National Development Plan for 2020/21 – 2024/25, that stipulates the Country’s medium term strategic direction, development priorities and implementation strategies in line with the Uganda Vision 2040, sets the digital transformation, ie the usage of ICT services for social and economic development as one of the 18 core programs of the strategy. At the same time, peace, security and defence are prerequisites for a sustainable socio-economic transformation, democracy and national unity. The growth in the ICT infrastructure, Internet usage and online access have opened new opportunities for the country, however, with the increase in use of e- services, the need for cybersecurity protection is key in order to avoid cyber fraud and maintain trust in the use of these services. Information security also serves broader national security goals by protecting critical national sectors and information infrastructure. Security in cyberspace is especially important to realize the strategic visions of Uganda. This Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 provides development paths, policy and technical recommendations to achieve Uganda’s Vision 2040 aiming to transform Uganda to a competitive upper middle income country. Uganda has taken important steps to put in place and implement in practice the necessary policy, legal and regulatory frameworks in order to take advantage of the growing digital economy, but also to protect its critical national infrastructure and citizens, by ensuring a safe and secure space that will help the society to have trust and confidence in the digital economy. The Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 is a strategic planning tool that reflects Uganda’s plans to achieve the objectives of modern economies. The strategy contributes to existing policies that seek to implement Uganda’s socio-economic development from cybersecurity perspective and aspires to support building a digital environment that citizens and businesses can trust. The Strategy document is structured into four main chapters. First, after introduction the vision, mission and goals for Uganda are set for the next years in the cybersecurity domain. Next, the Strategy describes the context of today’s trends in digital development and Uganda’s strategic advances, but also cyber threats and trends in cybercrime, and the national capacity to address these. The essence of the Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 is in Chapter 5 that describes the main principles, strategic direction, pillars and targets in 6 areas. The last Chapter covers implementation mechanism as well as monitoring and evaluation of the strategy. The Strategy was developed through a consultative process led by the Ministry of ICT and National Guidance. 7 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] 1 VISION AND GOALS 1.2 Vision and mission Vision: Uganda is a Digitally Empowered Society and Knowledge Economy. Mission: To create a ensuring a secure and resilient cyberspace that supports the adoption and innovation of ICT in all sectors for the socio-economic stability and development of Uganda. 1.3 Goals Digitalization is an important process that supports Uganda’s economic development, national welfare, and prosperity. Our goal is to have ICTs incorporated into every aspect of the everyday lives of people, organisations, business and government. The national cybersecurity system established by this Strategy aims to support fostering safe and trusted digital economy of Uganda to ensure safety of e-services and reduce cybercrime. The strategy set strategic goals in 6 areas. Following the whole-of-nation principle The protection of Uganda and its citizens in cyberspace is a shared responsibility – everyone has a role to play. The COVID crisis has shown the importance of secure online connectivity as it is forcing anything which can be digitized, to digitize and many organisations have had to embrace remote working. The whole-of-nation principle calls for citizens, private sector companies, and government agencies to work hand-in-hand to seize the various possibilities of digital technology while managing cyber risks. The Government of Uganda is putting in place the necessary infrastructure and policies to build capabilities, and to create a conducive ecosystem for the Digitally Empowered Society and Knowledge Economy of Uganda as set in the Digital Uganda Vision. In addition, the Government is conducive ecosystem to foster Uganda’s cybersecurity by developing and enforcing policies and guidelines. However, both companies and community as important stakeholders shall do their part and follow national cybersecurity guidelines and policies set by the Government. 8 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] 9 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] 2. CURRENT SITUATION, NATIONAL CAPACITY ASSESSMENT AND TRENDS E-Services and the widening use of ICT are the lifeblood of the digital economy globally. Over the last two decades, the number of e-Services globally has accelerated exponentially, helping to connect industry, facilitate trade, and drive international investment. E-Services have also impacted environmental and social practices and transformed the delivery of government services. Uganda Vision 2040 aims at “a transformed Ugandan society from a peasant to a modern and prosperous country within 30 years”. As a developing country, Uganda has a unique opportunity to boost economy, public administration, education, and healthcare with digitalisation. Without outdated legacy systems it is possible to focus on new opportunities in technology and e-services. Digital transformation also positions Uganda among regional and global leaders in the field of digital agile governance by focusing on effective service delivery, citizen engagement and the digital economy. This will reduce the cost of governance and reduce corruption while increasing national productivity. The potential for the total transformation of the economy and the attendant social impact is best demonstrated by the pervasive expansion and use of mobile money services in Uganda. Mobile money transactions facilitated via telecommunication company platforms more than doubled in value to US$ 20 billion in 2019, from $9 billion in 2015, according to the Bank of Uganda. Further design and implementation of specific sector-wide digitalization projects can assist faster and more profound digital transformation. Transformation of Uganda to modern society will rely on a modern education system but also on high awareness and safe behavior while using ICTs. Uganda focuses on building a digitally enabled society that is agile and able to adapt to emerging technologies and trends. It also looks at promotion of digital literacy and ICT professional development for the current and future industry needs. Cybersecurity is the a cross-cutting theme to support the digital economy and transformation. Therefore, it is important to develop also a robust and solid Cybersecurity Strategy that establishes measures to ensure security of digitalisation process and help to protect Uganda and its citizens in cyberspace. The strategic tasks described in the Cybersecurity Strategy will give assurance that digital services are and will remain safe, secure, protected, and trusted. 2.1 Alignment with Other Strategies Uganda has established quite a solid set of strategic perspectives, with the wider aspiration to support Uganda’s economic competitiveness and growth enabled by ICT. Series of policies, strategies, and legislation provide the road map guiding country to becoming an information society and digital economy and set the guiding principles and direction for the Cybersecurity Strategy 2021. Uganda Vision 2040 emphasizes the importance of digital transformation in Ugandan society and underscores the need for Uganda to re-orient itself to make ICT as the main driver of economic growth. Digital Uganda Vision of the Ministry of ICT and National Guidance provides an overarching framework that responds to the national Vision 2040 by providing a unified ICT policy direction and strategic framework to show how ICT can empower Ugandan citizens and achieve the goals of universal inclusion, sustainable development, economic progress and poverty eradication through digital innovation. Digital Uganda Vision acknowledges that the ICT potential by different stakeholders is very much premised on the ability to ensure security of information, privacy and protection of personal data. Therefore, the Vision provides strategic inventions to build a trusted digital ecosystem in Uganda. The 4th Industrial Revolutions 10 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] Strategy’s (4IR) vision is to transform Uganda to a continental 4IR hub by 2040 and accelerate Uganda’s development into an innovative, productive and competitive society using 4IR technologies. One of the strategic objectives is to support national security in the digital world. Given the immense advantages of connecting the population to the internet and to mobile networks, both universal broadband access and complete mobile coverage nationally are national priority in terms of infrastructure. Uganda Broadband Policy 2020 recognizes the broadband infrastructure as a public utility (like water, transport and energy) and sets the target to provide connectivity for all, improve its affordability and licensing conditions. At the same time, peace, security and defence are prerequisites for a sustainable socio-economic transformation, democracy and national unity as stated in the Uganda Vision 2040. Security in cyberspace is especially important to realize the goals set in the Digital Uganda Vision. Protection of the country’s sovereignty is now the next frontier and Uganda needs the enhanced the capabilities and resources, both human and technological, to build adequate and credible defence capacity to address external threats and maintain internal security. Third National Development Plan 2020/21 – 2024/25 acknowledges that cyberspace is now a medium for disinformation among competing commercial interests, ideological adversaries, governments, and extremists, and it is a battleground between cybercriminals and law enforcement. The Plan emphasizes Uganda’s need to significantly invest in building the competencies of communication structures to be able to anticipate, avert and stop disrupting attempts of government or commercial operations and minimize the spread of misinformation. Government is willing to react and enact regulation of cyberspace, increase resources for cyber-defence and protect the critical infrastructure (e.g. power grids) from cyber threats. Uganda’s preparation of its second National Development Plan coincided with the endorsement of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015. Consequently, Uganda was among the world’s first to begin alignment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with its national planning frameworks. The aspiration of the Agenda is to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation by 2030. Similarly, the aspiration of Agenda 2063 of African Union aspiration is to put in place the necessary infrastructure to support Africa’s accelerated integration and growth, technological transformation, trade and development. All these goals can be linked to the main strategic documents of Uganda. 2.2 Digital Transformation of Economy At the end 2020, 30.8 million devices were connected to the network in Uganda. These include mobile handsets, laptops, tablets and other IOT terminals. The growth is significant – during the last 12 months 3.7 million new devices were connected to the network. In December 2020, the number of active internet subscriptions had grown to 21.4 million which means more than 1 active connection for every 2 Ugandans [3]. According to the ITU Digital Development Dashboard 2020 24% of Uganda’s population is using the Internet (data from 2017) thus positioning as average in the African region, with significant potential for growth. 11 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] Figure 1. Mobile and fixed Internet subscriptions in 2020 [2]. However, broadband access in Uganda is largely mobile and rate of fixed broadband penetration is still very low (0.1% of all Internet subscriptions in the 4th quarter of 2020 are fixed). The low fixed broadband access implies that there is little progress in promoting broadband access to anchor institutions like schools, libraries, health centers, and Local Government offices and that a critical mass of institutions and businesses are not using broadband services to be competitive. Figure 2. How the Internet is used? Monthly user traffic profile in 4th quarter of 2020 [2]. In recent years, and in particular during the global pandemic crisis, Uganda has witnessed an increase in malware distribution, business email compromises, the spread of fake news and mobile money network fraud. In early October 2020, Uganda’s telecoms and banking sectors were plunged into crisis due to a major hack that compromised the country’s mobile money network. At least $3.2 million is estimated to have been stolen in that incident, in which hackers used around 2,000 mobile SIM cards to gain access to the mobile money payment system. By the end of 2020, total active mobile money accounts stood at 22.5 million of the 28 million registered accounts. The trend in the mobile money industry and the growth in number of mobile money accepting businesses has been upward for the year 2020. The number of active mobile agents has grown to 235,790 12 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] and the number of mobile money transactions during the last quarter of 2020 for the first time ever crossed the 1 billion transactions mark. In many African countries however, Uganda included, mobile-data baskets are still out of reach for a large part of the population, costing more than 10 per cent of Gross National Income per capita, in situations where incomes are already limited. In terms of affordability of fixed services, Africa is the region with the highest fixed-broadband basket prices and Uganda is no exception [4]. Figure 3. The use of mobile money (* up to September 2020) [1]. The private sector in Uganda is dominated by about 1.1 million micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) all together employing approximately 2.5 million people. The Uganda Vision 2040 aspires directly investing in strategic areas to stimulate the economy and facilitate private sector growth and targets increasing the growth of MSMEs to drive industrialization. National Development Plan recognizes the need to support the private sector, particularly local MSMEs, to develop capacity to drive the industrialization effort, increase exports, create jobs and increase local content. In the strategic ICT sector, SMEs can be supported through the system of incubation centres to develop their digital and financial literacy, and through supportive research and innovation facilities established and accessible to MSMEs. The 2018 After Access Survey shows that Internet use, mobile phone penetration, and the Internet use divisions between genders as well as urban and rural dwellers are correlated with Gross National Income (GNI) per capita. Uganda is classified as one of the least developed countries – a list of developing countries that, according to the UN, possess the lowest indicators of socioeconomic development and the lowest Human Development Index ratings among all countries in the world. The lack of electricity and underdeveloped ICT infrastructure are the primary causes of discrepancies in urban–rural Internet use and mobile phone penetration rates in Uganda. Uganda has a considerable urban–rural gap in Internet use of 70 percent, where only nine percent of Ugandans living in rural areas have access to the Internet and about a third (30%) of urban area dwellers using it [5]. Several studies demonstrate that broadband penetration and broadband quality are important factors for economic growth. According to a World Bank study, it is estimated that for every 10% increase in broadband penetration in low and middle income countries result in a commensurate increase of 1.38% of the GDP [6]. Studies also reveal the economic impact of broadband deployment directly through jobs created by deploying broadband infrastructure, and indirectly as a result of ‘spill- over’ externalities, such as increased productivity and new products and services i.e. through accelerated innovation. 2.3 Cyber Crime Cybersecurity continues to be a challenge in Uganda and the share of cyber (computer) crimes in total economic crimes is on the rise. In 2020 the cybercrime report of the Uganda Police acknowledges the relative increase in cases of cybercrimes related cases and they led to a loss of UGX 15,949,236,000 in 2020. The major categories of cybercrimes were electronic fraud and obtaining money by false pretense. [7] 13 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] Figure 4. Major categories of cybercrimes [8]. In addition to economic crimes, cybersecurity threats pose a serious risk to the integrity of the e- government system and internet in Uganda generally. [7] The Uganda Police Force has digital forensics capacity and a cyber-crime unit. The cybercrime unit helps the Police to participate and get knowledge on current trends on cybersecurity. Police in collaboration with National Information Technology Authority – Uganda and Uganda Communications Commission have published several cybercrime awareness materials and initiated thematic campaigns. Cybercrime is reported to have had a 300% fold growth in the year 2020 [8], thus the need for capacity building and increase in cybersecurity awareness is urgent to cope with the increasing number of cybercrimes. 2.4 Protection of Critical Infrastructure In 2011, the Government of Uganda developed the National Information Security Strategy (NISS) supporting sub-sector policies and frameworks within the ICT sector to secure critical national infrastructure and information resources. NISS recognizes the importance of the identification of critical infrastructure that are critical for the functioning of the society as a whole. In 2016 the protection of Uganda’s Critical Information Infrastructure and cyberspace was identified as one of 5 strategic goals of the draft cybersecurity strategy. The Computer Misuse Act 2011 provides guidance on sectors that are currently recognized as Critical National Infrastructure sectors in Uganda. According to the Act, a “protected computer” is a computer, program or data used directly in connection with or necessary for the security, defence or international relations of Uganda; law enforcement; the provision of services directly related to communications infrastructure, banking and financial services, public utilities; public key infrastructure and public safety. The 2014 National Information Security Policy and Framework (NISF) with its compulsory security measures applies to all organisations that operate protected computers. Policy is established by NITA-U. 14 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] Figure 5. Areas of protected computers according to the Computer Misuse Act 2011. The establishment of security baseline for protected computers, programs or data in sectors specified in NISF and Computer Misuse Act (2011) has been the tool to address the national critical information infrastructure (NCII) protection in Uganda. However, Legislation and regulation do not provide for obligations for cyber-incident reporting, which remains ad-hoc activity and thereby exacerbates the potential impact of incidents. Latest development in the area is the Strategic Plan on the protection of National Critical Information Infrastructure approved by NITA-U in 2021. The document describes critical infrastructure sectors, the CNII operators as well as their role. 2.5 Digital Awareness With the rapid growth of internet connectivity on the African continent, many Ugandans are getting access and connecting to the internet for the first time, while often lacking knowledge on how to protect themselves online. [10] Low levels of ICT literacy would make it difficult to launch awareness campaigns, which the Global Cybersecurity Capacity Centre found to be almost non-existent in the African countries it surveyed. In 2017, 90% of African businesses were operating below the cybersecurity ‘poverty line’ – unprepared for cyber threats and an easy preys to cybercriminals. [11] The Government of Uganda has realized that cybersecurity awareness is crucial and considerable awareness raising efforts, coupled with increasing availability, access and affordability have been undertaken. These efforts include concerted ICT security awareness campaigns led by the MoICT & NG, NITA-U and UCC. For example, a review of NITA statistics report 2019 indicates Sensitization activities to enhance cyber legal awareness have been conducted over the years. In financial year 2018/19, there was an increment of 20 percent in the number of awareness sessions conducted across the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and Local Governments. In July 2021, NITA-U embarked on a digital driven awareness campaign on cybersecurity with funding from the Regional Communications Infrastructure Program. The development and continuous implementation of cybersecurity awareness initiatives focusing on disseminating 15 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] information about cybersecurity risks and threats, as well as about best practices for countering them, should be continued and enhanced. In addition, there is a need for a structured training and certification program/framework for cybersecurity related careers in Uganda. Education on cybersecurity issues is not offered as part of the curriculum in all levels of education, and there is limited budgetary allocation for research and development in this field. Gaps in information security in the country can be close best by integrating security into the education systems and making skill building easier and attainable. 2.6 Uganda’s Performance on Global Indices Uganda has set the goal to improve rankings in the various global competitiveness indices. According to World Bank annual ratings Uganda is ranked 127 among 190 economies in the ease of doing business in 2018, a position it maintained in the following year (2019). Uganda ranked 152 out of 176 countries in the International Telecommunications Union’s IDI (2017); 121 out of 139 countries in the Network Readiness Index; and 64 out of 75 countries in the latest Economist Intelligence Unit Inclusive Internet Index (3i). Behind these rankings is the poor information infrastructure and low levels of Internet penetration in the country compared to others. In terms of Internet freedom, Uganda is considered as partly free and Internet penetration rates continue to improve despite a daily tax on social media use that limits access to communication platforms. In the E- Government Development Index (EGDI), which presents the state of E-Government Development of the United Nations Member States, Uganda ranked 137 out of 193 countries in 2020. In the ITU Global Cybersecurity Index; in the African region Uganda ranks as 9th in 2020 (2018 7th), globally 70th (2018 65th). According to the index, the Uganda’s relative strength is in the implementation of legal measures but there is room for potential growth in the Cooperative Measures category (national, regional, and international cooperation), implementation of the Data Protection and Privacy Act and also in capacity building. In the National Cybersecurity Index of the e-Governance Academy, Uganda holds 56th position globally and 3rd in African region. 16 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] Cybersecurity foundation in Uganda to date Current Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 builds on the following milestones:  2009 – Establishment of NITA-U to implement the provisions of the NITA-U Act.  2011 - Several laws were promulgated to guarantee a safe online environment for users and citizens, with a number of texts developed namely the Computer Misuse Act (2011), the Electronic Signatures Act (2011) and the Electronic Transactions Act (2011).  2011 - Adoption of the National Information Security Strategy (NISS)  2013 - Uganda Communications Commission revised mandate to implement the provisions of the UCC Act 2013  2013-2014 – Establishment of Computer Emergency Response Teams: National CERT.UG/CC and Communications Sector CERT  2014 – Publishment of the draft of the National Information Security Policy and Framework (NISF)  2014 – Establishment of the National Information Security Advisory Group (NISAG) as forum for coordinating implementation of cybersecurity best practices in CII operators  2019 - Enactment of the Data Protection and Privacy Act (2019)  2020 - Publishment of the draft of the Digital Uganda Vision 17 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] 3. STRATEGIC TASKS 3.1 Safe and trusted digital economy The real potential for economic growth and large-scale job creation lies in spreading digital innovations from lead firms to the rest of the economy. The role of governments is to create an environment that enables the many private sector actors to benefit from digitalization. Studies demonstrate that broadband penetration and broadband quality are important factors for economic growth. They also reveal the economic impact of broadband deployment directly through jobs created by deploying broadband infrastructure, and indirectly by increased productivity and the creation of new products and services. According to a World Bank study, it is estimated that for every 10% increase in broadband penetration in low- and middle-income countries, there is a commensurate increase of 1.38% of the GDP [6]. 3.1.1 Implement PKI and e-Signature Government will make effort to create an online environment that is safe and trusted by society and businesses. The vision is a user-friendly digital ecosystem where the security of personal and sensitive data and information is assured, and users’ rights are protected. To improve the trust and confidence towards digital transactions and e-services, the Government will enforce the adoption and implementation of digital standards, laws and regulations that ensure security of online transactions Uganda has taken steps towards a safer service environment. The Electronic Signature Act 2011 together with relevant regulations provide a framework for the provisions and use of electronic signatures. The Act regulates the use of advanced electronic signatures, digital signatures and the use of third-party certification systems, such as a public key infrastructure (PKI), for the purposes of securing information conveyed over the internet and authenticating or certifying electronic signatures. Government of Uganda through NITA-U is implementing the UgPass pilot project, a new digital authentication and electronic signatures´solution for Uganda which will activate use of PKI services. Uganda will take advantage of rapid advances in digital technology to establish national digital ID platforms or systems that serve the whole nation, including enterprises. Digital ID and signature are vital components of the modern economy, without which digital transformation will be impossible. Safe and trusted digital economy Develop and implement digital identity to facilitate utilization of e-services Prioritize support for MSMEs A public key infrastructure (PKI) is a set of roles, policies, and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption. The purpose of a PKI is to facilitate the secure electronic transfer of information for a range of network activities such as e-commerce, internet banking and confidential email. 18 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] 3.1.2 Increased focus on enterprises African economic growth has been steady for 25 years, but the continent has not fully enjoyed the benefits of digitalisation for economic and social progress. Also, policymakers are becoming more aware of the need to secure the digital future, as cybersecurity became part of the African Union Agenda 2063. Business operations have shifted further online during the COVID-19 pandemic, placing increased demands on private sector cybersecurity practices. MSMEs are often the most common size of business within a country and make up a significant part of national economy as 90% of businesses are MSMEs, 50% of employment stems from MSMEs, and formal MSMEs contribute up to 40% of Gross Domestic Product in emerging economies. Thus, Uganda has to nurture entrepreneurship and innovation. MSMEs are also often least able to tackle cybersecurity. This puts SMEs in need of cybersecurity awareness activities, accessible cybersecurity guidelines and tools. The Government will provide its support and dedicated programs for MSMEs to enhance the awareness how to safely conduct business in today’s networked environment. Uganda will develop a scheme that will help small and medium size enterprises to protect their organizations, against the most common cyberattacks. Governmental cybersecurity web portal will provide guidelines and awareness-raising materials and initiatives focused on MSMEs. The compromise of personal data can damage the legitimate rights and interests of cause adverse disruptions to the affected individuals and businesses. With increasing amounts of data migrating to computer systems and electronic devices, there is a need to secure these systems and safeguard individuals’ data against theft and misuse. At the same time, organisations can leverage good personal data management to gain a better understanding of their customers, increase business efficiency and effectiveness, and boost customer confidence. Uganda through the Personal Data Protection Office will intensify the work with private organizations to embrace data protection as part of their corporate culture and take reasonable steps to manage and secure personal information that they hold. Through industry briefings, online training resources, and advisory guidelines, MSMEs will be equipped with information on the requirements of the Data Protection Act and good data management practices. 3.1.3 Action Areas By fostering safe and trusted digital economy, the Government of Uganda (GoU) will: a) Implement digital identity to facilitate utilization of e-services GoU will pilot the UgPass to implement a whole-of-nation PKI and deploy the essential enabling building blocks for modern and safe e-services. The standards for electronic signatures will be updated and described. GoU will continue to scale the usage of PKI within government IT enabled services and applications. b) Prioritise support for SMEs GoU will provide support by providing cybersecurity guidelines and standards for voluntary compliance and dedicated capacity building programs for MSMEs to enhance the awareness on how safely conduct business in today’s networked environment. As part of the program GoU will work with private organizations to embrace cybersecurity and data protection as part of their corporate culture. 19 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] 3.2 Threat preparedness and response 3.2.1 Risk management It is important to realise that cybersecurity incidents can never be completely prevented. The rapid development of technology and its accelerated spread also increases the potential for security incidents. Therefore, in addition to preventing incidents, the focus must also be on cyber resilience – i.e. on the control and reduction of damage caused by incidents. This requires two types of action: first, proactive measures aimed at preventing incidents, and second, reactive ones to control and reduce damage. Figure 6. Measures to achieve cyber resilience. Continuous gathering and analysis of information on security incidents both domestically and internationally makes the rapid identification of threats possible and the resolution of incidents more effective. Therefore, Uganda will put continuous effort to identify and understand potential threats (threat intelligence) and the risks associated with these threats (risk awareness). There is also a need for resources to detect and cope with incidents (incident management) and to plan activities and resources to deal with the damage caused by incidents (recovery). The existence of such measures will, on the one hand, increase the ability to prevent incidents by increasing overall security and, on the other hand, significantly reduce the adverse impact of incidents on society. [1] Threat preparedness and response Promote risk assessment practices based on central risk repository Develop central incident register and sectoral incident scenarios Develop tools for information sharing Strengthen national and sectoral CERTs Publish regularly Cyber Threat Landscape Report Establish programs for a capacity building about risk management 20 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] Global cyberattacks during recent years have caused a massive financial and reputational damage to states states, governments, companies, and private citizens. To improve Uganda’s resilience against such incidents it is essential to detect, analyze, understand, and mitigate cybersecurity risks. Cybersecurity risks involve three components: - Threat. Threat can be technological like malware, geopolitical like adversary nation state, crime like an organized crime group or even environmental like extreme weather conditions. - Vulnerability. Vulnerability is often described as a weakness of computer system which can be exploited. In the cyber ecosystem, vulnerability is more complex and can be technological, organizational, administrative etc weaknesses that leave the ecosystem open to cyberthreats. - Consequence (impact). Consequence can be assessed combining likelihood of the cyber incident with potential impact to the ecosystem or its components. Figure 7. Three components of cybersecurity risk. To mitigate cybersecurity risk and minimize the negative impact of cyber threats, Government will continue the update of National Information Risk Register, develop and regularly update sector based risk scenarios for incident management (for energy, communications, government sectors etc). Both national level and sector oriented cyber risk repositories improve understanding about current cybersecurity risks and allows to forecast and model trends. The responsible regulatory bodies and NCII operators will update periodically the list of their critical services due to continually changing threat landscape. Uganda will establish the mandatory incident reporting for NCII and government sector and aggregate a national level incident register, which is essential for understanding security situation and to plan, develop and implement appropriate security measures for different sectors. For a successful and efficient risk management, Uganda will foster inter-agency cooperation in cybersecurity related matters, especially in information sharing, and will establish special programs for a capacity building for sectors that have less resources for cybersecurity such as MSMEs, healthcare institutions. 3.2.2 Preparedness and incident response Today, organizations’ ability to handle potential incidents is inevitable. Globally, 86,2% of companies are being compromised by at least one successful attack in 2021. Notably, this doesn’t account for attempted attacks or those that went unreported. [9] Even though when global investments to cybersecurity are enormous, due to the dynamics of cyberspace, fast growing number of threats and rapid digitalization, attack surface of cyberthreats is increasing fast. Many of attacks and other incidents can be prevented by efficient threat intelligence, risk awareness and smart technological protection. However, since cyber incidents will continue to take place, appropriate incident management and incident recovery framework shall be established for Uganda. In order to efficiently respond to incidents, Uganda will define clearly national working arrangements for information exchange and incident response. ICT incidents tend to escalate very rapidly, thus the roles of the various organisations and agencies, cooperation arrangements and mechanisms for exchange of information must be defined and organised. Given the need for extensive cooperation with the private sector and with future sector specific CSIRTs (e.g financial, energy etc.), sectoral CSIRTs will develop specific competence (such as security of industrial control systems) that is needed for incident management in specific sectors. 21 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] The threat environment and criminal landscape is in constant change, which means that the Government needs new tools, approaches and creativity for incident management at MDAs, NCII operators, police and law enforcement to stand a chance. Uganda will clarify common interests of various stakeholders and create appropriate tools or methods for information sharing. Communication and information sharing both within public sector and private sector and between public and private sector is a prerequisite for efficient response to incidents. Sound incident and crisis management plans as well as general knowledge about threat landscape guarantees the preparedness for incidents. Uganda will draft and establish national and sectoral incident resolution plans as a part of national emergency planning and crises management. Testing the rules and plans for information sharing and incident management guarantee their efficiency. Uganda will regularly conduct cyber drills. Cyberdrills will be organised both within teams and at the national level. 3.2.3 Action Areas To be prepared to threats and guarantee a sustainable national level cyber risk management and response system, GoU will: a) Promote risk assessment practices based on central risk repository & regularly publish the Cyber Threat Landscape Report. GoU will establish a mechanism for regular threat intelligence and analysis at strategic and tactical level. That shall include collection and analysis of the information about strategic threat vectors such as geopolitical tensions, increasing cybercrime etc. as well as technical information of cyber-attacks, characteristics of malware etc. Common cyber risk assessment methodology will be established for MDAs and NCII operators. The National Information Risk Register will provide up-to-date information about current cybersecurity risks and allows to observe and predict trends. b) Develop central incident register and sectoral incident scenarios. GoU will establish the mandatory incident reporting for NCII and government sector and develop clear guidelines for reporting. NITA-U will manage an aggregated national level incident register. GoU will generate sector-based risk scenarios for incident management and prepare national and sectoral incident resolution plans as a part of national emergency planning and crises management. c) Strengthen national and promote sectoral CERTs. GoU will enhance capacity and capability for incident response especially heavily focusing on the proactive approach, increasing capacity building for first level incident responders and home grown re-usable security monitoring solutions for organisations. d) Develop tools for information sharing. GoU will foster cooperation and communication between security, law enforcement and other government agencies and provide a Cyber Threat Intelligence information sharing framework. National emergency planning and crises management will be enhanced through the development of large-scale cyber incident management plans. e) Establish programs for capacity building in the risk management. GoU will establish capacity building programs for sectors hat have less resources for cybersecurity such as MSMEs, healthcare institutions. 22 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] 3.3 Robust cybersecurity ecosystem The complex and interconnected nature of cyberspace is such that ensuring holistic cybersecurity becomes a shared responsibility between the Government, private sector and other stakeholders as part of our country’s national critical information infrastructure is run by the private sector. A robust national ecosystem guaranteeing cybersecurity requires the involvement of all key stakeholders, both state and non-state actors, and at national and international level based on collaboration. Assets that are essential to the functioning and security of a society and economy of the country are Critical Infrastructure (CI). National Critical Information Infrastructure (NCII) are ICT systems that operate key functions of the critical infrastructure. The protection of NCII in Uganda is addressed from a risk management perspective. Regular risk assessments guide the identification of national critical infrastructure and services, whose disruption may have a serious impact on the security or economic well-being of citizens and harm Uganda’s possibilities to benefit from digitalisation. A risk-based approach also enables to prioritize implementation of programs and policies designed to protect NCIIs. Earlier strategic interventions, i.e. the 2011 NISS recognizes the prominence of protecting critical information infrastructure from disruption and the role of public-private partnerships as one of the guiding principles of Uganda. The Computer Misuse Act addresses the offences in relation with protected computers in certain areas and economic sectors, however, it does not organize transparently the principles and criteria for determining the NCII ecosystem, nor does it outlines minimum cybersecurity baselines addressing NCII operators. The establishment of a security baseline for protected computers, programs or data in sectors specified in NISF and Computer Misuse Act (2011) has been the current practice to address the critical information infrastructure protection in Uganda. In order to enhance the transparency and thereby boost trust between the private and the public sector, the Government will implement the strategic plan on the protection of National Critical Information Infrastructure containing a list of critical sectors to be considered as essential for the maintenance of critical societal and economic activities. The national level risk assessments provided by NITA-U and NISAG will serve as a basis of reviewing the list and any future NCII updates. Robust cyber- security ecosystem Implement the strategic plan on the protection of NCII Promote cooperation and understanding of cybersecurity risks in all critical sectors Raising awareness of supply chain risks Update of the minimal cybersecurity baseline for NCII operators Create effective governance and management structure for protection of NCII The protection of National Critical Information Infrastructure relies on regular and up-to-date risk assessments 23 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] The protection of NCII in various sectors exceeds the capabilities and mandate of any single Government agency. In Uganda, the National Information Security Advisory Group (NISAG), an inter-sectoral working group provides the platform for collaboration. Considering the changing threat environment, the update of the minimal cybersecurity baseline for NCII operators is inevitable. However, this should be done cognizant of the maturity level of the country to avoid the adoption of requirements that are too stringent and not implementable in Uganda’s current setting. The Ministry of ICT, responsible regulators, NISAG and owners of critical information infrastructures will assess the cybersecurity baseline and provide consistent updates to the baseline consistent with international standards and best practice. The baseline relies on the risk management approach and provides guidelines to NCII operators about the implementation of necessary security measures. It is required that every operator of critical services and infrastructure implements security measures. NCII operators prepare or update their contingency plans of critical ICT systems based on the national risk environment. Among others, the baseline will address incident response and vulnerability disclosure among other topics and the mandatory implementation of the cybersecurity baseline by NCII operators that needs to be regularly audited. The Government will continue working together with NCII operators to promote understanding of cybersecurity risks. The cooperation and exchange of information between government agencies and the private sector to identify cyber threats will ensure that the critical ICT systems are protected to a level that is commensurate with the risks faced to ensure the operation and recovery of critical services and infrastructures. The National Information Security Advisory Group - NISAG - provides cyber threat landscape assessment based on the National Information Risk Register. Furthermore, cyber incident reporting will be made mandatory for all government authorities and NCII operators. The overview of incidents serves as basis for comprehensive cyber threat landscape assessment. NCII operators will be bound to report cyber incidents to their sectoral regulators such is the current practice for communications sector under UCC. As referred in the previous chapter, NISAG’s risk register helps to align cyber risk management with the country’s national crisis/contingency management plan. It can also help harness the necessary capabilities/capacities, people, funding, and strategies to strengthen the overall cybersecurity posture of the Nation. Throughout the years, NISAG has been a platform for collaboration between NCII operators and the government sector. Through NISAG, they have shared the information on an ad hoc basis. NISAG shall develop its procedures, document the NCII assets in the country and will promote a fluent information flow with oversight supervision from the Ministry of ICT and NG. Recognizing the critical and highly interdependent role of NCII operators in managing cybersecurity risks and responding to incidents, the Government will provide the communication channels and cooperation mechanisms between public and private agencies. For every critical sector a National Regulatory Authority will be appointed, that serves as a sectoral national contact point. The role of the contact points is to take lead of NCII protection withing their sectors, to synthesize the information collected from NCII operators and contribute to the cyber threat landscape assessment on national level. ICT service providers and NCII operators shall pay attention to risks that are related to supply chain security. Threat intelligence and respective risk assessments shall be monitored during the IT development Established formats for private-public partnership are essential for boosting trust amongst and between the industry and the government. NCII Governance model defines clear responsibilities of every stakeholder. Minimum cybersecurity baselines for NCII operators will be established with appropriate legislative mechanisms. Guiding principles for NCIIs are the principles of personality and minimal adverse effects. Ensuring the security of a system is arranged by the service provider and in case of security incident, service provider will apply due care and measures to avoid the escalation and spread of the effect of the incident and will notify the supervisory authority. 24 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] stage and in the software and hardware tendering processes. Government through NITA-U will develop respective guidelines. This Strategy aims to create an effective governance and management framework. Establishing sustainable partnerships among the Government and NCII operators requires that all participating stakeholders define a clear understanding of the goals of the partnership and the mutual security benefits that stem from dedicated and meaningful collaboration. Areas of cooperation include establishing effective coordinating structures and information-sharing processes and protocols, building trust through joint events and exercises that enhance cross-sectoral response, exchanging best practices for improving security, as well as improving international coordination. 3.3.1 Action Areas GoU will work with key stakeholders - the NCII operators and the cybersecurity community - in five major areas. GoU will: a) Implement the strategic plan on the protection of National Critical Information Infrastructure. The strategic plan provides clear criteria on defining critical sectors and the roles and responsibilities of NCII operators, but also supervisory authorities to ensure the transparency and boosting trust amongst and between the government and private sector. b) Raise awareness of supply chain security risks GoU will increase the adoption of Security-by-Design practices and address cybersecurity issues upstream and along the supply chain. GoU will enhance the implementation of national cybersecurity standard for critical infrastructure, including requirements for software and hardware that can be used in vital services. The Government will start the preparations for developing accreditation standards for hardware, software and IT services deployed in NCII. c) Update of the minimal cybersecurity baseline for NCII operators Based on international standards and best practice, GoU will enhance the implementation of security measures of NCII operators based on the regular risk assessments. To achieve the goal, the Government will set legal requirements for minimum cybersecurity baseline of NCIIs. The standard includes the requirements for information sharing and incident reporting. d) Create effective governance and management structure for protection of NCII GoU will introduce legal provisions that give the relevant sector regulators the authority and resources to oversee compliance. This will assist in the efforts to implement the current strategy goals and achieve cross-sectoral agreements. 25 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] 3.4 Cyber Skilled Uganda End users are often the weakest link in the cybersecurity chain. This is true when the users lack the training to take informed security decisions while carrying out digital activities. As people begin to become more connected, they need support to develop cybersecurity capacity to better respond to threats. Securing the cyber domain through capacity building activities contributes to reducing issues such as cyber risks and digital divide. Promotion of the cybersecurity skills has been the main goals throughout the previous strategic interventions. However, a concerted effort by the Ugandan government to create online safety through skilled professionals and risk aware users demands an effort on continuous basis as the gap in the required skills set for cybersecurity still exists. 3.4.1 Engrain cybersecurity through all stages of education The review of the educational curricula is an ongoing task, and it shall meet current and future needs. To bridge the gap of institutional knowledge and shortage of skills Government of Uganda will promote and facilitate the development of cybersecurity educational programs. Inclusion of information security topics in the national ICT related curricula in all educational institutions across primary, secondary and tertiary levels is the goal. Curricula should be interdisciplinary and besides the technical knowledge also non-technical cybersecurity skills and topics, such as digital literacy, public policy and governance, economics, social sciences or international relations shall be covered. The focus of Uganda is also on creating a skilled professional workforce based on local content and provide the required human resource pool. Government will integrate cybersecurity courses in all computer science and IT programs in higher education, including teaching computer security and forensics as a subject or field of expertise. Dedicated cybersecurity degrees and apprenticeships will be created and additional resources for supporting the new degrees at the tertiary level will be applied. In addition, the curricula should foster awareness of and stimulate interest in cybersecurity career opportunities. To further the efforts in this space, the Government will consider various incentive schemes, such as scholarships and grants but also establishment of an accreditation mechanism for quality assurance of cybersecurity training programs in universities. Given the multi-disciplinary nature of cybersecurity capacity building, universities, colleges, and other educational institutions should be encouraged to work across departments and with other academic partners to develop or update their programs. To achieve the goal, the cooperation and collaboration between educational institutions will be enhanced and a framework for delivering cybersecurity knowledge throughout the education system, especially in primary and secondary schools will be generated. Cyber Skilled Uganda Engrain cybersecurity through all stages of education Improve expertise, skills and competencies Raising public cybersecurity awareness Enhance knowledge trough research and development 26 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] 3.4.2 Improve expertise, skills and competencies A qualified and highly skilled human resource base is pivotal to a successful information security strategy implementation. Expertise is required in areas like information security management, auditing and forensics. In order to diminish the lack of adequate human resource base both in Government authorities but also in private sector, Government will continuously coordinate cybersecurity programs and promote information security career development. Digital Uganda Vision aims to reach universal digital literacy and comprehensive utilization of e-services. Thus, the public sector needs to hire skilled officers able to guarantee the availability and safety of the e- services but also to develop relevant policies and implement them. Cybersecurity skills shall be integrated into core competencies in public sector institutions and advocating the creation of cybersecurity roles such as the Chief Information Security Officer in individual public sector institutions is inevitable when the role and impact of ICT systems grows. With the cost of cybercrime increasing every year across Uganda, the Government is committed to ensure that competent authorities better awareness of the threat of cybercrime and information security. Therefore, trainings within the Justice Law and Order Sector but also in Defence Sector, will continue. For supporting the cybersecurity competencies and share the information among public institutions, NITA- U as the core implementer of the Cybersecurity Strategy provides networking facilities to knowledgeable IT officers across Government MDAs, but also implements capacity building program for IT personnel of MDAs. As the experienced cybersecurity professionals are in high demand, certification schemas are crucial steppingstone for almost all careers. Government will coordinate cybersecurity programs and promote information security career development. In partnerships with academia Government will develop and implement curriculum but also specialized courses that address the required skills. Government will support and implement professional training courses and skills development schemes for professionals in other sectors as well. First, an assessment of capacity skills gap at across NCII operators will be carried out to determine the required resources. In order to promote the establishment of sectoral CSIRT teams, the need to recruit and train experts in the fields of incident management and forensics and cybercrime prevention is vital. 3.4.3 Raising public cybersecurity awareness Digital Uganda Vision promotes universal digital literacy and development, adoption and utilization of e- services. All those using the Internet and related technologies, need to understand the role they play in safeguarding sensitive or personal data. The rise of the Internet demands a responsible cybersecurity culture, safe Internet habits and practices to protect personal information online and safely use e-services. Government will continue to carry out the awareness programs to cover various target groups. The aim is to promote trust in e-government and e-commerce services. GoU will broaden the reach of program across age groups and include both individuals and businesses and create initiatives to inform the public continuously of the current and emerging cybercrime trends, defenses and cyber threats. Annual events like Cybersecurity Week to promote information security will be organized in addition to continuous awareness raising campaigns to improve cybersecurity awareness and literacy of the public focusing on disseminating information about cybersecurity risks and threats. The Government also introduces and designs cybersecurity awareness and school-based competitions. Government of Uganda through NITA-U, together with cross sectoral partners will continue to enhance the cybersecurity awareness portal (besafeoline website) acting as a reference point for cybersecurity awareness-raising materials and initiatives. 27 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] 3.4.4 Enhance knowledge through research and development The aspect of R&D within the Ugandan context ensures the availability of local innovations and solutions that fit the current challenges. Building capacity in this area makes us active participants to global cybersecurity solutions. There are good examples of cooperation and initiatives in the R&D area. Government of Uganda has designed the National ICT Initiatives Support Program (NIISP) to facilitate the creation of an ICT Innovation ecosystem and marketplace for Ugandan innovative digital products like software applications and innovations industry. Government will continuously support Research and Development programs in universities in Uganda in the area of cybersecurity. GoU will promote the development and commercialization of intellectual properties, technologies and innovations through focused research and development. GoU will support incubators and startups with a commercial approach that involve public and private actors, and ensure elements of competition and merit in the selection process. Government support is vital also for enterprises that are undertaking Research and Development in cybersecurity. Therefore, Uganda will deepen partnerships for the development of interfaces to research and innovation and interaction between universities and the local economy, so that skills are linked to market needs. Our goal is to provide an ecosystem comprising from highly skilled professionals, companies with deep cybersecurity capabilities and strong translational research and development. The ecosystem will ensure a sustainable source of expertise and solutions to support our plans for a resilient national infrastructure and a safer cyberspace. Government will establish incentives to develop partnerships for the development of interfaces to research and innovation and interaction between universities and the local economy, so that skills are linked to market needs. 3.4.5 Action Areas To promote cybersecurity skills and awareness in Uganda, GoU will: a) Engrain cybersecurity through all stages of education GoU will incorporate cybersecurity as a core learning area at the earliest levels of our education system as well as a specialized area at university and tertiary levels for professionals. b) Improve expertise, skills and competencies GoU will continuously coordinate cybersecurity programs and promote information security career development by developing specialized courses and curricula, supporting certification schemas, providing networking facilities and support trainings focused on NCII operators, military and law enforcement training programs. c) Raising public cybersecurity awareness GoU will develop comprehensive program to increase populations awareness. The program will be integrated with the digital (IT) awareness campaigns, in cooperation with telecoms, payment service providers etc. d) Enhance knowledge trough research and development Government will continuously support Research and Development programs in universities and promote the development and commercialization of intellectual properties, technologies and innovations through focused research and development. Uganda will promote the research to support the use of safest solutions. 28 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] 3.5 Active and reliable partner of international community Uganda is partnering various regional and global cooperation initiatives focused on an enhancing cybersecurity and fighting on cross-border cybercrime. However, Uganda has yet to sign and ratify both the African Union Convention on Cybersecurity and Personal Data Protection (the “Malabo Convention”) and the Convention on Cybercrime of the Council of Europe (Budapest Convention) [10]. The Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs (MoJCA) is part the inter-agency team which is gathered to accede to the Budapest Convention. Within the planning accession, MoJCA will provide the 24/7 single point of contact for international cooperation against organized and transnational cyber crimes. Still, in the light of rolling technological innovation to foster the development of the digital economy, against the background of the convergence of information and media services, networks and devices, Uganda acknowledges, that cybersecurity remains essential domain to balance the developments with the need to combat cyber threats on both national and regional level, but also on global arena. Considering increasing evolving threats to cybersecurity, which may constitute serious threats to national, regional, continental and international peace and security, GoU recognizes that international partnerships play essential role in strengthening collective cybersecurity capacities. International partnerships generate opportunities for information sharing and operational collaboration while representing our national interests. Therefore, Uganda remains dedicated on pursuing its active participation in both regional and international forums contributing to strengthening collective cybersecurity efforts and to address combating cybercrime and cyber threats on national, regional and global level. Hence, the Strategy aspires to guide global and regional engagements of Uganda across cyber affairs to maintain peace and security. Uganda will invest on coordinating and on establishing the national cooperation forums and formats to develop constructive and favorable international collaboration avenues of mutual interest. Active and reliable partner of International community Increasing bi- and multilateral dialogues on regional level Building capacity and confidence through international cooperation Promoting calls for action for Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace Uganda on the International arena Uganda cooperates with following international organizations and forums:  International Telecommunications Union (ITU)  Commonwealth Telecommunications Organization  African Telecommunications Union  Commonwealth Cybercrime Initiative (CCI)  East Africa Communications Organization  Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) Uganda has signed Memorandum of Understanding on fighting cybercrime with Kenya, Rwanda and South Sudan under the Northern Corridor Infrastructure Program. 29 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] 3.5.1 Enhance Regional Perspective The African Union (AU) Peace and Security Council has stressed the need for Member States to undertake regular cybersecurity risk assessments. Therefore, Uganda is dedicated to further cooperation avenues with the AU Commission, as well as with the AU Member States, to further enhance the both national and regional cybersecurity capacities, in order to more effectively address cybersecurity challenges and combat cyber-crimes including the abuse and misuse of the internet. The Peace and Security Council is a key pillar of the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA) and is a standing decision-making organ of the AU for the prevention, management and resolution of conflict. Developing ways for close collaboration among AU Member States and stakeholders, Uganda is dedicated to contribute to the discussions of the African Union Cybersecurity Expert Group (AUCSEG). Further, Uganda follows the AU Mechanism for Police Cooperation (AFRIPOL) and the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) for its continued technical support to the efforts being deployed by the AU Member States towards preventing and mitigating the risks posed by cybercrimes. Further, Uganda is proud to host Eastern Africa's Regional Intelligence Unit, that was established following a resolution of the 5th meeting of Peace and Security Council of the African Union held on 2nd of September in Nairobi. Uganda is committed to accelerate its efforts to develop cooperation mechanisms and initiatives with regional partners. 3.5.2 Actively take International Avenues International collaboration is key in ensuring the presence of sufficient capacity and mechanisms to handle cyber threats from a foreign adversary as well as provide assistance to international allies. Within the planning accession, MoJCA will provide the 24/7 single point of contact for international cooperation against organized and transnational cybercrimes. Participating in International Cybersecurity Diplomatic Negotiations The United Nations has put efforts to maintain a meaningful conversation on International Cybersecurity Diplomatic Negotiations for the last 15 years, mainly through the establishment of the Group of Government Experts (GGE), to discuss international cyber policies. Uganda will follow a Global Approach set up the ongoing United Nations Open-ended Working Group. In addition to technical skills, states recognized during OEWG’s discussions that there is a pressing need for building expertise across a range of diplomatic, policy, legislative and regulatory areas. Uganda is engaged to contribute to the discussions on the responsible state behaviour in cyberspace, led by the UN Further, Uganda welcomes joining the Paris Call that invites all cyberspace actors to work together and encourage States to cooperate with private sector partners, the world of research and civil society. The supporters of the Paris Call commit to working together to adopt responsible behaviour and implement within cyberspace the fundamental principles which apply in the physical world. Inspired by the Commonwealth Cyber Declaration Uganda is striving to establishing and developing the foundations for an effective cybersecurity response and capacity building across diplomatic, policy, legislative, regulatory and technical areas to support both national and international peace and stability. Uganda is committed to take actions to ensure designing a cyberspace that supports economic and social development and rights online. 30 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] 3.5.3 Building capacity and confidence through collaboration International collaboration is key in ensuring the presence of sufficient capacity and mechanisms to handle cyber threats from a foreign adversary as well as provide assistance to international allies when required. The effort to improve national cybersecurity will be assisted by participating in regional or international The effort to improve national cybersecurity will be assisted by participating in regional or international forums that can provide education and training. Uganda welcomes and pursues participation in available programs and activities of multilateral organizations that seek to improve and enhance global cybersecurity. Uganda recognizes the continuing need to foster international collaboration and efforts to address cybersecurity issues, including information sharing and assistance. Since mutual legal assistance regime is part of the Malabo Convention, Uganda recognizes the importance to finalise the accession process to develop exchange information mechanisms on cyber threats. Further, Uganda is dedicated to ensuring its active participation in international CERT and cybersecurity communities and initiatives, to improve and maintain connectivity and cooperation with international partners. Further, Uganda intends take full advantage of the various capacity building initiatives of the Global Forum on Cybersecurity Experts (GFCE). 3.5.4 Action Areas As an active and reliable partner of international community, GoU will: a) Increase both bi- and multilateral dialogues. The dialogues with the African Union states and the African Union to support cross-border law enforcement and other mechanisms that serve to achieving better common understanding of the cyber landscape b) Building capacity and confidence through international collaboration International collaboration aims to strengthen cyber-capacity and expertise in Uganda for government, businesses as well as for community. c) Promoting calls for action for Responsible State Behaviour in Cyberspace The initiatives contribute reducing risks to international peace and security and to the prevention of conflict. GoU will promote the participation of Uganda’s representatives in various international collaboration formats aiming for the responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. Government representatives will keep themselves in the loop on the international discussions, including the implementation of cyber norms and the application of international law in cyberspace as well as advancing cyber confidence and capacity building. 31 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] 3.6 Provide enabling governance framework 3.6.1 Cybersecurity Governance and Coordination Intragovernmental commitment, coordination and cooperation represent core functions of governmental institutions, needed to ensure that the governance mechanisms (i.e. rules) and resources yield the desired outcomes of the Cybersecurity Strategy. The Strategy will be implemented by following the whole of government approach which considers the government as one entity. The model foresees the active collaboration across Government, with industry and other stakeholders in the implementation of the Strategy. Effective communication and coordination ensure that all ministries and government agencies are aware of each other’s respective authorities, missions, and tasks. The cybersecurity competent authority ensures that institutions and stakeholders work in a complementary manner. The implementation of the Strategy calls for formalizing national cybersecurity governance structure under multi-stakeholder model. The governance model is based on the principle of shared responsibility. The multitude of stakeholders consists of law- and policymakers, economic players, educational institutions, technical and business communities, law enforcement, academia, diplomatic, military organizations and others. The Cybersecurity Governance Framework is based on the current practice and considers earlier strategic choices. It needs to be stressed that the engagement of the stakeholders across government is both a pre- requisite and an essential support for a successful implementation of the Cybersecurity Strategy. Collaboration presents a key to ensure that promises expressed and agreed in the Strategy are measurable and will be delivered in the future. Provide enabling framework and modernize legal environment Customised Governance structure Modernizing legal framework for NCII Revising Digital Identity and e-signature legislation Fostering information sharing Strengthening protection of National Critical Information Infrastructure Government coordination is the prerequisite of the effective implementation of the vision. 32 (43) [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation] 3.6.2 Roles of Authorities The following institutions are important in creating a favorable institutional framework that will guarantee the coordination and implementation of the strategy.

Today, ICT is one of the leading drivers for social-economic growth globally.      The Aspiration of the Government of Uganda is to support Uganda’s economic competitiveness growth  enabled by ICT. Embedded within, is to achieve a state of harmonized and interoperable digital   infrastructure for Government of Uganda as our strategic goal through building the appropriate secure ICT  Infrastructure, creating an enabling environment as well as developing and promoting use of e-Government   for efficient service delivery. Over the years, the private sector has made similar investments towards   incorporation of ICT within their various business models.     Pillar three of the Digital Uganda Vision (2020) addresses ‘Cyber Security and Data Privacy’. This pillar  provides assurance that digital services are safe, secure, protected, and trusted and when in use. This pillar   further seeks to ensure that the country builds capacity for cybersecurity management.      In line with this, the information and processes held on this digital infrastructure is critical to the well-  functioning of the country. The more we increase our adoption and investment in ICT, the more we increase  our risk exposure. This therefore necessitates we adopt cyber security as a culture in our usage of ICT   based on the principles of confidentiality, integrity and availability.     Currently, the threat towards digital infrastructure and applications is not only eminent but more   sophisticated, persistent and disastrous. With this in mind, countries are increasing improving their cyber  security focus to protect their digital infrastructure as well as defend against cyber-attacks. At the national   level, Government of Uganda has led several cyber security initiatives aimed towards improving Uganda’s  information security maturity level.       In light of the above, the complex and interconnected nature of the cyber space is such that ensuring  holistic cyber security becomes a shared responsibility between the Government, Private Sector and other   stakeholders. Part of our country’s national critical information infrastructure is run by the private sector. A  resilient National approach towards Cyber Security requires the involvement of all key stakeholders (both   state and non-state actors), whether at national and international level based on collaboration, which is   the intent of this strategy.  The development of this strategy has been a collaborative initiative within the  public and private ICT sub sector stakeholders.     The National Cyber Security Strategy sets the direction for improvement of our National Cyber Security   capabilities to achieve the highest cyber security maturity level. As we implement this strategy, we will be  promoting trust amongst our citizens in the usage of ICT enabled services, defending our digital   infrastructure against threats as well as contributing to international cyber security. The Strategy further   demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that our adoption of ICT supports the country’s improved  competitiveness.              ______________________________________   Hon. Dr. Chris Baryomunsi  Minister for ICT & National Guidance                  6 (43)  [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation]      EXECUTIVE SUMMARY    Over the years, the Government of Uganda has placed the requisite enabling environment to facilitate the   growth of the information and communication technologies (ICT) sector. Uganda has invested in a national  fibre-optic backbone to promote social and economic development by availing cost effective, reliable and   high-speed connectivity to the businesses and citizens. In the last ten years, Uganda's ICT sector has grown  at an exponential rate, owing largely to a favorable policy and legal climate that has resulted in increased   investment, expansion of ICT infrastructure, innovation, and expansion of ICT products and services. The  potential for the total transformation of the economy and the attendant social impact is best demonstrated   by the pervasive expansion and use of mobile money services in Uganda. Mobile money transactions   facilitated via telecommunication company platforms more than [1] doubled in value to US $26 billion in  2020, from $9 billion in 2015 [2]. The recent Uganda National Development Plan for 2020/21 – 2024/25,   that stipulates the Country’s medium term strategic direction, development priorities and implementation  strategies in line with the Uganda Vision 2040, sets the digital transformation, ie the usage of ICT services   for social and economic development as one of the 18 core programs of the strategy.       At the same time, peace, security and defence are prerequisites for a sustainable socio-economic   transformation, democracy and national unity. The growth in the ICT infrastructure, Internet usage and  online access have opened new opportunities for the country, however, with the increase in use of e-  services, the need for cybersecurity protection is key in order to avoid cyber fraud and maintain trust in   the use of these services. Information security also serves broader national security goals by protecting  critical national sectors and information infrastructure.      Security in cyberspace is especially important to realize the strategic visions of Uganda. This Cybersecurity   Strategy 2021 provides development paths, policy and technical recommendations to achieve Uganda’s  Vision 2040 aiming to transform Uganda to a competitive upper middle income country. Uganda has taken   important steps to put in place and implement in practice the necessary policy, legal and regulatory   frameworks in order to take advantage of the growing digital economy, but also to protect its critical  national infrastructure and citizens, by ensuring a safe and secure space that will help the society to have   trust and confidence in the digital economy.     The Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 is a strategic planning tool that reflects Uganda’s plans to achieve the   objectives of modern economies. The strategy contributes to existing policies that seek to implement  Uganda’s socio-economic development from cybersecurity perspective and aspires to support building a   digital environment that citizens and businesses can trust.     The Strategy document is structured into four main chapters. First, after introduction the vision, mission  and goals for Uganda are set for the next years in the cybersecurity domain. Next, the Strategy describes   the context of today’s trends in digital development and Uganda’s strategic advances, but also cyber threats   and trends in cybercrime, and the national capacity to address these. The essence of the Cybersecurity  Strategy 2021 is in Chapter 5 that describes the main principles, strategic direction, pillars and targets in 6   areas. The last Chapter covers implementation mechanism as well as monitoring and evaluation of the  strategy.      The Strategy was developed through a consultative process led by the Ministry of ICT and National  Guidance.                      7 (43)  [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation]      1   VISION AND GOALS     1.2 Vision and mission     Vision: Uganda is a Digitally Empowered Society and Knowledge Economy.       Mission: To create a  ensuring a secure and resilient cyberspace that   supports the adoption and innovation of ICT in all sectors for the socio-economic stability and development  of Uganda.       1.3 Goals     Digitalization is an important process that supports Uganda’s economic development, national welfare, and   prosperity. Our goal is to have ICTs incorporated into every aspect of the everyday lives of people,  organisations, business and government. The national cybersecurity system established by this Strategy   aims to support fostering safe and trusted digital economy of Uganda to ensure safety of e-services and  reduce cybercrime. The strategy set strategic goals in 6 areas.            Following the whole-of-nation principle   The protection of Uganda and its citizens in cyberspace is a shared responsibility – everyone has a role to   play. The COVID crisis has shown the importance of secure online connectivity as it is forcing anything  which can be digitized, to digitize and many organisations have had to embrace remote working. The   whole-of-nation principle calls for citizens, private sector companies, and government agencies to work  hand-in-hand to seize the various possibilities of digital technology while managing cyber risks.       The Government of Uganda is putting in place the necessary infrastructure and policies to build capabilities,  and to create a conducive ecosystem for the Digitally Empowered Society and Knowledge Economy of   Uganda as set in the Digital Uganda Vision. In addition, the Government is conducive ecosystem to foster  Uganda’s cybersecurity by developing and enforcing policies and guidelines. However, both companies and   community as important stakeholders shall do their part and follow national cybersecurity guidelines and  policies set by the Government.               8 (43)  [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation]                        9 (43)  [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation]      2. CURRENT SITUATION,  NATIONAL CAPACITY  ASSESSMENT AND TRENDS  E-Services and the widening use of ICT are the lifeblood of the digital economy globally. Over the last two  decades, the number of e-Services globally has accelerated exponentially, helping to connect industry,   facilitate trade, and drive international investment. E-Services have also impacted environmental and social  practices and transformed the delivery of government services.       Uganda Vision 2040 aims at “a transformed Ugandan society from a peasant to a modern and prosperous  country within 30 years”. As a developing country, Uganda has a unique opportunity to boost economy,   public administration, education, and healthcare with digitalisation. Without outdated legacy systems it is  possible to focus on new opportunities in technology and e-services. Digital transformation also positions   Uganda among regional and global leaders in the field of digital agile governance by focusing on effective   service delivery, citizen engagement and the digital economy. This will reduce the cost of governance and  reduce corruption while increasing national productivity.     The potential for the total transformation of the economy and the attendant social impact is best   demonstrated by the pervasive expansion and use of mobile money services in Uganda. Mobile money  transactions facilitated via telecommunication company platforms more than doubled in value to US$ 20   billion in 2019, from $9 billion in 2015, according to the Bank of Uganda. Further design and implementation   of specific sector-wide digitalization projects can assist faster and more profound digital transformation.      Transformation of Uganda to modern society will rely on a modern education system but also on high  awareness and safe behavior while using ICTs. Uganda focuses on building a digitally enabled society that   is agile and able to adapt to emerging technologies and trends. It also looks at promotion of digital literacy   and ICT professional development for the current and future industry needs.      Cybersecurity is the a cross-cutting theme to support the digital economy and transformation. Therefore,  it is important to develop also a robust and solid Cybersecurity Strategy that establishes measures to ensure   security of digitalisation process and help to protect Uganda and its citizens in cyberspace. The strategic  tasks described in the Cybersecurity Strategy will give assurance that digital services are and will remain   safe, secure, protected, and trusted.       2.1 Alignment with Other Strategies  Uganda has established quite a solid set of strategic perspectives, with the wider aspiration to support   Uganda’s economic competitiveness and growth enabled by ICT. Series of policies, strategies, and  legislation provide the road map guiding country to becoming an information society and digital economy   and set the guiding principles and direction for the Cybersecurity Strategy 2021.    Uganda Vision 2040 emphasizes the importance of digital transformation in Ugandan society and   underscores the need for Uganda to re-orient itself to make ICT as the main driver of economic growth.  Digital Uganda Vision of the Ministry of ICT and National Guidance provides an overarching framework   that responds to the national Vision 2040 by providing a unified ICT policy direction and strategic framework   to show how ICT can empower Ugandan citizens and achieve the goals of universal inclusion, sustainable  development, economic progress and poverty eradication through digital innovation. Digital Uganda Vision   acknowledges that the ICT potential by different stakeholders is very much premised on the ability to  ensure security of information, privacy and protection of personal data. Therefore, the Vision provides   strategic inventions to build a trusted digital ecosystem in Uganda. The 4th Industrial Revolutions            10 (43)  [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation]      Strategy’s (4IR) vision is to transform Uganda to a continental 4IR hub by 2040 and accelerate Uganda’s  development into an innovative, productive and competitive society using 4IR technologies. One of the   strategic objectives is to support national security in the digital world.      Given the immense advantages of connecting the population to the internet and to mobile networks,    both universal broadband access and complete mobile coverage nationally are national priority in terms of  infrastructure. Uganda Broadband Policy 2020 recognizes the broadband infrastructure as a public   utility (like water, transport and energy) and sets the target to provide connectivity for all, improve its  affordability and licensing conditions.       At the same time, peace, security and defence are prerequisites for a sustainable socio-economic  transformation, democracy and national unity as stated in the Uganda Vision 2040. Security in cyberspace   is especially important to realize the goals set in the Digital Uganda Vision. Protection of the country’s  sovereignty is now the next frontier and Uganda needs the enhanced the capabilities and resources, both   human and technological, to build adequate and credible defence capacity to address external threats and   maintain internal security. Third National Development Plan 2020/21 – 2024/25 acknowledges that  cyberspace is now a medium for disinformation among competing commercial interests, ideological   adversaries, governments, and extremists, and it is a battleground between cybercriminals and law  enforcement. The Plan emphasizes Uganda’s need to significantly invest in building the competencies of   communication structures to be able to anticipate, avert and stop disrupting attempts of government or  commercial operations and minimize the spread of misinformation. Government is willing to react and enact   regulation of cyberspace, increase resources for cyber-defence and protect the critical infrastructure (e.g.   power grids) from cyber threats.      Uganda’s preparation of its second National Development Plan coincided with the endorsement of the UN  2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015. Consequently, Uganda was among the world’s   first to begin alignment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with its national planning   frameworks. The aspiration of the Agenda is to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and  sustainable industrialization and foster innovation by 2030. Similarly, the aspiration of Agenda 2063 of   African Union aspiration is to put in place the necessary infrastructure to support Africa’s accelerated  integration and growth, technological transformation, trade and development. All these goals can be linked   to the main strategic documents of Uganda.       2.2 Digital Transformation of Economy   At the end 2020, 30.8 million devices were connected to the network in Uganda. These include mobile   handsets, laptops, tablets and other IOT terminals. The growth is significant – during the last 12 months  3.7 million new devices were connected to the network. In December 2020, the number of active internet   subscriptions had grown to 21.4 million which means more than 1 active connection for every 2 Ugandans  [3]. According to the ITU Digital Development Dashboard 2020 24% of Uganda’s population is using the   Internet (data from 2017) thus positioning as average in the African region, with significant potential for   growth.               11 (43)  [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation]        Figure 1. Mobile and fixed Internet subscriptions in 2020 [2].   However, broadband access in Uganda is largely mobile and rate of fixed broadband penetration is still   very low (0.1% of all Internet subscriptions in the 4th quarter of 2020 are fixed). The low fixed broadband  access implies that there is little progress in promoting broadband access to anchor institutions like schools,   libraries, health centers, and Local Government offices and that a critical mass of institutions and businesses  are not using broadband services to be competitive.         Figure 2. How the Internet is used? Monthly user traffic profile in 4th quarter of 2020 [2].   In recent years, and in particular during the global pandemic crisis, Uganda has witnessed an increase in   malware distribution, business email compromises, the spread of fake news and mobile money network   fraud. In early October 2020, Uganda’s telecoms and banking sectors were plunged into crisis due to a  major hack that compromised the country’s mobile money network. At least $3.2 million is estimated to   have been stolen in that incident, in which hackers used around 2,000 mobile SIM cards to gain access to  the mobile money payment system.      By the end of 2020, total active mobile money accounts stood at 22.5 million of the 28 million registered  accounts. The trend in the mobile money industry and the growth in number of mobile money accepting   businesses has been upward for the year 2020. The number of active mobile agents has grown to 235,790            12 (43)  [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation]      and the number of mobile money transactions during the last quarter of 2020 for the first time ever crossed  the 1 billion transactions mark.      In many African countries however, Uganda included, mobile-data baskets are still out of reach for a large  part of the population, costing more than 10 per cent of Gross National Income per capita, in situations   where incomes are already limited. In terms of affordability of fixed services, Africa is the region with the  highest fixed-broadband basket prices and Uganda is no exception [4].         Figure 3. The use of mobile money (* up to September 2020) [1].   The private sector in Uganda is dominated by about 1.1 million micro, small and medium enterprises   (MSMEs) all together employing approximately 2.5 million people. The Uganda Vision 2040 aspires directly   investing in strategic areas to stimulate the economy and facilitate private sector growth and targets  increasing the growth of MSMEs to drive industrialization. National Development Plan recognizes the need   to support the private sector, particularly local MSMEs, to develop capacity to drive the industrialization  effort, increase exports, create jobs and increase local content. In the strategic ICT sector, SMEs can be   supported through the system of incubation centres to develop their digital and financial literacy, and  through supportive research and innovation facilities established and accessible to MSMEs.      The 2018 After Access Survey shows that Internet use, mobile phone penetration, and the Internet use  divisions between genders as well as urban and rural dwellers are correlated with Gross National Income   (GNI) per capita. Uganda is classified as one of the least developed countries – a list of developing countries  that, according to the UN, possess the lowest indicators of socioeconomic development and the lowest   Human Development Index ratings among all countries in the world. The lack of electricity and   underdeveloped ICT infrastructure are the primary causes of discrepancies in urban–rural Internet use and  mobile phone penetration rates in Uganda. Uganda has a considerable urban–rural gap in Internet use of   70 percent, where only nine percent of Ugandans living in rural areas have access to the Internet and  about a third (30%) of urban area dwellers using it [5].     Several studies demonstrate that broadband penetration and broadband quality are important factors for   economic growth. According to a World Bank study, it is estimated that for every 10% increase in   broadband penetration in low and middle income countries result in a commensurate increase of 1.38% of  the GDP [6]. Studies also reveal the economic impact of broadband deployment directly through jobs   created by deploying broadband infrastructure, and indirectly as a result of ‘spill- over’ externalities, such  as increased productivity and new products and services i.e. through accelerated innovation.       2.3 Cyber Crime  Cybersecurity continues to be a challenge in Uganda and the share of cyber (computer) crimes in total  economic crimes is on the rise. In 2020 the cybercrime report of the Uganda Police acknowledges the   relative increase in cases of cybercrimes related cases and they led to a loss of UGX 15,949,236,000 in  2020. The major categories of cybercrimes were electronic fraud and obtaining money by false pretense.   [7]               13 (43)  [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation]        Figure 4. Major categories of cybercrimes [8].   In addition to economic crimes, cybersecurity threats pose a serious risk to the integrity of the e-  government system and internet in Uganda generally. [7]     The Uganda Police Force has digital forensics capacity and a cyber-crime unit. The cybercrime unit helps   the Police to participate and get knowledge on current trends on cybersecurity. Police in collaboration with  National Information Technology Authority – Uganda and Uganda Communications Commission have   published several cybercrime awareness materials and initiated thematic campaigns. Cybercrime is reported  to have had a 300% fold growth in the year 2020 [8], thus the need for capacity building and increase in   cybersecurity awareness is urgent to cope with the increasing number of cybercrimes.       2.4 Protection of Critical Infrastructure   In 2011, the Government of Uganda developed the National Information Security Strategy (NISS)   supporting sub-sector policies and frameworks within the ICT sector to secure critical national infrastructure  and information resources. NISS recognizes the importance of the identification of critical infrastructure   that are critical for the functioning of the society as a whole. In 2016 the protection of Uganda’s Critical   Information Infrastructure and cyberspace was identified as one of 5 strategic goals of the draft  cybersecurity strategy.      The Computer Misuse Act 2011 provides guidance on sectors that are currently recognized as Critical   National Infrastructure sectors in Uganda. According to the Act, a “protected computer” is a computer,   program or data used directly in connection with or necessary for the security, defence or international  relations of Uganda; law enforcement; the provision of services directly related to communications   infrastructure, banking and financial services, public utilities; public key infrastructure and public safety.  The 2014 National Information Security Policy and Framework (NISF) with its compulsory security measures   applies to all organisations that operate protected computers. Policy is established by NITA-U.              14 (43)  [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation]        Figure 5. Areas of protected computers according to the Computer Misuse Act 2011.   The establishment of security baseline for protected computers, programs or data in sectors specified in  NISF and Computer Misuse Act (2011) has been the tool to address the national critical information   infrastructure (NCII) protection in Uganda. However, Legislation and regulation do not provide for  obligations for cyber-incident reporting, which remains ad-hoc activity and thereby exacerbates the   potential impact of incidents.      Latest development in the area is the Strategic Plan on the protection of National Critical Information   Infrastructure approved by NITA-U in 2021. The document describes critical infrastructure sectors, the CNII  operators as well as their role.      2.5 Digital Awareness  With the rapid growth of internet connectivity on the African continent, many Ugandans are getting access  and connecting to the internet for the first time, while often lacking knowledge on how to protect   themselves online. [10] Low levels of ICT literacy would make it difficult to launch awareness campaigns,  which the Global Cybersecurity Capacity Centre found to be almost non-existent in the African countries it   surveyed. In 2017, 90% of African businesses were operating below the cybersecurity ‘poverty line’ –   unprepared for cyber threats and an easy preys to cybercriminals. [11]     The Government of Uganda has realized that cybersecurity awareness is crucial and considerable awareness  raising efforts, coupled with increasing availability, access and affordability have been undertaken. These   efforts include concerted ICT security awareness campaigns led by the MoICT & NG, NITA-U and UCC. For  example, a review of NITA statistics report 2019 indicates Sensitization activities to enhance cyber legal   awareness have been conducted over the years. In financial year 2018/19, there was an increment of 20   percent in the number of awareness sessions conducted across the Ministries, Departments and Agencies  (MDAs) and Local Governments. In July 2021, NITA-U embarked on a digital driven awareness campaign   on cybersecurity with funding from the Regional Communications Infrastructure Program. The development  and continuous implementation of cybersecurity awareness initiatives focusing on disseminating            15 (43)  [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation]      information about cybersecurity risks and threats, as well as about best practices for countering them,  should be continued and enhanced.       In addition, there is a need for a structured training and certification program/framework for cybersecurity  related careers in Uganda. Education on cybersecurity issues is not offered as part of the curriculum in all   levels of education, and there is limited budgetary allocation for research and development in this field.  Gaps in information security in the country can be close best by integrating security into the education   systems and making skill building easier and attainable.     2.6 Uganda’s Performance on Global Indices  Uganda has set the goal to improve rankings in the various global competitiveness indices. According to   World Bank annual ratings Uganda is ranked 127 among 190 economies in the ease of doing business  in 2018, a position it maintained in the following year (2019).      Uganda ranked 152 out of 176 countries in the International Telecommunications Union’s IDI   (2017); 121 out of 139 countries in the Network Readiness Index; and 64 out of 75 countries in the   latest Economist Intelligence Unit Inclusive Internet Index (3i). Behind these rankings is the poor  information infrastructure and low levels of Internet penetration in the country compared to others.     In terms of Internet freedom, Uganda is considered as partly free and Internet penetration rates continue   to improve despite a daily tax on social media use that limits access to communication platforms. In the E-  Government Development Index (EGDI), which presents the state of E-Government Development of  the United Nations Member States, Uganda ranked 137 out of 193 countries in 2020.     In the ITU Global Cybersecurity Index; in the African region Uganda ranks as 9th in 2020 (2018 7th),   globally 70th (2018 65th). According to the index, the Uganda’s relative strength is in the implementation  of legal measures but there is room for potential growth in the Cooperative Measures category (national,   regional, and international cooperation), implementation of the Data Protection and Privacy Act and also in   capacity building. In the National Cybersecurity Index of the e-Governance Academy, Uganda holds  56th position globally and 3rd in African region.               16 (43)  [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation]      Cybersecurity foundation in Uganda to date       Current Cybersecurity Strategy 2021 builds on the following milestones:    2009 – Establishment of NITA-U to implement the provisions of the NITA-U Act.    2011 - Several laws were promulgated to guarantee a safe online environment for users and   citizens, with a number of texts developed namely the Computer Misuse Act (2011), the Electronic   Signatures Act (2011) and the Electronic Transactions Act (2011).     2011 - Adoption of the National Information Security Strategy (NISS)     2013 - Uganda Communications Commission revised mandate to implement the provisions of the   UCC Act 2013    2013-2014 – Establishment of Computer Emergency Response Teams: National CERT.UG/CC and   Communications Sector CERT    2014 – Publishment of the draft of the National Information Security Policy and Framework (NISF)    2014 – Establishment of the National Information Security Advisory Group (NISAG) as forum for   coordinating implementation of cybersecurity best practices in CII operators    2019 - Enactment of the Data Protection and Privacy Act (2019)    2020 - Publishment of the draft of the Digital Uganda Vision             17 (43)  [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation]      3. STRATEGIC TASKS   3.1 Safe and trusted digital economy        The real potential for economic growth and large-scale job creation lies in spreading digital innovations  from lead firms to the rest of the economy. The role of governments is to create an environment that   enables the many private sector actors to benefit from digitalization. Studies demonstrate that broadband  penetration and broadband quality are important factors for economic growth. They also reveal the   economic impact of broadband deployment directly through jobs created by deploying broadband  infrastructure, and indirectly by increased productivity and the creation of new products and services.   According to a World Bank study, it is estimated that for every 10% increase in broadband penetration in   low- and middle-income countries, there is a commensurate increase of 1.38% of the GDP [6].       3.1.1 Implement PKI and e-Signature   Government will make effort to create an online environment that is safe and trusted by society and  businesses. The vision is a user-friendly digital ecosystem where the security of personal and sensitive data   and information is assured, and users’ rights are protected.      To improve the trust and confidence towards digital transactions and e-services, the Government will   enforce the adoption and implementation of digital standards, laws and regulations that  ensure security of online transactions Uganda has taken steps towards a safer service environment.   The Electronic Signature Act 2011 together with relevant regulations provide a framework for the provisions  and use of electronic signatures. The Act regulates the use of advanced electronic signatures, digital   signatures and the use of third-party certification systems, such as a public key infrastructure (PKI), for the   purposes of securing information conveyed over the internet and authenticating or certifying electronic  signatures. Government of Uganda through NITA-U is implementing the UgPass pilot project, a new digital   authentication and electronic signatures´solution for Uganda which will activate use of PKI services.      Uganda will take advantage of rapid advances in digital technology to establish national digital ID platforms  or systems that serve the whole nation, including enterprises. Digital ID and signature are vital components   of the modern economy, without which digital transformation will be impossible.    Safe and  trusted  digital  economy   Develop and implement digital identity to facilitate utilization of  e-services  Prioritize support for MSMEs  A public key infrastructure (PKI) is a set of roles, policies, and procedures   needed to create, manage, distribute, use, store, and revoke digital certificates  and manage public-key encryption. The purpose of a PKI is to facilitate the   secure electronic transfer of information for a range of network activities   such as e-commerce, internet banking and confidential email.              18 (43)  [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation]      3.1.2 Increased focus on enterprises   African economic growth has been steady for 25 years, but the continent has not fully enjoyed the benefits  of digitalisation for economic and social progress. Also, policymakers are becoming more aware of the need   to secure the digital future, as cybersecurity became part of the African Union Agenda 2063. Business  operations have shifted further online during the COVID-19 pandemic, placing increased demands on   private sector cybersecurity practices. MSMEs are often the most common size of business within a country   and make up a significant part of national economy as 90% of businesses are MSMEs, 50% of employment  stems from MSMEs, and formal MSMEs contribute up to 40% of Gross Domestic Product in emerging   economies. Thus, Uganda has to nurture entrepreneurship and innovation.     MSMEs are also often least able to tackle cybersecurity. This puts SMEs in need of cybersecurity awareness  activities, accessible cybersecurity guidelines and tools. The Government will provide its support and   dedicated programs for MSMEs to enhance the awareness how to safely conduct business in today’s   networked environment. Uganda will develop a scheme that will help small and medium size enterprises to  protect their organizations, against the most common cyberattacks. Governmental cybersecurity web   portal will provide guidelines and awareness-raising materials and initiatives focused on MSMEs.      The compromise of personal data can damage the legitimate rights and interests of cause adverse  disruptions to the affected individuals and businesses. With increasing amounts of data migrating to   computer systems and electronic devices, there is a need to secure these systems and safeguard   individuals’ data against theft and misuse. At the same time, organisations can leverage good personal  data management to gain a better understanding of their customers, increase business efficiency and   effectiveness, and boost customer confidence.      Uganda through the Personal Data Protection Office will intensify the work with private organizations   to embrace data protection as part of their corporate culture and take reasonable steps to manage and  secure personal information that they hold. Through industry briefings, online training resources, and   advisory guidelines, MSMEs will be equipped with information on the requirements of the Data Protection  Act and good data management practices.      3.1.3 Action Areas     By fostering safe and trusted digital economy, the Government of Uganda  (GoU) will:      a) Implement digital identity to facilitate utilization of e-services   GoU will pilot the UgPass to implement a whole-of-nation PKI and deploy the essential enabling  building blocks for modern and safe e-services. The standards for electronic signatures will be   updated and described. GoU will continue to scale the usage of PKI within government IT enabled  services and applications.       b) Prioritise support for SMEs   GoU will provide support by providing cybersecurity guidelines and standards for voluntary   compliance and dedicated capacity building programs for MSMEs to enhance the awareness on  how safely conduct business in today’s networked environment. As part of the program GoU will   work with private organizations to embrace cybersecurity and data protection as part of their   corporate culture.                 19 (43)  [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation]         3.2 Threat preparedness and response          3.2.1 Risk management    It is important to realise that cybersecurity incidents can never be completely prevented. The rapid  development of technology and its accelerated spread also increases the potential for security incidents.   Therefore, in addition to preventing incidents, the focus must also be on cyber resilience – i.e. on the   control and reduction of damage caused by incidents. This requires two types of action: first,  proactive measures aimed at preventing incidents, and second, reactive ones to control and reduce   damage.     Figure 6. Measures to achieve cyber resilience.    Continuous gathering and analysis of information on security incidents both domestically and internationally   makes the rapid identification of threats possible and the resolution of incidents more effective. Therefore,  Uganda will put continuous effort to identify and understand potential threats (threat intelligence)   and the risks associated with these threats (risk awareness). There is also a need for resources to detect  and cope with incidents (incident management) and to plan activities and resources to deal with the   damage caused by incidents (recovery). The existence of such measures will, on the one hand, increase   the ability to prevent incidents by increasing overall security and, on the other hand, significantly reduce  the adverse impact of incidents on society. [1]       Threat  preparedness and response  Promote risk assessment practices based on central  risk repository  Develop central incident register and sectoral  incident scenarios  Develop tools  for information sharing  Strengthen national and sectoral CERTs  Publish regularly Cyber Threat Landscape Report  Establish programs for a capacity building about risk  management           20 (43)  [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation]      Global cyberattacks during recent years have caused a massive financial and reputational damage to states  states, governments, companies, and private citizens. To improve Uganda’s resilience against such   incidents it is essential to detect, analyze, understand, and mitigate cybersecurity risks.      Cybersecurity risks involve three components:   - Threat. Threat can be technological like malware, geopolitical like adversary nation state, crime like an  organized crime group or even environmental like extreme weather conditions.   - Vulnerability. Vulnerability is often described as a weakness of computer system which can be exploited.  In the cyber ecosystem, vulnerability is more complex and can be technological, organizational,   administrative etc weaknesses that leave the ecosystem open to cyberthreats.   - Consequence (impact). Consequence can be assessed combining likelihood of the cyber incident with  potential impact to the ecosystem or its components.     Figure 7. Three components of cybersecurity risk.   To mitigate cybersecurity risk and minimize the negative impact of cyber threats, Government will continue  the update of National Information Risk Register, develop and regularly update sector based risk   scenarios for incident management (for energy, communications, government sectors etc). Both national  level and sector oriented cyber risk repositories improve understanding about current cybersecurity risks   and allows to forecast and model trends.     The responsible regulatory bodies and NCII operators will update periodically the list of their critical services   due to continually changing threat landscape.      Uganda will establish the mandatory incident reporting for NCII and government sector and aggregate a  national level incident register, which is essential for understanding security situation and to plan,   develop and implement appropriate security measures for different sectors.      For a successful and efficient risk management, Uganda will foster inter-agency cooperation in   cybersecurity related matters, especially in information sharing, and will establish special programs for  a capacity building for sectors that have less resources for cybersecurity such as MSMEs, healthcare   institutions.   3.2.2 Preparedness and incident response    Today, organizations’ ability to handle potential incidents is inevitable. Globally, 86,2% of companies are   being compromised by at least one successful attack in 2021. Notably, this doesn’t account for attempted  attacks or those that went unreported. [9] Even though when global investments to cybersecurity are   enormous, due to the dynamics of cyberspace, fast growing number of threats and rapid digitalization,   attack surface of cyberthreats is increasing fast. Many of attacks and other incidents can be prevented by  efficient threat intelligence, risk awareness and smart technological protection. However, since cyber   incidents will continue to take place, appropriate incident management and incident recovery framework  shall be established for Uganda.      In order to efficiently respond to incidents, Uganda will define clearly national working arrangements  for information exchange and incident response. ICT incidents tend to escalate very rapidly, thus the roles   of the various organisations and agencies, cooperation arrangements and mechanisms for exchange of  information must be defined and organised. Given the need for extensive cooperation with the private   sector and with future sector specific CSIRTs (e.g financial, energy etc.), sectoral CSIRTs will develop  specific competence (such as security of industrial control systems) that is needed for incident management   in specific sectors.            21 (43)  [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation]        The threat environment and criminal landscape is in constant change, which means that the Government   needs new tools, approaches and creativity for incident management at MDAs, NCII operators, police and   law enforcement to stand a chance. Uganda will clarify common interests of various stakeholders and  create appropriate tools or methods for information sharing. Communication and information   sharing both within public sector and private sector and between public and private sector is a prerequisite  for efficient response to incidents.     Sound incident and crisis management plans as well as general knowledge about threat landscape   guarantees the preparedness for incidents. Uganda will draft and establish national and sectoral   incident resolution plans as a part of national emergency planning and crises management.     Testing the rules and plans for information sharing and incident management guarantee their efficiency.  Uganda will regularly conduct cyber drills. Cyberdrills will be organised both within teams and at the   national level.      3.2.3 Action Areas     To be prepared to threats and guarantee a sustainable national level cyber risk  management and response system, GoU will:    a) Promote risk assessment practices based on central risk repository & regularly publish   the Cyber Threat Landscape Report. GoU will establish a mechanism for regular threat  intelligence and analysis at strategic and tactical level. That shall include collection and analysis of   the information about strategic threat vectors such as geopolitical tensions, increasing cybercrime  etc. as well as technical information of cyber-attacks, characteristics of malware etc. Common cyber   risk assessment methodology will be established for MDAs and NCII operators. The National  Information Risk Register will provide up-to-date information about current cybersecurity risks and   allows to observe and predict trends.   b) Develop central incident register and sectoral incident scenarios. GoU will establish the  mandatory incident reporting for NCII and government sector and develop clear guidelines for   reporting. NITA-U will manage an aggregated national level incident register.  GoU will generate  sector-based risk scenarios for incident management and prepare national and sectoral incident   resolution plans as a part of national emergency planning and crises management.   c) Strengthen national and promote sectoral CERTs. GoU will enhance capacity and capability  for incident response especially heavily focusing on the proactive approach, increasing capacity   building for first level incident responders and home grown re-usable security monitoring solutions  for organisations.   d) Develop tools for information sharing. GoU will foster cooperation and communication  between security, law enforcement and other government agencies and provide a Cyber Threat   Intelligence information sharing framework. National emergency planning and crises management   will be enhanced through the development of large-scale cyber incident management plans.  e) Establish programs for capacity building in the risk management. GoU will establish   capacity building programs for sectors hat have less resources for cybersecurity such as MSMEs,  healthcare institutions.              22 (43)  [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation]         3.3 Robust cybersecurity ecosystem       The complex and interconnected nature of cyberspace is such that ensuring holistic cybersecurity   becomes a shared responsibility between the Government, private sector and other stakeholders as part of   our country’s national critical information infrastructure is run by the private sector. A robust national  ecosystem guaranteeing cybersecurity requires the involvement of all key stakeholders, both state and   non-state actors, and at national and international level based on collaboration. Assets that are essential  to the functioning and security of a society and economy of the country are Critical Infrastructure (CI).   National Critical Information Infrastructure (NCII) are ICT systems that operate key functions of the critical  infrastructure.    The protection of NCII in Uganda is addressed from a risk management perspective. Regular risk  assessments guide the identification of national critical infrastructure and services, whose disruption may   have a serious impact on the security or economic well-being  of citizens and harm Uganda’s possibilities to benefit from   digitalisation. A risk-based approach also enables to prioritize   implementation of programs and policies designed to protect  NCIIs.      Earlier strategic interventions, i.e. the 2011 NISS recognizes the prominence of protecting critical   information infrastructure from disruption and the role of public-private partnerships as one of the guiding   principles of Uganda. The Computer Misuse Act addresses the offences in relation with protected computers  in certain areas and economic sectors, however, it does not organize transparently the principles and criteria   for determining the NCII ecosystem, nor does it outlines minimum cybersecurity baselines addressing NCII  operators.       The establishment of a security baseline for protected computers, programs or data in sectors specified in  NISF and Computer Misuse Act (2011) has been the current practice to address the critical information   infrastructure protection in Uganda.      In order to enhance the transparency and thereby boost trust between the private and the public sector,  the Government will implement the strategic plan on the protection of National Critical Information   Infrastructure containing a list of critical sectors to be considered as essential for the maintenance of   critical societal and economic activities. The national level risk assessments provided by NITA-U and NISAG  will serve as a basis of reviewing the list and any future NCII updates.       Robust cyber- security  ecosystem  Implement the strategic plan on the protection of  NCII  Promote cooperation and understanding of  cybersecurity risks in all critical sectors  Raising awareness of supply chain risks  Update of the minimal cybersecurity baseline for NCII  operators  Create effective governance and management  structure for protection of NCII   The protection of National Critical  Information Infrastructure relies on   regular and up-to-date risk assessments              23 (43)  [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation]      The protection of NCII in various sectors exceeds the capabilities and mandate of any single Government  agency. In Uganda, the National Information Security Advisory Group (NISAG), an inter-sectoral working   group provides the platform for collaboration.      Considering the changing threat environment, the   update of the minimal cybersecurity baseline for  NCII operators is inevitable. However, this should be   done cognizant of the maturity level of the country to  avoid the adoption of requirements that are too stringent   and not implementable in Uganda’s current setting. The  Ministry of ICT, responsible regulators, NISAG and   owners of critical information infrastructures will assess the cybersecurity baseline and provide consistent   updates to the baseline consistent with international standards and best practice.      The baseline relies on the risk management approach and provides guidelines to NCII operators about the  implementation of necessary security measures. It is required that every operator of critical services and   infrastructure implements security measures.   NCII operators prepare or update their contingency  plans of critical ICT systems based on the national   risk environment. Among others, the baseline will  address incident response and vulnerability   disclosure among other topics and the mandatory   implementation of the cybersecurity baseline by NCII  operators that needs to be regularly audited.     The Government will continue working together with   NCII operators to promote understanding of cybersecurity risks. The cooperation and exchange of  information between government agencies and the private sector to identify cyber threats will ensure that   the critical ICT systems are protected to a level that is   commensurate with the risks faced to ensure the operation  and recovery of critical services and infrastructures. The   National Information Security Advisory Group - NISAG - provides cyber threat landscape assessment based on   the National Information Risk Register. Furthermore, cyber   incident reporting will be made mandatory for all  government authorities and NCII operators. The overview of incidents serves as basis for comprehensive   cyber threat landscape assessment. NCII operators will be bound to report cyber incidents to their sectoral  regulators such is the current practice for communications sector under UCC. As referred in the previous   chapter, NISAG’s risk register helps to align cyber risk management with the country’s national  crisis/contingency management plan. It can also help harness the necessary capabilities/capacities, people,   funding, and strategies to strengthen the overall cybersecurity posture of the Nation.      Throughout the years, NISAG has been a platform for collaboration between NCII operators and the   government sector. Through NISAG, they have shared the information on an ad hoc basis. NISAG shall  develop its procedures, document the NCII assets in the country and will promote a fluent information flow   with oversight supervision from the Ministry of ICT and NG. Recognizing the critical and highly   interdependent role of NCII operators in managing cybersecurity risks and responding to incidents, the  Government will provide the communication channels and cooperation mechanisms between   public and private agencies. For every critical sector a National Regulatory Authority will be appointed,  that serves as a sectoral national contact point. The role of the contact points is to take lead of NCII   protection withing their sectors, to synthesize the information collected from NCII operators and contribute   to the cyber threat landscape assessment on national level.      ICT service providers and NCII operators shall pay attention to risks that are related to supply chain  security. Threat intelligence and respective risk assessments shall be monitored during the IT development   Established formats for private-public  partnership are essential for boosting   trust amongst and between the industry  and the government.   NCII Governance model defines clear  responsibilities of every stakeholder.      Minimum cybersecurity baselines for NCII   operators will be established with  appropriate legislative mechanisms.   Guiding principles for NCIIs are the principles   of personality and minimal adverse   effects. Ensuring the security of a system is  arranged by the service provider and in case of   security incident, service provider will apply  due care and measures to avoid the escalation   and spread of the effect of the incident and  will notify the supervisory authority.               24 (43)  [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation]      stage and in the software and hardware tendering processes. Government through NITA-U will develop  respective guidelines.      This Strategy aims to create an effective governance and management framework. Establishing  sustainable partnerships among the Government and NCII operators requires that all participating   stakeholders define a clear understanding of the goals of the partnership and the mutual security benefits  that stem from dedicated and meaningful collaboration. Areas of cooperation include establishing effective   coordinating structures and information-sharing processes and protocols, building trust through joint events  and exercises that enhance cross-sectoral response, exchanging best practices for improving security, as   well as improving international coordination.       3.3.1 Action Areas      GoU will work with key stakeholders - the NCII operators and the  cybersecurity community - in five major areas. GoU will:    a) Implement the strategic plan on the protection of National Critical Information   Infrastructure. The strategic plan provides clear criteria on defining critical sectors and the roles  and responsibilities of NCII operators, but also supervisory authorities to ensure the transparency   and boosting trust amongst and between the government and private sector.   b) Raise awareness of supply chain security risks    GoU will increase the adoption of Security-by-Design practices and address cybersecurity issues   upstream and along the supply chain. GoU will enhance the implementation of national  cybersecurity standard for critical infrastructure, including requirements for software and hardware   that can be used in vital services. The Government will start the preparations for developing  accreditation standards for hardware, software and IT services deployed in NCII.   c) Update of the minimal cybersecurity baseline for NCII operators   Based on international standards and best practice, GoU will enhance the implementation of   security measures of NCII operators based on the regular risk assessments. To achieve the goal,   the Government will set legal requirements for minimum cybersecurity baseline of NCIIs. The  standard includes the requirements for information sharing and incident reporting.    d) Create effective governance and management structure for protection of NCII   GoU will introduce legal provisions that give the relevant sector regulators the authority and   resources to oversee compliance. This will assist in the efforts to implement the current strategy   goals and achieve cross-sectoral agreements.                     25 (43)  [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation]      3.4 Cyber Skilled Uganda       End users are often the weakest link in the cybersecurity chain. This is true when the users lack the  training to take informed security decisions while carrying out digital activities. As people begin to become   more connected, they need support to develop cybersecurity capacity to better respond to threats. Securing   the cyber domain through capacity building activities contributes to reducing issues such as cyber risks and  digital divide.     Promotion of the cybersecurity skills has been the main goals throughout the previous strategic   interventions. However, a concerted effort by      the Ugandan government to create online safety through skilled professionals and risk aware users   demands an effort on continuous basis as the gap in the required skills set for cybersecurity still exists.   3.4.1 Engrain cybersecurity through all stages of education   The review of the educational curricula is an ongoing task, and it shall meet current and future needs. To   bridge the gap of institutional knowledge and shortage of skills Government of Uganda will promote and  facilitate the development of cybersecurity educational programs. Inclusion of information security topics   in the national ICT related curricula in all educational institutions across primary, secondary and  tertiary levels is the goal. Curricula should be interdisciplinary and besides the technical knowledge   also non-technical cybersecurity skills and topics, such as digital literacy, public policy and governance,   economics, social sciences or international relations shall be covered.     The focus of Uganda is also on creating a skilled professional workforce based on local content and provide  the required human resource pool. Government will integrate cybersecurity courses in all computer   science and IT programs in higher education, including teaching computer security and forensics as a   subject or field of expertise. Dedicated cybersecurity degrees and apprenticeships will be created and  additional resources for supporting the new degrees at the tertiary level will be applied. In addition, the   curricula should foster awareness of and stimulate interest in cybersecurity career opportunities. To further  the efforts in this space, the Government will consider various incentive schemes, such as scholarships and   grants but also establishment of an accreditation mechanism for quality assurance of cybersecurity training   programs in universities.     Given the multi-disciplinary nature of cybersecurity capacity building, universities, colleges, and other  educational institutions should be encouraged to work across departments and with other academic   partners to develop or update their programs. To achieve the goal, the cooperation and collaboration  between educational institutions will be enhanced and a framework for delivering cybersecurity   knowledge throughout the education system, especially in primary and secondary schools will be generated.   Cyber  Skilled  Uganda  Engrain cybersecurity through all stages of education  Improve expertise, skills and competencies  Raising public cybersecurity  awareness  Enhance knowledge trough research and development           26 (43)  [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation]      3.4.2 Improve expertise, skills and competencies   A qualified and highly skilled human resource base is pivotal to a successful information security strategy  implementation. Expertise is required in areas like information security management, auditing and   forensics. In order to diminish the lack of adequate human resource base both in Government authorities  but also in private sector, Government will continuously coordinate cybersecurity programs and promote   information security career development.      Digital Uganda Vision aims to reach universal digital literacy and comprehensive utilization of e-services.   Thus, the public sector needs to hire skilled officers able to guarantee the availability and safety of the e- services but also to develop relevant policies and implement them. Cybersecurity skills shall be   integrated into core competencies in public sector institutions and advocating the creation of  cybersecurity roles such as the Chief Information Security Officer in individual public sector institutions is   inevitable when the role and impact of ICT systems grows.      With the cost of cybercrime increasing every year across Uganda, the Government is committed to ensure   that competent authorities better awareness of the threat of cybercrime and information security.  Therefore, trainings within the Justice Law and Order Sector but also in Defence Sector, will continue.       For supporting the cybersecurity competencies and share the information among public institutions, NITA- U as the core implementer of the Cybersecurity Strategy provides networking facilities to   knowledgeable IT officers across Government MDAs, but also implements capacity building program for IT  personnel of MDAs.      As the experienced cybersecurity professionals are in high demand, certification schemas are crucial   steppingstone for almost all careers. Government will coordinate cybersecurity programs and promote   information security career development. In partnerships with academia Government will develop  and implement curriculum but also specialized courses that address the required skills.     Government will support and implement professional training courses and skills development schemes for   professionals in other sectors as well. First, an assessment of capacity skills gap at across NCII   operators will be carried out to determine the required resources. In order to promote the establishment  of sectoral CSIRT teams, the need to recruit and train experts in the fields of incident management and   forensics and cybercrime prevention is vital.   3.4.3 Raising public cybersecurity awareness   Digital Uganda Vision promotes universal digital literacy and development, adoption and utilization of e-  services. All those using the Internet and related technologies, need to understand the role they play in  safeguarding sensitive or personal data. The rise of the Internet demands a responsible cybersecurity   culture, safe Internet habits and practices to protect personal information online and safely use e-services.      Government will continue to carry out the awareness programs to cover various target groups. The   aim is to promote trust in e-government and e-commerce services. GoU will broaden the reach of program  across age groups and include both individuals and businesses and create initiatives to inform the public   continuously of the current and emerging cybercrime trends, defenses and cyber threats. Annual events  like Cybersecurity Week to promote information security will be organized in addition to continuous   awareness raising campaigns to improve cybersecurity awareness and literacy of the public focusing   on disseminating information about cybersecurity risks and threats. The Government also introduces and  designs cybersecurity awareness and school-based competitions.     Government of Uganda through NITA-U, together with cross sectoral partners will continue to enhance the   cybersecurity awareness portal (besafeoline website) acting as a reference point for cybersecurity   awareness-raising materials and initiatives.             27 (43)  [Draft Version for stakeholder consultation]      3.4.4 Enhance knowledge through research and development   The aspect of R&D within the Ugandan context ensures the availability of local innovations and solutions  that fit the current challenges. Building capacity in this area makes us active participants to global   cybersecurity solutions. There are good examples of cooperation and initiatives in the R&D area.  Government of Uganda has designed the National ICT Initiatives Support Program (NIISP) to facilitate the   creation of an ICT Innovation ecosystem and marketplace for Ugandan innovative digital products like   software applications and innovations industry.     Government will continuously support Research and Development programs in universities in  Uganda in the area of cybersecurity. GoU will promote the development and commercialization of   intellectual properties, technologies and innovations through focused research and development. GoU will  support incubators and startups with a commercial approach that involve public and private actors, and   ensure elements of competition and merit in the selection process.      Government support is vital also for enterprises that are undertaking Research and Development in   cybersecurity. Therefore, Uganda will deepen partnerships for the development of interfaces to research  and innovation and interaction between universities and the local economy, so that skills are linked to   market needs.      Our goal is to provide an ecosystem comprising from highly skilled professionals, companies with deep   cybersecurity capabilities and strong translational research and development. The ecosystem will ensure a  sustainable source of expertise and solutions to support our plans for a resilient national infrastructure and   a safer cyberspace. Government will establish incentives to develop partnerships for the development of  interfaces to research and innovation and interaction between universities and the local economy, so that   skills are linked to market needs.      3.4.5 Action Areas     To promote cybersecurity skills and awareness in Uganda, GoU will:   a) Engrain cybersecurity through all stages of education   GoU will incorporate cybersecurity as a core learning area at the earliest levels of our education  system as well as a specialized area at university and tertiary levels for professionals.   b) Improve expertise, skills and competencies   GoU will continuously coordinate cybersecurity programs and promote information security career   development by developing specialized courses and curricula, supporting certification schemas,   providing networking facilities and support trainings focused on NCII operators, military and law  enforcement training programs.   c) Raising public cybersecurity awareness   GoU will develop comprehensive program to increase populations awareness.

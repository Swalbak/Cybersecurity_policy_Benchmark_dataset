The digital divide is often associated with the resulting gap in terms of socio-economic development. E-Commerce / Electronic Commerce/Electronic transactions – Business activities involving consumers, manufacturers, suppliers, service providers and intermediaries using electronic medium. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) – Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) is a concept related to the convergence of Information Technology, telecommunications, broadcasting and multimedia. ICT is an environment enabling the development of physical infrastructure, hardware equipment and software systems used for the processing, the storing and the transmission of information. Information Society (IS) – A country or region where information technology has been fully exploited and is part of everyday life as an enabler of information sharing, communication and diffusion. Information Technology (IT) – Embraces the use of computers, telecommunications and office systems technologies for the collection, processing, storing, packaging and dissemination of information. Internet Exchange Point (IXP) – It is a “peering point” for interconnecting ISPs and/or other IXPs for the purpose of localizing national traffic routing as opposed to using international routes to accomplish inter-ISP traffic flow. Internet Service Provider (ISP) – Also known as Internet Access Providers, an ISP is a company that provides infrastructure for access to the Internet or for interconnecting other ISPs and content-based or application-based services on the Internet. Knowledge Based Economy (KBE) – A country or region where ICT is extensively used to enhance knowledge so that higher human capital brings further improvement to the economy. Local Area Network (LAN) – A computer network that spans a relatively small area. Most LANs are confined to a single building or group of buildings. However, one LAN can be connected to other LANs over any distance via telephone lines and radio waves. Teledensity - The number of telephones per 100 people in a region. Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) – Also known as Voice over Internet, IP Telephony or Internet Telephony – refers to telephone services provided over the Internet as the transmission medium. Wide Area Network (WAN) – A computer network that spans a relatively large geographical area. Typically, a WAN consists of two or more local area networks (LANs). Computers connected to a wide area network are often connected through public networks, such as the telephone system. They can also be connected through leased lines or satellites. The largest WAN in existence is the Internet. ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Page 10 / 63 NATIONAL ICT VISION ‘To develop into a knowledge-based information society with a vibrant ICT sector as the engine of sustainable socio-economic development.’ 1. INTRODUCTION 1-1 The ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) play a vital role today in facilitating the attainment of development goals of any nation. Over the last few years, many African countries have taken advantage of the opportunities provided by ICTs and have put in place ICT-enabled implementation plans to support their socio-economic development efforts. These country-successes have been made possible due to the combined efforts of all stakeholders and with support from regional and international organizations as well as bilateral partners and the private sector. Regionally, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) developed a harmonised policy for ICT in the West African region. The 15-Member States of ECOWAS recognising the importance of formulating an ICT policy, adopted on 19 January 2007 in Ouagadougou, the Supplementary Act A/SA1/01/07 entitled the ‘Harmonization of Policies and of the Regulatory Framework for Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)’. This Supplementary Act is a supplemental provision to the Revised ECOWAS Treaty of 1993 and provides guidance on the structure and contents of an ICT Policy for adoption by all Member States. This policy document is therefore in line with the ECOWAS ICT policy as it attempts to map the ways in which ICTs can be used to achieve the basic development objectives of Sierra Leone. Using the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, Vision 2025, and the Millennium Development Goals as a baseline for analysis, the policy links the application of ICT to national development goals identified under specific areas or ‘pillars’ with a series of ICT- specific objectives and targets for measuring progress over a 5-year implementation timeline. The development of this policy is the result of the consultative approach of the National ICT Task Force (NICTTF). Its policy work programme included: · a 2009 e-readiness survey; · industry consultations to obtain key issues, objectives, targets and challenges; · review of the draft policy over a two-day national workshop of stakeholders; and · a two-day stakeholders retreat to finalise the draft policy and incorporate the results from the national workshop. ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Page 11 / 63 1-2 General Purpose The general purpose of this National ICT Policy is to provide best practice guidance in the creation of an enabling environment for ICT development by: · Giving guidelines about the evolution of the legal framework to take into account the convergence of sectors and the convergence of technologies. · Defining the role of the national institutions and industry stakeholders in the new environment: policy maker, regulator, National ICT Advisory Council, private sector, Diaspora. · Stimulating a participative approach for the preparation and the implementation of the ICT Policy. · Ensuring a common understanding about the role of each type of stakeholder and key issues raised in the ICT sector. · Developing culturally specific contents and applications and to highlight the importance of local contents and local focus. · Promoting universal access/service. 1-3 STRUCTURE OF THE POLICY This Policy has been structured into three Sections as follows: 1. Section A -provides the objectives of the policy (2-1 to 2-3), background information (3-1 to 3-5) and the current status of the ICT sector in Sierra Leone (4-1 to 4-6); 2. Section B - summarises the key socio-economic issues identified by the Government and the preferred ICT solutions (see 5-1 to 5-11) as well as deadlines within which to address them (5-12). It also summarises plans for strengthening the key stakeholders tasked with oversight responsibility for the implementation of the policy (6-1 to 6-6) and the supporting legal and security framework required (7- 1 to 7-3); and 3. Section C - details the ten implementation plans required for the carrying out of this policy (8-1 to 8-10) and the summary conclusion (9). Additional annexes are provided for further detail and clarification (A, B, C). ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Page 12 / 63 SECTION A 2 OBJECTIVES IN DEVELOPING AN ICT POLICY The following political, economic and social objectives have been identified as the key objectives of the Government of Sierra Leone in its formulation of this policy: 2-1 Political objectives of the ICT policy · To enhance better transparency and facilitate communication with citizens through E-governance; · To integrate Sierra Leone regionally and globally through the use of ICTs; · To re-brand the image of Sierra Leone by providing information on progress and achievements in Sierra Leone and to promote the distribution of culturally sensitive materials through various ICT channels; · To comply with the provisions of ECOWAS and the World Trade Organisation (WTO) General Agreement on Trade and Services. 2-2 Economic objectives of the ICT policy · To improve efficiency in the public sector through effective use of ICT infrastructure, applications and services; · To enhance competitiveness in the private sector; · To enable global economic integration; · To create new opportunities for Sierra Leoneans to become ICT citizens equipped to take advantage of a knowledge-based economy; · To encourage the transition of the informal market to the formal market through ICT tools; · To promote and support indigenous and foreign entrepreneurship in Sierra Leone; · To enable growth in key areas such as Agriculture, Tourism, Mineral Resources, and Infrastructure development. 2-3 Social objectives of the ICT policy · To improve the basic living standard of Sierra Leoneans; · To facilitate and support the universal freedom of affordable access to information; · To identify and implement all relevant procedures related to cyber security, electronic security and data protection to protect ICT users; ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Page 13 / 63 · To improve the education system through e-learning; · To provide better assistance in the health sector through e-medicine; · To promote and sustain the national culture and tradition through e-learning and local content application/software development; · To reduce poverty by improving free flow of business opportunity based information to underprivileged areas and facilitating the growth of small businesses through innovative solutions; · To engage the Diaspora in the development of Sierra Leone through e-interaction; · To use ICT tools to bridge the illiteracy divide; · To subsidize access for high-speed Internet subscribers in schools and national education institutions. 3 BACKGROUND INFORMATION 3-1 General Summary According to the 2003 World Telecommunication Development Report, almost half of the workforce in developed countries will be employed by industries that are either producers or intensive users of ICT products and services. In the case of sub-Saharan Africa, the average teledensity is two lines per 100 inhabitants and only 0.6 percent of Internet users worldwide are on the African continent. Despite the growth of mobile telephones, Sierra Leone is ranked as one of the least connected countries (170th out of 178 economies) on the Digital Access Index (DAI) (with an index of 0.10), which measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use ICTs. 3-2 Post-conflict context Since the formal conclusion of the war in 2002, Sierra Leone has re-established security and the country’s economic growth rate has jumped to a healthy 7.4 percent. This growth, while positive, is more reflective of the fact that economic activity was halted during the war and current economic activity has been heavily reliant on donor contributions. Notably, a consequence of the war resulted in the missed opportunity of Sierra Leone obtaining fibre optic landing from the main SAT 3 connection along the coast of West Africa. This missed opportunity has meant that Sierra Leone relies on satellites as its primary access medium for wireless technology, resulting in high costs and insufficient access and distribution. On a positive note, the need to communicate, bolstered initially by very low licensing fees and the lack of a central regulator has resulted in the significant growth of mobile telephone operators in the market. Nonetheless, despite such growth, penetration levels remain low, with much market opportunity remaining, especially in the area of rural telephony. ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Page 14 / 63 As evidenced by the e-readiness survey results, access to the Internet, remains particularly low. Outside of the capital city, there are few access points and even in academia, students rarely have access to computers. In respect of re-branding the national image of Sierra Leone, the lack of positive content and culturally sensitive information have permitted negative foreign connotations on the national image, many of which are related to the concluded war such as seen in the film Blood Diamonds. 3-3 Key Strategic Issues from the Vision 2025 The Vision 2025 for Sierra Leone embodies the aspirations of Sierra Leoneans for the year 2025. This shared national vision is expressed as follows: “UNITED PEOPLE, PROGRESSIVE NATION, ATTRACTIVE COUNTRY”. It also identifies six strategic issues that must be confronted to attain the national vision by 2025. Table 3: Key Strategic Issues for Attainment of National Vision 1. How to attain a competitive private sector-led economy with effective indigenous participation; 2. How to create a high quality of life for all Sierra Leoneans; 3. How to build a well educated and enlightened society; 4. How to create a tolerant, stable, secure and well managed society based on democratic values; 5. How to ensure sustainable exploitation and effective utilization of our natural resources, while maintaining a healthy environment; 6. How to become a science and technology driven nation. Section six of the Vision 2025 Plan references technology with the following specific objectives: · Encourage and improve the teaching of science and technology at all levels of education; · Improve science and technology to increase productivity in all sectors of the economy, including the informal sector; and · Improve the use of science and technology to facilitate decision-making at all levels of society. 3-4 The SL-PRSP II (Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper) The Government of Sierra Leone in its second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper has identified four strategic priorities for national development: ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Page 15 / 63 · reliable power supply; · a pro-poor growth perspective in agriculture and fisheries; · a national transportation network to enable the movement of goods and people and thereby facilitate increased investment and economic activity; · sustainable human development through the provision of improved social services. 3-5 The Millennium Development Goals The table below details the strategic role of ICT in the attainment of the PRSP Pillars and the Millennium Development Goals (MDG’s): SL-PRSP I & II Pillars MDGs Contribution of ICTs Pillar 1:Good governance, security and peace building Goal 8: Develop a global partnership for development: Target 12: Develop an open, rule-based predictable, non-discriminatory trading and financial system (…). · Enhance efficiency of markets and financial systems; · Link local markets and financial systems to global networks; · Promote the use of internationally accepted standards and practices.

Seasonal capitalization has come largely as a result of donor-based initiatives and these have supported the growth of ICT firms. The recent explosion of new banks and the installations of the local and wide area networks are another case of the seasonal growth trend. The rapid growth seen in the mobile telecoms market has done much to connect the capital Freetown to the provincial towns. A number of ICT firms and individuals have also implemented modern ICT technologies to conduct their businesses. A notable sector trend is the growth projection of the number of Internet users in Sierra Leone, which could reach a quarter of a million by 2010 and exceed one million by 2015. Further growth would depend on an improvement of the country’s low literacy rate (currently circa 35%). Another trend that contributes to the growth of Internet usage is the rising number of Internet cafés accounting for the majority of Internet users (up to 80%). Telecentres and Internet cafés provide Internet access for the general public as well as low cost international phone calls using VoIP. The Government is keen to see the entry of new technologies in the ICT market. The example of WiMax technology will ultimately offer mobility, wireless broadband capability and lower base cost in urban areas. ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Page 17 / 63 The use of geo tools is also a priority, particularly for the collation of data necessary for the development of appropriate national policies. Annex C provides further information on the key application of geo-information in economic planning. 4-1-2 Sector Challenges One of the biggest constraints to the expansion of the telecommunications infrastructure in Sierra Leone (outside of the capital and a few main cities), is the limited extent of the electricity grid, which has yet to reach many of the provincial areas. These areas typically lack electricity or fixed phone service and are completely unconnected with the rest of the country. Even in the main cities, the provision of Internet bandwidth is limited, expensive and largely unavailable. These are all significant constraints to investment promotion in the ICT sector. In addition, the public telephone network is largely circuit-switched as opposed to packet- switched and relies heavily on copper wire rather than fibre optics. The limited infrastructure makes congestion management difficult since Internet traffic shares the same network as voice traffic. Furthermore, most of the available ISP providers concentrate their wireless broadband services in the greater Freetown area and only expensive VSAT services are available in the other major cities (VSAT bandwidth fees can range from US$500 to US$15,000 per month). 4-1-3 ICT for Basic Infrastructure Management and Operations Currently, basic infrastructure systems are poorly managed and maintained due in part to ineffective information communication systems. Basic infrastructure systems include water supply, electricity supply, sewage, solid waste collection, right-of-ways, communication networks and land use. Recent and projected investments in such infrastructure involve the introduction of prepaid services inclusive of monitoring and payment systems. These prepaid service operations rely on ICT devices at the client’s premises and community distribution hubs that are connected offline and online to databases at the responsible agency. Effective management of the basic infrastructure operations will depend on the collection, transmission and analysis of demand and supply information between client and responsible agency. This policy therefore envisions the introduction and customization of reliable ICT devices that are appropriate for the delivery services mentioned above. Coordination in ICT infrastructure development is also considered paramount to achieving national backbone networks that can carry data, voice and video, as would be employed in effective management and operations of basic infrastructure. ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Page 18 / 63 4-2 The Current Institutional Structures 4-2-1 The Ministry of Information and Communications The Ministry of Information and Communications is the primary stakeholder of ICT related policies and is tasked with overseeing the development, review and implementation of the Government’s information and communication agenda. The Ministry has mandated the preparation of this ICT Policy document and will be responsible for its regular review and update. 4-2-2 The Regulatory Authority, NATCOM The Telecommunications Act 2006 established the National Telecommunications Commission (NATCOM) to provide for the licensing and regulation of telecommunications operators and for the promotion of universal access to basic telecommunications services. It is also tasked with ensuring fair competition for the benefit of investors and users of telecommunications networks and services and to improve the national, regional and global integration of Sierra Leone in telecommunications. 4-2-3 The National ICT Task Force The National ICT Task Force was established by the Government to provide strategic recommendations on the enabling policies for the ICT sector and the necessary institutional framework to result in a more effective, efficient and harmonized sector. 4.3 Current ICT Infrastructure and Network Operators 4-3-1 Introduction The country's traditional telecommunications infrastructure suffered during the war but the mobile sector has experienced excellent growth with four GSM networks currently competing for customers. Wireless broadband service providers have been providing Internet access and VoIP Internet telephony. However, penetration rates in all market segments are still very low, leaving ample potential for future growth. 4-3-2 Incumbent Fixed Line Operator SierraTel (Sierra Leone Telecommunications Company), is 100% Government owned. It provides fixed-line, international and Internet services. The company lost its dominance with the arrival of the mobile network operators but has made significant effort to rehabilitate and reinstate the telecom network after the war and to modernise and expand its outdated equipment. The installed capacity of the PSTN fixed line network is 250,000 (as at 2004) but with only 25,000 active fixed lines (as at end 2008). The fixed-line teledensity is currently 0.4%. Its copper lines are in a very poor condition and are consequently not eligible for ADSL. SierraTel has plans to rehabilitate, upgrade and expand its PSTN services. Recently it has complemented the PSTN services using the CDMA wireless technologies to deliver both voice and data (Internet services). ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Page 19 / 63 In the near future, SierraTel plans to provide fibre optic connectivity within the Freetown municipality junction network. The diagram below shows the network fibre ducts (in blue) required. 4-3-3 International Gateway Sierra Leone is connected to the rest of the world via an Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) satellite Earth station that is operated by SierraTel. SierraTel currently solely manages the international gateway according to a two years statutory right. This mandate expired in August 2008, and the national regulator (NATCOM) is set to review the exclusivity status. However, efforts are being made to facilitate submarine optical fibre landing and several applications have been received from prospective providers. The process of approving landing rights is currently underway. It is believed that the cost of international communications will be drastically reduced if Sierra Leone acquires fibre landing in the nearest future. 4-3-4 GSM Mobiles Operators and Frequency Spectrum Usage · They are four active mobile operators: Mobile Network Technology & Frequency Africell / Lintel GSM 900 & 1800 Zain (ex-Celtel) GSM 900 & 1800 Comium GSM 900 & 1800 Tigo / Millicom GSM 900 & 1800 (SierraTel operates on a CDMA 850 frequency.) The combined total Mobile Subscriber base is approximately: - 1,200,000 (with 72% annual growth rate) in June 2007; and - 1,545,000 (with 39% annual growth rate) in 4th quarter 2008. The Mobile Penetration is 25% by June 2008; and the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) is $8.00. ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Page 20 / 63 · IMT - 2000 400 MHz band (FWA Broadband Internet). · Unlicensed Spectrum The unlicensed spectrum (2.4GHz/5.8GHz) is partly regulated by NATCOM the regulator and is subject to interference due to use by other wireless ISPs. This in some cases has resulted in the degradation of the quality of service provided. 4.4 Current ICT Services 4-4-1 Available Services · Fixed and Wireless Telephony (post-paid and prepaid). · Broadband Internet Services ranging from 64 kbps to 1Mbps are available for homes, small and medium sized enterprises, small office/home office and corporate entities; Audio/Video streaming (music download) and Virtual Private Networking (VPN) for Closed User Groups like Business Entities are also provided on the market. 4-4-2 Internet penetration · Dial-up ISP (PSTN) with 150-200 subscribers; · Internet Users (excluding mobile Internet users) 16,000; and · Internet Penetration 0.27% 4-4-3 Broadband ISPs · PCS Holdings (SL) Limited brand named IpTel · Afcom (SL) Limited · LimeLine (SL) Limited · Fidelity Global FGC · Multinet · Zain · Atlas Communications · Ambitel · Intergroup Telecommunications · Rawabi Dubai Company · Equatorial Communications · Tigo · icom.net (an ISP subsidiary of Comium) Current total Investment in Broadband Internet Business is estimated to be $7 Million. ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Page 21 / 63 4-4-4 Telecoms Market In 2008, the total revenue generated by the voice telephony market in Sierra Leone was estimated to be $176 million. Indeed, the demand in the voice market has been growing at a rate of 72% while that of the Internet lags behind at 15%. The trend in the voice market in Sierra Leone is moving from the traditional voice telephony model to the rich voice (Interactive voice response, ring tone download and audio streaming) model. As for Internet services, there is an ever-growing demand for higher Internet bandwidth for data-intensive services. Many financial institutions are rolling out products requiring higher bandwidth for data services. 4-5 The Postal Sector The Postal Sector has been beset by several problems in the past decade. The use of postal services has reduced drastically, due in part to the emergence of Internet and web technologies, and also due to general loss of confidence in the services. These problems have been exacerbated by poor infrastructure and inadequate finances to improve and expand the sector. Nonetheless, the Government is committed to developing a vibrant and efficient postal sector to effectively meet present and future needs. In particular, the Government plans to liberalize the fast mail and courier service segment of the sector in which the private sector has continued to play an important role. Additionally all post offices will be required to adhere to minimum service standards against which performance will be monitored. The Universal Service Provider will provide exclusive services such as delivery of printed materials and packages weighing up to 350 grams and the issuing of stamps. The non-exclusive market segments will consist of Courier and Parcel Services, Marketing Services, Postal Financial Services, and Agency services with other sectors. The Government recognises the key role of the postal sector to the development of ICTs in Sierra Leone as the incumbent operator, SALPOST is equipped with infrastructure and premises spanning the entire country. The Government is also mindful of the need to converge regulation as technology converges across the postal, telecoms and media sectors. An overview of the strategic considerations on the Postal Sector is located in Annexe B. 4.6 Broadcast Media and regulating converged technology Broadcast media have emerged as one of the most powerful communication tools in the 21st century thus revolutionising the way in which individuals and societies interact. A series of reforms have been undertaken in the broadcasting sub-sector to ensure that it becomes competitive and serves the growing needs of the people. Consequently, over 40 radio and two TV stations are operational in Sierra Leone. ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Page 22 / 63 An aim of this policy is the provision of a rational and comprehensive framework to govern the establishment, ownership, control, management and delivery of information, entertainment and educational services to Sierra Leoneans. This can be achieved through the provision of an efficient and reliable broadcasting. The case for reform is particularly strong in the music and film industry where rampant piracy has affected the growth and development of local music and film talent/work. It is certain that the development of Internet will result in further damage if an adequate legal framework is not established. Through the establishment of a supportive legal framework, this policy provides for the enactment of Intellectual Property and Copyright laws and for the development of music and film security/encryption tools by the Centre for ICT Intelligence (CII). Digital technology has however brought about the convergence of computer (IT) and communications (together referred as ICT), and permeated into media (Print & Electronic Media - broadcast) and entertainment (Games and IPTV), which has evolved into yet another terminology, ICE (Information, Communication and Entertainment). Additionally there has also been convergence of fixed and wireless communications with the arrival of wireless terminal devices that have multi purposes e.g. a single device functioning as a PDA, a cell phone, a TV receiver, providing wireless access to Internet etc. In the area of regulation, there is currently a specific regulatory body for the media, the Independent Media Commission, IMC. The Government is however fully aware that technologies arriving in Sierra Leone will arrive in converged devices and that will cut across telecoms and media services and even postal services. In this regard, it is envisaged that there will be a merger of NATCOM and the IMC to regulate the entire ICT sector. Moreover, this is a recognised principle of the ECOWAS recommendations on legal framework formulation for the sector. ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Page 23 / 63 SECTION B 5 LINKAGE BETWEEN SOCIAL-ECONOMIC GROWTH AND ICT DEVELOPMENT In this policy, the following eleven pillars have been identified as key to the socio-economic development of Sierra Leone: · Private Sector Business Activity · Capacity Building and Human Resources in ICT · Infrastructure · Health · Education · Natural Resources and Environment · Agriculture and Food Security · Good Governance · Gender, Youth and Social Services · Media and Civil Society · Tourism These eleven pillars cover basic social, political and economic needs that have been identified by the Government as areas in which ICT development can play a key role, providing opportunities for further social growth and cohesion through ICT enabled solutions. Annex A1 provides the Government’s strategic policy considerations identified in relation to the eleven pillars, listing the challenges, objectives and targeted solution to the issues through the use of ICTs. From Annex A1 are culled the issues listed in the eleven tables below that are considered to be of first and utmost priority in the implementation of this policy. Also presented are the Government’s preferred ICT solutions, the key stakeholder(s) tasked with oversight responsibility for implementation of the solutions and the PRSP (I&II) and MDG references. Following the tables is a Gantt timeline chart for the implementation of the priority ICT solutions over a period of 5 years (2010-2014). The Government anticipates a concerted and timely effort at implementation by the MDA’s most closely linked to the solutions, the private sector, the donor community and the full support of citizens both at home and in the Diaspora.

Given the nascent stage of the sector, regulation will be pro-growth and development focused. The Telecommunication Act 2006 (and its subsequent amendment) is the current legal framework that governs the ICT sector. However, given the fact that ICT substantively represents a broader domain than Telecommunications, it is necessary to further amend the Telecommunications Act to reflect modern trends of convergence. 6-2 Developing the role of the ICT Committee of the Parliament The role of Parliament is central for the enactment of all laws. In particular, the legal framework required for the ICT sector cuts across other sectors especially in areas of security and data protection. It is therefore important that the Parliamentary Committee on ICTs be made familiar with ICT science and technology innovation, policy formulation, planning and monitoring. This will ensure that key sector issues are properly understood in legislation enactment and are properly communicated through the various parliamentary constituency channels. Additional objectives for the development of the ICT Committee’s role include: · To expose the committee to regional and international instruments governing the development and implementation of emerging technologies; · To periodically review the roles and strategies of the parliamentary ICT technology. · To share and learn from various regional best practices; · Employing ICT tools to manage the legislative process. 6-3 Developing the role of the Ministry The Ministry shall be identified as being foremost in ICT. In order to ensure an effective implementation of the ICT policy and to enable it to fulfil its obligations as defined in the Telecommunications Act, the Ministry should facilitate the in-house training of personnel. The Ministry shall review and make recommendations to the Public Sector Reform Unit (PSRU) and HRMO on ICT entry requirements for prospective communication staff. It shall also be strengthened to effectively carry out the following tasks: · To monitor and review the implementation plans of this ICT policy; · To set up and to regularly update a web site to publish all the texts and the events related to the development of the ICT sector. ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Page 36 / 63 · To promote a participative approach with all the stakeholders of the ICT sector through the establishment and supervision of the National ICT Advisory Council. 6-4 Developing the role of NATCOM The role of NATCOM is principal in the implementation of this policy as it is tasked by law with ICT regulation as well as the enablement of growth in the ICT sector. This is in line with ECOWAS harmonisation principles but requires that NATCOM be adequately equipped with qualified staff and appropriate modern regulatory equipments. In particular, NATCOM must secure ICT tools to monitor all operators and develop a national information system with all pertinent statistics about the ICT sector. It must also undertake an annual ICT survey to ensure its activities and regulations are tailored for sector growth/development. 6-5 Developing Statistics Sierra Leone Statistics Sierra Leone (SSL), (formerly Central Statistics Office) established by statistics and census Statistics Act 2002) serves as the central authority for the collection, processing, analysis and dissemination of statistical information on socio-economic activities. There is the need for SSL to employ more ICT tools in data collection surveys and in analysis and dissemination of information. The website also needs to be updated to make it more interactive and to provide intuitive navigation and search capabilities for easier access to statistical data. Additionally, SSL also requires a research and development unit to ensure continual growth in its core skills and areas of competence. 6-6 Developing Standards Bureau The Standards Bureau has a key role in the development of the ICT sector. As the office responsible for establishing standards in imported goods and equipments, the Bureau’s human resource needs to be strengthened to be in a position to ensure that all imported equipments meet international type approval standards. In the area of electronic equipments, it is especially important that the Bureau must be able to adequately enforce the type approval standards determined by NATCOM for all electronic equipments (imported or otherwise) and to do so in collaboration with the Centre for ICT Intelligence once it is established. 6-5 Setting up a National ICT Advisory Council A National ICT Advisory Council shall be created by the Government on the recommendations of the Ministry of Information and Communications to ensure a participatory approach for the development of the ICT sector. The Council shall be tasked with giving guidance to all stakeholders on sector related matters including the following: · Formulating ICT objectives and implementation plans; · Development of national ICT standards and guidelines; · Coordination of national ICT initiatives and projects; ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Page 37 / 63 · Determining requisite ICT support services to public and private sectors; · Monitoring the implementation of policy plans and evaluating the results; · Convergence of technologies. This Council shall be a consultative body with membership comprising representatives of all key stakeholders of the ICT sector such as policymakers, regulator, network operators, service providers, universities, civil society, associations of consumers, private companies and the Chamber of Commerce etc. Below is a diagram showing the position of the National ICT Advisory Council in relation to some sector stakeholders. THE NATIONAL ICT ADVISORY COUNCIL AND SECTOR STAKEHOLDERS 6-6 Improving the performances of Service Providers The Government recognises the importance of service providers in the growth of the sector. NATCOM shall therefore establish clearly defined operational standards including the service level delivery to be met by all service providers and appropriate dispute resolution mechanisms. The Government shall foster an environment that promotes the full spectrum of financing options for ICT development (e.g. angel investors, incubator funds, venture capital and private equity investments) and promote the establishment of a technology incubator to foster local innovation/development while encouraging the use of open source applications. The Government shall also promote the use of locally developed applications by implementing a “Computerize Sierra Leone Initiative” that provides incentives for the provision of locally developed applications/solutions. ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Page 38 / 63 7 LEGAL AND SECURITY FRAMEWORK The rapid changes in the communications sector have given rise to the need to create a dynamic legal and regulatory framework that is responsive to technological changes and advancement in the sector. In addition, the convergence between telecommunications, broadcasting and information technologies must be reflected in a national legal and regulatory regime. A key goal is to develop the sector within a legal framework that is open and transparent in the application of its rules and regulations and that caters for and promotes healthy competition. The framework must also facilitate affordable universal services and access to basic value added services through the establishment of conditions for an investor friendly communications environment. Security of networks is also a major area of concern for the development of a digital economy. Information systems carry data of great value to government, businesses and individuals, the transmission of which involves security risks. Fraud conducted on such systems undermines consumer confidence in online services. Increased protection of the networks and the information systems is therefore necessary to guard against various attacks and unauthorised access. 7-1 Developing the national ICT legal framework The ICT sector is primarily subject to the Telecommunications Act 2006. The Government considers the following objectives as key to the establishment of a comprehensive legal framework in Sierra Leone over the next 3 years: a. The immediate amendment to the Telecommunications Act 2006. This shall take into consideration the regional harmonisation laws on ICT (ECOWAS Supplementary Acts), sector convergence and also provide interim provisions for the laws being prepared in accordance with the objective numbered 4(four) below. b. The Law Review Commission to review all laws with a view to ensuring that they reflect the existence of ICT considerations where required. c. The Ministry of Labour to determine a suitable labour regulation for ICT employees with a view to ensuring middle to senior management training of nationals, the retention of skilled ICT nationals at all levels and the attraction of skilled nationals from the Diaspora. d. The enactment of laws providing for: o the collection of biometric data (general public and visitors) and comprehensive digitalization of databases at the Police and Immigration Departments; o data protection, privacy; o tele-medicine; ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Page 39 / 63 o electronic transactions (e.g. e-commerce and transactions between the Government and other governments, between the Government and business institutions, between the Government and consumers and among Consumers); o intellectual property and copyright especially for print and electronic media; o the establishment of the Centre for Intelligence (CII). 7-2 Establishing a national security framework The establishment of a security framework is a key priority of the Government in order to ensure that the development of ICTs occurs within an e-environment that is properly monitored and safe to all users, irrespective of social class, economic class and nationality. In this regard, the Government has determined the need for a centre for intelligence gathering that shall be tasked with developing intelligence in ICT use, security and development in line with the legal framework referred to above. 7-2-1 Establishing the Centre for ICT Intelligence The Government shall establish the Centre for ICT Intelligence as an independent and autonomous body responsible for collating, organising and processing ICT information relevant to security matters on the use of ICT in the public/private spheres of Sierra Leone. The functions of the CII shall include: o To identify threats to national ICT networks; o To analyze e-security risks; o To undertake intelligence gathering; o To develop and to review adequate security software and privacy enhancing technologies (PETs); o To develop and review security/encryption tools to combat piracy and provide e-related defences for indigenous work (e.g. music, film, print media); o In collaboration with NATCOM and the Standards Bureau, to monitor the importation of all electronic equipments; o To establish a national ICT skills database (and from which employees of the CII shall be chosen); o To develop a section of CII that shall be tasked with the development of ICT courses for National Forces at all levels (including the top level National Security Council); o To liaise with NATCOM on developing local content regulation on security issues; o To collaborate with the universities on developing appropriate national security systems (e.g. solar CCTV cameras). o To develop ICT expertise to address security issues in key sectors/key issues of concern including: · Protection of children (trafficking, pornography, paedophilia etc.) ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Page 40 / 63 · Town/City centre monitoring · Fisheries and Marine Resources · Tourism · Mining areas · Education · Civil Aviation · Terrorism · Financial sector technologies · Money laundering · Anti-corruption Additionally, the CII shall: o be empowered to grant powers of access to the national security forces for quick and swift action wherein a security risk arises; o be solely funded by the Government (and indigenous private sector) and only employ trained nationals. o collaborate with Sierra Leone’s Embassies and Consular services for its information gathering activities. 7-3 Implementing the legal and security framework The Government considers the establishment of the legal and security framework as of the highest priority and first on the list of implementation activities. In particular, the establishment of the CII shall require a national effort on the part of all national stakeholders. The implementation plan to be developed for the establishment of the CII shall take into consideration various funding options that will ensure national ownership and the long-term sustainability of the CII. A key component shall be the training and retention of CII staff; supported by a comprehensive employment package. ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Page 41 / 63 SECTION C 8 IMPLEMENTATION PLANS OF THE ICT POLICY The carrying out of this Policy relies on the preparation of ten comprehensive plans that will be focused on the implementation of the priority activities tabled under Section B (5-1 to 5- 11). The ten Implementation Plans will be completed by December 2009, prepared by the Policy Unit established by MIC in collaboration with NATCOM. The National ICT Advisory Council shall supervise the preparation of the ten plans and oversee their timely implementation in partnership with the stakeholders identified as Accountable Stakeholders for the priority activities (see 5-1 to 5-11). Below are the ten Implementation Plans: SN Implementation Plan PLAN I To amend the current legal and regulatory framework to reflect industry and regulatory convergence; PLAN II To establish the Centre for ICT Intelligence (CII); PLAN III To improve Internet connectivity; PLAN IV To expand and improve fixed and mobile access networks; PLAN V To develop services and applications by local suppliers; PLAN VI To build capacity and develop national ICT skills; PLAN VII To develop appropriate ICT services for the marginalised/disadvantaged (e.g. the physically challenged); PLAN VIII To develop and use Geo-information to better know the ICT market; PLAN IX To promote private and community resource centres for affordable universal access/service; PLAN X To set up a national information system with relevant ICT indicators and to annually conduct E-readiness surveys. 8-1 To amend the legal and regulatory framework The objective of this implementation plan is to have a regulatory framework for technology convergence and that enables efficient operators and service providers to enter the market and to offer innovative services as affordable as possible for the benefit of the country: ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Page 42 / 63 · To review and amend the Telecommunications Act 2006 to comply with the recommendations of the ECOWAS Supplementary Acts of January 2007. · To enact a unified licensing regime and to enforce it as soon as possible. · To avoid any abuse by a dominant stakeholder and ensure a level playing field in the ICT market. · To promote affordable universal access with appropriate obligations for the licensed operators and service providers. 8-2 To establish the Centre for ICT Intelligence (CII) In line with paragraph 7-2-1, the objective of this implementation plan is to determine the structure, funding and appropriate law establishing the CII as an independent and autonomous body, that shall be responsible for collating, organising and processing ICT information relevant to e-security matters on the use of ICTs in the public/private spheres of Sierra Leone. The functions of the CII shall include identifying threats to national ICT networks, analysis of e-security risks, intelligence gathering, developing and reviewing security software, privacy enhancing technologies (PETs), anti-piracy security/encryption tools for music, film and print media. The CII shall establish a national ICT skills database (and from which employees of the CII shall be chosen) and develop a Unit that shall be tasked with the development of special ICT courses for National Forces at all levels (including the top level National Security Council). 8-3 To improve Internet connectivity The Government considers broadband access a basic necessity for Sierra Leoneans. This implementation plan shall have the following objectives: · To ensure broadband Internet access at reduced and affordable cost for the end users by: o enabling the landing of submarine fibre optic cable and emerging technologies linking Sierra Leone to the rest of the world, and o ensuring that international voice or data traffic has redundant paths that are not provided by the same vendor. · To rapidly extend the scope and traffic carrying capacity of the current international gateway and to improve quality of service. · To liberalise the international gateways with a limited number of alternative gateways. · To build up a fibre optic MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) with appropriate rings to offer a reliable broadband access to all categories of users: wholesale business with ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Page 43 / 63 GSM operators, corporate business with ISP, ASP, large enterprises and administrations. · To build up fibre optic links between the capital and all the main cities of Sierra Leone to allow broadband access to the rest of the country. · To upgrade the IXP (Internet Exchange Point) to establish a shared network. 8-4 To expand fixed and mobile access networks in remote areas The objective of this implementation plan is to ensure the expansion and upgrading of the national telecommunications infrastructures across the country. The priority of NATCOM is for mobile operators to extend and improve their networks in the provinces with better coordination and sharing of infrastructure. The Government considers that IP-based networks that merge voice telephony with data and image can offer a lot of business opportunities to operators and consumers. NATCOM shall encourage operators to consider the progressive migration of traditional networks (PSTN and GSM) to an all-IP network in their medium and long-term strategies. IP-based networks will facilitate the provision of innovative services and applications. For new entrants, the cost of building or leasing IP networks/links will be significantly lower than those of circuit-switched networks. NATCOM shall encourage 3G wireless technologies to boost the market for wireless communications. Some initiatives are opening the door for an emerging wireless Internet market even as broadband 3G becomes commercially available. Other network wireless high-speed data technologies are being developed and tested. The entry of WiMax shall be particularly encouraged. 8-5 To develop services and applications by local suppliers This implementation plan aims at delivering a complete range of affordable services and applications to satisfy different categories of ICT users, and to emphasize the production of local content. In this regard, Government shall: Ø Support the development and implementation of ICT services and sectoral applications (e-governance, e-commerce, e-learning, e-health, etc.). Ø Facilitate the development of the local ICT industry. Computer and Accessory costs The Government shall seek to establish a zero tariff on computers and computer accessories. Cybercafés and community resource centres are to be supported to facilitate the usage of nomadic users and other persons who cannot afford computers at home or for their small business. Local Content The Government is keen to ensure the indigenous development of Sierra Leonean content on the Internet. Local service provision currently gives preference to international content and little is available on Sierra Leone culture. Using various forms of Mass Media, it is ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Page 44 / 63 anticipated that through the development of ICTs, Sierra Leoneans shall have a prominent voice in the determination of their own image. 8-6 To build capacity and develop national ICT skills The objective of this implementation plan is to improve the skills required in an information- based society at different levels: Ø High level skills for advanced specialists needed for developing, implementing and operating the hardware and software systems and the security framework. Ø Suitable skills for intensive users of specific services and applications. Ø Knowledge on the basic and cross-sectoral tools (office automation, computer use, mailing, Internet browsing) for all potential ICT users. Ø Basic computer literacy for the population. 8-7 ICT services and skills for the marginalised/disadvantaged ICT can play a critical role in improving the quality of life of Sierra Leoneans especially those considered to be marginalised and disadvantaged (e.g. the physically and mentally challenged). This plan shall: Ø Ensure a training program that equips physically and mentally challenged Sierra Leoneans across the country with basic ICT and work related skills. Ø Provide the physically and mentally challenged with work opportunities that allow them to use their new ICT skills. 8-8 Develop and Use Geo-information to better know the market Planning in general requires a referencing framework to integrate large numbers of different data. Although information can be presented via text, voice or statistical tables, some of these are more intelligently communicated with geo-information tools and techniques, such as Geographical Information Systems (GIS). This implementation plan shall therefore determine the development and use of geo-information as a useful ICT tool for socio- economic analysis of the ICT sector. 8-9 Affordable universal access/service The objective of this implementation plan is to provide communities with access to affordable ICT services. Universal Access/Service means affordable access to basic ICT services regardless of geographic location. This can only happen with the cooperation of all stakeholders. This implementation plan aims at increasing the use of ICT in poor and remote areas through individual access in households and small businesses, or collective access with private and community resource centres. ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Page 45 / 63 8-10 ICT and E-readiness Survey A national information system with relevant indicators shall be set up to monitor progress on the implementation of infrastructure and services. The system shall be implemented by MIC with support from the National ICT Advisory Council, NATCOM and Statistics Sierra Leone. The indicators shall be culled from the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development.1 Surveys on E-readiness An e-readiness survey is a useful tool in determining a country’s position in terms of ICT and it serves as an initial phase of any national ICT strategic planning process. This survey shall be conducted annually by NATCOM in collaboration with Statistics Sierra Leone. The results of the survey shall provide a scorecard for all stakeholders. The indicators to be used in the surveys shall be consistent with the list of indicators provided by the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development. 9 CONCLUSION The Sierra Leone Government, private sector and civil society members recognize the potential offered by ICT in overcoming structural and historical weaknesses inherent in the country and affecting its overall development. The statements and targets in this document are therefore to accelerate a new phase in the economic growth and social development of Sierra Leone. Above all, they pave the way for the transformation of Government’s administrative processes, its communication with citizens, management of public services, education, citizen participation and commerce and all other aspects of the e-lives of Sierra Leoneans. “If the world is serious about achieving the Millennium Development Goal of halving the number of people living in extreme poverty by the year 2015, ICT must figure prominently in the effort. Everyone – governments, civil society, and private sector businesses – has a vital stake in fostering digital opportunity and putting ICT at the service of development.”2 Kofi Annan, (Ex) UN Secretary-General 1 The Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development is an international, multi-stakeholder initiative launched in 2004 to improve the availability and quality of ICT data and indicators, particularly in developing countries. See: D/ict/partnership. 2 Kofi Annan, (Ex) UN Secretary-General - Extract from the foreword of the UNCTAD E-Commerce and Development Report 2003.

ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Page 62 / 63 ANNEXE C. – GEO-INFORMATION C1 Introduction Geospatial Information (GI), also referred to as geographic information, geo-information, spatial data or geospatial data, identifies the geographic location and characteristics of natural or man-made features and boundaries, in, on or above the earth. A map is a typical example of GI. A GI characteristically has two main components, namely location information and attributes information. GI also describes the situation and characteristics of a country in terms of coordinates, place names, postal addresses and other criteria. In today's modern society of administration, economy, and science as well as in the private sector, GI is the basis for processes, planning, measures and decision-making. GI has become essential to most areas of human economic and social activity including environmental protection, agriculture, fisheries, mineral resources, computer science and telecommunications, education, culture, insurance and health care, national defence, home security, civil protection and disaster control, logistics and waste management etc. The growing realisation of the immense importance of GI to economic planning and development in recent decades has led to the emergence of a myriad of geospatial data providers, coming from various agencies of government and the private sector and mostly still acquiring and storing data in analogue formats. Uncoordinated efforts in GI data collection and use of obsolete procedures can result in overlaps and duplication. A national policy is therefore necessary for regulating, coordinating and mandating data production, access, sharing, exchange and quality. In order to realise the enormous economic benefits of GI, Sierra Leone requires a National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) to provide easy access to national geospatial data (instead of data kept manually in shelves or drawers) and to mainstream the use of GI into the Government’s decision making process. C2 Issues a. Inadequate core geographical data sets and thematic data sets, and the lack of a national geographic information strategy. b. MDAs slow to adopt contemporary technology for resource and environmental data acquisition, analysis and management. c. The organizations that were established to acquire and provide core fundamental data have largely been unable to meet the data demands. C3 Objectives a. Conduct a multidisciplinary assessment of the status of GI in Sierra Leone. b. Introduce the use of modern equipment (Satellite images and GPS technology) to capture spatial data and the use of modern GIS tools to produce more accurate maps for planning. ICT Policy of Sierra Leone Page 63 / 63 c. Develop a national geospatial data infrastructure that is capable of adequately supporting the economic and developmental needs of the country. C4 Targets a. A national catalogue of available geo-information datasets and related metadata developed as a result of a full assessment of the status of GI in Sierra Leone, by December 2009. b. Establishment of a sub-committee responsible for the coordination and planning of a national geospatial data infrastructure initiative by September 2009. c. Department of Lands and Surveys capacitated, through intensified training, in applying modern GPS and GIS tools and techniques to collect land related information and to produce corresponding maps accurately and speedily, by September 2014. d. A national spatial referencing network re-established based on Permanent GPS Base Stations by January 2010. Acknowledgements Abbreviations NATIONAL ICT VISION 1.

The digital divide is often associated with the resulting gap in terms of  socio-economic development.   E-Commerce / Electronic Commerce/Electronic transactions – Business activities involving  consumers, manufacturers, suppliers, service providers and intermediaries using electronic  medium.   Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) – Information and Communication  Technologies (ICTs) is a concept related to the convergence of Information Technology,  telecommunications, broadcasting and multimedia. ICT is an environment enabling the  development of physical infrastructure, hardware equipment and software systems used for  the processing, the storing and the transmission of information.   Information Society (IS) – A country or region where information technology has been fully  exploited and is part of everyday life as an enabler of information sharing, communication  and diffusion.   Information Technology (IT) – Embraces the use of computers, telecommunications and  office systems technologies for the collection, processing, storing, packaging and  dissemination of information.   Internet Exchange Point (IXP) – It is a “peering point” for interconnecting ISPs and/or other  IXPs for the purpose of localizing national traffic routing as opposed to using international  routes to accomplish inter-ISP traffic flow.   Internet Service Provider (ISP) – Also known as Internet Access Providers, an ISP is a  company that provides infrastructure for access to the Internet or for interconnecting other  ISPs and content-based or application-based services on the Internet.   Knowledge Based Economy (KBE) – A country or region where ICT is extensively used to  enhance knowledge so that higher human capital brings further improvement to the  economy.   Local Area Network (LAN) – A computer network that spans a relatively small area. Most  LANs are confined to a single building or group of buildings. However, one LAN can be  connected to other LANs over any distance via telephone lines and radio waves.   Teledensity - The number of telephones per 100 people in a region.   Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) – Also known as Voice over Internet, IP Telephony or  Internet Telephony – refers to telephone services provided over the Internet as the  transmission medium.   Wide Area Network (WAN) – A computer network that spans a relatively large geographical  area. Typically, a WAN consists of two or more local area networks (LANs). Computers  connected to a wide area network are often connected through public networks, such as the  telephone system. They can also be connected through leased lines or satellites. The largest  WAN in existence is the Internet.     ICT Policy of Sierra Leone    Page 10 / 63   NATIONAL ICT VISION   ‘To develop into a knowledge-based information society with a vibrant ICT sector as  the engine of sustainable socio-economic development.’      1.  INTRODUCTION   1-1  The ICT Policy of Sierra Leone   Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) play a vital role today in facilitating the  attainment of development goals of any nation. Over the last few years, many African  countries have taken advantage of the opportunities provided by ICTs and have put in place  ICT-enabled implementation plans to support their socio-economic development efforts.  These country-successes have been made possible due to the combined efforts of all  stakeholders and with support from regional and international organizations as well as  bilateral partners and the private sector.    Regionally, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) developed a  harmonised policy for ICT in the West African region. The 15-Member States of ECOWAS  recognising the importance of formulating an ICT policy, adopted on 19 January 2007 in  Ouagadougou, the Supplementary Act A/SA1/01/07 entitled the ‘Harmonization of Policies  and of the Regulatory Framework for Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)’.  This Supplementary Act is a supplemental provision to the Revised ECOWAS Treaty of 1993  and provides guidance on the structure and contents of an ICT Policy for adoption by all  Member States.    This policy document is therefore in line with the ECOWAS ICT policy as it attempts to map  the ways in which ICTs can be used to achieve the basic development objectives of Sierra  Leone. Using the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, Vision 2025, and the Millennium  Development Goals as a baseline for analysis, the policy links the application of ICT to  national development goals identified under specific areas or ‘pillars’ with a series of ICT- specific objectives and targets for measuring progress over a 5-year implementation  timeline.    The development of this policy is the result of the consultative approach of the National ICT  Task Force (NICTTF). Its policy work programme included:   · a 2009 e-readiness survey;    · industry consultations to obtain key issues, objectives, targets and challenges;   · review of the draft policy over a two-day national workshop of stakeholders; and   · a two-day  stakeholders retreat to finalise the draft policy and incorporate the results  from the national workshop.     ICT Policy of Sierra Leone    Page 11 / 63   1-2 General Purpose    The general purpose of this National ICT Policy is to provide best practice guidance in the  creation of an enabling environment for ICT development by:   · Giving guidelines about the evolution of the legal framework to take into account the  convergence of sectors and the convergence of technologies.   · Defining the role of the national institutions and industry stakeholders in the new  environment: policy maker, regulator, National ICT Advisory Council, private sector,  Diaspora.   · Stimulating a participative approach for the preparation and the implementation of  the ICT Policy.   · Ensuring a common understanding about the role of each type of stakeholder and  key issues raised in the ICT sector.   · Developing culturally specific contents and applications and to highlight the  importance of local contents and local focus.   · Promoting universal access/service.      1-3 STRUCTURE OF THE POLICY    This Policy has been structured into three Sections as follows:      1. Section A -provides the objectives of the policy (2-1 to 2-3), background information (3-1  to 3-5) and the current status of the ICT sector in Sierra Leone (4-1 to 4-6);   2. Section B - summarises the key socio-economic issues identified by the Government and  the preferred ICT solutions (see 5-1 to 5-11) as well as deadlines within which  to address them (5-12). It also summarises plans for strengthening the key  stakeholders tasked with oversight responsibility for the implementation of the  policy (6-1 to 6-6) and the supporting legal and security framework required (7- 1 to 7-3); and   3. Section C - details the ten implementation plans required for the carrying out of this policy  (8-1 to 8-10) and the summary conclusion (9).      Additional annexes are provided for further detail and clarification (A, B, C).         ICT Policy of Sierra Leone    Page 12 / 63   SECTION A   2 OBJECTIVES IN DEVELOPING AN ICT POLICY   The following political, economic and social objectives have been identified as the key  objectives of the Government of Sierra Leone in its formulation of this policy:    2-1 Political objectives of the ICT policy   · To enhance better transparency and facilitate communication with citizens through  E-governance;   · To integrate Sierra Leone regionally and globally through the use of ICTs;   · To re-brand the image of Sierra Leone by providing information on progress and  achievements in Sierra Leone and to promote the distribution of culturally sensitive  materials through various ICT channels;   · To comply with the provisions of ECOWAS and the World Trade Organisation (WTO)  General Agreement on Trade and Services.   2-2 Economic objectives of the ICT policy   · To improve efficiency in the public sector through effective use of ICT infrastructure,  applications and services;   · To enhance competitiveness in the private sector;    · To enable global economic integration;   · To create new opportunities for Sierra Leoneans to become ICT citizens equipped to  take advantage of a knowledge-based economy;   · To encourage the transition of the informal market to the formal market through ICT  tools;   · To promote and support indigenous and foreign entrepreneurship in Sierra Leone;   · To enable growth in key areas such as Agriculture, Tourism, Mineral Resources, and  Infrastructure development.    2-3 Social objectives of the ICT policy   · To improve the basic living standard of Sierra Leoneans;    · To facilitate and support the universal freedom of affordable access to information;     · To identify and implement all relevant procedures related to cyber security,  electronic security and data protection to protect ICT users;     ICT Policy of Sierra Leone    Page 13 / 63   · To improve the education system through e-learning;   · To provide better assistance in the health sector through e-medicine;   · To promote and sustain the national culture and tradition through e-learning and  local content application/software development;   · To reduce poverty by improving free flow of business opportunity based information  to underprivileged areas and facilitating the growth of small businesses through  innovative solutions;   · To engage the Diaspora in the development of Sierra Leone through e-interaction;   · To use ICT tools to bridge the illiteracy divide;   · To subsidize access for high-speed Internet subscribers in schools and national  education institutions.   3 BACKGROUND INFORMATION   3-1 General Summary   According to the 2003 World Telecommunication Development Report, almost half of the  workforce in developed countries will be employed by industries that are either producers  or intensive users of ICT products and services. In the case of sub-Saharan Africa, the  average teledensity is two lines per 100 inhabitants and only 0.6 percent of Internet users  worldwide are on the African continent. Despite the growth of mobile telephones, Sierra  Leone is ranked as one of the least connected countries (170th out of 178 economies) on the  Digital Access Index (DAI) (with an index of 0.10), which measures the overall ability of  citizens to access and use ICTs.   3-2 Post-conflict context    Since the formal conclusion of the war in 2002, Sierra Leone has re-established security and  the country’s economic growth rate has jumped to a healthy 7.4 percent. This growth, while  positive, is more reflective of the fact that economic activity was halted during the war and  current economic activity has been heavily reliant on donor contributions.   Notably, a consequence of the war resulted in the missed opportunity of Sierra Leone  obtaining fibre optic landing from the main SAT 3 connection along the coast of West Africa.  This missed opportunity has meant that Sierra Leone relies on satellites as its primary access  medium for wireless technology, resulting in high costs and insufficient access and  distribution.   On a positive note, the need to communicate, bolstered initially by very low licensing fees  and the lack of a central regulator has resulted in the significant growth of mobile telephone  operators in the market. Nonetheless, despite such growth, penetration levels remain low,  with much market opportunity remaining, especially in the area of rural telephony.      ICT Policy of Sierra Leone    Page 14 / 63   As evidenced by the e-readiness survey results, access to the Internet, remains particularly  low. Outside of the capital city, there are few access points and even in academia, students  rarely have access to computers.   In respect of re-branding the national image of Sierra Leone, the lack of positive content and  culturally sensitive information have permitted negative foreign connotations on the  national image, many of which are related to the concluded war such as seen in the film  Blood Diamonds.    3-3 Key Strategic Issues from the Vision 2025   The Vision 2025 for Sierra Leone embodies the aspirations of Sierra Leoneans for the year  2025. This shared national vision is expressed as follows: “UNITED PEOPLE, PROGRESSIVE  NATION, ATTRACTIVE COUNTRY”. It also identifies six strategic issues that must be  confronted to attain the national vision by 2025.       Table 3: Key Strategic Issues for Attainment of National Vision   1. How to attain a competitive private sector-led economy with  effective indigenous participation;    2. How to create a high quality of life for all Sierra Leoneans;    3. How to build a well educated and enlightened society;    4. How to create a tolerant, stable, secure and well managed  society based on democratic values;    5. How to ensure sustainable exploitation and effective utilization  of our natural resources, while maintaining a healthy  environment;    6. How to become a science and technology driven nation.      Section six of the Vision 2025 Plan references technology with the following specific  objectives:   · Encourage and improve the teaching of science and technology at all levels of  education;    · Improve science and technology to increase productivity in all sectors of the  economy, including the informal sector; and   · Improve the use of science and technology to facilitate decision-making at all levels  of society.   3-4 The SL-PRSP II (Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper)   The Government of Sierra Leone in its second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper has  identified four strategic priorities for national development:     ICT Policy of Sierra Leone    Page 15 / 63   · reliable power supply;   · a pro-poor growth perspective in agriculture and fisheries;   · a national transportation network to enable the movement of goods and people and  thereby facilitate increased investment and economic activity;   · sustainable human development through the provision of improved social services.   3-5 The Millennium Development Goals   The table below details the strategic role of ICT in the attainment of the PRSP Pillars and the  Millennium Development Goals (MDG’s):      SL-PRSP I & II Pillars MDGs Contribution of ICTs      Pillar 1:Good governance,  security and peace building       Goal 8: Develop a global partnership for  development:   Target 12: Develop an open, rule-based  predictable, non-discriminatory trading and  financial system (…).        · Enhance efficiency of markets  and financial systems;     · Link local markets and financial  systems to global networks;     · Promote the use of   internationally accepted  standards and practices.

Seasonal capitalization has come  largely as a result of donor-based initiatives and these have supported the growth of ICT  firms.  The recent explosion of new banks and the installations of the local and wide area  networks are another case of the seasonal growth trend. The rapid growth seen in the  mobile telecoms market has done much to connect the capital Freetown to the provincial  towns. A number of ICT firms and individuals have also implemented modern ICT  technologies to conduct their businesses.     A notable sector trend is the growth projection of the number of Internet users in Sierra  Leone, which could reach a quarter of a million by 2010 and exceed one million by 2015.  Further growth would depend on an improvement of the country’s low literacy rate  (currently circa 35%).    Another trend that contributes to the growth of Internet usage is the rising number of  Internet cafés accounting for the majority of Internet users (up to 80%). Telecentres and  Internet cafés provide Internet access for the general public as well as low cost international  phone calls using VoIP.    The Government is keen to see the entry of new technologies in the ICT market. The  example of WiMax technology will ultimately offer mobility, wireless broadband capability  and lower base cost in urban areas.      ICT Policy of Sierra Leone    Page 17 / 63   The use of geo tools is also a priority, particularly for the collation of data necessary for the  development of appropriate national policies. Annex C provides further information on the  key application of geo-information in economic planning.      4-1-2 Sector Challenges   One of the biggest constraints to the expansion of the telecommunications infrastructure in  Sierra Leone (outside of the capital and a few main cities), is the limited extent of the  electricity grid, which has yet to reach many of the provincial areas. These areas typically  lack electricity or fixed phone service and are completely unconnected with the rest of the  country. Even in the main cities, the provision of Internet bandwidth is limited, expensive  and largely unavailable. These are all significant constraints to investment promotion in the  ICT sector.   In addition, the public telephone network is largely circuit-switched as opposed to packet- switched and relies heavily on copper wire rather than fibre optics. The limited  infrastructure makes congestion management difficult since Internet traffic shares the same  network as voice traffic.    Furthermore, most of the available ISP providers concentrate their wireless broadband  services in the greater Freetown area and only expensive VSAT services are available in the  other major cities (VSAT bandwidth fees can range from US$500 to US$15,000 per month).    4-1-3 ICT for Basic Infrastructure Management and Operations   Currently, basic infrastructure systems are poorly managed and maintained due in part to  ineffective information communication systems. Basic infrastructure systems include water  supply, electricity supply, sewage, solid waste collection, right-of-ways, communication  networks and land use. Recent and projected investments in such infrastructure involve the  introduction of prepaid services inclusive of monitoring and payment systems. These prepaid  service operations rely on ICT devices at the client’s premises and community distribution  hubs that are connected offline and online to databases at the responsible agency.   Effective management of the basic infrastructure operations will depend on the collection,  transmission and analysis of demand and supply information between client and responsible  agency.   This policy therefore envisions the introduction and customization of reliable ICT devices  that are appropriate for the delivery services mentioned above. Coordination in ICT  infrastructure development is also considered paramount to achieving national backbone  networks that can carry data, voice and video, as would be employed in effective  management and operations of basic infrastructure.     ICT Policy of Sierra Leone    Page 18 / 63   4-2 The Current Institutional Structures   4-2-1 The Ministry of Information and Communications   The Ministry of Information and Communications is the primary stakeholder of ICT related  policies and is tasked with overseeing the development, review and implementation of the  Government’s information and communication agenda. The Ministry has mandated the  preparation of this ICT Policy document and will be responsible for its regular review and  update.   4-2-2 The Regulatory Authority, NATCOM   The Telecommunications Act 2006 established the National Telecommunications  Commission (NATCOM) to provide for the licensing and regulation of telecommunications  operators and for the promotion of universal access to basic telecommunications services. It  is also tasked with ensuring fair competition for the benefit of investors and users of  telecommunications networks and services and to improve the national, regional and global  integration of Sierra Leone in telecommunications.   4-2-3 The National ICT Task Force    The National ICT Task Force was established by the Government to provide strategic  recommendations on the enabling policies for the ICT sector and the necessary institutional  framework to result in a more effective, efficient and harmonized sector.     4.3   Current ICT Infrastructure and Network Operators   4-3-1 Introduction   The country's traditional telecommunications infrastructure suffered during the war but the  mobile sector has experienced excellent growth with four GSM networks currently  competing for customers. Wireless broadband service providers have been providing  Internet access and VoIP Internet telephony. However, penetration rates in all market  segments are still very low, leaving ample potential for future growth.    4-3-2 Incumbent Fixed Line Operator   SierraTel (Sierra Leone Telecommunications Company), is 100% Government owned. It  provides fixed-line, international and Internet services.    The company lost its dominance with the arrival of the mobile network operators but has  made significant effort to rehabilitate and reinstate the telecom network after the war and  to modernise and expand its outdated equipment.    The installed capacity of the PSTN fixed line network is 250,000 (as at 2004) but with only  25,000 active fixed lines (as at end 2008). The fixed-line teledensity is currently 0.4%. Its  copper lines are in a very poor condition and are consequently not eligible for ADSL.  SierraTel has plans to rehabilitate, upgrade and expand its PSTN services. Recently it has  complemented the PSTN services using the CDMA wireless technologies to deliver both  voice and data (Internet services).      ICT Policy of Sierra Leone    Page 19 / 63   In the near future, SierraTel plans to provide fibre optic connectivity within the Freetown  municipality junction network. The diagram below shows the network fibre ducts (in blue)  required.         4-3-3 International Gateway   Sierra Leone is connected to the rest of the world via an Intelsat (Atlantic Ocean) satellite  Earth station that is operated by SierraTel. SierraTel currently solely manages the  international gateway according to a two years statutory right. This mandate expired in  August 2008, and the national regulator (NATCOM) is set to review the exclusivity status.  However, efforts are being made to facilitate submarine optical fibre landing and several  applications have been received from prospective providers. The process of approving  landing rights is currently underway.   It is believed that the cost of international communications will be drastically reduced if  Sierra Leone acquires fibre landing in the nearest future.   4-3-4 GSM Mobiles Operators and Frequency Spectrum Usage   · They are four active mobile operators:   Mobile Network Technology & Frequency   Africell / Lintel GSM 900 & 1800   Zain (ex-Celtel) GSM 900 & 1800   Comium GSM 900 & 1800   Tigo / Millicom GSM 900 & 1800   (SierraTel operates on a CDMA 850 frequency.)   The combined total Mobile Subscriber base is approximately:   - 1,200,000 (with 72% annual growth rate) in June 2007; and   - 1,545,000 (with 39% annual growth rate) in 4th quarter 2008.   The Mobile Penetration is 25% by June 2008; and the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) is  $8.00.        ICT Policy of Sierra Leone    Page 20 / 63   · IMT - 2000   400 MHz band (FWA Broadband Internet).   · Unlicensed Spectrum   The unlicensed spectrum (2.4GHz/5.8GHz) is partly regulated by NATCOM the regulator and  is subject to interference due to use by other wireless ISPs. This in some cases has resulted in  the degradation of the quality of service provided.   4.4 Current ICT Services   4-4-1 Available Services   · Fixed and Wireless Telephony (post-paid and prepaid).   · Broadband Internet Services ranging from 64 kbps to 1Mbps are available for homes,  small and medium sized enterprises, small office/home office and corporate entities;  Audio/Video streaming (music download) and Virtual Private Networking (VPN) for  Closed User Groups like Business Entities are also provided on the market.   4-4-2 Internet penetration   · Dial-up ISP (PSTN) with 150-200 subscribers;   · Internet Users (excluding mobile Internet users) 16,000; and    · Internet Penetration 0.27%   4-4-3 Broadband ISPs    · PCS Holdings (SL) Limited brand named IpTel   · Afcom (SL) Limited   · LimeLine (SL) Limited   · Fidelity Global FGC   · Multinet   · Zain   · Atlas Communications   · Ambitel   · Intergroup Telecommunications   · Rawabi Dubai Company   · Equatorial Communications   · Tigo   · icom.net (an ISP subsidiary of Comium)   Current total Investment in Broadband Internet Business is estimated to be $7 Million.     ICT Policy of Sierra Leone    Page 21 / 63   4-4-4 Telecoms Market    In 2008, the total revenue generated by the voice telephony market in Sierra Leone was  estimated to be $176 million. Indeed, the demand in the voice market has been growing at a  rate of 72% while that of the Internet lags behind at 15%.    The trend in the voice market in Sierra Leone is moving from the traditional voice telephony  model to the rich voice (Interactive voice response, ring tone download and audio  streaming) model. As for Internet services, there is an ever-growing demand for higher  Internet bandwidth for data-intensive services. Many financial institutions are rolling out  products requiring higher bandwidth for data services.    4-5 The Postal Sector    The Postal Sector has been beset by several problems in the past decade. The use of postal  services has reduced drastically, due in part to the emergence of Internet and web  technologies, and also due to general loss of confidence in the services. These problems  have been exacerbated by poor infrastructure and inadequate finances to improve and  expand the sector.   Nonetheless, the Government is committed to developing a vibrant and efficient postal  sector to effectively meet present and future needs. In particular, the Government plans to  liberalize the fast mail and courier service segment of the sector in which the private sector  has continued to play an important role.    Additionally all post offices will be required to adhere to minimum service standards against  which performance will be monitored. The Universal Service Provider will provide exclusive  services such as delivery of printed materials and packages weighing up to 350 grams and  the issuing of stamps. The non-exclusive market segments will consist of Courier and Parcel  Services, Marketing Services, Postal Financial Services, and Agency services with other  sectors.   The Government recognises the key role of the postal sector to the development of ICTs in  Sierra Leone as the incumbent operator, SALPOST is equipped with infrastructure and  premises spanning the entire country. The Government is also mindful of the need to  converge regulation as technology converges across the postal, telecoms and media sectors.   An overview of the strategic considerations on the Postal Sector is located in Annexe B.   4.6 Broadcast Media and regulating converged technology   Broadcast media have emerged as one of the most powerful communication tools in the  21st century thus revolutionising the way in which individuals and societies interact. A series  of reforms have been undertaken in the broadcasting sub-sector to ensure that it becomes  competitive and serves the growing needs of the people. Consequently, over 40 radio and  two TV stations are operational in Sierra Leone.     ICT Policy of Sierra Leone    Page 22 / 63   An aim of this policy is the provision of a rational and comprehensive framework to govern  the establishment, ownership, control, management and delivery of information,  entertainment and educational services to Sierra Leoneans. This can be achieved through  the provision of an efficient and reliable broadcasting.    The case for reform is particularly strong in the music and film industry where rampant  piracy has affected the growth and development of local music and film talent/work. It is  certain that the development of Internet will result in further damage if an adequate legal  framework is not established. Through the establishment of a supportive legal framework,  this policy provides for the enactment of Intellectual Property and Copyright laws and for the  development of music and film security/encryption tools by the Centre for ICT Intelligence  (CII).   Digital technology has however brought about the convergence of computer (IT) and  communications (together referred as ICT), and permeated into media (Print & Electronic  Media - broadcast) and entertainment (Games and IPTV), which has evolved into yet another  terminology, ICE (Information, Communication and Entertainment).    Additionally there has also been convergence of fixed and wireless communications with the  arrival of wireless terminal devices that have multi purposes e.g. a single device functioning  as a PDA, a cell phone, a TV receiver, providing wireless access to Internet etc.    In the area of regulation, there is currently a specific regulatory body for the media, the  Independent Media Commission, IMC. The Government is however fully aware that  technologies arriving in Sierra Leone will arrive in converged devices and that will cut across  telecoms and media services and even postal services.   In this regard, it is envisaged that there will be a merger of NATCOM and the IMC to regulate  the entire ICT sector. Moreover, this is a recognised principle of the ECOWAS  recommendations on legal framework formulation for the sector.     ICT Policy of Sierra Leone    Page 23 / 63   SECTION B   5 LINKAGE BETWEEN SOCIAL-ECONOMIC GROWTH AND ICT DEVELOPMENT   In this policy, the following eleven pillars have been identified as key to the socio-economic  development of Sierra Leone:   · Private Sector Business Activity   · Capacity Building and Human Resources in ICT   · Infrastructure   · Health   · Education   · Natural Resources and Environment   · Agriculture and Food Security   · Good Governance   · Gender, Youth and Social Services   · Media and Civil Society   · Tourism   These eleven pillars cover basic social, political and economic needs that have been  identified by the Government as areas in which ICT development can play a key role,  providing opportunities for further social growth and cohesion through ICT enabled  solutions.    Annex A1 provides the Government’s strategic policy considerations identified in relation to  the eleven pillars, listing the challenges, objectives and targeted solution to the issues  through the use of ICTs. From Annex A1 are culled the issues listed in the eleven tables  below that are considered to be of first and utmost priority in the implementation of this  policy. Also presented are the Government’s preferred ICT solutions, the key stakeholder(s)  tasked with oversight responsibility for implementation of the solutions and the PRSP (I&II)  and MDG references.  Following the tables is a Gantt timeline chart for the implementation  of the priority ICT solutions over a period of 5 years (2010-2014).    The Government anticipates a concerted and timely effort at implementation by the MDA’s  most closely linked to the solutions, the private sector, the donor community and the full  support of citizens both at home and in the Diaspora.

Given the nascent stage of the sector, regulation will be pro-growth and  development focused.   The Telecommunication Act 2006 (and its subsequent amendment) is the current legal  framework that governs the ICT sector. However, given the fact that ICT substantively  represents a broader domain than Telecommunications, it is necessary to further amend the  Telecommunications Act to reflect modern trends of convergence.     6-2 Developing the role of the ICT Committee of the Parliament   The role of Parliament is central for the enactment of all laws. In particular, the legal  framework required for the ICT sector cuts across other sectors especially in areas of  security and data protection. It is therefore important that the Parliamentary Committee on  ICTs be made familiar with ICT science and technology innovation, policy formulation,  planning and monitoring. This will ensure that key sector issues are properly understood in  legislation enactment and are properly communicated through the various parliamentary  constituency channels. Additional objectives for the development of the ICT Committee’s  role include:   · To expose the committee to regional and international instruments governing the  development and implementation of emerging technologies;   · To periodically review the roles and strategies of the parliamentary ICT technology.      · To share and learn from various regional best practices;   · Employing ICT tools to manage the legislative process.   6-3 Developing the role of the Ministry    The Ministry shall be identified as being foremost in ICT. In order to ensure an effective  implementation of the ICT policy and to enable it to fulfil its obligations as defined in the  Telecommunications Act, the Ministry should facilitate the in-house training of personnel.   The Ministry shall review and make recommendations to the Public Sector Reform Unit  (PSRU) and HRMO on ICT entry requirements for prospective communication staff. It shall  also be strengthened to effectively carry out the following tasks:    · To monitor and review the implementation plans of this ICT policy;   · To set up and to regularly update a web site to publish all the texts and the events  related to the development of the ICT sector.     ICT Policy of Sierra Leone    Page 36 / 63   · To promote a participative approach with all the stakeholders of the ICT sector  through the establishment and supervision of the National ICT Advisory Council.   6-4 Developing the role of NATCOM   The role of NATCOM is principal in the implementation of this policy as it is tasked by law  with ICT regulation as well as the enablement of growth in the ICT sector. This is in line with  ECOWAS harmonisation principles but requires that NATCOM be adequately equipped with  qualified staff and appropriate modern regulatory equipments.  In particular, NATCOM must  secure ICT tools to monitor all operators and develop a national information system with all  pertinent statistics about the ICT sector. It must also undertake an annual ICT survey to  ensure its activities and regulations are tailored for sector growth/development.   6-5 Developing Statistics Sierra Leone   Statistics Sierra Leone (SSL), (formerly Central Statistics Office) established by statistics and  census Statistics Act 2002) serves as the central authority for the collection, processing,  analysis and dissemination of statistical information on socio-economic activities.   There is the need for SSL to employ more ICT tools in data collection surveys and in analysis  and dissemination of information. The website also needs to be updated to make it more  interactive and to provide intuitive navigation and search capabilities for easier access to  statistical data. Additionally, SSL also requires a research and development unit to ensure  continual growth in its core skills and areas of competence.    6-6 Developing Standards Bureau   The Standards Bureau has a key role in the development of the ICT sector. As the office  responsible for establishing standards in imported goods and equipments, the Bureau’s  human resource needs to be strengthened to be in a position to ensure that all imported  equipments meet international type approval standards. In the area of electronic  equipments, it is especially important that the Bureau must be able to adequately enforce  the type approval standards determined by NATCOM for all electronic equipments  (imported or otherwise) and to do so in collaboration with the Centre for ICT Intelligence  once it is established.   6-5 Setting up a National ICT Advisory Council    A National ICT Advisory Council shall be created by the Government on the  recommendations of the Ministry of Information and Communications to ensure a  participatory approach for the development of the ICT sector. The Council shall be tasked  with giving guidance to all stakeholders on sector related matters including the following:   · Formulating ICT objectives and implementation plans;   · Development of national ICT standards and guidelines;   · Coordination of national ICT initiatives and projects;     ICT Policy of Sierra Leone    Page 37 / 63   · Determining requisite ICT support services to public and private sectors;    · Monitoring the implementation of policy plans and evaluating the results;   · Convergence of technologies.   This Council shall be a consultative body with membership comprising representatives of all  key stakeholders of the ICT sector such as policymakers, regulator, network operators,  service providers, universities, civil society, associations of consumers, private companies  and the Chamber of Commerce etc. Below is a diagram showing the position of the National  ICT Advisory Council in relation to some sector stakeholders.      THE NATIONAL ICT ADVISORY COUNCIL AND SECTOR STAKEHOLDERS         6-6 Improving the performances of Service Providers    The Government recognises the importance of service providers in the growth of the sector.  NATCOM shall therefore establish clearly defined operational standards including the service  level delivery to be met by all service providers and appropriate dispute resolution  mechanisms.    The Government shall foster an environment that promotes the full spectrum of financing  options for ICT development (e.g. angel investors, incubator funds, venture capital and  private equity investments) and promote the establishment of a technology incubator to  foster local innovation/development while encouraging the use of open source applications.   The Government shall also promote the use of locally developed applications by  implementing a “Computerize Sierra Leone Initiative” that provides incentives for the  provision of locally developed applications/solutions.     ICT Policy of Sierra Leone    Page 38 / 63   7 LEGAL AND SECURITY FRAMEWORK   The rapid changes in the communications sector have given rise to the need to create a  dynamic legal and regulatory framework that is responsive to technological changes and  advancement in the sector. In addition, the convergence between telecommunications,  broadcasting and information technologies must be reflected in a national legal and  regulatory regime. A key goal is to develop the sector within a legal framework that is open  and transparent in the application of its rules and regulations and that caters for and  promotes healthy competition. The framework must also facilitate affordable universal  services and access to basic value added services through the establishment of conditions  for an investor friendly communications environment.    Security of networks is also a major area of concern for the development of a digital  economy. Information systems carry data of great value to government, businesses and  individuals, the transmission of which involves security risks. Fraud conducted on such  systems undermines consumer confidence in online services. Increased protection of the  networks and the information systems is therefore necessary to guard against various  attacks and unauthorised access.    7-1 Developing the national ICT legal framework   The ICT sector is primarily subject to the Telecommunications Act 2006.    The Government considers the following objectives as key to the establishment of a  comprehensive legal framework in Sierra Leone over the next 3 years:     a. The immediate amendment to the Telecommunications Act 2006. This shall take into   consideration the regional harmonisation laws on ICT (ECOWAS Supplementary Acts),  sector convergence and also provide interim provisions for the laws being prepared  in accordance with the objective numbered 4(four) below.     b. The Law Review Commission to review all laws with a view to ensuring that they  reflect the existence of ICT considerations where required.     c. The Ministry of Labour to determine a suitable labour regulation for ICT employees  with a view to ensuring middle to senior management training of nationals, the  retention of skilled ICT nationals at all levels and the attraction of skilled nationals  from the Diaspora.     d. The enactment of laws providing for:     o the collection of biometric data (general public and visitors) and  comprehensive digitalization of databases at the Police and Immigration  Departments;   o data protection, privacy;  o tele-medicine;     ICT Policy of Sierra Leone    Page 39 / 63   o electronic transactions (e.g. e-commerce and transactions between the  Government and other governments, between the Government and business  institutions, between the Government and consumers and among  Consumers);   o intellectual property and copyright especially for print and electronic media;  o the establishment of the Centre for Intelligence (CII).   7-2 Establishing a national security framework   The establishment of a security framework is a key priority of the Government in order to  ensure that the development of ICTs occurs within an e-environment that is properly  monitored and safe to all users, irrespective of social class, economic class and nationality. In  this regard, the Government has determined the need for a centre for intelligence gathering  that shall be tasked with developing intelligence in ICT use, security and development in line  with the legal framework referred to above.    7-2-1 Establishing the Centre for ICT Intelligence   The Government shall establish the Centre for ICT Intelligence as an independent and  autonomous body responsible for collating, organising and processing ICT information  relevant to security matters on the use of ICT in the public/private spheres of Sierra Leone.      The functions of the CII shall include:   o To identify threats to national ICT networks;  o To analyze e-security risks;   o To undertake intelligence gathering;   o To develop and to review adequate security software and privacy   enhancing technologies (PETs);    o To develop and review security/encryption tools to combat piracy and   provide e-related defences for indigenous work (e.g. music, film, print  media);    o In collaboration with NATCOM and the Standards Bureau, to monitor the  importation of all electronic equipments;   o To establish a national ICT skills database (and from which employees of  the CII shall be chosen);   o To develop a section of CII that shall be tasked with the development of  ICT courses for National Forces at all levels (including the top level  National Security Council);   o To liaise with NATCOM on developing local content regulation on security  issues;   o To collaborate with the universities on developing appropriate national  security systems (e.g. solar CCTV cameras).   o To develop ICT expertise to address security issues in key sectors/key  issues of concern including:    · Protection of children (trafficking, pornography, paedophilia  etc.)     ICT Policy of Sierra Leone    Page 40 / 63   · Town/City centre monitoring  · Fisheries and Marine Resources  · Tourism  · Mining areas  · Education  · Civil Aviation  · Terrorism  · Financial sector technologies  · Money laundering  · Anti-corruption     Additionally, the CII shall:   o be empowered to grant powers of access to the national security forces  for quick and swift action wherein a security risk arises;   o be solely funded by the Government (and indigenous private sector) and  only employ trained nationals.   o collaborate with Sierra Leone’s Embassies and Consular services for its  information gathering activities.   7-3 Implementing the legal and security framework   The Government considers the establishment of the legal and security framework as of the  highest priority and first on the list of implementation activities. In particular, the  establishment of the CII shall require a national effort on the part of all national  stakeholders. The implementation plan to be developed for the establishment of the CII shall  take into consideration various funding options that will ensure national ownership and the  long-term sustainability of the CII. A key component shall be the training and retention of CII  staff; supported by a comprehensive employment package.       ICT Policy of Sierra Leone    Page 41 / 63   SECTION C   8 IMPLEMENTATION PLANS OF THE ICT POLICY   The carrying out of this Policy relies on the preparation of ten comprehensive plans that will  be focused on the implementation of the priority activities tabled under Section B (5-1 to 5- 11). The ten Implementation Plans will be completed by December 2009, prepared by the  Policy Unit established by MIC in collaboration with NATCOM. The National ICT Advisory  Council shall supervise the preparation of the ten plans and oversee their timely  implementation in partnership with the stakeholders identified as Accountable Stakeholders  for the priority activities (see 5-1 to 5-11).    Below are the ten Implementation Plans:   SN Implementation Plan   PLAN I To amend the current legal and regulatory framework to reflect  industry and regulatory convergence;   PLAN II To establish the Centre for ICT Intelligence (CII);    PLAN III To improve Internet connectivity;   PLAN IV To expand and improve fixed and mobile access networks;   PLAN V To develop services and applications by local suppliers;   PLAN VI To build capacity and develop national ICT skills;   PLAN VII To develop appropriate ICT services for the  marginalised/disadvantaged (e.g. the physically challenged);   PLAN VIII To develop and use Geo-information to better know the ICT  market;   PLAN IX To promote private and community resource centres for  affordable universal access/service;   PLAN X To set up a national information system with relevant ICT  indicators and to annually conduct E-readiness surveys.      8-1 To amend the legal and regulatory framework    The objective of this implementation plan is to have a regulatory framework for technology  convergence and that enables efficient operators and service providers to enter the market  and to offer innovative services as affordable as possible for the benefit of the country:     ICT Policy of Sierra Leone    Page 42 / 63   · To review and amend the Telecommunications Act 2006 to comply with the  recommendations of the ECOWAS Supplementary Acts of January 2007.   · To enact a unified licensing regime and to enforce it as soon as possible.   · To avoid any abuse by a dominant stakeholder and ensure a level playing field in  the ICT market.   · To promote affordable universal access with appropriate obligations for the  licensed operators and service providers.    8-2 To establish the Centre for ICT Intelligence (CII)   In line with paragraph 7-2-1, the objective of this implementation plan is to  determine the structure, funding and appropriate law establishing the CII as an  independent and autonomous body, that shall be responsible for collating, organising  and processing ICT information relevant to e-security matters on the use of ICTs in  the public/private spheres of Sierra Leone.     The functions of the CII shall include identifying threats to national ICT networks,  analysis of e-security risks, intelligence gathering, developing and reviewing security  software, privacy enhancing technologies (PETs), anti-piracy security/encryption tools  for music, film and print media.     The CII shall establish a national ICT skills database (and from which employees of the  CII shall be chosen) and develop a Unit that shall be tasked with the development of  special ICT courses for National Forces at all levels (including the top level National  Security Council).   8-3 To improve Internet connectivity      The Government considers broadband access a basic necessity for Sierra Leoneans. This  implementation plan shall have the following objectives:   · To ensure broadband Internet access at reduced and affordable cost for the end  users by:   o  enabling the landing of submarine fibre optic cable and emerging  technologies linking Sierra Leone to the rest of the world, and   o ensuring that international voice or data traffic has redundant paths that are  not provided by the same vendor.   · To rapidly extend the scope and traffic carrying capacity of the current international  gateway and to improve quality of service.   · To liberalise the international gateways with a limited number of alternative  gateways.   · To build up a fibre optic MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) with appropriate rings to  offer a reliable broadband access to all categories of users: wholesale business with     ICT Policy of Sierra Leone    Page 43 / 63   GSM operators, corporate business with ISP, ASP, large enterprises and  administrations.    · To build up fibre optic links between the capital and all the main cities of Sierra  Leone to allow broadband access to the rest of the country.   · To upgrade the IXP (Internet Exchange Point) to establish a shared network.    8-4 To expand fixed and mobile access networks in remote areas   The objective of this implementation plan is to ensure the expansion and upgrading of the  national telecommunications infrastructures across the country.    The priority of NATCOM is for mobile operators to extend and improve their networks in the  provinces with better coordination and sharing of infrastructure.    The Government considers that IP-based networks that merge voice telephony with data  and image can offer a lot of business opportunities to operators and consumers. NATCOM  shall encourage operators to consider the progressive migration of traditional networks  (PSTN and GSM) to an all-IP network in their medium and long-term strategies. IP-based  networks will facilitate the provision of innovative services and applications. For new  entrants, the cost of building or leasing IP networks/links will be significantly lower than  those of circuit-switched networks.   NATCOM shall encourage 3G wireless technologies to boost the market for wireless  communications. Some initiatives are opening the door for an emerging wireless Internet  market even as broadband 3G becomes commercially available. Other network wireless  high-speed data technologies are being developed and tested. The entry of WiMax shall be  particularly encouraged.   8-5 To develop services and applications by local suppliers   This implementation plan aims at delivering a complete range of affordable services and  applications to satisfy different categories of ICT users, and to emphasize the production of  local content. In this regard, Government shall:   Ø Support the development and implementation of ICT services and sectoral  applications (e-governance, e-commerce, e-learning, e-health, etc.).   Ø  Facilitate the development of the local ICT industry.    Computer and Accessory costs   The Government shall seek to establish a zero tariff on computers and computer  accessories. Cybercafés and community resource centres are to be supported to facilitate  the usage of nomadic users and other persons who cannot afford computers at home or for  their small business.   Local Content    The Government is keen to ensure the indigenous development of Sierra Leonean content  on the Internet. Local service provision currently gives preference to international content  and little is available on Sierra Leone culture. Using various forms of Mass Media, it is     ICT Policy of Sierra Leone    Page 44 / 63   anticipated that through the development of ICTs, Sierra Leoneans shall have a prominent  voice in the determination of their own image.    8-6  To build capacity and develop national ICT skills    The objective of this implementation plan is to improve the skills required in an information- based society at different levels:   Ø High level skills for advanced specialists needed for developing, implementing and  operating the hardware and software systems and the security framework.   Ø Suitable skills for intensive users of specific services and applications.   Ø Knowledge on the basic and cross-sectoral tools (office automation, computer use,  mailing, Internet browsing) for all potential ICT users.   Ø Basic computer literacy for the population.   8-7 ICT services and skills for the marginalised/disadvantaged   ICT can play a critical role in improving the quality of life of Sierra Leoneans especially  those considered to be marginalised and disadvantaged (e.g. the physically and  mentally challenged).  This plan shall:    Ø Ensure a training program that equips physically and mentally challenged Sierra  Leoneans across the country with basic ICT and work related skills.   Ø Provide the physically and mentally challenged with work opportunities that allow  them to use their new ICT skills.     8-8 Develop and Use Geo-information to better know the market   Planning in general requires a referencing framework to integrate large numbers of different  data. Although information can be presented via text, voice or statistical tables, some of  these are more intelligently communicated with geo-information tools and techniques, such  as Geographical Information Systems (GIS). This implementation plan shall therefore  determine the development and use of geo-information as a useful ICT tool for socio- economic analysis of the ICT sector.    8-9 Affordable universal access/service   The objective of this implementation plan is to provide communities with access to  affordable ICT services. Universal Access/Service means affordable access to basic ICT  services regardless of geographic location. This can only happen with the cooperation of all  stakeholders. This implementation plan aims at increasing the use of ICT in poor and remote  areas through individual access in households and small businesses, or collective access with  private and community resource centres.     ICT Policy of Sierra Leone    Page 45 / 63   8-10 ICT and E-readiness Survey   A national information system with relevant indicators shall be set up to monitor progress  on the implementation of infrastructure and services. The system shall be implemented by  MIC with support from the National ICT Advisory Council, NATCOM and Statistics Sierra  Leone. The indicators shall be culled from the Partnership on Measuring ICT for  Development.1  Surveys on E-readiness       An e-readiness survey is a useful tool in determining a country’s position in terms of ICT and  it serves as an initial phase of any national ICT strategic planning process. This survey shall be  conducted annually by NATCOM in collaboration with Statistics Sierra Leone. The results of  the survey shall provide a scorecard for all stakeholders. The indicators to be used in the  surveys shall be consistent with the list of indicators provided by the Partnership on  Measuring ICT for Development.    9 CONCLUSION   The Sierra Leone Government, private sector and civil society members recognize the  potential offered by ICT in overcoming structural and historical weaknesses inherent in the  country and affecting its overall development.    The statements and targets in this document are therefore to accelerate a new phase in the  economic growth and social development of Sierra Leone.

ICT Policy of Sierra Leone    Page 62 / 63      ANNEXE C. – GEO-INFORMATION   C1 Introduction   Geospatial Information (GI), also referred to as geographic information, geo-information,  spatial data or geospatial data, identifies the geographic location and characteristics of  natural or man-made features and boundaries, in, on or above the earth. A map is a typical  example of GI. A GI characteristically has two main components, namely location  information and attributes information.    GI also describes the situation and characteristics of a country in terms of coordinates, place  names, postal addresses and other criteria. In today's modern society of administration,  economy, and science as well as in the private sector, GI is the basis for processes, planning,  measures and decision-making. GI has become essential to most areas of human economic  and social activity including environmental protection, agriculture, fisheries, mineral  resources, computer science and telecommunications, education, culture, insurance and  health care, national defence, home security, civil protection and disaster control, logistics  and waste management etc.   The growing realisation of the immense importance of GI to economic planning and  development in recent decades has led to the emergence of a myriad of geospatial data  providers, coming from various agencies of government and the private sector and mostly  still acquiring and storing data in analogue formats. Uncoordinated efforts in GI data  collection and use of obsolete procedures can result in overlaps and duplication. A national  policy is therefore necessary for regulating, coordinating and mandating data production,  access, sharing, exchange and quality.    In order to realise the enormous economic benefits of GI, Sierra Leone requires a National  Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) to provide easy access to national geospatial data (instead  of data kept manually in shelves or drawers) and to mainstream the use of GI into the  Government’s decision making process.    C2 Issues   a. Inadequate core geographical data sets and thematic data sets, and the lack  of a national geographic information strategy.   b. MDAs slow to adopt contemporary technology for resource and  environmental data acquisition, analysis and management.   c. The organizations that were established to acquire and provide core  fundamental data have largely been unable to meet the data demands.   C3 Objectives   a. Conduct a multidisciplinary assessment of the status of GI in Sierra Leone.   b. Introduce the use of modern equipment (Satellite images and GPS technology) to  capture spatial data and the use of modern GIS tools to produce more accurate  maps for planning.     ICT Policy of Sierra Leone    Page 63 / 63   c. Develop a national geospatial data infrastructure that is capable of adequately  supporting the economic and developmental needs of the country.   C4 Targets   a. A national catalogue of available geo-information datasets and related metadata  developed as a result of a full assessment of the status of GI in Sierra Leone, by  December 2009.   b. Establishment of a sub-committee responsible for the coordination and planning  of a national geospatial data infrastructure initiative by September 2009.    c. Department of Lands and Surveys capacitated, through intensified training, in  applying modern GPS and GIS tools and techniques to collect land related  information and to produce corresponding maps accurately and speedily, by  September 2014.    d. A national spatial referencing network re-established based on Permanent GPS  Base Stations by January 2010.               Acknowledgements  Abbreviations  NATIONAL ICT VISION   1.

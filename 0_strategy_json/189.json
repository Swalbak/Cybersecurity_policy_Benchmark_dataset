New ways of communicating and of ac- cessing knowledge and innovative design lead to greater social interaction, new business models and new fields for research and development. Interconnected elec- tronic devices have a growing influence on our daily lives and work. The growth of machine-generated data and the proliferation of smart meters and sensors are creat- ing enormous amounts of data. Machines are learning on their own how to take on increasingly complex tasks. Routines and production processes are becoming in- creasingly interconnected and innovation cycles are speeding up. Borderless cyber- space demands new approaches. Government has the responsibility to work with the private sector and other actors in order to assess these processes of change in the public interest, actively influence them and create the conditions for their further de- velopment. The ongoing digital revolution brings both opportunities and risks and therefore re- quires trust. There is no such thing as 100% security; there will always be potential for misuse. The task of government and the private sector is to lay the groundwork for such trust. Security is an important part of this effort. Individuals must be able to use the new technologies safely and autonomously, even when these technologies and the risks of using them are too complicated for ordinary people to understand fully. In this digital age, companies must be able to protect their intellectual property against unauthorized access and control their production processes even when using self-learning machines or cloud services that store their data on servers all over the world. The Federal Government’s Cyber Security Strategy for Germany that was adopted in February 2011 provided an important outline for forward-looking cyber security poli- cy. Many of the measures proposed in that strategy have since been carried out. For example, the National Cyber Security Council is a high-level body for strategic initia- tives at the interface between government and industry, while the National Cyber Re- sponse Centre serves as a platform for government agencies to share strategic and operational information. Since 2011, cyber security has become a key element of many strategic plans and interministerial projects of the Federal Government. It is 4 now clear that government institutions too must work together to ensure cyber securi- ty. In cyberspace, it is no longer possible to distinguish clearly between internal and external security. Maintaining cyber security and defending against cyber attacks have thus become a task for government as a whole. The strategic approaches and objectives of the 2011 Cyber Security Strategy remain largely valid today. However, constantly changing conditions have made it necessary to expand the strategy and incorporate it into a larger interministerial effort which pays appropriate attention to the relevance and horizontal nature of cyber security and addresses this issue in a comprehensive way. The 2016 Cyber Security Strategy provides the interministerial strategic framework for the Federal Government’s activities related to cyber security and updates the 2011 Cyber Security Strategy. The federal states (Länder) and private industry were included in the process of developing the new strategy. 5 Cyber threat situation The cyber threat situation in Germany is characterized by the increasing complexity and interdependence of the technology used and by constantly changing threats. The digitalization of modern societies has made them more vulnerable and increased the possibility of misuse in cyberspace. It also makes it much easier to attack the private sphere of individuals. The impact of cyber attacks is not limited to cyberspace. Successful attacks may cause economic, political and even personal harm. Attacks on government institu- tions for the purpose of spying or sabotage can interfere with the functioning of public administration, the armed forces and the security authorities, thereby having an im- pact on public security and order in Germany. Cyber attacks on the energy supply network can shut down large segments of public and private life. Targeted cyber at- tacks on banking infrastructure or market manipulation can threaten the financial markets, with far-reaching consequences for the economy of Germany and the rest of the world. The manipulation of IT health-care applications, of IT-supported traffic routing systems or of self-driving cars and digital networks with which cars can com- municate with each other and with traffic infrastructure can lead to very real threats to life and health. Intentionally spreading false information with the help of hacked IT systems can be used to manipulate public opinion, creating long-term threats to our open society and democracy. Attackers often have a criminal, extremist/terrorist, military or intelligence back- ground. The quantitative and qualitative diversity of potential actors at home and abroad and the technical possibilities for disguise make it difficult to detect, prevent and prosecute cyber attacks and identify attackers. Political and military conflicts are often accompanied by cyber campaigns or are waged in cyberspace below the threshold of armed conflict. This makes it more difficult to assess the political signifi- cance of cyber attacks and to decide what counter-measures to take. The number and sophistication of cyber attacks is constantly growing, while IT sys- tems are often inadequately protected. Some attacks show a high level of profes- sionalism. Today, the tools to carry out attacks are available to state actors, criminal groups and individuals alike. Classic defences are often inadequate to protect 6 against sophisticated malware. Attackers have the technical skills to keep their at- tacks from being detected and to cover their own tracks. This is why it is becoming harder and harder to detect cyber attacks and who is responsible for them without a great deal of time and effort. We can assume that many attacks have so far gone undiscovered. This threat situation will have a significant impact on government, in- dustry and society in Germany in the coming years. 7 Guiding principles of the Cyber Security Strategy Germany must maintain its sovereignty and ability to function even in the digital age. Cyber security policy that is ready for the future will enable our country to take full advantage of the enormous opportunities and potential of the digital rev- olution to the benefit of all, by keeping the related risks under control. Ensuring freedom and security is a core task of the state, also in cyberspace. So it is also a task of the state to protect individuals and businesses in Germany against threats from cyberspace and to prevent and prosecute crime in cyberspace. In the digital age, the state can perform these tasks effectively for the long term only by of- fering businesses and individuals protection and freedom to develop also in cyber- space. To do so, the state must make sure its own systems are secure. In view of the potential for digital innovation, the state must recognize possible developments and their relevance for cyber security issues at an early stage based on the necessary risk analysis; it must also investigate possible new solutions and incorporate them into public policy. Cyber security results first of all from risk-appropriate behaviour and the use of se- cure systems in the operators’ and users’ area of responsibility. Many cyber attacks can be prevented with reasonable effort simply by taking tried and tested basic measures, such as consistently using risk-appropriate, effective and up-to-date secu- rity products and standards. Close cooperation and coordination is necessary to prevent, detect, identify, defend against and prosecute cyber attacks. Government, private industry, society and the research community all share responsibility for ensuring the security of cyberspace. They must therefore also coordinate their response to current challenges. Due to in- terdependencies and threats that often extend across national borders, close Euro- pean and international coordination is essential from the perspective of foreign and security policy. As a result, the Federal Government’s cyber security policy in the coming years will set priorities in the following four areas of action: 8 1. Remaining safe and autonomous in a digital environment 2. Government and private industry working together 3. Strong and sustainable cyber security architecture for every level of govern- ment 4. Germany’s active role in European and international cyber security policy The measures in each of these four areas affect all areas of society to differing de- grees. 9 Action area 1: Remaining safe and autonomous in a digital environment A cornerstone of cyber security is the ability to be safe and in control in a digital environment. Individual users, businesses, government and others in Germany must be able to understand and assess the opportunities and risks involved in using information technology and to adjust their behaviour accordingly (ability to assess). For them to do so, trustworthy technologies and conditions must be available. The possibility to be safe and in control in cyberspace lies within the context of technological or digital autonomy. It is based on targeted digital education for all ages and types of users. To counteract digital carelessness, awareness of cyber security must become firmly anchored in society. In order to take advantage of what digitalization offers, all user groups must be able to access trustworthy and secure IT systems, thereby reducing their digital vulnerability. An important part of this is user-friendly and practical solutions – al- so those made in Germany – based on globally applicable technical architecture. So are targeted IT security research and development, needs- and user-based certification policy, support for secure electronic identities and encryption of both electronic communications and of services offered via the Internet. National regu- lations should be revised as necessary in line with current security needs. At the same time, the Federal Government will continue to work in the European Union and in international organizations on behalf of appropriate and uniform IT security standards and effective legislation. 10 Strategic objectives and measures: Promoting digital literacy among all users Responsible behaviour in cyberspace and awareness of the opportunities and specific risks when using IT systems are an integral part of digital literacy. Digital education must therefore become firmly integrated in the educational system, from school and the dual system of vocational education and training, to universi- ty, continuing professional training and general adult education. The federal states have primary responsibility for schools and universities. By the time young people finish school, they should all have the basic technical understanding and fundamental skills to use information and communications technology safely. The federal and state governments must work more closely together in this area. The Federal Government will align the dual system of vocational education and train- ing more closely with the needs of digital society and will amend the training reg- ulations accordingly. Vocational training centres for multiple employers are being equipped for the digital age. They must be able to offer high-quality continuing training in this area. The necessary investment in equipment has high funding priority. The Federal Government will also work with trade and labour unions as well as employers to create more flexible and individual digital continuing train- ing. The Federal Government will also push to expand course offerings in this area by establishing additional university chairs and by supporting leading institutions in the field of STEM education, in particular in computer science, for example with regard to Big Data analyses, industrial software and IT security. In the process, the Federal Government will also support greater cooperation with private indus- try, for example in the form of foundations and externally funded teaching and re- search posts. Countering digital carelessness In addition to education, responsible and risk-averse behaviour requires regular awareness-raising to counteract users’ digital carelessness at home and at work. To this end, the Federal Government will work with initiatives such as Deutsch- land sicher im Netz e.V. (Germany secure on the Internet) to promote efforts to 11 increase awareness tailored to specific groups. The Federal Government also provides funding for specific projects to increase media literacy. The Federal Government initiatives related to cyber security and society are being expanded and updated. This also includes the public discourse on horizontal cyber policy issues using targeted formats. It is also necessary to counteract digital careless- ness in businesses. Appointing IT security officers to drive the drafting and im- plementation of IT security measures is an effective, tried and tested way to ac- complish this. To make cyber threats more visible, it is also necessary to provide the public with the latest information on the security aspects of IT products and services. For this reason, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) will expand its units dealing with public warnings and information on how to deal with IT security gaps. Creating the conditions for secure electronic communication and safe web offer- ings Secure and trustworthy electronic communication that cannot be manipulated is fundamental for individuals to be able to enjoy the rights related to communica- tion, the right to privacy and the right to control one’s own image. For businesses, it constitutes important protection against cyber spying and is thus the foundation for their financial success. Easy and secure encryption ensures confidential elec- tronic communication for all and should become standard. The Federal Govern- ment explicitly welcomes research projects and industry initiatives aimed at this goal. The consistent use of strong encryption for web offerings will further in- crease security on the Internet. The Federal Government will analyse the specific barriers to the use of encryption and will promote initiatives to reduce these bar- riers. Along with this approach, which could be called “security through encryption”, Germany is also pursuing the approach of “security despite encryption”. Users must have access to the highest level of protection for their data, values and rights. At the same time, Germany’s law enforcement and security authorities are allowed, under strict legal conditions, to decrypt or bypass encrypted communi- cations if necessary in the individual case to carry out their duties as required by law. To keep these powers from being undermined, the technical decryption ca- 12 pabilities of the law enforcement and security authorities must keep up with tech- nical developments in encryption. Secure electronic identities In parallel with promoting secure electronic communications, the strategies for securely identifying persons and things should be expanded. Users must have access to secure, user-friendly and modern means of authentication on the Inter- net. The current standard of user name/password is widespread but not secure; it should be added to or if possible replaced. Identification documents with an online ID function are central; the Federal Government already provides such documents as a highly secure way to identify oneself on the Internet without shedding lots of data. The aim is to establish the online ID function, and secure identities based on it, as a standard means of identification for sensitive services, then to further develop this function and promote equally secure solutions in the private sector. The Federal Government also advocates standardized identity management in all German public administration and is calling on makers of information and communications technology to work with Germany’s IT security industry to devel- op and bring to market trustworthy products and services. Strengthening certification and approval: Introducing a quality label for IT security Effective, needs-based certificates and quality labels are an important tool for disseminating cyber security standards. Certifying or approving IT security prod- ucts is already an established and recognized procedure. But it only covers a small segment of the information technology in use today. For this reason, the Federal Government encourages makers of standard technology in particular to certify more of their products. It will also introduce a basic certification procedure for secure IT consumer products, with criteria to be defined by the BSI. At the same time, the BSI’s existing resources for drafting technical guidelines, certify- ing and supporting the national accreditation agency for IT security will be in- creased and the relevant processes streamlined in the interest of all involved. In the process, it will be necessary to use modern processes to overcome the chal- lenge of rigorous but time-consuming certification and approval processes at a 13 time of shorter technology cycles. For example, this challenge can be met effi- ciently through greater involvement and accreditation of businesses and integrat- ing them more thoroughly in the certification process. Scalable and delegated processes in accordance with BSI standards will be considered for this purpose. The Federal Government will advocate expanding the European and internation- al agreements for IT security certification based on common criteria for evaluat- ing security (Common Criteria, ISO/IEC 15408 and ISO/IEC 27000) in order to enable greater international recognition of these criteria. In certain areas, labelling IT security features of products and services is still a special challenge. To make the security of IT products and services more trans- parent for individuals and small and medium-sized businesses, the Federal Gov- ernment will increase its activities related to IT security quality labels and certifi- cates and will make suitable proposals, especially concerning shared systems for certification and a standardized system of labelling. In future, a single quality la- bel should help prospective buyers tell easily and quickly which IT products and services are designed to be secure and thus help protect data. Such a label is in- tended to make cyber security easier to understand and achieve. Making digitalization secure Individual consumers and businesses expect government to evaluate and active- ly influence the changes brought by digitalization. Examples include the E-Health Act (E-Health-Gesetz) and the IT Security Act (IT-Sicherheitsgesetz). We must continue to pursue this approach, paying attention to new technologies, new business models and changing user behaviour as well as new threats and new European and international regulations, such as the EU’s Directive 2016/1148 on security of network and information systems. Requirements for the appropriate distribution of responsibilities and security risks on the Internet, for example by means of security requirements for makers of hard- and software and product li- ability rules for inadequate IT security, are being considered. The impacts of the use of digital technologies, especially on cyber security, should be taken into ac- count already when drafting federal legislation and regulations. 14 And requiring the early implementation of security requirements should be al- lowed by law in order to ensure security by design. For this purpose, the BSI serves the federal ministries as a central source of advice. As mobility becomes increasingly digitalized and more data are generated as a result, new cross-border requirements are needed to ensure the safety of vehi- cles and infrastructure and to protect privacy. Germany will play an active role in creating international standards especially at the level of UNECE to ensure suffi- cient protection against manipulation and misuse of technical structures, data and processes. Advancing IT security research New, all-encompassing IT security solutions are needed to be able to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by digitalization, such as Industry 4.0, medical technology and Mobility 4.0. This is why innovative IT security solutions for tomorrow must be researched and implemented today. The Federal Govern- ment is expanding its research framework programme on IT security, Selbstbes- timmt und sicher in der digitalen Welt 2015–2020 (Independent and safe in the digital world 2015–2020), and closely linking it to other measures of the Cyber Security Strategy. The existing centres of excellence for IT security research will also be further strengthened: CRISP in Darmstadt, CISPA in Saarbrücken and KASTEL in Karls- ruhe. These centres address current research topics, provide estimates and as- sessments for policy-makers and develop concrete solutions. The results of gov- ernment-funded projects should be applied and marketed in products and pro- cesses as quickly as possible. In the area of military applications of IT and cyber security, this is the task of the cyber cluster at the Bundeswehr University in Mu- nich, with its Cyber Defence and Smart Data (CODE) research centre. The com- mercial application and further development by businesses and start-ups of inno- vative ideas in the field of IT security should be an explicit goal of government in- vestment in order to bring about the greatest possible economic benefit. Active technology scouting can help discover, introduce and further refine the latest 15 technologies. Private venture capital investors can also play an important role in this regard. 16 Action area 2: Government and private industry working together Trusting cooperation and close interaction between government and the private sector are essential to maintain a high level of cyber security in Germany over the long term. New avenues should be taken as part of a cooperative approach in order to combine strengths. Businesses in Germany must be able to protect themselves and their customers ef- fectively against cyber attacks. Operators of critical infrastructure deserve special attention. But other businesses are also very important for government, society and the economy and require special protection. With the help of the cooperative ap- proach established with the IT Security Act, the necessary conditions should be im- proved and extended to other economic sectors as needed. Government and private industry need to work together closely and on the basis of mutual trust in developing and implementing effective, needs-based IT security standards. For this to happen, Germany needs a strong IT industry promoted with the help of modern economic pol- icy. The Federal Government will also draft measures to improve Germany’s start-up culture in the field of IT and cyber security, which is weak in international comparison. In detecting and averting cyber attacks, it is essential to include providers and IT se- curity services in Germany. Strategic objectives and measures Securing critical infrastructures Protecting critical infrastructures is the central focus of joint activities by govern- ment and the private sector. The interconnectedness of these systems means that protecting the IT of critical infrastructures is especially important. This cyber prevention and defence task is shared by the federal, state and local govern- ments, because internal and external security in the cyber area are closely inter- related. In implementing the IT Security Act, government and the private sector must work together closely at all levels and share information on the basis of trust, among others in the public–private partnership UP KRITIS. Minimum standards and reporting channels are drafted, implemented and further devel- oped in cooperation with the private sector. Whether to extend such obligations 17 concerning prevention and response to other businesses with great relevance for society will also be considered. Protecting businesses in Germany The Federal Government will expand and increase links between its offerings to increase awareness and support German business and industry. Medium-sized businesses in particular must be able to protect themselves effectively against threats in and from cyberspace in order to take full advantage of the opportunities associated with digitalization. The relevant implementation strategies should be developed by government, the private sector and the research community work- ing together. Government should provide concrete support for businesses to help them achieve the necessary level of IT security. Businesses and government agencies must be able to trust each other to handle sensitive topics professional- ly and with discretion. The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) and the central cyber crime contact point of the federal and state police play a key role in pre- venting cyber crime and espionage against businesses. The Federal Govern- ment will also work with the private sector and research community to expand ex- isting initiatives, such as the Allianz für Cyber-Sicherheit (Alliance for cyber secu- rity), the German Competence Center against Cyber-Crime (G4C), and the initia- tives IT-Sicherheit in der Wirtschaft (IT security in the private sector) and Initiative Wirtschaftsschutz (Economic security initiative), and to strengthen the connec- tions between them, also to create synergies. Strengthening Germany’s IT industry Cyber security in Germany requires a strong and innovative German IT industry based on secure network infrastructures and on identifying key technologies in the field of IT security and defence from trustworthy IT manufacturers. To make Germany’s IT industry more competitive, the Federal Government will promote the quality label “IT Security Made in Germany” and expand the existing instru- ments for foreign trade. In national key technology fields, networks with the na- tional IT security industry should be strengthened and own capacities should be built up, promoted and protected wherever possible and useful. 18 Further, a broader portfolio of qualified, trustworthy service providers is needed, for example for IT security solutions, forensics, and attack detection and re- sponse. Here too users should be able to rely on a broader range of service pro- viders. The Federal Government provides support for IT companies through spe- cial research programmes. In joint projects with universities, research institutes and other private-sector partners, they develop innovative approaches for new products and services. Working with providers Working with providers plays a key role. In the framework of current law, this is especially true of provider activities to detect cyber threats, deal with known inci- dents/infections and reduce the impact of ongoing attacks. One effective option for improving data security on the Internet in general is to increase the use of sensors, in compliance with data protection regulations, to detect anomalies. The findings should be anonymized or pseudonymized to protect the rights of data subjects. Getting providers of IT security services involved At a time when skilled IT workers are in short supply, government and the private sector have an interest in encouraging the mutual exchange of IT expertise and the creation of expert networks. In the framework of applicable law, private pro- viders of IT security services will be more involved in case of need than in other areas of government activity. The Federal Government will therefore take target- ed advantage of possibilities to promote skilled and trustworthy IT security ser- vice providers. It will also work with representatives of Germany’s IT security in- dustry to develop and carry out staff exchange programmes in the field of cyber security. In doing so, protecting government confidentiality and official secrecy is just as important as protecting trade secrets. Creating a platform for sharing information on the basis of mutual trust The cooperative approach also includes intensive information-sharing. For this purpose, the Federal Government will institutionalize a cooperation platform for government and the private sector; within the predefined legal boundaries, this 19 platform will above all enable the sharing of information relevant for averting cyber attacks. 20 Action area 3: Strong and sustainable cyber security architecture for eve- ry level of government Government must ensure security, law and freedom in our country, also in cy- berspace. This requires up-to-date cyber security architecture that effectively connects the various actors at federal level without losing sight of the state and local governments and the private sector. The ongoing digital revolution means that many federal and state government agen- cies today deal with cyber security issues. The range of tasks is broad, extending (in compliance with the constitutionally imposed limits) from prevention, threat preven- tion and law enforcement to counter-espionage, intelligence-gathering and cyber de- fence. Both internal and external security in cyberspace are equally affected. Gov- ernment institutions must be organized in such a way that they can fulfil their duty to protect society also in the digital age and can protect themselves against cyber at- tack. In this context, modern cyber security architecture regards cyber security as an ongo- ing national task. It is essential that, in case of need, information is shared and the performance of tasks is coordinated efficiently. Synergies among ministries and agencies at all levels of government and across national borders are especially im- portant. At federal level, the National Cyber Response Centre already offers the nec- essary structure for individual actors to work together within their respective roles and responsibilities. This cooperation should be intensified and the federal states more closely involved. The Federal Government will review the legal responsibilities as well as the technical and staffing capabilities, bring them more closely into line and adjust them as needed. This is the only way to ensure that government remains able to prevent, detect, investigate, avert and prosecute cyber attacks even in the digital age. Strategic objectives and measures Further developing the National Cyber Response Centre 21 In carrying out the 2011 Cyber Security Strategy, the National Cyber Response Centre was established under the leadership of the Federal Ministry of the Interi- or to strengthen information-sharing among the relevant federal agencies. At the Centre, the federal agencies responsible for cyber security issues currently share information on cyber incidents as well as their assessments and analyses. This activity will be further intensified. To improve the ability to avert cyber at- tacks, the Centre must be suitably organized within the framework of cyber secu- rity architecture for all levels of government. As an inter-ministerial institution, un- der the supervision of the Federal Ministry of the Interior the Centre will be further developed into a central platform for cooperation and coordination. In future, the Centre will have its own evaluation and analysis capabilities and a current cyber situation report reflecting the cyber security situation in Germany. In case of cyber attack, it is crucial for all national actors to inform each other and coordi- nate their response in compliance with applicable law. If a cyber attack originates abroad, foreign and security policy aspects must also be taken into account. In case of cyber security incidents affecting numerous institutions across Germany, the Centre becomes a crisis response centre. In this case, the affected IT sys- tems can be secured and restored and cyber attacks investigated and averted only through coordinated measures taken by the national actors. This operational cooperation is to be coordinated more intensively. The planning and implementa- tion of joint exercises and reciprocal training are also to be established. The federal states are invited to share their capabilities in this coordination pro- cess in the context of tasks performed by every level of government. Improving local analysis and response capability Recent cyber attacks have shown that there are hardly any institutionalized gov- ernment structures, other than the usual IT security measures, to help those af- fected assess an incident quickly and locally. Firstly, this involves managing se- curity incidents in technical terms, for which the BSI has special expertise. Sec- ondly, cyber attacks may require action by the local security authorities based on the relevant law. The National Cyber Response Centre oversees the necessary coordination for such operations involving multiple authorities while respecting 22 the legal limits. The interests of these authorities in restoring IT systems, investi- gating incidents and prosecuting the perpetrators are taken into account, as are the interests in protection of the party affected. The BSI will set up Mobile Incident Response Teams (MIRTs) to analyse and clear up cyber incidents affecting institutions which are especially important to society. On request, these teams will travel to constitutional bodies, federal agencies, critical infrastructure operators and similarly important institutions to help them deal quickly and flexibly with the technical aspects of managing securi- ty incidents, when there is a special public interest in doing so. This assistance is intended to rapidly restore the safe technical operations of the institution con- cerned. Cyber attacks may also require action by federal security authorities. For this reason, the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) is setting up a specialized in- vestigative unit, the Quick Reaction Force (QRF). In consultation with the re- sponsible public prosecutor’s office or the Office of the Federal Prosecutor, the QRF will take the first action that cannot be delayed under the Code of Criminal Procedure on behalf of the law enforcement authorities. The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) is creating Mobile Cyber Teams made up of IT specialists, intelligence specialists experienced in analysing cyber attacks and, if necessary, staff with foreign language skills. These teams will travel to the scene of cyber attacks with an intelligence or extremist/terrorist background, in- cluding possible sabotage cases. The Military Counterintelligence Service (MAD) handles this task for agencies within the defence remit. As far as allowed by law, the Federal Intelligence Service (BND) may monitor attacks as they are being prepared and carried out. Information flows resulting from attacks are also regis- tered. The Bundeswehr may also contribute, as far as allowed by the Constitu- tion, to security preparedness with its Incident Response Teams and other rele- vant units. Classic preventive measures may not be enough to deal with serious cyber at- tacks in the necessary time. The Federal Government will therefore examine the 23 legal framework to determine whether government agencies could conduct net- work operations and if so, what technical options they could use in these cases. Intensifying law enforcement in cyberspace The Federal Government will further intensify its efforts to fight cyber crime in the coming years. To do so, intensive information-sharing and knowledge transfer at national and international level will be necessary. Justice and law enforcement authorities will also need additional technical and specialized capabilities. The relevant basic and advanced training curriculum is being developed. The Federal Government will also work to improve the condi- tions for recruiting and developing skilled staff in the fields of investigation, cyber crime and digital forensics. High-performance analysis and evaluation systems are to be built for the federal and state-level security authorities. The Federal Government will work to make sure that the powers and capabilities of the security authorities keep up with the latest technological developments so that there are no gaps in threat prevention and law enforcement. Investigative measures in the field of information technology surveillance must not be depend- ent on a particular technology, to ensure that they remain efficient and state of the art. Fighting cyber espionage and sabotage effectively For foreign intelligence services, cyber attacks on government IT systems and those of businesses, research institutes and their employees represent a signifi- cant source of information. The Federal Government has responded by reorgan- izing its counterintelligence efforts and will continue its 360° monitoring of all ac- tivities by foreign intelligence services in Germany. The BfV’s directorate-general for counterintelligence has added staff and undergone targeted restructuring, with a focus on cyber espionage: technical and expert analysis and evaluation of attacks on federal agencies and other targets which are thought to be the work of 24 intelligence services. The BfV will also increase its efforts to fight cyber attacks with an extremist or terrorist background. An early-warning system for cyber attacks from abroad As mandated by law, the BND monitors cyber spying and other cyber attacks from abroad targeting government and/or critical infrastructures in Germany and can send potential targets an early warning to take the necessary defensive ac- tion (Signals Intelligence Support to Cyber Defence (SSCD)). In this way, the BND is using IT specialists and experienced analysts to create an early-warning system for cyber attacks. Once detected, attacks are assessed in terms of their quantity and quality in order to get a picture of the current threat situation. Centre for Information Technology of Security Authorities (ZITiS) The national security authorities must be as effective in the digital environment as in other areas. To help them with their operational cyber capabilities and to take advantage of synergies, a centre for technical support for the federal securi- ty and expert authorities, including the intelligence services, is being set up within the remit of the Federal Ministry of the Interior. The centre’s tasks will be support- ive and based on those of the authorities they serve. Development, support and advising the security authorities will have priority. This Centre for Information Technology of Security Authorities (ZITiS) will work closely with these authorities to develop the necessary methods, products and strategies for the security au- thorities to use in their operations. ZITiS itself will have no operational powers. Strengthening the defensive aspects of cyber security As a military part of overall defence, cyber defence is a constitutionally mandated task of the Bundeswehr and is subject to national and international rules govern- ing Bundeswehr operations. According to the 2016 White Paper, defensive as- pects of national cyber security are the originary responsibility of the Federal Min- istry of Defence and the Bundeswehr. Cyber prevention, foreign and international cyber security policy and cyber defence are three supplementary means to achieve cyber security. The defence capabilities of the Bundeswehr in cyber- space are also an integral part of cyber security architecture. This is demonstrat- ed by the similar content in the technical implementation of protective measures 25 and by using and sharing cyber defence structures, processes and reporting with regard to defence-related aspects and situations. As high-tech army deployed around the world, the Bundeswehr constantly faces threats in cyberspace. But the armed forces depend on cyberspace in order to function. Cyber defence and cyber prevention must be incorporated into all overall de- fence planning, structures and processes. Information security and the protection of the Bundeswehr’s IT systems are assured around the clock as a standing op- erational task, both in Germany and in its areas of operations. For the Bun- deswehr to perform its tasks in cyberspace, its own capabilities are being ex- panded, the security architecture of its IT systems is being consolidated, and previously fragmented structures are being brought together in a ministerial divi- sion and a new, separate military organizational unit. In addition, the Bundeswehr has special expertise, capabilities and resources which can be made available to other government actors through administrative assistance, within the limits allowed by constitutional law. The Bundeswehr can also use the services of civilian businesses to help it carry out its tasks as man- dated by the Constitution. Strengthening CERT structures in Germany Government and non-governmental computer emergency response teams (CERTs) are single points of contact for technical prevention and response in the field of IT security and are an important component of any sustainable cyber se- curity architecture. They meet the need for information-sharing and coordination at the IT expert level everywhere in the world. In Germany, the BSI serves as na- tional CERT, with its CERT-Bund for the public administration; its services for operators of critical infrastructures, the private sector and individual users; and as single point of contact for CERTs in other countries. Other federal agencies have independent CERTs, as do state-level public administrations, some businesses and research institutions. These structures should be further expanded and con- nected in a network in the interest of national cyber security. The BSI will further intensify cooperation within the network of federal and state CERTs and with the business and research CERTs and will bring all the key actors together to im- 26 prove and complete the existing CERT structures in Germany in an inclusive pro- cess which builds on what has already been achieved. This process should also take the development of the National Cyber Response Centre into account. Keeping the federal administration secure Rapid technological development, the growing complexity of information and communications technology and digitalization in public administration are creat- ing new challenges for IT security management in the federal administration as well. The implementation plan for ensuring IT security in the federal administra- tion (UP Bund) is the binding IT security guideline for all federal agencies and will be revised in line with current technical and organizational developments. The comprehensive project to consolidate federal IT (IT-Konsolidierung Bund) seeks in principle to merge the IT operations of the direct federal administration. One major goal of the project is to increase IT security. The project Netze des Bundes (networks of the Federal Government) is creating a consistent and se- cure network infrastructure for the federal administration. In a first step, the exist- ing networks which are the responsibility of the Federal Ministry of the Interior are being migrated to a joint network, thereby establishing a single, higher level of IT security. In order to gradually migrate the remaining federal administration net- works, this joint network will then serve as an integration platform for all federal IT networks. In addition, the Federal Government has launched a programme to promote se- cure mobile communications. The programme seeks to increase awareness of the need to use secure IT products and to pay attention to security-relevant fea- tures when procuring new products. The resilience of federal IT systems will also be increased in order to handle unavoidable incidents better. Working more closely with federal and state governments There are proven structures for federal and state cooperation in the areas of cyber crime, cyber espionage and self-protection. To further strengthen this co- operation, the BSI will be assigned the new task of assisting state-level agencies 27 which are responsible for dealing with cyber security incidents. Up to now, the BSI has only provided such assistance to law enforcement authorities. In 2013, the IT Planning Council adopted a guideline for information security in the public administration, which set a general standard for the IT security of all agencies and institutions of the federal and state administration. The federal and state governments have agreed to jointly defend against attacks on information infrastructures of the public administration. To improve their joint situation report, information-sharing between the federal and state levels on cyber attacks, which has been voluntary up to now, will be subject to a binding agreement. In addition, more attention will be given to cyber security at local government lev- el, for example in modernizing baseline IT security and its recommendations concerning organization, personnel, infrastructure and technical matters. The IT Planning Council is a suitable forum for this effort. The Federal Government sup- ports central state-level structures to promote cyber security at local level, for ex- ample by local IT service providers. In future, federal agencies will be able to share more of their expertise with local governments via the federal states. The BSI will draw up a situation report for the local level with the help of the federal states and the national associations of local authorities. Using resources, recruiting and developing staff Cyber security costs money. In the coming years, major expenditures will there- fore be necessary at federal, state and local level to keep Germany sufficiently and permanently up to date in the area of cyber security. Staff recruitment and development plays a key role in ensuring effective public administration. The guideline of the IT Planning Council offers valuable infor- mation in this regard. It will be crucial to emphasize that the public service is an attractive employer and to make targeted use of the existing pay and employ- ment conditions for civil servants and other government employees. Government must also work closely with training institutions. Cyber “clusters” where govern- ment, the private sector and the research community work together can be an important factor for success in the competition for highly skilled workers. Staff re- 28 cruitment within the Federal Government should be more closely coordinated, and staff exchanges should be made easier. Access to the new cyber security course of study at the Bundeswehr University in Munich should also be as broad as possible. The expertise of existing staff and supervisors should be expanded and developed while creating new career and personal prospects. In-house basic and advanced training plays a special role in this context. The Federal Academy of Public Administration (BAköV) will offer relevant courses, and the training modules at the Federal University of Public Administration will be revised and added to. In addition, an innovative model is needed for staff exchanges with private industry and businesses. The Bundeswehr is creating a new cyber reserve pool which can serve as a blueprint for similar civilian volunteer organizations wanting to gather and use the existing know-how of experts from industry, research, administration and civil so- ciety. Close cooperation with Germany’s IT industry is very important in this con- text as well. 29 Action area 4: Germany’s active role in European and international cyber security policy In view of transnational interconnections in a digitalized world, a high level of cyber security can be achieved only by embedding national measures in the rel- evant European, regional and international processes and thereby reinforcing them. With this in mind, Germany will continue to play an active role in European and international cyber security policy. A clear legal framework, increased trust and greater resilience in Europe and the rest of the world will also mean greater protection for Germany. Especially in the digital age, security must be understood in global terms. With regard to measures to strengthen national and regional cyber security capabilities, Germany will also push for interoperable cyber security architectures and standards. At Euro- pean level, the digital single market with an emphasis on sharing secure and interop- erable data is crucial to ensure that European cyberspace is secure. Within the framework of existing Union competences, the same applies to police and judicial cooperation, to the Common Foreign and Security Policy and to the European IT se- curity research network. Germany also actively campaigns for greater cyber security in the relevant forums. The central aim of NATO’s cyber defence policy is to make the Alliance resilient and to protect NATO’s own networks. At the United Nations, Germany will continue to work hard to address numerous new issues concerning the application of interna- tional law in cyberspace and to maintain and improve openness, security and legal certainty in cyberspace. Bilateral cyber consultations and cooperation with selected partner countries with which Germany is pursuing development cooperation can rein- force this process and achieve a global minimum level of cyber security. Strengthen- ing international law enforcement also plays a special role. In the case of cyber attacks which use foreign systems, the use of diplomatic chan- nels is always also to be considered, in addition to measures to protect and restore the systems affected and to prosecute the perpetrators. 30 Strategic objectives and measures Actively shaping effective European cyber security policy Security is a cornerstone of the digital single market. Germany will work to make sure that IT security is sufficiently taken into account in all digitalization process- es, for example by means of a European data location policy based on data se- curity and of European rules for international data exchange which pay attention to data protection. Germany will participate in EU pilot projects addressing the legal and technical issues related to the cross-border processing and use of data. Key elements in- clude the cross-border application of electronic identification, qualified electronic signatures, digital stamps for businesses and government agencies and other electronic trust services. Germany will also strive to make the Common Foreign and Security Policy pay greater attention to cyber security. Further, the Federal Government will help the German IT security research community form networks at European level and position itself in EU measures in order to take an active role in forming the European research landscape and research programmes. Further developing NATO’s cyber defence policy As a cornerstone of German and Euro-Atlantic security, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization depends on sufficient protection against attacks from cyberspace in order to fulfil its core tasks, especially in the area of collective defence and in the framework of international stabilization missions. In adapting to the changing se- curity environment, the Alliance must also continue to develop its cyber defence policy. Germany will actively participate in this process. The aim is to steadily im- prove the resilience of Allies and of the Alliance as a whole, and to increase their deterrence and defence capabilities, not least in the context of hybrid threats. NATO has recognized cyberspace as a domain of operations, reflecting the in- creased importance of cyber defence policy. Shaping international cyber security In the international community, access to and use of digital technologies varies greatly between countries and regions. The relevant forums pursue sometimes 31 diverging policy and economic goals. At the UN, Germany will continue to con- tribute to the debates on applying international law to the actions of states and non-state actors: To expand the system of international norms, Germany will par- ticularly engage in efforts to develop norms, rules, principles and additional rec- ommendations for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. In view of interna- tional cyber threats, Germany will also advocate measures to maintain interna- tional stability and increase the UN’s capacities in this area. Germany supports deliberations on how, on a global level, the problem of attributing cyber attacks can be addressed and the sharing of information can be promoted, the latter of which is essential in this regard. International laws that can be enforced across German and European borders must make economic espionage and cyber at- tacks more difficult to carry out. Germany will actively support international efforts to make the export control regime stricter with regard to surveillance technolo- gies. In view of the threat of escalation caused by incidents in cyberspace, confi- dence-building measures must be implemented, improved and expanded. Exist- ing forums and partnerships can be used for this purpose. Efforts within the OSCE, in which Germany has been involved since the beginning, thus play a pi- oneering role. The Federal Government will furthermore establish a German institute for inter- national cyber security, intended to bring together private industry, the research community and government organizations in the interest of international stability and crisis prevention, and to serve as a reliable and independent adviser to gov- ernments. Bilateral and regional support and cooperation for cyber capacity building Special needs arise where resources, infrastructure and capacities for cyber se- curity are lacking. Cyber threats and attacks can greatly hinder or reverse the economic, social and political development of certain countries and demographic groups. Germany will help selected partner countries and regions build up their cyber security prevention and response capabilities (network robustness and re- silience). This includes encouraging other regions to agree on confidence- building measures and to increase security. In its development policy, the Feder- al Government is working to realize the potential of digitalization worldwide and 32 to counteract the related risks. Security aspects play a key role in building and supporting digital infrastructures in partner countries with which Germany is pur- suing development cooperation. All over the world, the Federal Government is viewed as a trustworthy actor. It can also utilize existing skills to increase the help it provides to partner countries and regions through cyber capacity building. This includes developing its own cyber security strategies, legislation, institutions, certification, research, basic and advanced training and regional initiatives. The necessary conditions and aware- ness to ensure the secure and dependable use of cyberspace require support especially where development policy has provided access to cyberspace for the first time. Strengthening international law enforcement Germany will work hard at international level to fight cyber crime. To do so, it will increase cross-border law enforcement and joint police investigative capabilities. The Federal Government will work to improve the international regulatory frame- work for threat prevention and law enforcement and will actively participate in ex- isting initiatives at international level to further develop the legal framework for cross-border law enforcement investigations in cyberspace. In addition, it is ex- amining ways to simplify and expedite requests for legal assistance with selected international partners to ensure effective law enforcement. The Federal Government will also continue to encourage as many countries as possible to join the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and transpose it into national law. 33 Ongoing strategy development in the National Cyber Security Council An open-ended cyber security strategy must not be limited to defining strategic measures. Instead, digital change should be accompanied by an ongoing strategy process on cyber security issues out of which additional strategic measures may evolve. New threats must be recognized early and innovative solutions investigated and worked out. The National Cyber Security Council, established with the 2011 Cyber Security Strategy to serve the Federal Government as a strategic adviser, is supposed to play a key role in this regard. The National Cyber Security Council brings together high-level representatives from the federal (Federal Chancellery, Federal Foreign Office and the federal ministries of the Interior, Defence, Economic Affairs and Energy, Justice and Consumer Protection, Finance, Education and Re- search, and Transport and Digital Infrastructure; additional ministries as needed) and state levels, as well as the private sector, thereby offering a suitable format to ad- vance the strategic cyber security issues most important for Germany. The National Cyber Security Council identifies long-term trends and needs for action, then develops ideas for strengthening cyber security in the areas of action men- tioned. These ideas are then incorporated into the efforts of the Federal Government. In future, the National Cyber Security Council will increasingly draw on expertise from society, private industry and the research community. Invited experts speaking on individual strategic topics will provide background for discussion and for drawing up recommendations for action. In Action Area 1, based on the latest technical developments, the National Cyber Se- curity Council should propose further national rules to improve cyber security. In Ac- tion Area 2, the Council should indicate further fields of cooperation between gov- ernment and the private sector to increase cyber security and should make relevant proposals for implementation. In Action Area 3, the Council should address the fed- eral cyber security architecture and offer important ideas for the Federal Government and Standing Conference of Interior Ministers. In Action Area 4, the Council should seek contact with similar strategic bodies of other key international partners to gen- erate new ideas for national cyber security policy. 34 The Council will regularly provide a written report to the Federal Cabinet informing the latter of the results it has achieved on the various strategic issues. The report will be presented to the Cabinet for its information. 35 Glossary Definitions Preliminary remarks: The following definitions apply to this Cyber Security Strategy and are intended to enhance its clarity and consistency. The validity of definitions found in other contexts in the area of cyber security remains unaffected. cyber threat prevention Cyber threat prevention includes all measures intended to preserve or increase cyber security. cyber attack A cyber attack is an effect on one or more other information technology systems in or through cyberspace with the aim of using information technology to interfere with its IT security. cyberspace Cyberspace is the virtual area of all information technology systems in the world which are or could be interconnected at data level. Cyberspace as a publicly ac- cessible network is based on the Internet, which can be expanded by means of any other data networks. cyber security Cyber security is the IT security of all information technology systems which are and could be interconnected at data level in cyberspace. cyber defence Cyber defence covers the defensive and offensive capabilities in cyberspace which the Bundeswehr possesses to fulfil its constitutional tasks and which are suitable and necessary for operational command or to avert (military) cyber at- tacks and thus to protect own information, IT, weapons and other systems. This also includes the use and co-design of cyber defence structures, processes and reporting in defence-relevant aspects and situations. 36 information technology Information technology (IT) includes all technical means to process or transmit in- formation. Processing information includes the collecting, recording, using, stor- ing, transmitting, software-driven processing, in-house presentation and disclo- sure of information. information-technology system An information-technology system (IT system) is a technical system to process information which constitutes a complete functional unit. Typical IT systems are servers, clients, stand-alone computers, mobile telephones, routers, switches and security gateways. IT security IT security (also known as information security) means the fact that the authentic- ity, confidentiality, integrity and availability of an information-technology system and the data processed and stored in it are intact.",

New ways of communicating and of ac-  cessing knowledge and innovative design lead to greater social interaction, new   business models and new fields for research and development. Interconnected elec-  tronic devices have a growing influence on our daily lives and work. The growth of   machine-generated data and the proliferation of smart meters and sensors are creat-  ing enormous amounts of data. Machines are learning on their own how to take on   increasingly complex tasks. Routines and production processes are becoming in-  creasingly interconnected and innovation cycles are speeding up. Borderless cyber-  space demands new approaches. Government has the responsibility to work with the   private sector and other actors in order to assess these processes of change in the   public interest, actively influence them and create the conditions for their further de-  velopment.      The ongoing digital revolution brings both opportunities and risks and therefore re-  quires trust. There is no such thing as 100% security; there will always be potential   for misuse. The task of government and the private sector is to lay the groundwork   for such trust. Security is an important part of this effort. Individuals must be able to   use the new technologies safely and autonomously, even when these technologies   and the risks of using them are too complicated for ordinary people to understand   fully. In this digital age, companies must be able to protect their intellectual property   against unauthorized access and control their production processes even when using   self-learning machines or cloud services that store their data on servers all over the   world.       The Federal Government’s Cyber Security Strategy for Germany that was adopted in   February 2011 provided an important outline for forward-looking cyber security poli-  cy. Many of the measures proposed in that strategy have since been carried out. For   example, the National Cyber Security Council is a high-level body for strategic initia-  tives at the interface between government and industry, while the National Cyber Re-  sponse Centre serves as a platform for government agencies to share strategic and   operational information. Since 2011, cyber security has become a key element of   many strategic plans and interministerial projects of the Federal Government. It is           4   now clear that government institutions too must work together to ensure cyber securi-  ty. In cyberspace, it is no longer possible to distinguish clearly between internal and   external security. Maintaining cyber security and defending against cyber attacks   have thus become a task for government as a whole.      The strategic approaches and objectives of the 2011 Cyber Security Strategy remain   largely valid today. However, constantly changing conditions have made it necessary   to expand the strategy and incorporate it into a larger interministerial effort which   pays appropriate attention to the relevance and horizontal nature of cyber security   and addresses this issue in a comprehensive way.       The 2016 Cyber Security Strategy provides the interministerial strategic framework   for the Federal Government’s activities related to cyber security and updates the   2011 Cyber Security Strategy. The federal states (Länder) and private industry were   included in the process of developing the new strategy.                  5   Cyber threat situation   The cyber threat situation in Germany is characterized by the increasing complexity   and interdependence of the technology used and by constantly changing threats. The   digitalization of modern societies has made them more vulnerable and increased the   possibility of misuse in cyberspace. It also makes it much easier to attack the private   sphere of individuals.      The impact of cyber attacks is not limited to cyberspace. Successful attacks may   cause economic, political and even personal harm. Attacks on government institu-  tions for the purpose of spying or sabotage can interfere with the functioning of public   administration, the armed forces and the security authorities, thereby having an im-  pact on public security and order in Germany. Cyber attacks on the energy supply   network can shut down large segments of public and private life. Targeted cyber at-  tacks on banking infrastructure or market manipulation can threaten the financial   markets, with far-reaching consequences for the economy of Germany and the rest   of the world. The manipulation of IT health-care applications, of IT-supported traffic   routing systems or of self-driving cars and digital networks with which cars can com-  municate with each other and with traffic infrastructure can lead to very real threats to   life and health. Intentionally spreading false information with the help of hacked IT   systems can be used to manipulate public opinion, creating long-term threats to our   open society and democracy.       Attackers often have a criminal, extremist/terrorist, military or intelligence back-  ground. The quantitative and qualitative diversity of potential actors at home and   abroad and the technical possibilities for disguise make it difficult to detect, prevent   and prosecute cyber attacks and identify attackers. Political and military conflicts are   often accompanied by cyber campaigns or are waged in cyberspace below the   threshold of armed conflict. This makes it more difficult to assess the political signifi-  cance of cyber attacks and to decide what counter-measures to take.       The number and sophistication of cyber attacks is constantly growing, while IT sys-  tems are often inadequately protected. Some attacks show a high level of profes-  sionalism. Today, the tools to carry out attacks are available to state actors, criminal   groups and individuals alike. Classic defences are often inadequate to protect           6   against sophisticated malware. Attackers have the technical skills to keep their at-  tacks from being detected and to cover their own tracks. This is why it is becoming   harder and harder to detect cyber attacks and who is responsible for them without a   great deal of time and effort. We can assume that many attacks have so far gone   undiscovered. This threat situation will have a significant impact on government, in-  dustry and society in Germany in the coming years.                     7   Guiding principles of the Cyber Security Strategy      Germany must maintain its sovereignty and ability to function even in the digital   age. Cyber security policy that is ready for the future will enable our country to   take full advantage of the enormous opportunities and potential of the digital rev-  olution to the benefit of all, by keeping the related risks under control.       Ensuring freedom and security is a core task of the state, also in cyberspace. So it is   also a task of the state to protect individuals and businesses in Germany against   threats from cyberspace and to prevent and prosecute crime in cyberspace. In the   digital age, the state can perform these tasks effectively for the long term only by of-  fering businesses and individuals protection and freedom to develop also in cyber-  space. To do so, the state must make sure its own systems are secure. In view of the   potential for digital innovation, the state must recognize possible developments and   their relevance for cyber security issues at an early stage based on the necessary   risk analysis; it must also investigate possible new solutions and incorporate them   into public policy.       Cyber security results first of all from risk-appropriate behaviour and the use of se-  cure systems in the operators’ and users’ area of responsibility. Many cyber attacks   can be prevented with reasonable effort simply by taking tried and tested basic   measures, such as consistently using risk-appropriate, effective and up-to-date secu-  rity products and standards.       Close cooperation and coordination is necessary to prevent, detect, identify, defend   against and prosecute cyber attacks. Government, private industry, society and the   research community all share responsibility for ensuring the security of cyberspace.   They must therefore also coordinate their response to current challenges. Due to in-  terdependencies and threats that often extend across national borders, close Euro-  pean and international coordination is essential from the perspective of foreign and   security policy.       As a result, the Federal Government’s cyber security policy in the coming years will   set priorities in the following four areas of action:           8      1. Remaining safe and autonomous in a digital environment   2. Government and private industry working together   3. Strong and sustainable cyber security architecture for every level of govern-  ment    4. Germany’s active role in European and international cyber security policy       The measures in each of these four areas affect all areas of society to differing de-  grees.                 9   Action area 1: Remaining safe and autonomous in a digital environment      A cornerstone of cyber security is the ability to be safe and in control in a digital   environment. Individual users, businesses, government and others in Germany   must be able to understand and assess the opportunities and risks involved in   using information technology and to adjust their behaviour accordingly (ability to   assess). For them to do so, trustworthy technologies and conditions must be   available.      The possibility to be safe and in control in cyberspace lies within the context of   technological or digital autonomy. It is based on targeted digital education for all   ages and types of users. To counteract digital carelessness, awareness of cyber   security must become firmly anchored in society.       In order to take advantage of what digitalization offers, all user groups must be   able to access trustworthy and secure IT systems, thereby reducing their digital   vulnerability. An important part of this is user-friendly and practical solutions – al-  so those made in Germany – based on globally applicable technical architecture.   So are targeted IT security research and development, needs- and user-based   certification policy, support for secure electronic identities and encryption of both   electronic communications and of services offered via the Internet. National regu-  lations should be revised as necessary in line with current security needs. At the   same time, the Federal Government will continue to work in the European Union   and in international organizations on behalf of appropriate and uniform IT security   standards and effective legislation.            10   Strategic objectives and measures:       Promoting digital literacy among all users   Responsible behaviour in cyberspace and awareness of the opportunities and   specific risks when using IT systems are an integral part of digital literacy. Digital   education must therefore become firmly integrated in the educational system,   from school and the dual system of vocational education and training, to universi-  ty, continuing professional training and general adult education. The federal   states have primary responsibility for schools and universities. By the time young   people finish school, they should all have the basic technical understanding and   fundamental skills to use information and communications technology safely. The   federal and state governments must work more closely together in this area. The   Federal Government will align the dual system of vocational education and train-  ing more closely with the needs of digital society and will amend the training reg-  ulations accordingly. Vocational training centres for multiple employers are being   equipped for the digital age. They must be able to offer high-quality continuing   training in this area. The necessary investment in equipment has high funding   priority. The Federal Government will also work with trade and labour unions as   well as employers to create more flexible and individual digital continuing train-  ing.       The Federal Government will also push to expand course offerings in this area by   establishing additional university chairs and by supporting leading institutions in   the field of STEM education, in particular in computer science, for example with   regard to Big Data analyses, industrial software and IT security. In the process,   the Federal Government will also support greater cooperation with private indus-  try, for example in the form of foundations and externally funded teaching and re-  search posts.       Countering digital carelessness   In addition to education, responsible and risk-averse behaviour requires regular   awareness-raising to counteract users’ digital carelessness at home and at work.   To this end, the Federal Government will work with initiatives such as Deutsch-  land sicher im Netz e.V. (Germany secure on the Internet) to promote efforts to           11   increase awareness tailored to specific groups. The Federal Government also   provides funding for specific projects to increase media literacy. The Federal   Government initiatives related to cyber security and society are being expanded   and updated. This also includes the public discourse on horizontal cyber policy   issues using targeted formats. It is also necessary to counteract digital careless-  ness in businesses. Appointing IT security officers to drive the drafting and im-  plementation of IT security measures is an effective, tried and tested way to ac-  complish this. To make cyber threats more visible, it is also necessary to provide   the public with the latest information on the security aspects of IT products and   services. For this reason, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) will   expand its units dealing with public warnings and information on how to deal with   IT security gaps.       Creating the conditions for secure electronic communication and safe web offer-  ings   Secure and trustworthy electronic communication that cannot be manipulated is   fundamental for individuals to be able to enjoy the rights related to communica-  tion, the right to privacy and the right to control one’s own image. For businesses,   it constitutes important protection against cyber spying and is thus the foundation   for their financial success. Easy and secure encryption ensures confidential elec-  tronic communication for all and should become standard. The Federal Govern-  ment explicitly welcomes research projects and industry initiatives aimed at this   goal. The consistent use of strong encryption for web offerings will further in-  crease security on the Internet. The Federal Government will analyse the specific   barriers to the use of encryption and will promote initiatives to reduce these bar-  riers.      Along with this approach, which could be called “security through encryption”,   Germany is also pursuing the approach of “security despite encryption”. Users   must have access to the highest level of protection for their data, values and   rights. At the same time, Germany’s law enforcement and security authorities are   allowed, under strict legal conditions, to decrypt or bypass encrypted communi-  cations if necessary in the individual case to carry out their duties as required by   law. To keep these powers from being undermined, the technical decryption ca-          12   pabilities of the law enforcement and security authorities must keep up with tech-  nical developments in encryption.       Secure electronic identities   In parallel with promoting secure electronic communications, the strategies for   securely identifying persons and things should be expanded. Users must have   access to secure, user-friendly and modern means of authentication on the Inter-  net. The current standard of user name/password is widespread but not secure; it   should be added to or if possible replaced. Identification documents with an   online ID function are central; the Federal Government already provides such   documents as a highly secure way to identify oneself on the Internet without   shedding lots of data. The aim is to establish the online ID function, and secure   identities based on it, as a standard means of identification for sensitive services,   then to further develop this function and promote equally secure solutions in the   private sector.       The Federal Government also advocates standardized identity management in   all German public administration and is calling on makers of information and   communications technology to work with Germany’s IT security industry to devel-  op and bring to market trustworthy products and services.       Strengthening certification and approval: Introducing a quality label for IT security    Effective, needs-based certificates and quality labels are an important tool for   disseminating cyber security standards. Certifying or approving IT security prod-  ucts is already an established and recognized procedure. But it only covers a   small segment of the information technology in use today. For this reason, the   Federal Government encourages makers of standard technology in particular to   certify more of their products. It will also introduce a basic certification procedure   for secure IT consumer products, with criteria to be defined by the BSI. At the   same time, the BSI’s existing resources for drafting technical guidelines, certify-  ing and supporting the national accreditation agency for IT security will be in-  creased and the relevant processes streamlined in the interest of all involved. In   the process, it will be necessary to use modern processes to overcome the chal-  lenge of rigorous but time-consuming certification and approval processes at a           13   time of shorter technology cycles. For example, this challenge can be met effi-  ciently through greater involvement and accreditation of businesses and integrat-  ing them more thoroughly in the certification process. Scalable and delegated   processes in accordance with BSI standards will be considered for this purpose.   The Federal Government will advocate expanding the European and internation-  al agreements for IT security certification based on common criteria for evaluat-  ing security (Common Criteria, ISO/IEC 15408 and ISO/IEC 27000) in order to   enable greater international recognition of these criteria.      In certain areas, labelling IT security features of products and services is still a   special challenge. To make the security of IT products and services more trans-  parent for individuals and small and medium-sized businesses, the Federal Gov-  ernment will increase its activities related to IT security quality labels and certifi-  cates and will make suitable proposals, especially concerning shared systems for   certification and a standardized system of labelling. In future, a single quality la-  bel should help prospective buyers tell easily and quickly which IT products and   services are designed to be secure and thus help protect data. Such a label is in-  tended to make cyber security easier to understand and achieve.       Making digitalization secure   Individual consumers and businesses expect government to evaluate and active-  ly influence the changes brought by digitalization. Examples include the E-Health   Act (E-Health-Gesetz) and the IT Security Act (IT-Sicherheitsgesetz). We must   continue to pursue this approach, paying attention to new technologies, new   business models and changing user behaviour as well as new threats and new   European and international regulations, such as the EU’s Directive 2016/1148 on   security of network and information systems. Requirements for the appropriate   distribution of responsibilities and security risks on the Internet, for example by   means of security requirements for makers of hard- and software and product li-  ability rules for inadequate IT security, are being considered. The impacts of the   use of digital technologies, especially on cyber security, should be taken into ac-  count already when drafting federal legislation and regulations.               14   And requiring the early implementation of security requirements should be al-  lowed by law in order to ensure security by design. For this purpose, the BSI   serves the federal ministries as a central source of advice.       As mobility becomes increasingly digitalized and more data are generated as a   result, new cross-border requirements are needed to ensure the safety of vehi-  cles and infrastructure and to protect privacy. Germany will play an active role in   creating international standards especially at the level of UNECE to ensure suffi-  cient protection against manipulation and misuse of technical structures, data   and processes.      Advancing IT security research   New, all-encompassing IT security solutions are needed to be able to take full   advantage of the opportunities offered by digitalization, such as Industry 4.0,   medical technology and Mobility 4.0. This is why innovative IT security solutions   for tomorrow must be researched and implemented today. The Federal Govern-  ment is expanding its research framework programme on IT security, Selbstbes-  timmt und sicher in der digitalen Welt 2015–2020 (Independent and safe in the   digital world 2015–2020), and closely linking it to other measures of the Cyber   Security Strategy.       The existing centres of excellence for IT security research will also be further   strengthened: CRISP in Darmstadt, CISPA in Saarbrücken and KASTEL in Karls-  ruhe. These centres address current research topics, provide estimates and as-  sessments for policy-makers and develop concrete solutions. The results of gov-  ernment-funded projects should be applied and marketed in products and pro-  cesses as quickly as possible. In the area of military applications of IT and cyber   security, this is the task of the cyber cluster at the Bundeswehr University in Mu-  nich, with its Cyber Defence and Smart Data (CODE) research centre. The com-  mercial application and further development by businesses and start-ups of inno-  vative ideas in the field of IT security should be an explicit goal of government in-  vestment in order to bring about the greatest possible economic benefit. Active   technology scouting can help discover, introduce and further refine the latest           15   technologies. Private venture capital investors can also play an important role in   this regard.               16   Action area 2: Government and private industry working together       Trusting cooperation and close interaction between government and the private   sector are essential to maintain a high level of cyber security in Germany over   the long term. New avenues should be taken as part of a cooperative approach   in order to combine strengths.       Businesses in Germany must be able to protect themselves and their customers ef-  fectively against cyber attacks. Operators of critical infrastructure deserve special   attention. But other businesses are also very important for government, society and   the economy and require special protection. With the help of the cooperative ap-  proach established with the IT Security Act, the necessary conditions should be im-  proved and extended to other economic sectors as needed. Government and private   industry need to work together closely and on the basis of mutual trust in developing   and implementing effective, needs-based IT security standards. For this to happen,   Germany needs a strong IT industry promoted with the help of modern economic pol-  icy. The Federal Government will also draft measures to improve Germany’s start-up   culture in the field of IT and cyber security, which is weak in international comparison.   In detecting and averting cyber attacks, it is essential to include providers and IT se-  curity services in Germany.       Strategic objectives and measures      Securing critical infrastructures   Protecting critical infrastructures is the central focus of joint activities by govern-  ment and the private sector. The interconnectedness of these systems means   that protecting the IT of critical infrastructures is especially important. This cyber   prevention and defence task is shared by the federal, state and local govern-  ments, because internal and external security in the cyber area are closely inter-  related. In implementing the IT Security Act, government and the private sector   must work together closely at all levels and share information on the basis of   trust, among others in the public–private partnership UP KRITIS. Minimum   standards and reporting channels are drafted, implemented and further devel-  oped in cooperation with the private sector. Whether to extend such obligations           17   concerning prevention and response to other businesses with great relevance for   society will also be considered.      Protecting businesses in Germany    The Federal Government will expand and increase links between its offerings to   increase awareness and support German business and industry. Medium-sized   businesses in particular must be able to protect themselves effectively against   threats in and from cyberspace in order to take full advantage of the opportunities   associated with digitalization. The relevant implementation strategies should be   developed by government, the private sector and the research community work-  ing together. Government should provide concrete support for businesses to help   them achieve the necessary level of IT security. Businesses and government   agencies must be able to trust each other to handle sensitive topics professional-  ly and with discretion.      The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) and the central   cyber crime contact point of the federal and state police play a key role in pre-  venting cyber crime and espionage against businesses. The Federal Govern-  ment will also work with the private sector and research community to expand ex-  isting initiatives, such as the Allianz für Cyber-Sicherheit (Alliance for cyber secu-  rity), the German Competence Center against Cyber-Crime (G4C), and the initia-  tives IT-Sicherheit in der Wirtschaft (IT security in the private sector) and Initiative   Wirtschaftsschutz (Economic security initiative), and to strengthen the connec-  tions between them, also to create synergies.       Strengthening Germany’s IT industry   Cyber security in Germany requires a strong and innovative German IT industry   based on secure network infrastructures and on identifying key technologies in   the field of IT security and defence from trustworthy IT manufacturers. To make   Germany’s IT industry more competitive, the Federal Government will promote   the quality label “IT Security Made in Germany” and expand the existing instru-  ments for foreign trade. In national key technology fields, networks with the na-  tional IT security industry should be strengthened and own capacities should be   built up, promoted and protected wherever possible and useful.            18      Further, a broader portfolio of qualified, trustworthy service providers is needed,   for example for IT security solutions, forensics, and attack detection and re-  sponse. Here too users should be able to rely on a broader range of service pro-  viders. The Federal Government provides support for IT companies through spe-  cial research programmes. In joint projects with universities, research institutes   and other private-sector partners, they develop innovative approaches for new   products and services.      Working with providers    Working with providers plays a key role. In the framework of current law, this is   especially true of provider activities to detect cyber threats, deal with known inci-  dents/infections and reduce the impact of ongoing attacks. One effective option   for improving data security on the Internet in general is to increase the use of   sensors, in compliance with data protection regulations, to detect anomalies. The   findings should be anonymized or pseudonymized to protect the rights of data   subjects.       Getting providers of IT security services involved   At a time when skilled IT workers are in short supply, government and the private   sector have an interest in encouraging the mutual exchange of IT expertise and   the creation of expert networks. In the framework of applicable law, private pro-  viders of IT security services will be more involved in case of need than in other   areas of government activity. The Federal Government will therefore take target-  ed advantage of possibilities to promote skilled and trustworthy IT security ser-  vice providers. It will also work with representatives of Germany’s IT security in-  dustry to develop and carry out staff exchange programmes in the field of cyber   security. In doing so, protecting government confidentiality and official secrecy is   just as important as protecting trade secrets.       Creating a platform for sharing information on the basis of mutual trust   The cooperative approach also includes intensive information-sharing. For this   purpose, the Federal Government will institutionalize a cooperation platform for   government and the private sector; within the predefined legal boundaries, this           19   platform will above all enable the sharing of information relevant for averting   cyber attacks.                  20   Action area 3: Strong and sustainable cyber security architecture for eve-  ry level of government       Government must ensure security, law and freedom in our country, also in cy-  berspace. This requires up-to-date cyber security architecture that effectively   connects the various actors at federal level without losing sight of the state and   local governments and the private sector.       The ongoing digital revolution means that many federal and state government agen-  cies today deal with cyber security issues. The range of tasks is broad, extending (in   compliance with the constitutionally imposed limits) from prevention, threat preven-  tion and law enforcement to counter-espionage, intelligence-gathering and cyber de-  fence. Both internal and external security in cyberspace are equally affected. Gov-  ernment institutions must be organized in such a way that they can fulfil their duty to   protect society also in the digital age and can protect themselves against cyber at-  tack.      In this context, modern cyber security architecture regards cyber security as an ongo-  ing national task. It is essential that, in case of need, information is shared and the   performance of tasks is coordinated efficiently. Synergies among ministries and   agencies at all levels of government and across national borders are especially im-  portant. At federal level, the National Cyber Response Centre already offers the nec-  essary structure for individual actors to work together within their respective roles and   responsibilities. This cooperation should be intensified and the federal states more   closely involved. The Federal Government will review the legal responsibilities as   well as the technical and staffing capabilities, bring them more closely into line and   adjust them as needed. This is the only way to ensure that government remains able   to prevent, detect, investigate, avert and prosecute cyber attacks even in the digital   age.       Strategic objectives and measures      Further developing the National Cyber Response Centre           21   In carrying out the 2011 Cyber Security Strategy, the National Cyber Response   Centre was established under the leadership of the Federal Ministry of the Interi-  or to strengthen information-sharing among the relevant federal agencies. At the   Centre, the federal agencies responsible for cyber security issues currently share   information on cyber incidents as well as their assessments and analyses.      This activity will be further intensified. To improve the ability to avert cyber at-  tacks, the Centre must be suitably organized within the framework of cyber secu-  rity architecture for all levels of government. As an inter-ministerial institution, un-  der the supervision of the Federal Ministry of the Interior the Centre will be further   developed into a central platform for cooperation and coordination. In future, the   Centre will have its own evaluation and analysis capabilities and a current cyber   situation report reflecting the cyber security situation in Germany. In case of   cyber attack, it is crucial for all national actors to inform each other and coordi-  nate their response in compliance with applicable law. If a cyber attack originates   abroad, foreign and security policy aspects must also be taken into account. In   case of cyber security incidents affecting numerous institutions across Germany,   the Centre becomes a crisis response centre. In this case, the affected IT sys-  tems can be secured and restored and cyber attacks investigated and averted   only through coordinated measures taken by the national actors. This operational   cooperation is to be coordinated more intensively. The planning and implementa-  tion of joint exercises and reciprocal training are also to be established.       The federal states are invited to share their capabilities in this coordination pro-  cess in the context of tasks performed by every level of government.      Improving local analysis and response capability   Recent cyber attacks have shown that there are hardly any institutionalized gov-  ernment structures, other than the usual IT security measures, to help those af-  fected assess an incident quickly and locally. Firstly, this involves managing se-  curity incidents in technical terms, for which the BSI has special expertise. Sec-  ondly, cyber attacks may require action by the local security authorities based on   the relevant law. The National Cyber Response Centre oversees the necessary   coordination for such operations involving multiple authorities while respecting           22   the legal limits. The interests of these authorities in restoring IT systems, investi-  gating incidents and prosecuting the perpetrators are taken into account, as are   the interests in protection of the party affected.      The BSI will set up Mobile Incident Response Teams (MIRTs) to analyse and   clear up cyber incidents affecting institutions which are especially important to   society. On request, these teams will travel to constitutional bodies, federal   agencies, critical infrastructure operators and similarly important institutions to   help them deal quickly and flexibly with the technical aspects of managing securi-  ty incidents, when there is a special public interest in doing so. This assistance is   intended to rapidly restore the safe technical operations of the institution con-  cerned.      Cyber attacks may also require action by federal security authorities. For this   reason, the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) is setting up a specialized in-  vestigative unit, the Quick Reaction Force (QRF). In consultation with the re-  sponsible public prosecutor’s office or the Office of the Federal Prosecutor, the   QRF will take the first action that cannot be delayed under the Code of Criminal   Procedure on behalf of the law enforcement authorities. The Federal Office for   the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) is creating Mobile Cyber Teams made up   of IT specialists, intelligence specialists experienced in analysing cyber attacks   and, if necessary, staff with foreign language skills. These teams will travel to the   scene of cyber attacks with an intelligence or extremist/terrorist background, in-  cluding possible sabotage cases. The Military Counterintelligence Service (MAD)   handles this task for agencies within the defence remit. As far as allowed by law,   the Federal Intelligence Service (BND) may monitor attacks as they are being   prepared and carried out. Information flows resulting from attacks are also regis-  tered. The Bundeswehr may also contribute, as far as allowed by the Constitu-  tion, to security preparedness with its Incident Response Teams and other rele-  vant units.      Classic preventive measures may not be enough to deal with serious cyber at-  tacks in the necessary time. The Federal Government will therefore examine the           23   legal framework to determine whether government agencies could conduct net-  work operations and if so, what technical options they could use in these cases.      Intensifying law enforcement in cyberspace   The Federal Government will further intensify its efforts to fight cyber crime in the   coming years. To do so, intensive information-sharing and knowledge transfer at   national and international level will be necessary.       Justice and law enforcement authorities will also need additional technical and   specialized capabilities. The relevant basic and advanced training curriculum is   being developed. The Federal Government will also work to improve the condi-  tions for recruiting and developing skilled staff in the fields of investigation, cyber   crime and digital forensics.       High-performance analysis and evaluation systems are to be built for the federal   and state-level security authorities.       The Federal Government will work to make sure that the powers and capabilities   of the security authorities keep up with the latest technological developments so   that there are no gaps in threat prevention and law enforcement. Investigative   measures in the field of information technology surveillance must not be depend-  ent on a particular technology, to ensure that they remain efficient and state of   the art.       Fighting cyber espionage and sabotage effectively   For foreign intelligence services, cyber attacks on government IT systems and   those of businesses, research institutes and their employees represent a signifi-  cant source of information. The Federal Government has responded by reorgan-  izing its counterintelligence efforts and will continue its 360° monitoring of all ac-  tivities by foreign intelligence services in Germany. The BfV’s directorate-general   for counterintelligence has added staff and undergone targeted restructuring,   with a focus on cyber espionage: technical and expert analysis and evaluation of   attacks on federal agencies and other targets which are thought to be the work of           24   intelligence services. The BfV will also increase its efforts to fight cyber attacks   with an extremist or terrorist background.      An early-warning system for cyber attacks from abroad   As mandated by law, the BND monitors cyber spying and other cyber attacks   from abroad targeting government and/or critical infrastructures in Germany and   can send potential targets an early warning to take the necessary defensive ac-  tion (Signals Intelligence Support to Cyber Defence (SSCD)). In this way, the   BND is using IT specialists and experienced analysts to create an early-warning   system for cyber attacks. Once detected, attacks are assessed in terms of their   quantity and quality in order to get a picture of the current threat situation.      Centre for Information Technology of Security Authorities (ZITiS)    The national security authorities must be as effective in the digital environment   as in other areas. To help them with their operational cyber capabilities and to   take advantage of synergies, a centre for technical support for the federal securi-  ty and expert authorities, including the intelligence services, is being set up within   the remit of the Federal Ministry of the Interior. The centre’s tasks will be support-  ive and based on those of the authorities they serve. Development, support and   advising the security authorities will have priority. This Centre for Information   Technology of Security Authorities (ZITiS) will work closely with these authorities   to develop the necessary methods, products and strategies for the security au-  thorities to use in their operations. ZITiS itself will have no operational powers.       Strengthening the defensive aspects of cyber security   As a military part of overall defence, cyber defence is a constitutionally mandated   task of the Bundeswehr and is subject to national and international rules govern-  ing Bundeswehr operations. According to the 2016 White Paper, defensive as-  pects of national cyber security are the originary responsibility of the Federal Min-  istry of Defence and the Bundeswehr. Cyber prevention, foreign and international   cyber security policy and cyber defence are three supplementary means to   achieve cyber security. The defence capabilities of the Bundeswehr in cyber-  space are also an integral part of cyber security architecture. This is demonstrat-  ed by the similar content in the technical implementation of protective measures           25   and by using and sharing cyber defence structures, processes and reporting with   regard to defence-related aspects and situations. As high-tech army deployed   around the world, the Bundeswehr constantly faces threats in cyberspace. But   the armed forces depend on cyberspace in order to function.       Cyber defence and cyber prevention must be incorporated into all overall de-  fence planning, structures and processes. Information security and the protection   of the Bundeswehr’s IT systems are assured around the clock as a standing op-  erational task, both in Germany and in its areas of operations. For the Bun-  deswehr to perform its tasks in cyberspace, its own capabilities are being ex-  panded, the security architecture of its IT systems is being consolidated, and   previously fragmented structures are being brought together in a ministerial divi-  sion and a new, separate military organizational unit.       In addition, the Bundeswehr has special expertise, capabilities and resources   which can be made available to other government actors through administrative   assistance, within the limits allowed by constitutional law. The Bundeswehr can   also use the services of civilian businesses to help it carry out its tasks as man-  dated by the Constitution.       Strengthening CERT structures in Germany   Government and non-governmental computer emergency response teams   (CERTs) are single points of contact for technical prevention and response in the   field of IT security and are an important component of any sustainable cyber se-  curity architecture. They meet the need for information-sharing and coordination   at the IT expert level everywhere in the world. In Germany, the BSI serves as na-  tional CERT, with its CERT-Bund for the public administration; its services for   operators of critical infrastructures, the private sector and individual users; and as   single point of contact for CERTs in other countries. Other federal agencies have   independent CERTs, as do state-level public administrations, some businesses   and research institutions. These structures should be further expanded and con-  nected in a network in the interest of national cyber security. The BSI will further   intensify cooperation within the network of federal and state CERTs and with the   business and research CERTs and will bring all the key actors together to im-          26   prove and complete the existing CERT structures in Germany in an inclusive pro-  cess which builds on what has already been achieved. This process should also   take the development of the National Cyber Response Centre into account.      Keeping the federal administration secure   Rapid technological development, the growing complexity of information and   communications technology and digitalization in public administration are creat-  ing new challenges for IT security management in the federal administration as   well. The implementation plan for ensuring IT security in the federal administra-  tion (UP Bund) is the binding IT security guideline for all federal agencies and will   be revised in line with current technical and organizational developments.       The comprehensive project to consolidate federal IT (IT-Konsolidierung Bund)   seeks in principle to merge the IT operations of the direct federal administration.   One major goal of the project is to increase IT security. The project Netze des   Bundes (networks of the Federal Government) is creating a consistent and se-  cure network infrastructure for the federal administration. In a first step, the exist-  ing networks which are the responsibility of the Federal Ministry of the Interior are   being migrated to a joint network, thereby establishing a single, higher level of IT   security. In order to gradually migrate the remaining federal administration net-  works, this joint network will then serve as an integration platform for all federal IT   networks.       In addition, the Federal Government has launched a programme to promote se-  cure mobile communications. The programme seeks to increase awareness of   the need to use secure IT products and to pay attention to security-relevant fea-  tures when procuring new products. The resilience of federal IT systems will also   be increased in order to handle unavoidable incidents better.       Working more closely with federal and state governments   There are proven structures for federal and state cooperation in the areas of   cyber crime, cyber espionage and self-protection. To further strengthen this co-  operation, the BSI will be assigned the new task of assisting state-level agencies           27   which are responsible for dealing with cyber security incidents. Up to now, the   BSI has only provided such assistance to law enforcement authorities.       In 2013, the IT Planning Council adopted a guideline for information security in   the public administration, which set a general standard for the IT security of all   agencies and institutions of the federal and state administration. The federal and   state governments have agreed to jointly defend against attacks on information   infrastructures of the public administration. To improve their joint situation report,   information-sharing between the federal and state levels on cyber attacks, which   has been voluntary up to now, will be subject to a binding agreement.       In addition, more attention will be given to cyber security at local government lev-  el, for example in modernizing baseline IT security and its recommendations   concerning organization, personnel, infrastructure and technical matters. The IT   Planning Council is a suitable forum for this effort. The Federal Government sup-  ports central state-level structures to promote cyber security at local level, for ex-  ample by local IT service providers. In future, federal agencies will be able to   share more of their expertise with local governments via the federal states. The   BSI will draw up a situation report for the local level with the help of the federal   states and the national associations of local authorities.      Using resources, recruiting and developing staff    Cyber security costs money. In the coming years, major expenditures will there-  fore be necessary at federal, state and local level to keep Germany sufficiently   and permanently up to date in the area of cyber security.       Staff recruitment and development plays a key role in ensuring effective public   administration. The guideline of the IT Planning Council offers valuable infor-  mation in this regard. It will be crucial to emphasize that the public service is an   attractive employer and to make targeted use of the existing pay and employ-  ment conditions for civil servants and other government employees. Government   must also work closely with training institutions. Cyber “clusters” where govern-  ment, the private sector and the research community work together can be an   important factor for success in the competition for highly skilled workers. Staff re-          28   cruitment within the Federal Government should be more closely coordinated,   and staff exchanges should be made easier.       Access to the new cyber security course of study at the Bundeswehr University in   Munich should also be as broad as possible. The expertise of existing staff and   supervisors should be expanded and developed while creating new career and   personal prospects. In-house basic and advanced training plays a special role in   this context. The Federal Academy of Public Administration (BAköV) will offer   relevant courses, and the training modules at the Federal University of Public   Administration will be revised and added to. In addition, an innovative model is   needed for staff exchanges with private industry and businesses.       The Bundeswehr is creating a new cyber reserve pool which can serve as a   blueprint for similar civilian volunteer organizations wanting to gather and use the   existing know-how of experts from industry, research, administration and civil so-  ciety. Close cooperation with Germany’s IT industry is very important in this con-  text as well.            29   Action area 4: Germany’s active role in European and international cyber   security policy      In view of transnational interconnections in a digitalized world, a high level of   cyber security can be achieved only by embedding national measures in the rel-  evant European, regional and international processes and thereby reinforcing   them. With this in mind, Germany will continue to play an active role in European   and international cyber security policy. A clear legal framework, increased trust   and greater resilience in Europe and the rest of the world will also mean greater   protection for Germany.      Especially in the digital age, security must be understood in global terms. With regard   to measures to strengthen national and regional cyber security capabilities, Germany   will also push for interoperable cyber security architectures and standards. At Euro-  pean level, the digital single market with an emphasis on sharing secure and interop-  erable data is crucial to ensure that European cyberspace is secure. Within the   framework of existing Union competences, the same applies to police and judicial   cooperation, to the Common Foreign and Security Policy and to the European IT se-  curity research network.       Germany also actively campaigns for greater cyber security in the relevant forums.   The central aim of NATO’s cyber defence policy is to make the Alliance resilient and   to protect NATO’s own networks. At the United Nations, Germany will continue to   work hard to address numerous new issues concerning the application of interna-  tional law in cyberspace and to maintain and improve openness, security and legal   certainty in cyberspace. Bilateral cyber consultations and cooperation with selected   partner countries with which Germany is pursuing development cooperation can rein-  force this process and achieve a global minimum level of cyber security. Strengthen-  ing international law enforcement also plays a special role.       In the case of cyber attacks which use foreign systems, the use of diplomatic chan-  nels is always also to be considered, in addition to measures to protect and restore   the systems affected and to prosecute the perpetrators.              30   Strategic objectives and measures      Actively shaping effective European cyber security policy    Security is a cornerstone of the digital single market. Germany will work to make   sure that IT security is sufficiently taken into account in all digitalization process-  es, for example by means of a European data location policy based on data se-  curity and of European rules for international data exchange which pay attention   to data protection.       Germany will participate in EU pilot projects addressing the legal and technical   issues related to the cross-border processing and use of data. Key elements in-  clude the cross-border application of electronic identification, qualified electronic   signatures, digital stamps for businesses and government agencies and other   electronic trust services. Germany will also strive to make the Common Foreign   and Security Policy pay greater attention to cyber security. Further, the Federal   Government will help the German IT security research community form networks   at European level and position itself in EU measures in order to take an active   role in forming the European research landscape and research programmes.       Further developing NATO’s cyber defence policy    As a cornerstone of German and Euro-Atlantic security, the North Atlantic Treaty   Organization depends on sufficient protection against attacks from cyberspace in   order to fulfil its core tasks, especially in the area of collective defence and in the   framework of international stabilization missions. In adapting to the changing se-  curity environment, the Alliance must also continue to develop its cyber defence   policy. Germany will actively participate in this process. The aim is to steadily im-  prove the resilience of Allies and of the Alliance as a whole, and to increase their   deterrence and defence capabilities, not least in the context of hybrid threats.   NATO has recognized cyberspace as a domain of operations, reflecting the in-  creased importance of cyber defence policy.       Shaping international cyber security   In the international community, access to and use of digital technologies varies   greatly between countries and regions. The relevant forums pursue sometimes           31   diverging policy and economic goals. At the UN, Germany will continue to con-  tribute to the debates on applying international law to the actions of states and   non-state actors: To expand the system of international norms, Germany will par-  ticularly engage in efforts to develop norms, rules, principles and additional rec-  ommendations for responsible state behaviour in cyberspace. In view of interna-  tional cyber threats, Germany will also advocate measures to maintain interna-  tional stability and increase the UN’s capacities in this area. Germany supports   deliberations on how, on a global level, the problem of attributing cyber attacks   can be addressed and the sharing of information can be promoted, the latter of   which is essential in this regard. International laws that can be enforced across   German and European borders must make economic espionage and cyber at-  tacks more difficult to carry out. Germany will actively support international efforts   to make the export control regime stricter with regard to surveillance technolo-  gies. In view of the threat of escalation caused by incidents in cyberspace, confi-  dence-building measures must be implemented, improved and expanded. Exist-  ing forums and partnerships can be used for this purpose. Efforts within the   OSCE, in which Germany has been involved since the beginning, thus play a pi-  oneering role.       The Federal Government will furthermore establish a German institute for inter-  national cyber security, intended to bring together private industry, the research   community and government organizations in the interest of international stability   and crisis prevention, and to serve as a reliable and independent adviser to gov-  ernments.       Bilateral and regional support and cooperation for cyber capacity building   Special needs arise where resources, infrastructure and capacities for cyber se-  curity are lacking. Cyber threats and attacks can greatly hinder or reverse the   economic, social and political development of certain countries and demographic   groups. Germany will help selected partner countries and regions build up their   cyber security prevention and response capabilities (network robustness and re-  silience). This includes encouraging other regions to agree on confidence-  building measures and to increase security. In its development policy, the Feder-  al Government is working to realize the potential of digitalization worldwide and           32   to counteract the related risks. Security aspects play a key role in building and   supporting digital infrastructures in partner countries with which Germany is pur-  suing development cooperation.       All over the world, the Federal Government is viewed as a trustworthy actor. It   can also utilize existing skills to increase the help it provides to partner countries   and regions through cyber capacity building. This includes developing its own   cyber security strategies, legislation, institutions, certification, research, basic and   advanced training and regional initiatives. The necessary conditions and aware-  ness to ensure the secure and dependable use of cyberspace require support   especially where development policy has provided access to cyberspace for the   first time.      Strengthening international law enforcement   Germany will work hard at international level to fight cyber crime. To do so, it will   increase cross-border law enforcement and joint police investigative capabilities.   The Federal Government will work to improve the international regulatory frame-  work for threat prevention and law enforcement and will actively participate in ex-  isting initiatives at international level to further develop the legal framework for   cross-border law enforcement investigations in cyberspace. In addition, it is ex-  amining ways to simplify and expedite requests for legal assistance with selected   international partners to ensure effective law enforcement. The Federal   Government will also continue to encourage as many countries as possible to   join the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and transpose it into   national law.                     33   Ongoing strategy development in the National Cyber Security Council   An open-ended cyber security strategy must not be limited to defining strategic   measures. Instead, digital change should be accompanied by an ongoing strategy   process on cyber security issues out of which additional strategic measures may   evolve. New threats must be recognized early and innovative solutions investigated   and worked out. The National Cyber Security Council, established with the 2011   Cyber Security Strategy to serve the Federal Government as a strategic adviser, is   supposed to play a key role in this regard. The National Cyber Security Council   brings together high-level representatives from the federal (Federal Chancellery,   Federal Foreign Office and the federal ministries of the Interior, Defence, Economic   Affairs and Energy, Justice and Consumer Protection, Finance, Education and Re-  search, and Transport and Digital Infrastructure; additional ministries as needed) and   state levels, as well as the private sector, thereby offering a suitable format to ad-  vance the strategic cyber security issues most important for Germany.       The National Cyber Security Council identifies long-term trends and needs for action,   then develops ideas for strengthening cyber security in the areas of action men-  tioned. These ideas are then incorporated into the efforts of the Federal Government.   In future, the National Cyber Security Council will increasingly draw on expertise from   society, private industry and the research community. Invited experts speaking on   individual strategic topics will provide background for discussion and for drawing up   recommendations for action.      In Action Area 1, based on the latest technical developments, the National Cyber Se-  curity Council should propose further national rules to improve cyber security. In Ac-  tion Area 2, the Council should indicate further fields of cooperation between gov-  ernment and the private sector to increase cyber security and should make relevant   proposals for implementation. In Action Area 3, the Council should address the fed-  eral cyber security architecture and offer important ideas for the Federal Government   and Standing Conference of Interior Ministers. In Action Area 4, the Council should   seek contact with similar strategic bodies of other key international partners to gen-  erate new ideas for national cyber security policy.              34   The Council will regularly provide a written report to the Federal Cabinet informing   the latter of the results it has achieved on the various strategic issues. The report will   be presented to the Cabinet for its information.             35   Glossary     Definitions     Preliminary remarks: The following definitions apply to this Cyber Security Strategy   and are intended to enhance its clarity and consistency. The validity of definitions   found in other contexts in the area of cyber security remains unaffected.      cyber threat prevention   Cyber threat prevention includes all measures intended to preserve or increase   cyber security.      cyber attack    A cyber attack is an effect on one or more other information technology systems   in or through cyberspace with the aim of using information technology to interfere   with its IT security.       cyberspace   Cyberspace is the virtual area of all information technology systems in the world   which are or could be interconnected at data level. Cyberspace as a publicly ac-  cessible network is based on the Internet, which can be expanded by means of   any other data networks.       cyber security   Cyber security is the IT security of all information technology systems which are   and could be interconnected at data level in cyberspace.      cyber defence   Cyber defence covers the defensive and offensive capabilities in cyberspace   which the Bundeswehr possesses to fulfil its constitutional tasks and which are   suitable and necessary for operational command or to avert (military) cyber at-  tacks and thus to protect own information, IT, weapons and other systems. This   also includes the use and co-design of cyber defence structures, processes and   reporting in defence-relevant aspects and situations.              36   information technology    Information technology (IT) includes all technical means to process or transmit in-  formation. Processing information includes the collecting, recording, using, stor-  ing, transmitting, software-driven processing, in-house presentation and disclo-  sure of information.      information-technology system   An information-technology system (IT system) is a technical system to process   information which constitutes a complete functional unit. Typical IT systems are   servers, clients, stand-alone computers, mobile telephones, routers, switches   and security gateways.      IT security   IT security (also known as information security) means the fact that the authentic-  ity, confidentiality, integrity and availability of an information-technology system   and the data processed and stored in it are intact.",

The Zambian Government and private sectors continued rollout and investment in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) networks and systems has increased access to ICTs and the internet. These have been powerful tools for human and economic development which have simplified provision of health care, financial services, education, agriculture, mining, commerce, transportation, banking, manufacturing, energy, trade, media and broadcasting services, amongst others. Zambia’s cyberspace has also experienced continuous development. With a substantial increase in access to the internet in the country, concerns around cybersecurity have become prominent. Access to the internet has brought about a new type of risk and threat to national peace which in itself will need new forms of defence to counter it. The country remains at risk of eminent cybersecurity incidents that may significantly disrupt the healthy functioning of our cyber eco-system emanating from both local and/or international threats. Cyber-attacks are growing in prominence every day and the role these attacks play in our daily lives should not be underestimated. The average cost of combating malicious software and data breaches continues to increase, making the recovery from cybercrimes very costly to businesses. . The aim of this Policy is to establish a coordinated cybersecurity framework and enhance resilience of national ICT systems to cyber incidents in order to attain the desired transformation into a Smart Zambia that is underpinned by trust and confidentiality. The Policy also aims at reforming the legal and regulatory framework on cybersecurity and cybercrimes in the country. Successful implementation of this Policy will require extensive collaboration with all stakeholders. As the Ministry responsible for the development of the ICTs, we will endeavour to put in place a multi- sectoral framework that allows all stakeholders to play their role in the prevention and detection of and recovery from cyber-attacks and incidences. Due to the borderless nature of cybersecurity, Zambia will work closely with other countries within the SADC Region, African Union, United Nations and indeed other organisations in order to foster international cooperation in fighting against the increasing number of incidents caused by illegal activities in cyberspace. Foreword Hon. Mutotwe L. Kafwaya, MP Minister of Transport and Communications 1 National Cybersecurity Policy Forword Acknowledgement Eng.

Cyberspace is a new frontier for a variety of innovations for social and economic progress. The management of Cyberspace is important not only because of the actions of individual participants but also the infrastructure of cyberspace is now fundamental to the functioning of national and international security systems, trade networks, emergency services, basic communications, and other public and private activities. As the world enters its fourth industrial revolution shaped by the immense transformational power of digital technology, it is argued that the countries that will stand to benefit are those that will harness the new technology while safeguarding individual and national interest against a new kind of threat presented by cybercrime. Although Zambia’s journey towards the digital information age dates back many years, the launch of the ICT Policy in 2006 formally recognised ICTs to be critical in achieving national development. The 2006 ICT Policy achieved much in terms of commitments and objectives set forth. However, widespread adoption of ICTs over the years has overtaken the gains of the 2006 ICT Policy. This has been compounded by cyber threats while extensive innovations have unleashed a new wave of cybercrimes. Additionally, other intervening policy measures intended to further leverage and accelerate the nation’s move towards an information society and attain middle income status such as Vision 2030, the Seventh National Development Plan and Smart Zambia initiatives have all added a new layer of complexity to the country’s cybercrime landscape. While the country has inadequate national statistics on the nature and incidences of cybercrimes, the menace and prevalence cannot be disputed. Cybercrime in the country, as exemplified by several incidences of electronic fraud and other cyber related criminality in recent past, has been on the rise. This and the need to have a coordinated framework to respond to cyber incidences has necessitated the need for the formulation of the country’s first National Cybersecurity Policy. The thrust of this Policy is to ensure a clear, bold and decisive cybersecurity governance structure is developed to direct and drive coordinated efforts to foster defence of the Zambian cyberspace. The Policy is divided into six parts namely: Introduction, Situation Analysis, Vision, Rationale and Guiding Principles, Objectives and Implementation Framework. The Situation Analysis gives an overview of the cybersecurity situation in the country. The Rationale explains the justification for the Policy and the guiding principles upon which it is grounded. The Policy further outlines the objectives and policy measures and ends with an implementation framework which outlines the institutional arrangements and legal framework to support the implementation of the Policy. 6 National Cybersecurity PolicyIntroduction Chapter 2 — Situation Analysis 2.1 Economic Landscape of Cybersecurity in Zambia 2.1.1 Globalisation 2.1.2 Digital Inclusion 2.1.3 E-services ICTs, particularly Broadband technology, are a key contributor to economic growth at various levels. The deployment of such technologies improve productivity by facilitating the adoption of more efficient communication, resource sharing which consequently improve business processes. Further, extensive deployment of broadband accelerates innovation by introducing new consumer applications and services. According to a recent report by the World Bank on the impact of broadband on the economy, ICTs contribute 5-10% to the GDPs of countries mostly in developing countries. Further, it is estimated that for low and middle income economies, a 10 % increase in broadband penetration yields an additional 1.38% in GDP growth. The economic landscape is affected by various factors as highlighted below. The increase in the use of the internet has enhanced globalisation leading to increased social and economic interconnectedness. As a result of globalisation, there has been growth in the information society which has consequently led to increased e-commerce, e-government, innovation and access to information across borders. Due to the borderless nature of cyberspace, the area of cyber-attacks and cybercrimes has greatly increased and citizens are susceptible to cybercrimes owing to the increased use of ICTs. Zambia’s economy has been on the positive trajectory for the last eighteen (18) years leading to improved income levels for an expanded population. This has increased the up-take of ICTs by the larger part of the population in virtually all sectors of the economy. Similarly, the Government has taken significant strides in developing and investing in ICT infrastructure such as the construction of communication towers in underserved and unserved areas. This has led to more and more people being connected to the information networks and potentially be exposed to cyber threats. E-services are commercial or non-commercial in nature. There are several such services in the private sector but currently Government provides e-services to the public which include e-tax, e-pensions and e-health. According to the Seventh National Development Plan (7NDP), more than 142 e-services will be provided to the public by 2021. The reliance on modern technologies to deliver services constantly exposes citizen’s personal data and country’s Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) which includes power, water, fuel, communication, factories or commercial assets that are essential for the functioning of our society and economy, to cyber-attacks. 7 National Cybersecurity Policy Situation AnalysisSituation Analysis 2.1.4 E-commerce 2.1.5 Digital Financial Services 2.2 Technological Development E-commerce transcends international borders. It is estimated that global retail ecommerce is worth $28 trillion. In Zambia, the number of people using the internet to purchase goods and services from within and abroad is growing and set to continue even at a faster rate as more and more people get connected to the internet due to the enabling legislations Government has put in place. Together with investment in communications infrastructure, Government’s overall goal has been to facilitate digital financial inclusion and thereby facilitating ecommerce. According to ZICTA’s ICT Survey on access and usage of Information and Communication Technology Report of 2018 internet penetration rate in Zambia stood at 51.8% in the first quarter of 2020. The report cited the increase in internet penetration rate to an increased in the participation in e-commerce activities by Zambian citizens. The Report also revealed that the number of internet users that used the internet to purchase goods and/or services online increased, from 84,058 individuals in 2015 to 100,092 individuals in 2018. This also translates to an increase in the number of individuals expoed to several cyber threats. The use and promotion of Digital Financial Services (DFS) has facilitated financial inclusion. According to a survey conducted by the Bank of Zambia on the State of the DFS Market in 2018, the country experienced significant growth in terms of the number of active customers, agents and DFS providers. The survey also revealed that the industry went from having only 2% active DFS accounts with four providers in 2014 to 44% active DFS accounts with 18 providers in 2018. Between December 2017 and December 2018, active DFS accounts grew by 89%. Responding to the rise in active customers, the number of active agents grew from 22,965 to 46,747 in the same period. In 2019, Mobile Money transactions in Zambia stood at more than ZMW12 billion. With the launch of the Financial Inclusion Strategy, it is envisaged that DFS would become universally accessible. Further, according to the ICT survey of 2018, at least 48.9% of households across the country used digital financial services with more than 70% of them able to receive and send money. There has been a rise in the use of DFS leading to a corresponding rise in fraudulent activities. For instance in 2019, ZICTA received 791 consumer complaints, the majority of which were associated to DFS representing 64% of the total complaints received. The pace of technological development is remarkably fast. The ICT landscape is fast-evolving as devices and services proliferate, broadband connectivity has become increasingly pervasive, and the hyper-connected world of the ‘Internet of Things’ is quickly becoming a reality. At the core of this phenomenal transformation is Mobile technology capable of delivering high speed internet. The expanding mobile broadband is responsible for connecting the large population of today’s world to a wide range of online resources and services leading to cybersecurity related issues. 8 National Cybersecurity PolicySituation AnalysisSituation Analysis 2.2.1 Access to ICT 2.2.2 Technological Trends 2.2.3 Technological Innovations 2.3 Legal and Regulatory Framework 2.3.1 Legal Framework Globally, mobile subscribers stood at nearly 67% as at the end of 2019, while Zambia had a penetration rate of 95.4% mobile subscriptions based on the number of Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) cards purchased by consumers as at first quarter of 2020. Zambia, like the rest of the world, is increasingly reliant and dependent on ICTs. The increase in connected devices and the amount of data generated and downloaded has increased dramatically leading to cybersecurity related issues about privacy and data protection among other things, for the users. The increase in the number of people connected to the internet has also increased the number of active users of social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook which has also led to increase in the number of people causing harm to others on these platforms. These people are using these platforms to steal identities and impersonate others, cyber bully, transmit pornographic content, perpetrate hate speech and insult, abuse, falsely accuse and defraud others. Avid users of ICTs that include children and young adults have become primarily vulnerable to such vices. This emerging digital culture is placing the nation’s cultural, social and economic wellbeing at risk. It is projected that in the near future key developments will include artificial intelligence, machine learning, machine-to-machine (M2M) infrastructure and Internet of Things (IoT). This will facilitate the development of smart homes, buildings and cities. It is further estimated that future network traffic will increasingly be driven by M2M traffic generated by billions of connected devices, products and sensors with M2M communications over mobile cellular networks already emerging as the fastest- growing ICT service in terms of traffic. Many of these applications have been made possible by 4G (Long Term Evolution (LTE) - Advanced and 5G technology. One key feature of 5G, the enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) which supports the internet of everything, will bring about new and advanced cybersecurity threats. Broadband expansion and availability across the world has inspired innovations in the areas of machine learning, cloud computing, over the top services and big data management which is expected to shape the broader telecommunications sector. Notably, advancements in wearable technologies and use of crypto currency is expected to increase leading to an upsurge in a cybercrime known as ransomware. Currently, the two principal legislation governing cybersecurity are the Electronic Transactions and Communications Act No. 21 of 2009 and the Information and Communications Technology Act No. 15 of 2009. While the ECT Act defines the rules and procedures on matters related to cybersecurity, it does not adequately deal with the many dimensions of cybersecurity nor cover the spectrum of emerging cybercrimes. This has necessitated the need for the review of the ECT Act to address current lacunas. The ECT Act no 21 of 2009 Act does provide some procedures on cryptographic controls, this provision is implemented ad-hoc and where required, particularly in financial institutions. The ECT Act does not promote the disclosure of vulnerabilities and threats encountered by critical infrastructure, such as banks, but whether organisations actually engage in reporting is difficult to determine. There is no mechanism that enables the disclosure of vulnerability information for analysis and decision making in the Act. 9 National Cybersecurity Policy Situation Analysis 2.3.2 Licensing Regime 2.3.3 Regulatory Overlaps 2.3.4 Processes and Standards 2.3.5 International Conventions and Protocols Zambia’s liberalisation of the ICT sector brought about many changes in the internet service provision and mobile telecommunication industry. The country has at present, a total of 89 licensees in the ICT sector divided as follows: 51 Network Licensees of which three (03) are in the international market segment, 38 in the national market segment, four (04) in the provincial market segment and 6 in the district market segment, 32 service without a network licensee of which 27 are in the national market segment, two (02) in the provincial market segment and three (03) in the district Market segment and six (06) service without a network licensees in the National Market segment. The country has more than 14,000 kilometres of optic fibre offering high speed connectivity and connecting Zambia to more than six different routes. Each major Network Licence operator terminates its traffic using its own gateway. When there is a cyber-attack on such a network arrangement, the response might be uncoordinated and lack resilience, therefore, posing a higher cyber-security risk in that it is difficult to monitor and defend the cyber space. The Banking, Broadcasting and Mobile Network Money Services have converged on the ICT devices, platforms and infrastructure in the form of Smart phones, Smart Televisions and mobile money. The convergence has created an overlap in duties among the Financial, Broadcasting and the ICT Regulator. The overlapping of roles is due to the convergence of radio, television and financial transactions which poses cyber threats as Regulators are limited by their respective mandates. The process of acquisition, development and use of ICT tools is often a source of cybersecurity concern. A number of ICT security, procurement and software development standards have been adopted across Government and the private sector. However, the public sector does not have appropriate standards to guide the development and use of software designed to forestall cyber threats. As a result of the borderless nature of cybersecurity, the policing and safeguarding of the Cyber space almost often requires International Cooperation to enforce. It is for this reason that globally and regionally, countries have adopted to come together to forge cooperation in the area of cybersecurity. Notable among these international conventions and guidelines are the 2014 African Union (AU) Convention of Cybersecurity and Personal Data Protection that Zambia is a signatory to and needs to ratify. The AU Convention on Cybersecurity and Data Protection aims at defining the objectives and broad orientation of the information society in Africa and strengthens existing legislation on Information and Communications Technologies of Member States and Regional Economic Communities. The goal of the Convention is to address the need for harmonised legislation in the area of cybersecurity in Africa and establish mechanisms of combating violations of privacy that may be generated by personal data collection, processing, transmission, storage and use of that data. 10 National Cybersecurity PolicySituation Analysis 2.4 Institutional Framework 2.5 Environmental Factors 2.6 Digital Literacy, Skills and Education Zambia Information and Communications Technology Authority (ZICTA) is currently responsible for matters related to cybersecurity. The Zambia Computer Incidence Response Team (ZM-CIRT) under ZICTA is one of the major frameworks that deal with cybersecurity incidents in Zambia. The ZM-CIRT supports Law Enforcement Agencies conducts digital forensics to aid in investigations and detect and respond to cyber related attacks. Further in 2014, ZICTA partnered with the Zambia Police Service to establish the Zambia Digital Forensics Laboratory to aid in digital investigations. Additionally, the country’s CIIs in different sectors are beyond ZICTA’s mandate and there are no sector specific Computer Incident Response Teams (CIRTs) to enhance the detection of cyber threats and cyber incidences. Environmental factors such as climate change inherently raise the number of environmental crises including droughts, floods, and pandemics. These occurrences have the potential to disrupt the provision of critical ICT services and also affect national security. A disastrous weather event can affect signalling on terrestrial as well as satellite communication networks and shut down critical electronic and digital systems. A poor cybersecurity culture among citizens, puts both the individual and the country at very high risk of cyber-attack. Studies have shown that the greatest security vulnerability within an organisation or a country is often the inadequate knowledge by individuals about the potential risks of their actions or lack thereof. For instance, the common habit of sharing of Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) and passwords voluntarily with strangers has led to loss of money. Digital literacy and ICT education can guarantee a good cybersecurity culture and awareness. Zambia unfortunately has very low digital literacy levels especially among the old, young children, women and persons with disabilities. Despite ICT having been introduced as a mandatory subject in schools, most schools do not have enough nor appropriate ICT equipment and materials to cater for the demands of an often large population of learners. 11 National Cybersecurity Policy Situation Analysis Chapter 3 — Vision, Rationale and Guiding Principles “A secure and resilient Zambian cyberspace by 2030” The country needs to have a National Cybersecurity Policy in place in order to protect its cyberspace. This is because cyberspace is central to the governance of our nation and thus essential to our socio- economic wellbeing and national security. There are a number of sectors in the economy that are heavily dependent on cyberspace for operations. Further, the development of the Policy has been necessitated by the need to: 1. Address the inadequate cybersecurity provisions in the National ICT Policy of 2006; 2. Protect critical information infrastructure in both public and private sectors; 3. Develop a coordinated cybersecurity governance structure; 4. Provide mechanisms to ensure a safe and secure cyber environment; 5. Enhance the cybersecurity culture; and 6. Promote effective international cooperation on cybersecurity matters. The National Cybersecurity Policy would foster the defence of a resilient Zambian cyberspace. The following principles will guide the implementation of the National Cybersecurity Policy: 3.1 Vision 3.2 Rationale 3.3 Guiding Principles Coordination This Policy shall promote coordination in cybersecurity defence and other operations among relevant stakeholders; Inclusive Stakeholder Participation Public-Private collaboration shall be the basis for the implementation of this Policy; Accountability Professionalism and responsible use of ICTs are cardinal to the implementation of cybersecurity in Zambia; Human dignity, equity and social justice The rights of individuals should be respected in implementing the Policy; Patriotism It is the duty of every Zambian citizen to defend the country; Good governance and integrity Good governance shall enhance the provision for a coordinated approach in addressing cybersecurity in Zambia. 12 National Cybersecurity PolicyVision, Rationale & Guiding Principles Chapter 4 — Policy Objectives and Measures To transform the cyberspace in Zambia into a safer environment in order to fully realise the social, economic and strategic benefits of using ICTs. 4.2.1 Objective 1: To secure Zambia’s critical information infrastructure to enhance cyber resilience.

The Zambian Government and private sectors continued rollout and investment in Information and  Communications Technology (ICT) networks and systems has increased access to ICTs and the  internet. These have been powerful tools for human and economic development which have  simplified  provision of health care, financial services, education, agriculture, mining, commerce, transportation,  banking, manufacturing, energy, trade, media and broadcasting services, amongst others.  Zambia’s cyberspace has also experienced continuous development. With a substantial increase in  access to the internet in the country, concerns around cybersecurity have become prominent. Access  to the internet has brought about a new type of risk and threat to national peace which in itself will need  new forms of defence to counter it. The country remains at risk of eminent cybersecurity incidents that  may significantly disrupt the healthy functioning of our cyber eco-system emanating from both local  and/or international threats. Cyber-attacks are growing in prominence every day and the role these  attacks play in our daily lives should not be underestimated. The average cost of combating malicious  software and data breaches continues to increase, making the recovery from cybercrimes very costly  to businesses. .  The aim of this Policy is to establish a coordinated cybersecurity framework and enhance resilience  of national ICT systems to cyber incidents in order to attain the desired transformation into a Smart  Zambia that is underpinned by trust and confidentiality. The Policy also aims at reforming the legal and  regulatory framework on cybersecurity and cybercrimes in the country.  Successful implementation of this Policy will require extensive collaboration with all stakeholders. As  the Ministry responsible for the development of the ICTs, we will endeavour to put in place a multi- sectoral framework that allows all stakeholders to play their role in the prevention and detection of and  recovery from cyber-attacks and incidences. Due to the borderless nature of cybersecurity, Zambia  will work closely with other countries within the SADC Region, African Union, United Nations and  indeed other organisations in order to foster international cooperation in fighting against the increasing  number of incidents caused by illegal activities in cyberspace.

Cyberspace is a new frontier for a variety of innovations for social and economic progress. The  management of Cyberspace is important not only because of the actions of individual participants  but also the infrastructure of cyberspace is now fundamental to the functioning of national and  international security systems, trade networks, emergency services, basic communications, and other  public and private activities. As the world enters its fourth industrial revolution shaped by the immense  transformational power of digital technology, it is argued that the countries that will stand to benefit  are those that will harness the new technology while safeguarding individual and national interest  against a new kind of threat presented by cybercrime.   Although Zambia’s journey towards the digital information age dates back many years, the launch  of the ICT Policy in 2006 formally recognised ICTs to be critical in achieving national development.  The 2006 ICT Policy achieved much in terms of commitments and objectives set forth. However,  widespread adoption of ICTs over the years has overtaken the gains of the 2006 ICT Policy. This  has been compounded by cyber threats while extensive innovations have unleashed a new wave  of cybercrimes. Additionally, other intervening policy measures intended to further leverage and  accelerate the nation’s move towards an information society and attain middle income status such as  Vision 2030, the Seventh National Development Plan and Smart Zambia initiatives have all added a  new layer of complexity to the country’s cybercrime landscape.   While the country has inadequate national statistics on the nature and incidences of cybercrimes, the  menace and prevalence cannot be disputed. Cybercrime in the country, as exemplified by several  incidences of electronic fraud and other cyber related criminality in recent past, has been on the rise.  This and the need to have a coordinated framework to respond to cyber incidences has necessitated  the need for the formulation of the country’s first National Cybersecurity Policy. The thrust of this  Policy is to ensure a clear, bold and decisive cybersecurity governance structure is developed to direct  and drive coordinated efforts to foster defence of the Zambian cyberspace.  The Policy is divided into six parts namely: Introduction, Situation Analysis, Vision, Rationale and Guiding  Principles, Objectives and Implementation Framework. The Situation Analysis gives an overview of the  cybersecurity situation in the country. The Rationale explains the justification for the Policy and the  guiding principles upon which it is grounded.  The Policy further outlines the objectives and policy  measures and ends with an implementation framework which outlines the institutional arrangements  and legal framework to support the implementation of the Policy.  6 www.mtc.gov.zm  National Cybersecurity PolicyIntroduction    Chapter 2 — Situation Analysis   2.1 Economic Landscape of Cybersecurity in Zambia  2.1.1 Globalisation  2.1.2 Digital Inclusion   2.1.3 E-services  ICTs, particularly Broadband technology, are a key contributor to economic growth at various levels.  The deployment of such technologies improve productivity by facilitating the adoption of more  efficient communication, resource sharing which consequently improve business processes. Further,  extensive deployment of broadband accelerates innovation by introducing new consumer applications  and services.   According to a recent report by the World Bank on the impact of broadband on the economy, ICTs  contribute 5-10% to the GDPs of countries mostly in developing countries. Further, it is estimated that  for low and middle income economies, a 10 % increase in broadband penetration yields an additional  1.38% in GDP growth. The economic landscape is affected by various factors as highlighted below.  The increase in the use of the internet has enhanced globalisation leading to increased social and  economic interconnectedness. As a result of globalisation, there has been growth in the information  society which has consequently led to increased e-commerce, e-government, innovation and access to  information across borders. Due to the borderless nature of cyberspace, the area of cyber-attacks and  cybercrimes has greatly increased and citizens are susceptible to cybercrimes owing to the increased  use of ICTs.  Zambia’s economy has been on the positive trajectory for the last eighteen (18) years leading to  improved income levels for an expanded population. This has increased the up-take of ICTs by the  larger part of the population in virtually all sectors of the economy. Similarly, the Government has  taken significant strides in developing and investing in ICT infrastructure such as the construction of  communication towers in underserved and unserved areas. This has led to more and more people  being connected to the information networks and potentially be exposed to cyber threats.  E-services are commercial or non-commercial in nature. There are several such services in the private  sector but currently Government provides e-services to the public which include e-tax, e-pensions and  e-health. According to the Seventh National Development Plan (7NDP), more than 142 e-services will  be provided to the public by 2021. The reliance on modern technologies to deliver services constantly  exposes citizen’s personal data and country’s Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) which includes  power, water, fuel, communication, factories or commercial assets that are essential for the functioning  of our society and economy, to cyber-attacks.  7  National Cybersecurity Policy  www.mtc.gov.zm  Situation AnalysisSituation Analysis    2.1.4 E-commerce  2.1.5 Digital Financial Services  2.2 Technological Development  E-commerce transcends international borders.  It is estimated that global retail ecommerce is worth  $28 trillion. In Zambia, the number of people using the internet to purchase goods and services from  within and abroad is growing and set to continue even at a faster rate as more and more people get  connected to the internet due to the enabling legislations Government has put in place.  Together with investment in communications infrastructure, Government’s overall goal has been  to facilitate digital financial inclusion and thereby facilitating ecommerce. According to ZICTA’s ICT  Survey on access and usage of Information and Communication Technology Report of 2018 internet  penetration rate in Zambia stood at 51.8% in the first quarter of 2020. The report cited the increase  in internet penetration rate to an increased in the participation in e-commerce activities by Zambian  citizens.  The Report also revealed that the number of internet users that used the internet to purchase goods  and/or services online increased, from 84,058 individuals in 2015 to 100,092 individuals in 2018. This  also translates to an increase in the number of individuals expoed to several cyber threats.  The use and promotion of Digital Financial Services (DFS) has facilitated financial inclusion. According  to a survey conducted by the Bank of Zambia on the State of the DFS Market in 2018, the country  experienced significant growth in terms of the number of active customers, agents and DFS providers.   The survey also revealed that the industry went from having only 2% active DFS accounts with four  providers in 2014 to 44% active DFS accounts with 18 providers in 2018. Between December 2017 and  December 2018, active DFS accounts grew by 89%. Responding to the rise in active customers, the  number of active agents grew from 22,965 to 46,747 in the same period.  In 2019, Mobile Money transactions in Zambia stood at more than ZMW12 billion.  With the launch of the  Financial Inclusion Strategy, it is envisaged that DFS would become universally accessible.   Further, according to the ICT survey of 2018, at least 48.9% of households across the country used  digital financial services with more than 70% of them able to receive and send money.  There has been  a rise in the use of DFS leading to a corresponding rise in fraudulent activities.  For instance in 2019,  ZICTA received 791 consumer complaints, the majority of which were associated to DFS representing  64% of the total complaints received.  The pace of technological development is remarkably fast. The ICT landscape is fast-evolving as  devices and services proliferate, broadband connectivity has become increasingly pervasive, and  the hyper-connected world of the ‘Internet of Things’ is quickly becoming a reality. At the core of  this phenomenal transformation is Mobile technology capable of delivering high speed internet. The  expanding mobile broadband is responsible for connecting the large population of today’s world to a  wide range of online resources and services leading to cybersecurity related issues.    8 www.mtc.gov.zm  National Cybersecurity PolicySituation AnalysisSituation Analysis    2.2.1 Access to ICT  2.2.2 Technological Trends  2.2.3 Technological Innovations  2.3 Legal and Regulatory Framework 2.3.1 Legal Framework  Globally, mobile subscribers stood at nearly 67% as at the end of 2019, while Zambia had a penetration  rate of 95.4% mobile subscriptions based on the number of Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) cards  purchased by consumers as at first quarter of 2020. Zambia, like the rest of the world, is increasingly  reliant and dependent on ICTs. The increase in connected devices and the amount of data generated  and downloaded has increased dramatically leading to cybersecurity related issues about privacy and  data protection among other things, for the users.   The increase in the number of people connected to the internet has also increased the number of active  users of social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook which has also led to increase in the  number of people causing harm to others on these platforms. These people are using these platforms  to steal identities and impersonate others, cyber bully, transmit pornographic content, perpetrate hate  speech and insult, abuse, falsely accuse and defraud others. Avid users of ICTs that include children  and young adults have become primarily vulnerable to such vices. This emerging digital culture is  placing the nation’s cultural, social and economic wellbeing at risk.  It is projected that in the near future key developments will include artificial intelligence, machine  learning, machine-to-machine (M2M) infrastructure and Internet of Things (IoT). This will facilitate the  development of smart homes, buildings and cities. It is further estimated that future network traffic  will increasingly be driven by M2M traffic generated by billions of connected devices, products and  sensors with M2M communications over mobile cellular networks already emerging as the fastest- growing ICT service in terms of traffic. Many of these applications have been made possible by 4G  (Long Term Evolution (LTE) - Advanced and 5G technology. One key feature of 5G, the enhanced Mobile  Broadband (eMBB) which supports the internet of everything, will bring about new and advanced  cybersecurity threats.  Broadband expansion and availability across the world has inspired innovations in the areas of machine  learning, cloud computing, over the top services and big data management which is expected to shape  the broader telecommunications sector. Notably, advancements in wearable technologies and use of  crypto currency is expected to increase leading to an upsurge in a cybercrime known as ransomware.   Currently, the two principal legislation governing cybersecurity are the Electronic Transactions and  Communications Act No. 21 of 2009 and the Information and Communications Technology Act No.  15 of 2009. While the ECT Act defines the rules and procedures on matters related to cybersecurity,  it does not adequately deal with the many dimensions of cybersecurity nor cover the spectrum of  emerging cybercrimes. This has necessitated the need for the review of the ECT Act to address current  lacunas.  The ECT Act no 21 of 2009 Act does provide some procedures on cryptographic controls, this provision  is implemented ad-hoc and where required, particularly in financial institutions.   The ECT Act does not promote the disclosure of vulnerabilities and threats encountered by critical  infrastructure, such as banks, but whether organisations actually engage in reporting is difficult to  determine. There is no mechanism that enables the disclosure of vulnerability information for analysis  and decision making in the Act.  9  National Cybersecurity Policy  www.mtc.gov.zm  Situation Analysis    2.3.2 Licensing Regime    2.3.3 Regulatory Overlaps    2.3.4 Processes and Standards   2.3.5 International Conventions and Protocols  Zambia’s liberalisation of the ICT sector brought about many changes in the internet service provision  and mobile telecommunication industry. The country has at present, a total of 89 licensees in the ICT  sector divided as follows: 51 Network Licensees of which three (03) are in the international market  segment, 38 in the national market segment, four (04) in the provincial market segment and 6 in the  district market segment, 32 service without a network licensee of which 27 are in the national market  segment, two (02) in the provincial market segment and three (03) in the district Market segment and  six (06) service without a network licensees in the National Market segment.   The country has more than 14,000 kilometres of optic fibre offering high speed connectivity  and  connecting Zambia to more than six different routes. Each major Network Licence operator terminates  its traffic using its own gateway. When there is a cyber-attack on such a network arrangement, the  response might be uncoordinated and lack resilience, therefore, posing a higher cyber-security risk in  that it is difficult to monitor and defend the cyber space.  The Banking, Broadcasting and Mobile Network Money Services have converged on the ICT devices,  platforms and infrastructure in the form of Smart phones, Smart Televisions and mobile money. The  convergence has created an overlap in duties among the Financial, Broadcasting and the ICT Regulator.  The overlapping of roles is due to the convergence of radio, television and financial transactions which  poses cyber threats as Regulators are limited by their respective mandates.  The process of acquisition, development and use of ICT tools is often a source of cybersecurity concern.  A number of ICT security, procurement and software development standards have been adopted  across Government and the private sector. However, the public sector does not have appropriate  standards to guide the development and use of software designed to forestall cyber threats.   As a result of the borderless nature of cybersecurity, the policing and safeguarding of the Cyber  space almost often requires International Cooperation to enforce. It is for this reason that globally and  regionally, countries have adopted to come together to forge cooperation in the area of cybersecurity.  Notable among these international conventions and guidelines are the 2014 African Union (AU)  Convention of Cybersecurity and Personal Data Protection that Zambia is a signatory to and needs to  ratify.  The AU Convention on Cybersecurity and Data Protection aims at defining the objectives and broad  orientation of the information society in Africa and strengthens existing legislation on Information and  Communications Technologies of Member States and Regional Economic Communities. The goal of  the Convention is to address the need for harmonised legislation in the area of cybersecurity in Africa  and establish mechanisms of combating violations of privacy that may be generated by personal data  collection, processing, transmission, storage and use of that data.  10 www.mtc.gov.zm  National Cybersecurity PolicySituation Analysis    2.4 Institutional Framework  2.5 Environmental Factors  2.6 Digital Literacy, Skills and Education  Zambia Information and Communications Technology Authority (ZICTA) is currently responsible for  matters related to cybersecurity. The Zambia Computer Incidence Response Team (ZM-CIRT) under  ZICTA is one of the major frameworks that deal with cybersecurity incidents in Zambia. The ZM-CIRT  supports Law Enforcement Agencies conducts digital forensics to aid in investigations and detect and  respond to cyber related attacks. Further in 2014, ZICTA partnered with the Zambia Police Service to  establish the Zambia Digital Forensics Laboratory to aid in digital investigations.   Additionally, the country’s CIIs in different sectors are beyond ZICTA’s mandate and there are no sector  specific Computer Incident Response Teams (CIRTs) to enhance the detection of cyber threats and  cyber incidences.  Environmental factors such as climate change inherently raise the number of environmental crises  including droughts, floods, and pandemics. These occurrences have the potential to disrupt the  provision of critical ICT services and also affect national security. A disastrous weather event can affect  signalling on terrestrial as well as satellite communication networks and shut down critical electronic  and digital systems.  A poor cybersecurity culture among citizens, puts both the individual and the country at very high risk  of cyber-attack. Studies have shown that the greatest security vulnerability within an organisation or a  country is often the inadequate knowledge by individuals about the potential risks of their actions or  lack thereof. For instance, the common habit of sharing of Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) and  passwords voluntarily with strangers has led to loss of money.  Digital literacy and ICT education can guarantee a good cybersecurity culture and awareness. Zambia  unfortunately has very low digital literacy levels especially among the old,  young children, women and  persons with disabilities. Despite ICT having been introduced as a mandatory subject in schools, most  schools do not have enough nor appropriate ICT equipment and materials to cater for the demands of  an often large population of learners.  11  National Cybersecurity Policy  www.mtc.gov.zm  Situation Analysis    Chapter 3 — Vision, Rationale and Guiding Principles  “A secure and resilient Zambian cyberspace by 2030”  The country needs to have a National Cybersecurity Policy in place in order to protect its cyberspace.  This is because cyberspace is central to the governance of our nation and thus essential to our socio- economic wellbeing and national security. There are a number of sectors in the economy that are  heavily dependent on cyberspace for operations.  Further, the development of the Policy has been necessitated by the need to:  1. Address the inadequate cybersecurity provisions in the National ICT Policy of 2006; 2. Protect critical information infrastructure in both public and private sectors; 3. Develop a coordinated cybersecurity governance structure; 4. Provide mechanisms to ensure a safe and secure cyber environment; 5. Enhance the cybersecurity culture; and 6. Promote effective international cooperation on cybersecurity matters.  The National Cybersecurity Policy would foster the defence of a resilient Zambian cyberspace.  The following principles will guide the implementation of the National Cybersecurity Policy:  3.1 Vision  3.2 Rationale  3.3 Guiding Principles  Coordination This Policy shall promote coordination in cybersecurity defence and other operations among relevant  stakeholders;  Inclusive  Stakeholder  Participation  Public-Private collaboration shall be the basis for the implementation of this Policy;  Accountability Professionalism and responsible use of ICTs are cardinal to the implementation of cybersecurity in  Zambia;  Human dignity,  equity and social  justice  The rights of individuals should be respected in implementing the Policy;  Patriotism It is the duty of every Zambian citizen to defend the country;  Good  governance and  integrity  Good governance shall enhance the provision for a coordinated approach in addressing cybersecurity in  Zambia.  12 www.mtc.gov.zm  National Cybersecurity PolicyVision, Rationale & Guiding Principles    Chapter 4 — Policy Objectives and Measures  To transform the cyberspace in Zambia into a safer environment in order to fully realise the social,  economic and strategic benefits of using ICTs.  4.2.1 Objective 1: To secure Zambia’s critical information infrastructure to enhance cyber resilience.

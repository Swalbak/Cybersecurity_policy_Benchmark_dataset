The ICT sector, tech start-ups, universities, key economic sectors and policy makers need to work together closely to ensure Jordan’s relevance in the digital economy 2025. The purpose of this vision paper is to identify common ground, and common agreed actions to create the skills and the capacity required to shape the future digital innovative Jordan. It is in this connection important that both the ICT sector capacity, as well as the digitization of the market and its actors, complement each other. This vision builds on strong foundations in Jordan:  The first REACH Initiative was launched in year 2000 as the official kick-start of a comprehensive public-private partnership aimed to develop the country’s ICT sector and pave the way for the other economic sectors to move into the Knowledge Economy.  There are over 600 Jordanian ICT companies in the ICT cluster, which drive digitization and are a key resource for skills and capacity in Jordan.  Jordan has established a maturing ecosystem with international tech firms, established firms, venture funds, angel investors, incubators and accelerators.  As a country with limited natural resources, Jordan’s economy diversified early based on investments in cutting-edge technologies and infrastructure. The key to reaching the future will be to build on these enablers and accelerate digital innovation through cross-sectoral collaboration.  Jordanians are a people that have shaped their future over centuries. There is a deeply engrained tradition to make the future happen through informed decisions and to enable the future to the benefit of everyone. In 2015, his Majesty King Abdullah II called upon the leaders of the tech industry to come together and develop a new roadmap for the tech sector in an all-inclusive process that would include the private and public sector, academia, investors, and entrepreneurs. The REACH2025 initiative has been launched to re-invigorate digital Jordan and particularly one of the growth engines of the Jordan economy – the ICT sector. To facilitate the management of this call to action, a core team has been assembled from the sector alongside the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology, mandated to develop a focused action plan. REACH2025 has key relevance to the economic development of Jordan. The vision and action plan: 1. Works as a booster for economic development in key knowledge sectors; 2. Enables businesses growth and enhancement not only for the ICT sector, but for the digital economy sector of focus; 3. Focuses on building relevant talent and increasing job creation rate; 4. Ensures better accessibility and inclusion of all citizens to key services at lower costs of investment through digitization of key sectors, providing better solutions for health, education, financial services etc.); 5. Ensures national regional development in governorates, rural areas advancement, etc.; 6. Gives Jordan global alignment and relevance in global value chains; 7. Increases economic and social value add; 8. Boosts public-private partnerships for better co-owned development and country advancement; 9. Attracts new investments in new developed fields and key sectors; and 10. Focuses the role of government as a policy maker, regulator and potential innovation platform/adopter. The methodology of this vision and action paper has been led by a design-thinking inspired approach. This means that a key notion of the exercise has been to co-create a vision and mission statement and an action paper. The approach and aim have been to put end-users’ needs at the centre of the policy formulation system, leading to solutions that are progressively refined through an iterative process of providing voice to end-users and engaging them in shaping decisions (co-creation); considering multiple causes of and diversified perspectives to the problems at hand; and experiment with initial ideas.1 This means that the process has focused on stakeholder engagement and making the stakeholders' voices heard so that the actions could be co-created and owned in Jordan. What this process does not do, is to provide a one-size-fits-all model for actions in Jordan, nor is it a full national diagnostics exercise. However, the design thinking process does not stop with this action paper. The actions laid out in this paper are largely based on international good practise and input from Jordan stakeholders. However, it is necessary to activate strong stakeholders in Jordan further to ensure that they are the right actions for Jordan. Moreover, the budget considerations for each action are largely based on international benchmark good practise and need to be stress-tested in a Jordanian environment. REACHING THE VISION OF A DIGITAL ECONOMY IN JORDAN To reach the vision of a digital economy in Jordan, and action plan has been created alongside with the vision and mission. The action plan takes its point of departure in the vision statements for Jordan 2025, which are captured in the REACH2025 vision paper. The vision paper was developed based on an extensive stakeholder consultation in Jordan building on a thorough review of international key trends, expert interviews and a review of policy documents. The stakeholder consultation has ensured a strong grounding and support for the vision in Jordan. The vision paper and the action plan thus build on a strong foundation in Jordan. It is not reinventing the wheel, but leveraging the existing Jordan potential and differentiators into the digital economy. Concretely, the vision paper and action plan have been created by mapping leading international digital economy 1 development/English/Singapore%20Centre/GCPSE%20Design%20Thinking%20Summary.pdf models, enablers and levers to the Jordan differentiators, to create the best model for a digital economy in Jordan. This means creating an action plan for Jordan that ensures relevance in global value chains and addresses the challenges in Jordan. Box 1: A new way of approaching economic transformation in Jordan – Reach 2025 The vision, mission and action plan seeks to streamline the economic transformation across the entire Jordan economy through digitization. With the plan, Jordan is moving away from seeing ICT as an isolated sector and towards digitizing the entire Jordanian economy with emphasis on niche markets and global value chains. Fundamentally, this vision and action plan seeks to accelerate digitization across Jordan and support, enable and inspire the next generation of digital entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs building on Jordan’s strength of being a young and tech-savvy nation. The aim of this vision is to support and accelerate Jordan’s economic goals, create jobs for all Jordanians, empower women and position Jordan in the future digital global economy, through a clear alignment with the Jordan Vision 2025. This process includes introducing new mechanisms to initiate a different level of economic dialogue that will address key national development needs. KEY TRENDS THAT DRIVE THE FUTURE The world is looking at the Fourth Digital Revolution. It combines multiple technologies that are leading to unprecedented paradigm shifts in the economy, business, society, and individually2. This means that increasingly, sectors are disrupted and increasingly digitized. This offers immense opportunities for networked societies, but it also poses threats if timely actions are not taken. In countries such as Germany and Denmark, this revolution has been addressed through focus on Industry 4.0 – next generation manufacturing. However, the fourth industrial revolution is not only about smart and connected machines and systems; its scope is much wider. A great number of technology breakthroughs emerge, covering wide-ranging fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the internet of things, autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage and quantum computing, to name a few. Many of these innovations are in their infancy, but rapidly growing in importance as they build on and amplify each other in a fusion of technologies across the physical, digital and biological worlds. Waves of further breakthroughs in areas ranging from gene sequencing to nanotechnology, from renewables to quantum computing, are occurring simultaneously, 2 Schwab, Klaus (2016): The Fourth Industrial Revolution, World Economic Forum broadening the scope3. In fact, digital solutions are viewed as one of the most important driving forces across the entire economy4. THE KEY MEGATRENDS following this digital revolution are presented here5. The physical trends include autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, advanced robotics and new materials. For the autonomous vehicles, particularly the opportunities for drones are interesting. Over time, it will for example be possible to use these for checking power lines. 3D printing has the advantage of being able to be easily customized. For small companies and for entrepreneurs it brings opportunities to design products and solutions in close interaction with customers regardless of their location, and to embed services in new solutions and at a lower cost. That way, also small producers, for instance in areas like design, can bring new products to the global markets 6 . The physical trends can also give way to distributed manufacturing, which is a form of decentralized manufacturing whereby enterprises use a network of geographically dispersed manufacturing facilities coordinated through IT. Distributed manufacturing is a way of increasing the flexibility and agility of a value chain7 and can create relevance for especially SMEs in these. Advanced robotics are increasingly used across sectors for a wide range of tasks, with the advances in sensors increasingly enabling robots to respond better to their environment. Lastly, with time new materials may significantly disrupt the manufacturing industries8 with new benefits for example in medico tech and health applications. One of the main bridges between the physical and digital applications is the internet of things. The increased number of devices connected to the internet enables businesses to monitor and optimize assets and activities to a high level, affecting across all industries9. This is what Gartner Group terms the digital mesh10. The emphasis of this trend is on sensor technologies, connected devices and the consequences of this interconnectivity. The device mesh will drive augmented and virtual reality with huge implications for citizens, governments and businesses alike. Blending with ambient user experience, organizations will need to consider their customers’ behavior journeys to shift the focus on design from discreet apps to the entire mesh of products and services involved in the user experience. Part of the mesh are also the opportunities 3D printing may bring with them – with its capacity to prototype a wide range of materials. A related trend is the smart machines11. The key element of the future will be data and information. Data analytics will drive production processes as well as help steer, manage and optimize value chains 3 Schwab, Klaus (2016): The Fourth Industrial Revolution, World Economic Forum 4 Brynjolfsson, Erik and Andrew McAfee (2012): Race against the machine: How the digital revolution is accelerating innovation, driving productivity, and irreversibly transforming employment in the economy 5 Schwab, Klaus (2016): The Fourth Industrial Revolution, World Economic Forum 6 Schwab, Klaus (2016): The Fourth Industrial Revolution, World Economic Forum 7 For instance Leitao, Paulo (2008): Agent-based distributed manufacturing control 8 Schwab, Klaus (2016): The Fourth Industrial Revolution, World Economic Forum 9 Schwab, Klaus (2016): The Fourth Industrial Revolution, World Economic Forum 10 Gartner Group (2016): Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends For 2016, manufacturing/ 11 Gartner Group (2016): Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends For 2016, manufacturing/ within and across sectors. Advanced machine learning is what makes smart machines appear “intelligent” by enabling them to both understand concepts in the environment and to learn. Advanced machine learning gives rise to a spectrum of smart machine implementations — including robots, autonomous vehicles, virtual personal assistants (VPAs) and smart advisors — that act in an autonomous (or at least semiautonomous) manner. Closely connected to this discussion is the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI). AI is driven by exponential increases in computing power and by the availability of large amounts of data. Many of these algorithms learn from the trails of data that are left in the digital world. This results in new types of “machine learning” and automated discovery that enables intelligent robots and computers to self-programme and find optimal solutions from first principles. Applications such as Apple’s Siri provide a glimpse of what the future holds with respect to the rapidly advancing AI field – so-called intelligent assistants12. These advantages can be exploited in a range of sectors, including in new digital learning applications, which can support personalization of learning, be it in school or in a company environment. All of these key trends boil down to the new digital reality13. The digital mesh and smart machines require intense computing architecture demands to make them viable for organizations. The mesh app and service architecture are what enables delivery of apps and services to the flexible and dynamic environment. This new reality means that Jordanian companies face a future where digitization is everywhere and in all sectors. Digitization will affect different sectors at different times and with different intensities. The increased interconnectivity of everything means that the ability to innovate in the context of large-scale demand driven innovation projects becomes paramount. Due to the fast development of digital technology, innovation of components and apps will tend to be optimized towards being phased out again at some point. Therefore, innovation requires the ability to optimize every single partial innovation towards a future paradigm. Therefore, how companies and nations approach digitization is of key importance. A strategy, which only focuses on efficiency, will eventually lead to a commoditization of products and services and thus a competitive situation where price is the main determinant14. This means that focus not only should be on efficiency, but also on elements such as how companies continuously innovate through interaction with customers, suppliers etc., and how the companies can create increased value-add for customers without the price increases correspondingly. Networking and collaboration is the key source to such forms of innovation. Reshaping the full potential of the digital revolution depends on whether the companies use digitization for cost-effectiveness or as a driver for cost-effectiveness as well as innovation. Some of the digital tech companies in Jordan may have an understanding of keys to competitiveness, which are not aligned to rapidly changing markets for digital products and services. On the other hand, Jordan is 12 Schwab, Klaus (2016): The Fourth Industrial Revolution, World Economic Forum 13 Gartner Group (2016): Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends For 2016, manufacturing/ 14 Nielsen, Niels Christian, Jonathan Murray, and John Zysman (2013): The Services Dilemma: Productivity Sinkhole or Commoditization? Book Manuscript a young nation with much idea generating and support around the start-up culture, which provides an enabling innovation DNA to unleash the full benefit of digitization. Furthermore, the disruption that the fourth industrial revolution will have on existing political, economic and social models will require that empowered actors recognize that they are part of a wider ecosystem that requires more collaborative forms of interaction to succeed15. Close collaboration not only entails cooperation among tech companies, but also among the tech companies and the companies in the key disrupted sectors, and among the public sector and companies, to succeed with a digital revolution. These leadership competences can be built through high-level strategic partnerships with other nations and at firm level, to fully exploit the potential that digitization has to create sustainable growth in Jordan. Another key trend is how the dynamic of innovation is changing globally. In particular, the following elements are key:  DEMAND DRIVEN INNOVATION – Demand side innovation is an inclusive paradigm shift away from supply side innovation to serving the needs of supply chains and customers. As the Arab region is digitizing exponentially, culturally sensitive content and solutions will be a particular opportunity to lead in the region. To support demand driven innovation, demand-side innovation policies – from public procurement of innovation, to standards and regulations, to lead markets and user-/consumer-driven innovation initiatives needs to be in place16.  THE IMPORTANCE OF TECH START-UPS AND ENTREPRENEURS – Start-ups and entrepreneurship can create a culture of innovation, of developing ideas and solutions and adding value in entirely new ways. Start-up programs play a key role in the attraction of international, talented and high impact entrepreneurs to come and boost the local ecosystem.  THE MAKERS MOVEMENT – With the advent of digital manufacturing, fabrication laboratories, or FabLabs, are spreading around the world. These centers provide access to hardware, machines, and open-source software, along with affordable training and mentoring. They encourage collaboration among stakeholders and across disciplines, and are increasingly seen as a powerful way to spur entrepreneurship, address the skills gap, and alleviate youth unemployment while revolutionizing production processes17.  ECOSYSTEMS AND NETWORKS – the increased digitization of the economy supports a more efficient way of collaborating, sourcing and developing human capital. Particularly large companies can take advantage of leveraging their scale advantages and investing in their ecosystem of start-ups and SMEs by acquiring and partnering with smaller and more innovative 15 Schwab, Klaus (2016): The Fourth Industrial Revolution, World Economic Forum 16 OECD Competences to innovate › Stimulating demand for innovation > outlook/stipolicyprofiles/competencestoinnovate/stimulatingdemandforinnovation.htm 17 World Economic Forum (2015): the Global Information Technology Report 2015 businesses. This will enable them to maintain autonomy in their respective businesses while also allowing for more efficient and agile operations. Small and medium-sized enterprises, on the other hand, will have the advantages of speed and the agility needed to participate in these ecosystems18. JORDAN’S ROLE WITH RESPECT TO KEY TRENDS The increasingly digitized world requires that Jordan exploits the advantages that the country has and finds its place in the global value chains. Below are discussed five key areas with which to unlock Jordan’s potential. Jordan’s true differentiator lies in the combination of these key areas. LEVERAGING HIGH-LEVEL STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS As mentioned in the key trends section above, digital global value chains today are a dominant feature of the world economy. This means that the production of goods and services is carried out wherever the necessary skills and materials are available at competitive cost and quality, creating growing fragmentation of production across borders19, and thereby increasingly relying on digitization for collaboration across borders. To deliver according to the required quality and time specifications, lead companies in global value chains increasingly rely on specialized sub-suppliers, which become knowledge and innovation partners, and provide the small companies privileged access to global markets. In an upcoming publication from the OECD, they conclude that the winning companies and countries in a digital economy are those who understand how to leverage resources and overcome limitations of size through networking and collaboration20. Jordan has a good ICT infrastructure and historically, a strong focus on skills and education due to a lack of natural resources21, particularly to be found among professionals with some years of work experience. In addition, Jordan is a source of IT talent for major companies in the Middle East22. Building on the ICT infrastructure and the human capital, with the steps that already have been taken to reform the curricula to the needs of the digital economy and Jordan’s ICT sector23, as well as future steps for further reforming, Jordan will have a strong role to play 18 Schwab, Klaus (2016): The Fourth Industrial Revolution, World Economic Forum 19 OECD (2013): Implications of global value chains for trade, investment, development and jobs 20 OECD (2016) Committee on Digital Economy Policy: Stimulating Digital Innovation for Growth and Inclusiveness: The Role of Policies for the Succesful Diffusion of ICT (Draft background report for ministerial panel) 21 int@j: Jordan ICT sector profile 22 int@j: Jordan ICT sector profile 23 Current work is being done on this. In collaboration with industry and universities, a process has started to develop industry based occupational profiles, which will be piloted and the model can be replicated to other ICT occupations and across clusters. in these value chains. In the future, Jordan should use the partnerships to become the platform for digital innovation by being an innovation creating center for digital solutions driven by these strong partnerships. In this regard, Jordan has a long and solid relationship with the US, with a large diaspora situated in the US and GCC. This relationship could be further utilized to leverage high-level strategic partnerships with clear task leaders and milestones, although it requires clear tasks and owners. PRODUCING SPECIALIZED ICT TALENT, BUILDING ON ENTREPRENEURIAL DRIVE & IMAGINATION One of Jordan’s strong differentiators is the country’s talent, entrepreneurial drive and imagination. Being a country of limited natural resources, Jordan’s main strength lies in its human capital, and the entrepreneurial drive and imagination among the country’s population is being highlighted as one of the country’s major strengths. Good human capital is particularly found among professionals with some years of work experience. However, skills are a two-edged sword in Jordan. While Jordanian ICT specialists are increasingly being hired in other countries in the region, for instance in Dubai and Saudi Arabia, there are still barriers to overcome with regard to higher education modernization, in particularly curriculum relevance to the industry, and modes of cooperation between university and industry. These barriers are of a nature so that they can be addressed and a modernization process can be set fully in motion within a relatively short period. DRIVING SMART, DEMAND-DRIVEN DIGITAL INNOVATION ACROSS KEY SECTORS Smart specialization entails innovative combinations of existing and latent resources in new ways, which can be enabled further by digital technologies to create outreach and scale with new types of services. Addressing the issue of specialization in R&D and innovation is particularly crucial for regions/countries that are not leaders in any of the major science or technology domains.24 Leading benchmark countries such as the UK have driven growth in their entire economy through a focus on smart specialization and a digital economy. However, the focus on smart specialization still means that the tech verticals in the ICT sector (Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Hardware and Artificial Intelligence) are of the utmost importance to drive growth – the market for such solutions has the potential to grow bigger. A key trend mentioned above is that the ICT sector is no longer viewed as a stand-alone sector, but that digitization is highly embedded in other sectors as well. Moreover, there will be a substantial focus on selected tech verticals, that is, certain areas of the tech sector where Jordan has a comparative strength. Thus, in Jordan, smart specialization focuses on unlocking the potential for digitization in areas where Jordan has – or has the potential to develop – a competitive advantage, and through key tech verticals where Jordan currently has a stronghold. It can also be in areas/sectors of global importance, where Jordanian firms can be positioned in global value chains and can become a development partner, which can open up to further market opportunities. The increased digitization of the global economy provides 24 Foray, Dominique et al (2009): Smart Specialization – the concept an opportunity for Jordan to focus on further developing digitally enabled solutions to meet demands from key sectors. A focus on smart specialization is therefore of key importance for linking the ICT sector and the overall economy, and for assisting Jordan in shifting its effort towards the digital economy, which can drive productivity and service innovation. In the following, we present the six key sectors and key tech verticals that are of relevance to Jordan, and it will be argued why they are key to Jordan. To sum up, the driving sectors of the digital economy in Jordan are shown in the table below. Table 1: Proposed focus areas and niche sectors for the digital economy in Jordan Key sectors Global markets opportunity Jordan strengths Market enablers Vertical technologies Health The global eHealth market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7% from 2011- 2020, and the MENA market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 16% from 2014-2022.25 Jordan is viewed as a regional center for health and should take advantage of this position. 26 To reap this potential in Jordan, opportunities include unified eHealth records, e-health exchange, telemedicine, Arabic content in health, health insurance exchange and records, and online booking for doctors, to maximize Jordan’s competitive edge in medical tourism. Big data will be transforming the healthcare and integrated care sector to offer personalized solutions and new ways of providing diagnostics and care from the preventive care market to the intensive care. Integrated healthcare solutions, cloud based services Big data, learning analytics, AI Building on the existing eHealth program, a particular niche will be the intersection of eHealth, AI and the pharma industry powered by digital analytics capacity that Jordan can develop, for instance by using international big data platforms. Education The global smart education & learning market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 24.4% from 2015- 2020.27 Personalized and collaborative digital learning environments will revolutionize how education will be delivered globally. The latest advances in learning science, artificial intelligence, learning analytics, mobile platforms/services, and maker spaces, should enable this. Jordan will have a world-leading role in developing these types of solutions and platforms responding to the global need for scalable solutions that match 21st century skills demands. Jordan pioneered the adoption of technology as a means to innovate education several years ago and should exploit this. In Jordan, there are opportunities around digital curricula, entrepreneurship and digital skills for kids in schools, makerspaces in education, and online education for refugees, or in rural areas. Mobile platform solutions based on cloud technology, as digital educational content through advanced techniques in gamification and simulations Learning analytics, AI 25 26 int@j: Jordan ICT sector profile 27 Energy & Cleantech Globally, the worldwide cleantech market is expected to double in value to €4.4tr by 2025. 28 Another prediction shows an increase in market size from $601bn in 2014 to $1.3tn in 2020. Jordan has an impressive history of dealing with scarce resources and creating livable urban environments in a desert environment. Jordan will take a leading role in “innovating towards zero”, testing energy efficient solutions in close collaboration with the construction industry, adopting smart mobility solutions and delivering optimized tech-enabled solutions for water resource management. To reap this benefit, Jordan should exploit that it has more than 300 sunny days per year for solar power energy. Other opportunities include energy storage solutions, energy management and monitoring, and smart cities/buildings and houses. Low-carbon led disruption now slowing in lighting, in full swing in the power sector, and still in the early innings in autos. Require products, components and applications & services. Collectively LEDs, onshore wind, solar PV, and hybrid & electric vehicles present a set of breakthrough technologies that are rapidly taking market share in global lighting (69% by 2020 vs. 28% today), new power generation (51% by 2025 vs. 20% today), and autos (22% in 2025 vs. 3% today). This creates significant new opportunities. IoT, big data and sensors are technologies required to enable energy & cleantech. Transport The Global Intelligent Transport System Market is poised to grow at a CAGR of around 13.1% over the next decade to reach approximately $49.2 billion by 2025.29 The public transportation system in and around Amman as well as in the rural areas is relatively poor, which gives a strong incentive to improve public transportation and focus on Smart City Amman by GAM. Building on its smart city Amman initiative, Jordan will take a leading role in developing an effective digital transportation system, using for instance IoT sensors, Big Data and other new technologies. Opportunities include traffic management solutions, smart cities solutions, online ride sharing and booking. Next generation products, components and applications will need to be integrated in back office services and solutions to enable real-time data analysis. Sensors, mobile data and 5G. 28 29 Financial Sector/FinTech In the near future, the global FinTech market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 55% during the period 2016-202030, but with a large untapped potential in the MENA region. Good internet uptake and 75% of Jordanians unbanked leaves a great potential for enabling mobile payment solutions in Jordan. Jordan possess the potential to become the regional FinTech hub, and can be at the forefront of delivering FinTech solutions and transforming industry areas like retail banking, investing, and peer-to- peer lending. Next generation payments, lending, HR solutions and banking systems. FinTech, block chain technology Communications and security Particularly in the MENA region, CAGRs are high at around 23% from 2016-2022.31,32 Jordan has strong incentives to drive tech-led/digital security-related solutions and enable communications and connectivity in rural areas. Opportunities for Jordan in communications include for instance online and mobile payment solutions. Also, with the conflict in Syria and Iraq at its borders, Jordan will take a leading role in driving ICT led security-related solutions. In terms of security, with Jordan currently deploying smart IDs, this can include digital signatures as well for authentication into all applications. Advanced techniques in gamification and simulations, as well as more donor- oriented products and services such as identification and registration solutions Secure digital communications, specific niche technologies Source: DTI All content in the table above are examples of trending technologies adopted in international good practice. They are subject to change with the advancement of technologies. Moreover, the focus areas can be customized and validated to the local context as the sectors’ digitization grow, to ensure alignment with stakeholders’ needs and national priorities. 30 31 32 Smart specialization across key sectors in Jordan needs the ongoing support of key enablers and key vertical tech areas, which help build capacity, expertise and excellence to drive the digital economy. Jordan already has existing products, services and actors within the enabling sectors predicted to grow exponentially in terms of market in the MENA region by 2025, 33 i.e., digital content & gaming, ecommerce and professional services (integration and support services), which need to be encouraged to invest in becoming regional leaders and of relevance to global digital value chains. Given particularly the ongoing trend of mobile device uptake in the whole MENA region, and the young population, Jordan should strive to lead demand-driven innovation across the region. Similarly, key technologies of relevance across the sectors and the enabling sectors are the vertical tech areas, i.e., IOT, cloud computing, hardware and artificial intelligence. Here forecasts are predicting growth in the relevant tech markets and disruptive new business models that may emerge from these technologies. This needs to be complemented with significant capacity to lead the data revolution and be able to offer secure and reliable digital products and services. The above sectors are examples of international trends of sectors that have grown as a result of the opportunities of digitization. These sectors have been related to the Jordan differentiators and opportunities. However, the sectors should be seen as input to a wider dialogue and may change in the course of this strategy. LEADING THE MAKER REVOLUTION The maker revolution, where entrepreneurs use open source design, 3D printing etc. to bring manufacturing, architectural design etc. and technology together 34 , brings opportunities for small companies that can address markets much more easily, at a lower cost. The maker market allows small companies to prototype ideas, get funding, and then access manufacturing to scale up35. Moreover, crowdfunding platforms, where a large number of supporters fund projects and ideas, typically online, have further boosted the development, as makers can now approach supporters directly and receive funding for their work. Jordan is a young nation with much idea generating and support around the start-up culture. In the MENA region, Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt lead the seed investment culture for start-ups. Incubators such as Oasis 500, iPark, the incubator Darat Al Reyadah which was recently launched by int@j, the Amman Chamber of Commerce and MoICT, Zain Innovation Campus (ZINC) by ZAIN, Business Innovation Growth (BIG) by Orange, the Tank by UMNIAH and others are drivers behind this. Young entrepreneurs sees Jordan as a good place to build on new ideas36. 33 For example, gaming is expected to nearly triple in size in the coming years — from $1.6 billion in 2014 to $4.4 billion in 2022. Demand for local content will spur rapid MENA media growth. See for example growth-20141119/ 34 The Maker Revolution is a term first coined in Chris Anderson’s 2012 book “Makers: the new industrial revolution”. See also todays-maker-movement-is-the-new-industrial-revolution-tctv/ 35 36 17 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | With the advent of digital manufacturing, FabLabs are spreading around the world. These are key elements of the maker revolution. Jordan also has a strong focus on providing the right facilities such as incubators and fab labs to its entrepreneurs, and Jordan is the 5th best place in the MENA region to start a business37. Therefore, Jordan is in a strong position to lead the maker revolution. It is in this connection important that Jordan embrace an open source system to allow internal and external resources to access information, technology and talent, as a way to trigger competitiveness and become a real leader of the maker revolution regionally. However, there are currently challenges in Jordan related to the bureaucratic challenges of introducing new technologies such as 3D printing. It is important that these challenges are overcome to reap the full potential of new technologies and to create the best conditions for makers in Jordan. CREATING AND INTEGRATING SOLUTIONS FOR CONTENT PLATFORMS FOR THE ARAB MARKET Content and digital commerce solutions are not new trends, but persistent trends. At the same time, very little content is actually available in Arabic language and the region still has a large potential for growth in eCommerce uptake. The best guesstimate of the actual content available in Arabic is around 3%, according to MIT38, whilst on average, 60 % of Arabs prefer digital content to be in Arabic39. In 2015, Jordan’s eCommerce market was worth 40 million USD, and the eCommerce market in the MENA region is projected to double its value by 202040. Jordan has strong knowledge and long tradition in the field of online content and eCommerce, as a large percentage of digital content and e-commerce engines are either based or have back-offices in Jordan41. This means that there is a huge gap in supply and demand and that Jordan has a competitive advantage in addressing this gap. Jordan’s strength lies in building the platforms and technologies that manage e-content and eCommerce. Content creation per se can continue to grow in parallel but is not perceived to be of high impact compared to the volume and level of content created in other Arab countries focusing on digital content as well (such as Egypt and Lebanon). However, with Jordan focusing on building platforms and technologies for managing content, there might be a potential for regional partnerships with Egypt and Lebanon, where much content is created, to support these countries in managing and digitizing the Arabic content. REACH2025 – JORDAN’S DIGITAL VISION AND MISSION The REACH2025 vision is based on Jordan’s strengths and opportunities for responding to the current digital strengths and for making Jordan relevant in the global digital economy. 37 38 39 40 41 The figure from this source is not repeated in the text, as there are no certain figures on the exact percentage. 18 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | The digital vision statement is as follows: In 2025, Jordan will: be the platform for digital innovation by being an innovation creating center for next generation solutions driven by strong partnerships between Jordanian champions and global IT companies. have world-class talent that can compete and collaborate on the global digital skills market with an emphasis on applied solutions driving value added creation. drive globally competitive and innovative digital solutions in the following key sectors: - HEALTH – Jordan is viewed as a regional center for health and should take advantage of this position. To reap this potential in Jordan, opportunities include unified eHealth records, e- health exchange, telemedicine, Arabic content in health, health insurance exchange and records, and online booking for doctors. Building on the existing eHealth program, a particular niche will be the intersection of the Health sector, AI and the pharma industry powered by digital analytics capacity. - EDUCATION – Personalized and collaborative digital learning environments will revolutionize how education will be delivered globally. The latest advances in learning science, artificial intelligence, learning analytics, mobile platforms/services, and maker spaces, should enable this. Jordan will have a world-leading role in developing these types of solutions and platforms responding to the global need for scalable solutions that match 21st century skills demands. Jordan pioneered the adoption of ICT as a means to innovate education several years ago and should exploit this. In Jordan, there are opportunities around digital curricula, entrepreneurship and digital skills for kids in schools, makerspaces in education, and online education for refugees. - ENERGY & CLEANTECH – Jordan has an impressive history of dealing with scarce resources and creating livable urban environments in a desert environment. Jordan will take a leading role in “innovating towards zero”, testing energy efficient solutions in close collaboration with the construction industry, adopting smart mobility solutions and delivering optimized tech-enabled solutions for water resource management. To reap this benefit, Jordan should exploit that it has more than 300 sunny days per year for solar power energy. Other opportunities include energy storage solutions, energy management and monitoring, and smart cities/buildings and houses. - FINANCIAL SECTOR – Jordan possess the potential to become the regional FinTech hub, and can be at the forefront of delivering FinTech solutions and transforming industry areas like retail banking, investing, and peer-to-peer lending. - TRANSPORT – building on its smart city Amman initiative, Jordan will take a leading role in developing an effective digital transportation system, using for instance IoT sensors, Big Data and other new technologies. - COMMUNICATION AND SECURITY – Jordan has strong incentives to drive ICT-led security- related solutions and enable communications and connectivity in rural areas. Also, with the conflict in Syria and Iraq at its borders, Jordan will take a leading role in driving ICT led security-related solutions. In terms of security, with Jordan currently deploying smart IDs, this can include digital signatures as well for authentication into all applications. 19 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | Moreover, there will be a substantial focus on selected tech verticals. Tech verticals such as IoT, cloud computing, hardware (including electronics design) and artificial intelligence (AI) are among the verticals where Jordan is perceived to have a stronghold. lead the maker revolution across the region. Led by the established hardware industry, product innovation will be increasingly supported by embedding cutting-edge technologies directly into industrial zones and tech hubs. establish itself as the leading solutions builder and integrator for content platforms for the Arab market, which will serve the demand of the exponentially growing young digital Arabic speaking customer base across the region and beyond. …be the preferred place in the region for starting, scaling & growing a tech company by ensuring clear rules, procedures and policies, as well as acceleration and incubation. The above vision statement translates into the following vision and mission statements: Vision A digital economy that empowers people, sectors and businesses to raise productivity and ensure growth and prosperity, creating a highly attractive business destination for investments and international collaboration. Mission Jordan will • Ensure a highly stable, nurturing business environment. • Drive creative and innovative technologies in key niche sectors and markets. • Strengthen the entrepreneurial mindset of the country, supported by specialized skills. • Support the transformation towards being a platform for innovation in international partnerships. • Spur innovation through open access in technology, people, standards and data. By focusing on these areas, Jordan will increase its relevance to regional and global niche markets. GROWTH TARGETS TO ASPIRE TO BY 2025 It is imperative to secure growth in Jordan’s economy and, subsequently, to measure this growth to ensure progress. Consequently, the vision and action plan are accompanied by the development of concrete, realistic and measurable targets. The Key Performance Indicators (presented under each action in Annex1) are the outputs and the immediate results of the actions if implemented to the required scope and within the proposed timeframe. As part of the assessment phase, relevant key benchmarks were assembled that reflect key indicators of 20 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | the digital economy and the necessary business environment. Here, further positive change is expected to be seen. Finally, the overall targets of growth in GDP, revenue, jobs and digital economy businesses are expected to be reached by 2025. Figure 1 illustrates the logic behind the need for an intervention/action plan, the actions, KPIs and targets. Figure 1: Intervention logic Source: DTI In the following, we present the overall target opportunities to aspire to by 2025 as well as Jordan’s position in key indices. TARGET OPPORTUNITIES TO ACCELERATE GROWTH IN JORDAN BY 2025 The overall targets are built on benchmarks from international good practice countries. This means that they are based on growth figures from other countries that have invested heavily in the digital economy and benefitted from it. This also means that the targets should be seen as growth opportunities for Jordan, if the country succeeds in the transformation to a digital economy. This requires a full implementation of the proposed action framework within the proposed timeframe. If timely action is not taken immediately, other key sectors will not benefit from digitization and the tech sector will continue to decline and loose relevance on the global market. The key proposed high-level targets to be set up for each of these high-level areas are shown in Table 2. The targets set are assuming a serious implementation effort starting in the first year and constant push for results and impact. 21 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | Table 2: Key proposed high-level targets Type Target Acceleration of growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (national level) 3%-4% extra growth annually by 2025. This will be effective after two years and will gradually increase to up to 4%. First two years will see an estimate of 3% growth rate in accordance with IMF figures, but no extra growth from digital economy interventions. In year 3, it is predicted to see a growth rate of 1%, In year 4 and 5, an annual growth on minimum 2% is expected. In year 6 to 9, an annual growth of 3%-4% is expected. This corresponds to a 6%-8% overall GDP growth by 2025 (A 3-4% extra growth annually plus the 3-4% IMF projected growth that will happen regardless of an intervention, according to IMF figures). Revenue growth across digital economy sectors Revenue is defined as the total income a company generates – domestically and internationally (export) (Additional revenue growth % on top of annual sectors revenue) Accumulative increase by 25%-30% in digital sector’s revenue by 2025. Growth is expected to start after 2 years when regulatory and enabling environment is fully in place. From 2019-2025, an annual average growth in sector’s revenue is expected to be app. 4% on average, reaching a 28% increase in 2025.

Source: DTI ACCELERATION OF GROWTH IN GDP From the international literature42, it is clear that digitization used with a view to both being more effective and more innovative creates growth in companies and for the economy as a whole. One way of monitoring growth due to increased digital economy presence is to measure the contribution to Gross Value Added (GVA)43 or Gross Domestic Product (GDP)44. Table 3: International examples of targets for acceleration of growth in GDP/GVA The UK has chosen to focus on GVA and has seen an increase of 27% between 2010 and 2014 in its digital tech industries (the UK term). This translates into a yearly growth rate of approx. 7%.45 A Parliament-led enquiry in the UK found that he digital economy in the United Kingdom is a success story: the British economy has the highest percentage of gross domestic product attributed to the digital economy of all European 42 Hanne Shapiro, Martin Eggert Hansen og Simon Fuglsang Østergaard, DTI (2014): Kortlægning af kompetencebehov og barrierer for videregående VEU for faglærte inden for det tekniske og produktionsrettede område 43 Defined as output minus intermediate consumption 44 Defined as market value of all final goods and services produced in a period 45 1.pdf?utm_content=buffer2e58f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer 0 420 840 1,260 1,680 2,100 2,520 2,940 3,360 3,780 0 200 600 1,000 1,200 1,600 2,000 2,200 2,600 3,000 0 2,000 4,000 6,000 8,000 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Growth in Number of new Businesses in Digital Economy Sectors New businesses created in Digital Economy sectors through REACH intervention programs New businesses created in Digital Economy sectors through natural and spillover growth 5,000 to 7,000 new Digital Economy Businesses 25 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | nations; UK digital industries grew two and a half times as fast as the economy as a whole between 2003 and 2013; and the United Kingdom has the highest percentage of individual internet usage of any G7 economy.46 Dubai, which is also a very ambitious country and currently the leading MENA country in many international indices such as World Economic Forum, has set a yearly GDP growth target (exclusive of oil) of 5% up to 2021.47 Digitization clearly has an impact on GDP growth. A recent study shows that a 10% increase in digitization contributes to a 0.59% increase in GDP for a transitional economy like Jordan.48 Jordan clearly has to be ambitious in its goal setting. At the same time, the country has much catching up to do before it can have similar growth rates as the UK or even Dubai, which are both advanced economies in terms of digitization and thus experience higher GDP growth rates than transitional economies49. Based on international literature and Jordan’s strengths, opportunities, and weaknesses, it is estimated that a yearly growth rate of between 3% and 4% on top of the traditional GDP growth (currently estimated by IMF at 2.8 % increase for 2016 and 3.2 % increase for 201750) is the target for Jordan by 2025. This digital economy target will be effective after two years and will gradually increase to up to 4%. The first two years will see a 3% growth rate in accordance with IMF figures, but no extra growth from digital economy interventions. Year 3, with the assumption than the digital economy action plan has been implemented at the proposed speed and extent, is predicted to see a growth rate of 1% additional growth on top of IMF projections. In year 4 and 5, an annual additional growth on minimum 2% is expected. In year 6 to 9, an annual additional growth of 3%-4% is expected. This corresponds to a 6%-8% total increase in GDP by 2025 (A 3-4% extra growth annually plus the 3-4% projected growth that will happen regardless of an intervention, according to IMF figures). GROWTH IN REVENUE To measure digitization in companies, other countries are focusing on revenue, or turnover as it is termed in the UK. Revenue is defined as the income of a company, both including domestic and international (export). Table 4: International example of targets for growth in turnover The UK’s Tech Nation initiative clearly shows that digital tech industries grew 32% faster in terms of turnover than the national average in a five-year time span.51 46 47 48 Strategy& (2012): Maximizing the impact of digitization 49 Strategy& (2012): Maximizing the impact of digitization 50 IMF World Economic Outlook 2016, 51 1.pdf?utm_content=buffer2e58f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer 26 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | Thus, if digitization is used proactively in sectors and companies in Jordan, growth can be expected within the period between now and 2025. However, for digital companies to grow it is necessary to have an open and sound regulatory business environment, which the assessment has shown that Jordan does not yet fully have and need to focus on. Therefore, Jordanian digital economy companies cannot be expected to grow as much as their UK counterparts. However, once the regulatory environment is in place, Jordan has the advantage of a creative population and a strong setup around a startup culture that can boost growth in digital economy industries. The regulatory environment is assumed to be fully in place within the first two years, meaning that Jordanian digital economy companies can be expected to start growing faster after two years. After 10 years, it is estimated that the accumulative and gradual growth for digital economy industries should be between 25% and 30% for Jordan, giving Jordanian companies a few more years to reach a growth similar to the British companies. GROWTH IN JOBS The proposed focus of Jordan on selected sectors where digitization has the potential to create a competitive edge is expected to drive job creation and growth in these sectors. At the same time, international experience from Europe shows that digitization will drive productivity increase, which will have a negative impact on jobs in the short term. Nevertheless, benchmark countries have largely experienced high growth in digital economy jobs as a result of digital economy. Table 5: International examples of targets for growth in jobs In the UK, digital tech economy jobs grew approximately 11% between 2011 and 2014, which is an average yearly increase of nearly 4%. The UK has experienced a 2.8 times faster job growth in the digital tech economy compared to the rest of the economy.52 Ireland, a leading European ICT hub, expects a yearly increase in tech jobs of approx. 5%, between 2014 and 2018.53 The digital economy is expected to create new jobs in two different categories: by scaling up existing new companies in key sectors and by either creating new companies or registering new branches (new entrants), in addition to the spill-over effect. To estimate jobs created in existing companies, the following calculation has been made: The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that there are 1.2 million working Jordanians, 463,000 of whom are in the public sector. That leaves a little over 700,000 people in the private sector.54 It is estimated that half of these jobs potentially pertain to the future digital economy – the ICT sector as well as the six 52 1.pdf?utm_content=buffer2e58f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer 53 2014/$file/ICT+Skills+Action+Plan+2014.pdf 54 Jordan’s National Employment Strategy 2011-2020 27 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | selected key sectors (totaling 350,000 jobs). It is widely recognized that digitization creates both direct and indirect jobs. For instance, in the US, one digital job creates 5 indirect jobs55. In the international benchmark examples above, the yearly job growth in the digital economy in the UK and Ireland are between 4% and 5%. In Jordan, the service industry is not necessarily entirely local, which means that the job growth in the digital economy will be a little less. Therefore, it is estimated that Jordan can manage an average yearly job growth of 3%-3.5%. This amounts to the digital economy creating a multiplier effect of 1.3 over 10 years, amounting to 105,00056 jobs. To estimate new digital economy jobs created, the following estimations have been made: As a result of the acceleration programme under action 5, 1,000 digital economy start-ups would be incubated in the first three years. For the next 3-year period, an additional 1,000 start-ups would be incubated and for the last 3-year period, another 1,000 start-ups would be incubated. This amounts to 3,000 digital economy startups in total which are created within the acceleration prorgamme. It is estimated that on average these start-ups will create on average five jobs each (15,000 jobs in a 10-year life span). Moreover, approximately 700 new businesses are created in all sectors every month outside of the acceleration programme, representing new businesses, spinoffs from existing companies and/or universities, and companies coming from outside registering as new companies in Jordan. Of these companies, it is expected that 10% of these pertain to sectors relevant in the future digital economy. This amounts to 840 businesses annually. Assuming that half of these companies survive (amounting to 420 companies), this amounts to the creation of 4,200 companies in ten years. Assuming that these companies create 5 jobs each on average, this is an additional 21,000 jobs. The total job creation is the following:  the new jobs within existing companies within core sectors & tech sector (105,000 jobs in 10 years) PLUS  the jobs created in digital economy startups or spin offs outside of the acceleration programs (18,900 jobs in 10 years) PLUS  the new jobs created by digital economy start-ups within the acceleration program (15,000 jobs in 10 years). This totals 138,900 jobs. This means setting a political goal of between 130,000 and150,000 new jobs over a 10-year period. This figure does also factor in possible growth in university spin-outs and non- for-profit sector jobs, which may also potentially be growing. However, the figure does not factor in the potential job loss that Jordan may experience as a result of digitization. 55 See for instance Moretti, Enrico (2012): The new geography of jobs 56 350,000 x 0.3 equals the extra job growth of 105,000 28 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | GROWTH IN DIGITAL BUSINESSES Closely linked to the growth in jobs is the growth in digital businesses. As of 2016, Jordan has a baseline of 600 digital economy companies according to int@j estimates. In all sectors, approximately 700 new businesses are created in all sectors every month, representing new businesses, spinoffs from existing companies and/or universities, and companies coming from outside registering as new companies in Jordan. Of these companies, it is expected that 10% of these pertain to sectors relevant in the digital economy. This amounts to 840 businesses annually. From international benchmarks, it can be seen that approximately half of the companies survive. Assuming that half of these are expected to survive, which amounts to 420 digital companies created every year. In ten years, this will amount to 3,780 companies. In addition, 3,000 new digital economy companies are created under Action 5. In total, this amounts to 6,780 digital companies. For the purpose of setting a target, the range of 5,000-7,000 new digital businesses is set. Digital businesses can be companies in key sectors that venture into the digital economy as well as newly created digital companies. FUTURE SOCIO-ECONOMIC INDICATORS The healthiness of the future society and the attractiveness of an economy are increasingly being measured in additional socio-economic indicators such as livability, happiness, sustainability and resilience as well as the potential for social innovation. Actual indicators in this field are at the explorative stage and aim to capture the socio-economic value the digital economy can deliver. Relevant trackers that Jordan should be considering are inclusiveness of the digital economy with a specific emphasis on the inclusion of immigrants and refugees as well as fostering a digital economy that is nationwide rather than focused on Amman, the empowerment of women, the contribution of the digital economy to the green economy and as a very important issue the impact of the digitization to improve transparency and working processes of government and the non-for -profit sector. All of these outcome indicators attract huge international attention currently and there is significant potential to become a regional leader in demonstrating impact and solutions that work in the MENA region. International literature point to a number of socio-economic indicators that could be taken into consideration in the future to track progress. Examples of these indicators are found below.

Value derived from the digital future are beyond GDP, not only measured in economic value but also in specific added social value. We have selected key metrics from independent global rankings that should be monitored to track Jordan’s performance. The reason for choosing to measure Jordan’s performance in these key areas is to instill investor confidence and help ensure that Jordan is perceived to be an attractive country to work and do business in. 30 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | Table 7: Jordan’s position in selected international indices The table above shows that there are success stories in Jordan, particularly in respect to the effectiveness of the law-making bodies and venture capital availability, which have both increased. However, Jordan is declining in a number of areas central to the digital economy. The business environment in terms of number of days, procedures, and cost to start a business and number of days to enforce a contract are at a level too low for Jordan to excel, even though two of the indicators show signs of increasing. In addition, in the skills area, particularly the quality of mathematics and science education, the indicator is dropping at an alarming rate. The impact on ICTs on new organizational models also dropped quite alarmingly, clearly showing a need for immediate action if Jordan is to fulfil its Indicator 2016 Trend Source Selected Sub-Indicators RANK /140 2015 to 2016 Political and regulatory environment Effectiveness of law-making bodies* 45 20 WEF Global Competitiveness Report No. procedures to enforce a contract 89 2 World Bank Doing Business No. days to enforce a contract 104 2 World Bank Doing Business Business and innovation environment Availability of latest technologies* 47 -6 WEF Global Competitiveness Report Venture capital availability* 19 4 WEF Global Competitiveness Report No. days to start a business 72 -3 World Bank Doing Business No. procedures to start a business 74 4 World Bank Doing Business Intensity of local competition* 57 0 World Bank Doing Business Gov’t procurement of advanced tech* 42 -7 WEF Global Competitiveness Report Infrastructure Mobile network coverage, % pop 67 -1 International Telecommunications Union ICT Indicators Secure Internet servers/million pop 75 -4 World Bank Development Indicators Affordability Prepaid mobile cellular tariffs, PPP $/min 7 46 International Telecommunications Union ICT Indicators Skills Quality of educational system* 32 -8 WEF Global Competitiveness Report Quality of math & science education* 64 -25 WEF Global Competitiveness Report Individual usage Mobile phone subscriptions/100 pop 24 9 International Telecommunications Union ICT Indicators Use of virtual social networks* 57 1 WEF Global Competitiveness Report Business usage Firm-level technology absorption* 35 1 WEF Global Competitiveness Report Capacity for innovation* 47 11 WEF Global Competitiveness Report Government usage Importance of ICTs to gov’t vision* 35 -9 WEF Global Competitiveness Report Government Online Service Index, 0–1 (best) 62 0 UNDESA UN E-Government Development Economic impacts Impact of ICTs on new services & products* 50 -9 WEF Global Competitiveness Report Impact of ICTs on new organizational models* 56 -25 WEF Global Competitiveness Report Social impacts Impact of ICTs on access to basic services* 43 -8 WEF Global Competitiveness Report ICT use & gov’t efficiency* 47 -17 WEF Global Competitiveness Report E-Participation Index, 0–1 (best) 70 -1 UNDESA UN E-Government Development 31 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | digital economy vision. Lastly, the level of the eGovernment indicator is a clear sign that government needs a more active role in developing a digital economy for Jordan. All of the above clearly shows a need for immediate action, if Jordan is to be perceived as a leading digital economy in the future. KEY QUESTIONS/ISSUES TO ADDRESS The insights above leads to a number of key questions or issues to address for Jordan to move in the direction of the vision towards an action plan. The following key questions have been identified: 1. How can Jordan shift its efforts to support demand driven innovation across key sectors and ecosystems in Jordan in collaboration with the ICT sector, tech start-ups and universities? 2. How can Jordan ensure world-class talent and build relevant skills and capacity for tomorrow’s global digital economy? 3. How can Jordan ensure collaboration within the ICT sector, and among the ICT sector and other key sectors to leverage its strategic partnerships to stimulate digitization in key sectors? 4. How can Jordan facilitate an environment that provides companies with the most favorable business environment and laws/regulations? 5. How can Jordan be inclusive and open to new technologies and new technologies business models transformation? 6. How can Jordan ensure a strong leadership position in the development of culturally adapted and localized Arab content and solutions? 7. How can Jordan ensure the right conditions for startups leading a maker revolution? COST OF INACTION The above questions require that actions are taken immediately. If Jordan continues without changes, it will imply that the tech sector will continue to be challenged. Already now, the sector is witnessing a decline in turnover. The average development from 2011-2014 has been a decline of 9 percent57. Also, exports to key markets have declined, both to Saudi Arabia and the US, which are the two major export 57 int@j (2014): ICT & ITES Industry Statistics & Yearbook 32 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | destinations58. This situation clearly needs to be turned around if Jordan is to prosper and to play a key role in the digital economy. Key weaknesses that need to be rectified for Jordan to turn around the above situation include the relative mismatch between the university curricular and the requirements from the industry, and the lack of a unanimous interpretation of the regulatory framework in Jordan. However, if action is taken, Jordan can take advantage of its good human capital and strong conditions for startups and position itself as a strong digital player in the MENA region. Therefore, the stepping stones for bridging the gap between the current situation and Jordan’s place in the digital economy in 2025 is illustrated below. Figure 0.1: Bridging the “valley of death” Source: DTI 58 int@j (2014): ICT & ITES Industry Statistics & Yearbook 33 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | It is clear that Jordan faces a number of declining indicators, such as declining revenue in the ICT sector, a skills mismatch and lack of collaboration among companies and sectors. If nothing is done to revitalize the tech sector and move the country as a whole towards a digital economy, the declining figures are expected to continue and the cost of inaction will be paramount to Jordan, resulting in a lack of relevance in global value chains. KEY FOCUS AREAS THAT DRIVE INITIATIVES LEADING TO TRANSFORMATION To bridge the cost of inaction – or “valley of death” – a number of focus areas have been identified that drive transformation change and are the pillars of the digital economy. These focus areas have been based on two assessments: They are drivers of the digital economy addressed in comparative transformational national strategies, and they are key drivers and indicators used in recognized digital economy benchmarks, such as by the OECD’s Measuring the digital economy 59 , the World Economic Forum’s global competitiveness index 60 , the World Economic Forum’s information and communication technology benchmark61 and ITU’s ICT development index62 . The six key focus areas that will drive the initiatives and actions are as follows: Smart Specialization and demand-driven innovation Tech Start-ups and Entrepreneurs Public Sector Innovation Enabling Business Environment ICT Skills, Capacity and Talent Smart Infrastructure The key focus areas are elaborated more below. In addition, in placing Jordan on the path towards excellence, a number of high-level actions have been identified. These high-level actions are linked to the aforementioned focus areas. Each high-level action will inform a number of concrete actions, with clear owners and targets attached to them. SMART SPECIALIZATION 63 AND DEMAND-DRIVEN INNOVATION focuses on unlocking the potential for digitization in areas where Jordan has – or has the potential to develop – a competitive advantage. It can also be in areas/sectors of global importance, where Jordan can be relevant in global value chains. The increased digitization of the global economy provides an opportunity for Jordan to focus on further developing digitally enabled solutions to fit the demands from key sectors. TECH START-UPS AND ENTREPRENEURS sets out to build on the strength of the tech startup environment in Jordan, and to give the companies the best possibilities for scaling and growing. The startup 59 60 61 62 63 We are aware that our use of this term conflicts with how for instance the European Commission uses it. 34 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | companies – and later on, the growing companies – will typically need to have a regional and/or global focus, as the Jordan market is typically too small and poor for companies to prosper. However, a key barrier in Jordan is the concrete legal and regulatory challenges that make starting and closing a tech business too risky and unattractive. PUBLIC SECTOR INNOVATION: Government plays a large role in ensuring that a digital strategy can unfold and become a reality on the ground. As a lawmaker, but also as enabling partner and a law enforcer or interpreter, and as a market, where digital solutions can be tested and unfolded. ENABLING BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT: To be an important player in the global digital economy, Jordan needs world-class companies. To support these, Jordan needs to have favorable business conditions spanning from opening a business and running it to closing it down, but clearly also the most transparent laws. These business conditions are not only pertaining to ICT, but should be favorable to companies across the economy. ICT SKILLS, CAPACITY AND TALENT: Building on one of the other clear strengths that Jordan has, namely its human capital, is also important for positioning Jordan in the global value chains and in the region. The skills should be further developed to ensure that Jordan has the innovative skills for bringing ICT verticals into other key sectors. One of the current initiatives to build on is the Jordan Skills Standardization Organization (JSSO) focusing on bridging the gap between universities’ graduates and private sector requirements and working on improving skills of unemployed resources according to the unique sector needs and trends64 based on a qualifications framework. Another is the int@j initiative, offering - through its international partners and local training centers - a certification program related to IoT, Cloud Computing and Big Data. The aim of this is to better equip ICT professionals and fresh graduates. SMART INFRASTRUCTURE is highly relevant for the uptake and use of digital solutions among businesses and its employees. The digital infrastructure should be in place in Jordan and should be able to meet the demands and enable the advancement to a digital economy, for the benefit of the tech sector and the wider digital economy sectors. APPROACH AND LOGIC FRAMEWORK TO DRIVE THE TRANSFORMATION FORWARD The action plan builds on a strong foundation in Jordan as highlighted in the vision paper:  The first REACH Initiative, which was launched in year 2000 as the official kick-start of a comprehensive public-private partnership, aimed at developing the country’s ICT sector and pave the way for the other economic sectors to move into the Knowledge Economy. 64 35 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE |  There are over 600 Jordanian ICT companies in the ICT cluster, which drive digitization and are a key resource for skills and capacity in Jordan.  As a country with few natural resources, Jordan’s economy diversified early based on investments in new technologies and infrastructure. The key to reaching the future will be to build on these enablers and accelerate digital innovation through cross-sectoral collaboration.  Jordanians are a people that have shaped their future over centuries. There is a deeply engrained tradition to make the future happen through informed decisions and enable the future to the benefit of everyone. Additionally, there is a tradition in Jordan for collaborative effort across industry, government, non-for- profit organizations and even the Royal Court to drive change and to ensure that Jordan is globally competitive and not 'left behind'. This action plan has been compiled and built based on a review of existing initiatives and programs and clearly identifying where they can be scaled, accelerated or expanded, as well as based on good practice and benchmarks with other economies’ and countries’ key actions. To reach the vision statements presented above, a number of actions were developed. These actions build on stakeholder and expert input as well as international good practice. The following logic framework explains how the actions relate to the vision statements and key differentiators for Jordan. Figure 2: Logic framework linking vision and action Source: DTI As can be seen from Figure 1, the differentiators/opportunities, vision, mission and core elements translate into a set of strategic objectives as well as high-level actions with specific objectives, sub-actions, owners, budget considerations & KPIs. The high-level actions are specified in further detail below and in Annex 1. The actions set out to put Jordan amongst the leading digital economies of the world. Focus is on creating an institutionalized and sustainable, transformative ecosystem for a digital economy, opening up Jordan to be a regional hub for makers and tech start-ups. Steps on the way include delivering a policy push to enable the ICT sector and the key economic sectors to grow Jordan through a digital economy, and leveraging existing platforms and programs with a focus on strengthening the Jordanian start-ups and companies. THE ACTION FRAMEWORK The digital economy in Jordan has four key focus areas, i.e., smart specialization, tech start-ups & entrepreneurs, public sector innovation, and skills capacity & talent. Under smart specialization, the digital economy can be accelerated by focusing on three driving core elements to enable the digital economy:  The six leading sectors (Health, Education, Energy & Cleantech, Transport & logistics, Financial sector, and Communications & security)  The key enablers (Content & gaming, E-commerce and Professional services)  The vertical tech areas (IOT, Cloud Computing, Hardware and Artificial Intelligence) Taking an ecosystem perspective, emphasis of lead actions need to be further on activating and motivating makers and their transition to become startups or inform the innovation system around Jordan’s companies. Startups need to be increased in numbers and encouraged to venture into the digital economy focus areas, whilst both startups and Jordan companies need to investigate partnerships with international companies and shift to a demand-led market development paradigm informed by considerations across global value chains and markets. Finally, activating public sector innovation is also of key importance for government to act as a market for Jordanian innovations. Underlying this is open access to world-class talent (both talent graduating from educational systems and talent in the active labor force). 38 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | Figure 3: Framework for the actions Source: DTI The supporting actions towards the transformation of a digital economy in Jordan are the enabling business environment and smart digital economy infrastructure. Here, particularly the accessibility and adoption rate of emerging technologies as well as continuous updating of underlying telecommunications business models matter. Underlying the effort of accelerating smart specialization in Jordan is also the establishment of a strong, visible, accountable and fundamentally co-owned governance structure. For this reason, Jordan needs to consider a governance structure that will directly oversee the performance and impact of the lead actions. This document presents an ideal governance model highlighting three specific governance actions in developing and maintaining multiple layers of leadership, smart regulation and strong monitoring and evaluation. To finalize the governance model, all relevant actors, roles and mandates should be reviewed in the near future to ensure an effective implementation set-up. THE ACTIONS Based on the core elements and strategic objectives presented above, 15 high-level actions and 3 governance actions have been developed. They are based on Jordan’s key differentiators/opportunities, strengths, opportunities, and weaknesses, as well as international experience in terms of how other benchmark countries have set the path for achieving a digital vision. The sub-actions with clear owners and timelines are specified for the 15 high-level actions and 3 governance actions later in the report. To set a roadmap for the high-level actions to reach their KPIs, it is important to further spell out how the actions will be specified. This section presents the high-level actions and a short explanation of the 39 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | detailed sub-actions underlying each of the high-level actions. The sub-actions are designed for the next three years. After a period of three years, the action plan will have to be revised and new sub-actions identified. Owners – or coordinators – have been assigned for each of the sub-actions. These will lead the transformation of Jordan towards a digital economy. The 15 high-level actions and 3 governance actions have owners, budget indications and clear KPIs to ensure the progress and success of the digital strategy. The actions are presented below. For a full overview of the details for each action, please see Annex 1. As can be seen from the figure below, the lead, supporting and governance actions are closely interlinked. The lead actions sets out to drive smart specialization whilst the support actions are the prerequisites for the lead actions to succeed. The governance actions ensure visibility and accountability. Figure 4: The linkages between the lead, supporting and governance actions Source: DTI Leading Actions Governance Actions Supporting Actions 40 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | Lead actions The first set of leading actions a strategic objective of enabling and supporting the transition of the Jordan economy towards becoming a digital economy through smart specialization, serving global niche markets. Moreover, they are important for reaching the concrete vision of social change and a sustainable digital economy. They are presented below. It should be noted that some of the actions are already being initiated. Box 2: Lead actions Smart Specialization & Growth Action 1 – Adopting the Digital Economy Framework in Jordan’s economy …by launching a Digital Economy Catapult and Launchpads in key sectors and verticals Create an independent digital economy catapult – a platform for the digital economy in Jordan. It should be established as a network of specialized centers of excellence with one headquarter/umbrella. A digital economy catapult will be established with one headquarter and nine catapults in the six leading sectors (Health, Education, Energy & Cleantech, Transport & logistics, Financial sector, and Communications & security) and three key enablers (Content & gaming, E-commerce and Professional services). The vertical tech areas (IOT, Cloud Computing, Hardware and Artificial Intelligence) will be embedded in the relevant catapults. Action 2 – Creating globally relevant, high value digital applications, solutions and IP … by supporting in-licensing and the reuse of IPs Create national agreement on utilizing local intellectual property/innovations/solutions for the digital economy. The action is building on the differentiator of leveraging high-level strategic partnerships. A way of doing this is to reuse IPs from international companies. Leading countries are experimenting with the reuse of local intellectual property/existing solutions to create an open economy that facilitates digital innovation. Action 3 - Driving global partnerships and bridges with international digital hubs … through a network of international innovation centers in key markets Strengthen and promote Jordan’s digital solutions and market development potential in key export markets. The main focus is to enable business-to-business partnerships between Jordanian digital economy companies and international partners, to create international awareness of Jordan’s strengths, differentiators and capabilities. Public sector innovation Action 4 – Transforming government and public sector to be “digital by default” by 2020 …by developing open data policy, changing models of implementation based on Public- Private Partnerships and leading and accelerating digital innovation across government Transform government and public sector to be a regionally and globally recognized leader in public sector innovation and digitization by going digital by default. The aims for Jordan are to achieve a strong and open public infrastructure key for developing a strong digital economy and create a more efficient government as shown by leading countries. Moreover, the actions are responding to the weakness of government not acting as a competent market and user that can drive digital economy. Startups & entrepreneurship Action 5 - Boosting digital economy startups …in Jordan and special zones, by increasing incubation, acceleration & support capacity 41 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | Support and scale tech start-ups, particularly in venturing into the digital economy. This is done through physical and/or virtual tech zones, where companies enjoy special benefits. Action 6 – Making Jordan the regional hub for makers …by giving all makers access to the innovation infrastructure/ecosystem The maker movement, where entrepreneurs use open source design, 3D printing etc. to bring manufacturing, architectural design etc. and technology together65, brings opportunities for small companies that can address markets much more easily, at a lower cost. Jordan has an opportunity of leading the maker movement in the region by building a national program co-owned between local industry, foundations, universities and other educational institutions. The action is responding to the key differentiator of leading the maker revolution and aims at strengthening the local innovation and entrepreneurship culture. Action 7 – Enabling a culture of digital entrepreneurship & intrapreneurship across Jordan …by launching a national campaign and through building specialized corporate funds and action for intrapreneurship To create awareness and support of the culture of entrepreneurship; launch national campaign, support program for entrepreneurs & intrapreneurs, and integrate the concepts of entrepreneurship into education. The action is building on Jordan’s differentiator on leveraging high-level strategic partnerships, with the aim of creating ecosystems and collaboration including the public sector, private sector, and universities, around the digital economy. Skills, capacity & talent Action 8 - Implementing 21st century skills to support the digital economy …by linking digital economy skills needs to the nation-wide overhaul of the education system Link digital economy to the nation-wide overhaul of the education system, linking the education policy framework to the digital economy and 21st century skills needs. The action is building on the differentiator of producing specialized tech talent, entrepreneurial drive and imagination. It is also addresses the weakness of the mismatch between the university curricular and graduates and industry requirements. Action 9 – Creating a world-class talent pool to support and drive the digital economy demand locally and globally …by supporting training & qualifications and enabling an open labor market Create an attractive labor market by focusing on key smart specialization areas and supporting knowledge transfer programs. Create an open (for local and foreign investors and employees) labor market linked to the global skills market and actively focused on export of Jordanian products and solutions and services-built Jordanian skills. The aim of this action is to enable the industry to access the right talent at the right time. Action 10 – Creating models and tools for better women participation in the digital economy …in workplaces and as active users 65 The Maker Revolution is a term first coined in Chris Anderson’s 2012 book “Makers: the new industrial revolution”. See also todays-maker-movement-is-the-new-industrial-revolution-tctv/ 42 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | Empower women to work more in the digital economy and support women in being part of digital services. The aim of this action is to unlock the untapped potential the educated female workforce. According to UN and int@j figures, the current percentage of women in tech sectors is 30%, but the potential is 50%. Moreover, the action sets out to empower women to be part of the digital economy, allowing women to drive usage and demand for digital services. Source: DTI Support actions The supporting actions have the purpose of ensuring that the lead actions can be reached. In other words, they can be said to be the prerequisites for the success of the lead actions. The supporting actions have the strategic objective of improving the enabling and investment environment for tech companies and digital innovation, including emerging industries. Box 3: Support actions Enabling business environment Action 11 – Creating an open, stable and enabling business environment for the digital economy …by streamlining and revising processes, laws and regulations Lead government-wide overhaul of policies and regulations to develop enabling legislative framework for digital companies, products and services, reduce administrative burden on companies and create regulatory stability and visibility. Action 12 – Building a high-performance and attractive investment environment …with an emphasis on the availability of scaling and growth capital and FDI Significantly increase the availability of growth capital (Seed and follow-on investments). The action aims to address the weakness of gaps in funding cycles, and provides a potential for the market to make up to the lack of government funding and drive one of the most competitive digital economies of the world. Action 13 - Becoming an early adopter country and regional beta-tester for key emerging technologies …by supporting experimentation Map and drive the adoption of new technologies and support experimentation, in particularly by the public sector. The action addresses the weakness of several key technologies being heavily controlled in Jordan. Controlled openness is necessary to allow for the experimentation needed to be the beta tester of the region. Smart digital economy infrastructure Action 14 - Establishing a state-of-the-art secure digital infrastructure …by developing information and cyber security practices and regulations, revising spectrum pricing and investing in the national broadband infrastructure and laying the path for 5G Create a competitive, privately owned infrastructure with a focus on data traffic across networks. Leading digital economies continuously focus on supporting commercially feasible models for the development of future telecommunication networks, and so should Jordan, to ensure a state-of-the-art digital infrastructure for its businesses and citizens. 43 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | Action 15 – Leading nation-wide focus on data-driven transformation …by developing regional standards and secure operational models for open data Drive data-driven solutions across the MENA region, linked to higher education and developing digital economy solutions. International benchmark countries show that the backbone of the digital economy is data- led. This requires standards, security and interoperable business protocols across the economy for example FinTech and eHealth protocols. Source: DTI Governance actions The governance actions sets out to ensure a strong, visible and accountable governance structure to attract investor confidence and assure business leaders and those considering to start a company in Jordan. Box 4: Governance actions Action 16 – Establishing co-owned leadership and ownership …by implementing a strong but agile governance structure to ensure accountability Demonstrate strong leadership and establish a strong governance structure across the whole of government with support at private sector level. Action 17 - Reforming the regulatory system to support the integrated digital economy …by launching a review process of the existing regulators and shifting towards a more dynamic ex-post system focusing on enabling a competitive market Establish smart regulation for the digital economy to ensure that the regulatory system supports the digital economy in the best way possible. Action 18 – Exercising strong program accountability and progress monitoring …by establishing a systematic but dynamic program monitoring and evaluation system Create a strong accountability structure to effectively and dynamically manage the transformation towards a digital economy, and to ensure continuous progress. Source: DTI The recommended next steps to operationalise and implement these actions are:  Ensure commitment from recommended main owners and ensure their willingness and ability to drive the actions on time and required scale of impact.  For the targets and Key Performing Indicators (KPIs) to be met, it is imperative that: o actions are executed together (no picking and choosing) o actions are delivered within the specified timeframe  Focus on the identified required immediate actions.  Ensure in particular the impact of the smart specialization aim initiate pilots as quickly as possible. 44 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | Lastly, a sound communications and change management process needs to be put in place for the action plan to move at the required speed and with the necessary commitment and owners to create the growth that Jordan needs to prosper. DRIVING THE ACTIONS FORWARD IN A 3-YEAR TIMEFRAME TO FACILITATE TRANSFORMATION From the actions and KPIs presented earlier, it is clear that the actions are interlinked. Some of the actions are prerequisites for others, and some institutions – such as the digital economy catapult – will have to be set up to drive other actions. In Annex 1 under each high-level action and its corresponding sub actions, the 3-year timeframe for setting in place the actions and its sub-actions is presented. Please note that the sub-actions are designed for a 3- year period only. This timeframe has been selected, because three years is estimated to be the maximum timeframe for which detailed actions in a dynamic digital economy can meaningfully be designed. After three years, the action plan should be revisited and new detailed actions should be determined. For the lead actions, it is clear that much action needs to be taken immediately. Identifying the champions to drive REACH2025 and establishing Digital Economy Catapults and Launchpads are among the top priorities for these actions. For the supporting actions, it is equally important that a number of initiatives be initiated within the first year. For instance, the supporting actions related to skills and enabling environment need to be addressed quickly for the digital economy catapults to reach their goals. Please see Annex 1 for further details on the timeframe. Having briefly discussed the time line for the action, it is now presented how the action plan should be governed and monitored to ensure continuous progress. FUTURE SUCCESS BUILT ON STRONG GOVERNANCE The effort of accelerating smart specialization in Jordan to increase the significance of the Jordan digital economy in global value chains is based on the fundamental principle of co-ownership of this action plan between the private sector (the tech sector and the key sectors of the digital economy) and the government. The emphasis of the transformation path towards a strong digital economy is for Jordan to become an 'open access' country – open to technologies, talent, and investment and particularly for global collaboration. Whilst actors have concrete role to play, the key to the digital economy will be that Jordan becomes a platform for digital innovation and supports, in particular, communities of experts and talents and smart specialization across the country focusing on strong and systematic support of regional and global partnerships. Box 5: Important considerations for a governance model 45 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE |  Digital Economy Catapult (led by industry) to be institutionalized, thus creating independent and stable push environment  Strong focus on key market enablers and a strong market push by co-creating (industry and government) assessments and recommendations  Establishment of a digital economy fund to seed-fund further investment or directly fund pre- commercial procurement of innovation processes/Public Procurement of Innovative Solutions (PPI)66.  Jordan as a driver for regional development of the digital economy and open for business leaders to come to Jordan  Strong focus on exports and supporting international partnerships and the activation of the Jordanian diaspora  Establishment of smart regulation across all regulators in key sectors, including at local level to enable digital economy business models  A strong accountability structure includes the involvement of the Cabinet/Economic Policies Council as an oversight body and to establish strong legal basis for the digital economy (Digital Economy Bill67) Source: DTI GOVERNING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY IN JORDAN BY CREATING A DYNAMIC AND YET ACCOUNTABLE NETWORK OF CHAMPIONS, MOVERS & SHAKERS THAT DRIVE THE AGENDA TOGETHER The key to attracting investor confidence and ensure business leaders and those considering to start a company in Jordan must be a strong, visible and accountable governance structure that will work together to drive impact and reach the envisioned outcomes. This action plan and roadmap toward the digital economy requires collaborative leadership across the spectrum of industry, government and the non-for- profit organizations. Moreover, it requires that the digital economy is seen as relevant for the entire economy, and that the Tech/ICT sector must become an integral part of this economic reality for Jordan. For this reason, there needs to be a high-level governance structure driving smart specialization 66 Pre-commercial procurement or PPI refers to the procurement of research and development of new innovative solutions before they are commercially available. 67 The Digital Economy Bill is inspired by the UK. The country decided that if it is to remain ahead and be a world leader in the digital economy it needs to continue to raise its ambition. The tool for this is introducing a Digital Economy Bill, which includes a range of measures in support of this. The bill will 1) empower consumers and provide better connectivity so that everyone has access to broadband wherever they live, 2) build a better infrastructure fit for the digital future, 3) enable better public services using digital technologies, and 4) provide important protections for citizens from spam email and nuisance calls etc. 46 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | throughout the Jordan economy. This also requires fundamental changes in the way government operates and needs to be supported by the non-for-profit sector to enable the society’s transformation towards a digital Jordan. Setting up a short-term governance structure to drive the right and sustainable governance model for Jordan’s transformation The following figure outlines the key layers, roles and responsibilities underlying the proposed short-term governance structure that should drive the dialogues and process adopting a more sustainable governance model and advanced economic structure in Jordan that addresses the digital economy as a key growth pillar. Figure 5: Governance structure to lead the digital economy Source: DTI The key drivers of the short-term governance structure are:  To identify the right governance set-up and at the same time create immediate momentum following the announcement of the action, it is recommended that the Cabinet takes ownership in the short-term to review and advise the Jordan government on the sustainable governance set- up to drive the commitment towards the digital economy in Jordan. 47 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE |  At the same time it is recommended to immediately set-up the digital economy catapult and immediately start piloting 1-3 digital launchpads in key priority sectors to define the structural requirements and required conditions for successful smart specialization and acceleration.  At the heart of the transformation is the commitment of a co-funded digital economy fund. It would be recommended that a 100Mio JDs fund can be launched immediately. This fund should be co-owned.  The digital economy catapult and all other activities leading to smart specialisation laid out in this action plan should be in the short-term overseen by a digital economy group. It is advisable to include a high-level reporting mechanism on a monthly/quarterly basis to the royal court and to the prime minister to ensure progress. Within the first period of the digital economy action plan, all relevant roles and mandates of key leading institutions need to be investigated and potentially revised (int@j, MoICT, etc.) leading to the following key elements of a strong governance model for the digital economy in Jordan. STRONG LEADERSHIP AT NATIONAL LEVEL The vision is national transformation supported by high level steering groups across the private sector, government and non-for-profit sector to create and sustain momentum in partnership with each other. The leadership required by government is across three action areas: 1) enabling the digital economy, 2) becoming a leader in digital government services and solutions itself (see action 3), 3) smart regulation to enable state-of-the-art infrastructure and new tech business models for the digital economy. As part of the shift away from focusing on ICT/Tech as a sector and towards a digital economy, Ministry of ICT will increasingly become more focused on the digital economy instead of ICT. We recommend that focus be on this development at ministerial level and the potential necessary changes be supported. Furthermore, in supporting the digital economy, it is important that the ICT association int@j moves away from being an ICT sector organization only and expands into at least the key digital economy sectors of this action paper. Therefore, it is recommended that int@j’s mandate be reviewed to include additional sectors to become more inclusive and representative. Furthermore, the government needs to demonstrate leadership across the supporting actions as laid out in the actions above. SMART SPECIALISATION PUSHED BY THE PRIVAT AND PUBLIC SECTOR ACROSS KEY SECTORS The digital catapult will require a headquarter and the establishment of a network of individual launch pads working on the different focus sectors, enablers and vertical tech areas. A qualified high-performing individual should lead the digital catapult. Moreover, an executive board consisting of the current ICTAC group, 10 leading next generation digital economy leaders as well as the economic team under the Cabinet, should support it. It needs to be evaluated whether each catapult also has external advisory boards to ensure effective diffusion and maximization of impact of the catapults. 48 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | As opposed to the previous REACH models, it is important that strong champions drive the individual launch pads, which will accelerate digitization in priority sectors, across enabling sectors and in key vertical tech areas. The strong champions should be young leaders with new ideas and drive, who will in turn put together working groups across key partners to diffuse digitization, create capacity, drive excellence, and experiment with new products, services and approaches. A key task for the catapults will be to seek to set up global partnerships to drive knowledge and tech transfer as well as drive digitization and innovation capacity across the relevant sectors ecosystems. These champions are accountable to the Executive Board of the Digital Economy Catapult. Closely related, the entire ecosystem supporting start-ups will need to be strengthened and collaboration and coordination improved. Moreover, there is a particular need to support the scaling and growth of start-ups more effectively. A key mechanism to drive smart specialization is the establishment of a JD 100 million digital economy fund, which should be co-financed by public and private funds. Eventually, the innovation system should also include close collaboration between industry players, universities in local, regional and global partnerships. This capacity will be supported by government-led innovation centers in key markets and should be revised and further expanded after the initial 3 years. Overall, the commitments of the different actors can be summarized as follows: Box 6: What is needed for the next digital revolution in Jordan - commitment of different actors Private sector will…  Own and drive the digital economy catapults and thus create strong innovation partnerships and collaborations across the smart specialization agendas (related to the key sectors, enablers and vertical tech areas) to enable the digital economy in Jordan  Take responsibility for raising a JD 100 million digital economy fund  Increase expenditure on digital R&D, and drive an open innovation culture to support digital innovation in companies and at start-ups and entrepreneurs  Actively seek to improve skills and build up talent of relevance to the digital economy  Drive nation-wide state-of-the-art infrastructure and new and emerging business models for tomorrow's state-of-the-art infrastructure Government will…  Set up a Digital Economy Group/Committee to accelerate digitization across key sectors, enablers and tech areas  Review and revise the role of existing ministries  Revise and re-allocate funds and programs to support the efforts of the digital economy transformation, particularly by creating an enabling business environment, investing in 49 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | relevant education and skills and fostering a nation-wide digital entrepreneurship & maker culture  Create arbitration services for digital companies to ensure the ongoing resolution of regulatory conflict  Lead the setting up of global partnerships for businesses and start-ups in leading target markets  Allow an environment of experimentation and testing, and lead innovation in public sector  Enable use and adoption of PPP and PPI models to accelerate the implementation of the digital economy Source: DTI Finally, the non-for-profit sector (particularly foundations, but also funds and universities) also has a key role to play, particularly in driving some of the launch pads. The non-for-profit sector will be particularly engaged in driving the maker revolution and the entrepreneurial culture across the region, in supporting youth in creating ideas for digital business for the future, and in disseminating social goals such as green economy goals, bringing women into the active workforce, becoming a regional hub and for digital innovation to become a nation-wide strength. HOW TO MEASURE SUCCESS – CONSIDERATIONS FOR A DYNAMIC FRAMEWORK FOR MONITORING AND EVALUATION To ensure progress towards reaping the benefits of a digital economy, it is imperative to have a solid monitoring and evaluation process in place. While the action plan contains a certain detail of the necessary monitoring arrangements, particularly reflected in the detailing of the actions and KPIs, it should be stressed that not everything can or should be included in this document. Hence, the first phase of this action plan should be used to confirm and refine this. Moreover, at the very beginning of the action plan, a clear baseline of information should be established, against which progress and performance will be subsequently assessed. In addition, both the action plan and the monitoring arrangements should be subject to ongoing review and revision during the next ten years, based on experience and lessons learned.68 Monitoring focuses on collecting and using information to help determine if project objectives are being achieved. It is therefore important that the project objectives are the right ones from the outset and are clearly specified. As a first step, the institutions responsible for the monitoring exercise should double- check this. Likewise, the final selection of appropriate indicators should be carried out by those responsible for collecting and using the information, as they are the only ones having enough insight to 68 European Commission (2007): Strengthening project internal monitoring 50 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | ensure the appropriateness of the indicators.69 In setting up the monitoring and evaluation system, it is advisable to develop a digital economy impact forecast and assessment model to establish a dynamic measuring framework across the economy. Such a task is a major task, and it should be carefully considered at the very beginning of the entire action plan to set up a sound model capturing the right baseline, KPIs, targets, etc. As with the selection and use of indicators, it is important that those responsible for implementation on the ground take the lead in the setting of targets. Ownership of targets by implementing partners is critical. In addition, the targets need to be reviewed regularly, as part of the ongoing monitoring and review process. This helps ensure their continued relevance.70 Summing up, the following recommendations for a strong governance structure for the digital economy emerge from international good practice: Box 7: Recommendations for the future sustainable governance structure to support the digital economy in Jordan Engage strong public and private sector leaders to be champions of the digital economy and its potential across Jordan. Manage the digital economy as a cross-cutting policy priority across government. Key ministries aligned with the priority sectors should be leading this effort. This could take the form of a committee or a working group, and could be chaired by a private sector leader or a high-level government figure. It is important that the digital economy is driven by an economy or industry relevant ministry (ies). Consider strong government leadership by nominating a digital economy minister. Prove to the world that you can create a vibrant and dynamic digital economy with re-prioritising existing funds only and by smartly working in close partnership with the private sector to build value for Jordan together. To create the transformative push required to create the digital economy in Jordan a strong accountability structure is required, including the mandate to withhold funds and roles and mandates if performance is not met. This needs to apply to the private and the public sector and rules for enforcement need to be clearly laid out. In the long-term the parliament could have an oversight role into how the digital economy is functioning and how it could be approved as a regular mechanism to advise the government. Similarly, international reviews or competitions could be held to bring in scrutiny. Celebrate digital economy success stories. 69 European Commission (2007): Strengthening project internal monitoring 70 European Commission (2007): Strengthening project internal monitoring 51 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | INSPIRING INTERNATIONAL EXAMPLES OF CONCRETE TRANSFORMATIONAL ACTIONS Faced with the digital future, many countries have taken concrete actions to create a competitive advantage. Here are some examples of concrete transformational actions that Jordan could consider adapting to its own context:  DENMARK - DIGITIZATION OF SUPPLY CHAINS AND SMART PRODUCTION - Market Development Fund (2013-15), a new type of initiative, supports the development process just before commercialization, when a functioning prototype must be customized to fit the demands of the market. The fund co-finances facilitation of end-consumer testing and adaptation of the new product or service, thereby shortening the developer’s time to market and strengthening the potential for growth and employment.  DENMARK - FOCUS ON SMART CITIES - Copenhagen Smart City Solutions lab - The Copenhagen Solutions Lab will be a new governing body for smart city projects across all sectors in the city and will have focus on creating triple helix partnerships. Copenhagen Solutions Lab will lead the implementation of innovation and smart city development in close collaboration with knowledge institutions and companies as well as citizens. New intelligent transportation system solutions, reduced carbon emissions, implementation of sensors that create real time data and information on current situations in the city and the buildup and architecture of a new ‘Big Data Digital Infrastructure Platform’ that shares data across public and private sectors will all be working focus points within the Lab.  DUBAI – THE NATIONAL INNOVATION STRATEGY: The strategy sets out specific strands of action: o Developing government innovation by institutionalizing innovative practices with the support of an integrated system of modern tools, requiring all government entities to reduce spending by 1 percent and to dedicate the savings to research and innovation projects; o Encouraging private sector innovation by stimulating companies to establish innovation and scientific research centres, to adopt new technologies and to develop innovative products and services; o Qualifying individuals with highly innovative skills by concentrating on science, technology, engineering and mathematics, including the creation of educational material for schools and universities. The Dubai National Innovation Strategy includes the following focus areas: o In the field of renewable energy, the strategy will establish a new organisation to facilitate decentralised power generation projects such as small-scale solar installations.

By mid-2015, get 10,000 businesses online for the first time and through the Trading Online Voucher Scheme help 2,000 more small businesses trade online for the first time.  IRELAND – GRAND COALITION FOR ESKILLS - The ICT Skills Working Group of Northern Ireland is a regional coalition of stakeholders. The ICT Skills Working Group brings together a wide range of stakeholders, including representatives from relevant government departments, higher education, further education, employers, employer representative bodies, sector skills councils and trade associations. The Group manages an Action Plan setting out the short, medium and long term actions required to ensure that the local ICT industry has access to the skilled workforce it needs to grow and flourish, both now and in the future.  IRELAND – COMMUNICATION & AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS TO PROMOTE THE DIGITAL SOCIETY – Ireland has been running a number of campaigns to promote trust, safety and skills. Similar aspects could promote wide-scale digital innovation.  UK – DEVELOPING OPEN DATA - The Open Data Institute is already championing innovation in industry and society through open data. A growing body of evidence points towards the economic benefits of open data, and the trend of public and private organizations opening up their data sets should be encouraged to continue.  UK – TECH NATION VISION AND BENCHMARKING APPROACH – The strategy focuses on areas like digital skills, smart capital investment, infrastructure, international development and leadership to support the tech industry in the UK. 53 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | INTERNATIONAL EXAMPLES - GOVERNANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION The platforms, systems and supply chains that underpin the emerging digital economy in Jordan will need consistent investment, a shared innovation strategy and a broad-based cross-industry collaborative approach. Concrete actions and commitment will be the transformatory engine in Jordan. However, this roadmap to excellence, which is currently being developed, will require joint leadership from the private sector as well as government. To assure all partners and stakeholders, a strong governance and implementation model will need to be set in place to ensure follow-through and guide effort in a dynamic way based on consistent monitoring of impact achieved against key targets. To determine the right model international approaches and best practice will be taken into consideration. Different approaches and components displayed by leading countries include the following:  UK - The UK currently has a tech nation strategy at city level, led by an independent organization called Tech City UK. Launched in 2010, Tech City UK focusses on areas like digital skills, smart capital investment, infrastructure, international development and leadership to support the tech industry in the UK focusing on the ICT clusters in key cities. At the same time, the UK has national digital economy strategy focusing on unlocking digital growth, transforming government, transforming day-to-day life, and building the foundations – infrastructure, emphasis on cybersecurity, privacy, trust, skills. The strategy is led by the Digital Economy Minister in the Department for Culture, Media & Sport.  DENMARK - The focus of the current digital vision in Denmark is on Digitization of Supply Chains and Smart Production. The vision is to enable the rapid design, implementation and evaluation of innovative value creating automated digital business solutions in the supply chain. There is a particular emphasis on key sectors and on SMEs. This is supported by policy, investment solutions and by a set-up of tech transfer organizations, for instance the GTS institutes. GTS stands for Godkendt Teknologisk Service (approved technology service provider) and are independent not-for-profit organizations whose purpose is to spread technical know-how, new methods and knowledge to industry and society. The GTS institutes are independent from political or economic interests and profit is reinvested in research and development.  DENMARK - The Copenhagen Solutions Lab is a new governing body for smart city projects across all sectors in the city and will have focus on creating triple helix partnerships. Copenhagen Solutions Lab leads the implementation of innovation and smart city development in close collaboration with knowledge institutions and companies as well as citizens. New intelligent transportation system solutions, reduced carbon emissions, implementation of sensors that create real time data and information on current situations in the city and the build-up and architecture of a new ‘Big Data Digital Infrastructure Platform’ that shares data across public and private sectors are working focus points within the Lab.  DUBAI - Dubai has a strong top-down, government led approach. In 2014 His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE, launched a National Innovation Strategy with a seven-year plan that aims to make the UAE among the most innovative nations in the world. Innovation strategy focusses on 7 key constituents: Innovative products and services, knowledge and technology, infrastructure, competitive environment, 54 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | funding and investment, human capital and research, institutions and regulatory environment. To support the transformation within government, the UAE has announced the creation of a new job post – CEO of Innovation – for every government department and has announced multiple private sector, or zone relevant partnerships or targets such as the Dubai Global Innovation Centre in partnership with Dutch technology firm Philips for the 3D printing targets.  IRELAND - Historically, Ireland set its ambitions to become the European ICT hub in the late 1990. This received high level backing from the Irish Information Society Commission (ISC), which was established in 2001. This was an independent advisory body to the Irish Government, reporting directly to the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister). It drew on high-level representation from the business community, the social partners, and government itself. The ISC had a key role in shaping the evolving public policy framework for the Information Society in Ireland. It contributed to the policy formulation process, monitored progress, and highlighted issues that needed to be prioritized. The Commission served until the end of 2004.  IRELAND - In 2014, major industry players including General Motors, Johnson & Johnson and Kerry Group got together with UL, LIT, Limerick City & County Council and IDA Ireland and formed a unique IT skills partnership ‘Limerick for IT’. Since its establishment, the initiative has created over 200 high skilled IT jobs and has been acknowledged as a major FDI skills innovation developer. Further inspiration can be derived from the private sector71, and from emerging smart cities, which increasingly look to collaborative governance models 72 to lead the digital transformation. Such international best practices will be further investigated as to their relevance to Jordan. Summarizing, the governance for the digital economy requires a collaborative approach, specific approach to handling data, creation of digital building blocks and platforms, working with acceleration & digital champions, clear commitment to impact measurement and continuous alignment of policies and programs based on real-time evidence. 71 See for instance an overview of central components to manage a successful digital transformation four example companies display - file-access/resource/pdf/Governance__A_Central_Component_of_Successful_Digital_Transformation.pdf 72 See for instance the BSI Standards Publication (2014) Smart city framework – Guide to establishing strategies for smart cities and communities 55 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | ANNEX 1: DETAILED ACTIONS The actions are based on Jordan’s key differentiators, strengths and weaknesses, as well as international experience in terms of how other benchmark countries have set the path for achieving a digital vision. Under all actions, other actions and responsibilities can be added based on need. Action 1 Smart Specialization and Growth Adopting the Digital Economy Framework in Jordan’s economy …thus driving the digital economy in Jordan Create an independent digital economy catapult – a platform for the digital economy in Jordan. It should be established as a network of specialized centers of excellence with one headquarter/umbrella. Establishing the digital economy catapult puts Jordan among the frontrunners of the digital economy and allows Jordan to develop relevant digital products and services across leading sectors of relevance to global digital value chains. Building on the Jordan differentiators of leveraging high-level strategic partnerships, drive demand-driven digital innovation, creating and integrating solutions for the digital economy, the catapults set out to diffuse and accelerate digitization across sectors that are lagging behind currently, and where linkages between sectors and the tech sector are not yet established. A digital economy catapult will be established with one headquarter and nine catapults in the six leading sectors (Health, Education, Energy & Cleantech, Transport & logistics, Financial sector, and Communications & security) and three key enablers (Content & gaming, E-commerce and Professional services). The vertical tech areas (IOT, Cloud Computing, Hardware and Artificial Intelligence) will be embedded in the relevant catapults. The catapults will be working across the horizontal and vertical emphasis areas and the digital enablers. The digital economy catapult HQ will have the following responsibilities: Provide tech innovation support service to entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs and makers Develop understanding of value of in-licensing and create support program Support prototyping and service design, for instance through an innovation fund Create a disruption program for the existing tech sector which should lead to the immediate development of a pipeline of new products services targeting the digital economy Provide advocacy support for digital economy Initiate cross-sectoral digital economy standards development Initiate communications campaign & promotion of the digital economy across sectors Establish an open data center to drive the opening of data and the development of new solutions based on this data. The nine sector/enabler catapults/launchpads will have the following responsibilities: Market development & match making (national and international) within the relevant key digital sector/enabler and across the relevant verticals Recommended main owner Government (Cabinet/Economic Policies Council) 56 REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE | Action specified (3-year timeframe) Immediate actions Establish Digital Economy Catapult HQ (including a Programme Management Unit and a Monitoring and Evaluation unit). The catapult HQ will be tasked to set up nine catapults in the six key sectors and three enabling sectors. Pilot one launchpad with good leadership. While multiple sector- and tech vertical-based catapults should be built, one with good leadership should be fast-tracked (could be FinTech (CBJ) or Health (Hakeem)). Subsequent actions Establish Digital Economy Launchpads in remaining key sectors and enablers. There is no one Launchpad model fits all sectors; it depends on the stakeholders and dynamics of each sector in terms of how to drive dialogue and transformation. Recommended owner Government (Cabinet/EPC) to set up a new independent body (Digital Economy Catapult HQ with its own branded identity). Program work in policy/economic considerations could include the Jordan Strategy Forum and int@j. MoICT/Government and Digital Economy Committee should pinpoint sector and owner/leader for piloting the catapult Individual catapults led by key digital sector champions Regulations/Instructions/Decisions: Within 6 months: Decision for EPC to adopt REACH2025 and suggested governance model Decision to establish the PMU & M&E at entity X under EPC/Cabinet supervision Instructions for CBJ to lead FinTech Instructions for MoICT to lead Government Digitization Instructions for Digitization PPP model Instruction to Cabinet on key regulatory changes within 6 months – 1 year Within 1 year: Instructions for GAM to lead Smart Cities Digitization Instructions for Y to lead Health Digitization Instructions for Y to lead Education Digitization Instructions for Y to lead Transportation Digitization Instructions for Y to lead Communications and Security Digitization Scalability/sustainability Additional catapults can be established following the same model. Budget Consideration:73 Based on the figures from the UK Digital Catapult, the following considerations apply: Setting up a Digital Economy Catapult with six sectoral catapults, three enabling sectors and three tech verticals: JD 12-14 million (Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)74 adjusted) Yearly costs of running the catapults: Approx. JD 1.5 million per catapult and headquarter (PPP adjusted) amounting to JD 16.5 million in total per year. This is based on a team of 15 people at the Catapult HQ and five people in each of the other catapults.

The aims for Jordan are to achieve a strong and open public infrastructure key for developing a strong digital economy and create a more efficient government as shown by leading countries. Moreover, the actions are responding to the weakness of government not acting as a competent market and user that can drive digital economy. Strengthening government innovation will give access to world-class government services, which is a driver for the digital economy companies to grow and/or settle in Jordan, and it will stimulate eGovernment products and services within existing tech companies to sell/export regionally. Lastly, it will generate accountability and transparency for FDI into Jordan. Action specified (3-year timeframe) Immediate actions Issue an overall digital policy for Digital Economy and separate digitization policies for each target sectors  Emphasis on Public-Private partnerships; mainly to drive implementation of digitization in key sectors  Address procurement rules and potential need for revision  Identify key enablers of the digital economy such as authentication, online transaction services, digital health record and agree plan for implementation  Address key security and capacity-building concerns Support and grow public sector innovation through appointing an innovation officer in each ministry, with a clear framework and responsibility to drive innovation forward Align the eGovernment Strategy & Action Plan with the needs of the digital economy as well as government efficiency goals.

The ICT sector, tech start-ups, universities,   key economic sectors and policy makers need to work together closely to ensure Jordan’s relevance in   the digital economy 2025. The purpose of this vision paper is to identify common ground, and common   agreed actions to create the skills and the capacity required to shape the future digital innovative Jordan.   It is in this connection important that both the ICT sector capacity, as well as the digitization of the market   and its actors, complement each other.   This vision builds on strong foundations in Jordan:    The first REACH Initiative was launched in year 2000 as the official kick-start of a comprehensive   public-private partnership aimed to develop the country’s ICT sector and pave the way for the   other economic sectors to move into the Knowledge Economy.    There are over 600 Jordanian ICT companies in the ICT cluster, which drive digitization and are   a key resource for skills and capacity in Jordan.    Jordan has established a maturing ecosystem with international tech firms, established firms,   venture funds, angel investors, incubators and accelerators.      As a country with limited natural resources, Jordan’s economy diversified early based on   investments in cutting-edge technologies and infrastructure. The key to reaching the future will   be to build on these enablers and accelerate digital innovation through cross-sectoral   collaboration.    Jordanians are a people that have shaped their future over centuries. There is a deeply engrained   tradition to make the future happen through informed decisions and to enable the future to the   benefit of everyone.       In 2015, his Majesty King Abdullah II called upon the leaders of the tech industry to come together and   develop a new roadmap for the tech sector in an all-inclusive process that would include the private and   public sector, academia, investors, and entrepreneurs. The REACH2025 initiative has been launched to   re-invigorate digital Jordan and particularly one of the growth engines of the Jordan economy – the ICT   sector. To facilitate the management of this call to action, a core team has been assembled from the   sector alongside the Ministry of Information and Communications Technology, mandated to develop a   focused action plan.    REACH2025 has key relevance to the economic development of Jordan. The vision and action plan:      1. Works as a booster for economic development in key knowledge sectors;   2. Enables businesses growth and enhancement not only for the ICT sector, but for the digital   economy sector of focus;   3. Focuses on building relevant talent and increasing job creation rate;     4. Ensures better accessibility and inclusion of all citizens to key services at lower costs of investment   through digitization of key sectors, providing better solutions for health, education, financial   services etc.);   5. Ensures national regional development in governorates, rural areas advancement, etc.;   6. Gives Jordan global alignment and relevance in global value chains;   7. Increases economic and social value add;   8. Boosts public-private partnerships for better co-owned development and country advancement;   9. Attracts new investments in new developed fields and key sectors; and   10. Focuses the role of government as a policy maker, regulator and potential innovation   platform/adopter.   The methodology of this vision and action paper has been led by a design-thinking inspired approach. This   means that a key notion of the exercise has been to co-create a vision and mission statement and an   action paper. The approach and aim have been to put end-users’ needs at the centre of the policy   formulation system, leading to solutions that are progressively refined through an iterative process of   providing voice to end-users and engaging them in shaping decisions (co-creation); considering multiple   causes of and diversified perspectives to the problems at hand; and experiment with initial ideas.1 This   means that the process has focused on stakeholder engagement and making the stakeholders' voices heard   so that the actions could be co-created and owned in Jordan. What this process does not do, is to provide   a one-size-fits-all model for actions in Jordan, nor is it a full national diagnostics exercise.   However, the design thinking process does not stop with this action paper. The actions laid out in this   paper are largely based on international good practise and input from Jordan stakeholders. However, it is   necessary to activate strong stakeholders in Jordan further to ensure that they are the right actions for   Jordan. Moreover, the budget considerations for each action are largely based on international benchmark   good practise and need to be stress-tested in a Jordanian environment.    REACHING THE VISION OF A DIGITAL ECONOMY IN JORDAN   To reach the vision of a digital economy in Jordan, and action plan has been created alongside with the   vision and mission. The action plan takes its point of departure in the vision statements for Jordan 2025,   which are captured in the REACH2025 vision paper. The vision paper was developed based on an   extensive stakeholder consultation in Jordan building on a thorough review of international key trends,   expert interviews and a review of policy documents. The stakeholder consultation has ensured a strong   grounding and support for the vision in Jordan.   The vision paper and the action plan thus build on a strong foundation in Jordan. It is not reinventing the   wheel, but leveraging the existing Jordan potential and differentiators into the digital economy. Concretely,   the vision paper and action plan have been created by mapping leading international digital economy                                                           1 http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/capacity-  development/English/Singapore%20Centre/GCPSE%20Design%20Thinking%20Summary.pdf   http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/capacity-development/English/Singapore%20Centre/GCPSE%20Design%20Thinking%20Summary.pdf http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/capacity-development/English/Singapore%20Centre/GCPSE%20Design%20Thinking%20Summary.pdf   models, enablers and levers to the Jordan differentiators, to create the best model for a digital economy   in Jordan. This means creating an action plan for Jordan that ensures relevance in global value chains and   addresses the challenges in Jordan.   Box 1: A new way of approaching economic transformation in Jordan – Reach 2025   The vision, mission and action plan seeks to streamline the economic transformation across the   entire Jordan economy through digitization. With the plan, Jordan is moving away from seeing ICT   as an isolated sector and towards digitizing the entire Jordanian economy with emphasis on   niche markets and global value chains.   Fundamentally, this vision and action plan seeks to accelerate digitization across Jordan and   support, enable and inspire the next generation of digital entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs   building on Jordan’s strength of being a young and tech-savvy nation.   The aim of this vision is to support and accelerate Jordan’s economic goals, create jobs for   all Jordanians, empower women and position Jordan in the future digital global   economy, through a clear alignment with the Jordan Vision 2025. This process includes introducing   new mechanisms to initiate a different level of economic dialogue that will address key national   development needs.          KEY TRENDS THAT DRIVE THE FUTURE   The world is looking at the Fourth Digital Revolution. It combines multiple technologies that are leading   to unprecedented paradigm shifts in the economy, business, society, and individually2. This means that   increasingly, sectors are disrupted and increasingly digitized. This offers immense opportunities for   networked societies, but it also poses threats if timely actions are not taken.   In countries such as Germany and Denmark, this revolution has been addressed through focus on Industry   4.0 – next generation manufacturing. However, the fourth industrial revolution is not only about smart   and connected machines and systems; its scope is much wider. A great number of technology   breakthroughs emerge, covering wide-ranging fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the internet of   things, autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy   storage and quantum computing, to name a few. Many of these innovations are in their infancy, but rapidly   growing in importance as they build on and amplify each other in a fusion of technologies across the   physical, digital and biological worlds. Waves of further breakthroughs in areas ranging from gene   sequencing to nanotechnology, from renewables to quantum computing, are occurring simultaneously,                                                           2 Schwab, Klaus (2016): The Fourth Industrial Revolution, World Economic Forum     broadening the scope3. In fact, digital solutions are viewed as one of the most important driving forces   across the entire economy4.     THE KEY MEGATRENDS following this digital revolution are presented here5.    The physical trends include autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, advanced robotics and new materials. For   the autonomous vehicles, particularly the opportunities for drones are interesting. Over time, it will for   example be possible to use these for checking power lines. 3D printing has the advantage of being able to   be easily customized. For small companies and for entrepreneurs it brings opportunities to design products   and solutions in close interaction with customers regardless of their location, and to embed services in   new solutions and at a lower cost. That way, also small producers, for instance in areas like design, can   bring new products to the global markets 6 . The physical trends can also give way to distributed   manufacturing, which is a form of decentralized manufacturing whereby enterprises use a network of   geographically dispersed manufacturing facilities coordinated through IT. Distributed manufacturing is a   way of increasing the flexibility and agility of a value chain7 and can create relevance for especially SMEs in   these. Advanced robotics are increasingly used across sectors for a wide range of tasks, with the advances   in sensors increasingly enabling robots to respond better to their environment. Lastly, with time new   materials may significantly disrupt the manufacturing industries8 with new benefits for example in medico   tech and health applications.   One of the main bridges between the physical and digital applications is the internet of things. The   increased number of devices connected to the internet enables businesses to monitor and optimize assets   and activities to a high level, affecting across all industries9. This is what Gartner Group terms the digital   mesh10. The emphasis of this trend is on sensor technologies, connected devices and the consequences   of this interconnectivity. The device mesh will drive augmented and virtual reality with huge implications   for citizens, governments and businesses alike. Blending with ambient user experience, organizations will   need to consider their customers’ behavior journeys to shift the focus on design from discreet apps to   the entire mesh of products and services involved in the user experience.  Part of the mesh are also the   opportunities 3D printing may bring with them – with its capacity to prototype a wide range of materials.       A related trend is the smart machines11. The key element of the future will be data and information.   Data analytics will drive production processes as well as help steer, manage and optimize value chains                                                           3 Schwab, Klaus (2016): The Fourth Industrial Revolution, World Economic Forum   4 Brynjolfsson, Erik and Andrew McAfee (2012): Race against the machine: How the digital revolution is accelerating innovation, driving productivity, and irreversibly transforming   employment in the economy   5 Schwab, Klaus (2016): The Fourth Industrial Revolution, World Economic Forum   6 Schwab, Klaus (2016): The Fourth Industrial Revolution, World Economic Forum   7 For instance Leitao, Paulo (2008): Agent-based distributed manufacturing control   8 Schwab, Klaus (2016): The Fourth Industrial Revolution, World Economic Forum   9 Schwab, Klaus (2016): The Fourth Industrial Revolution, World Economic Forum   10  Gartner Group (2016): Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends For 2016, http://www.ibaset.com/blog/gartner-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2016-define-the-future-of-  manufacturing/   11  Gartner Group (2016): Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends For 2016, http://www.ibaset.com/blog/gartner-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2016-define-the-future-of-  manufacturing/     within and across sectors. Advanced machine learning is what makes smart machines appear “intelligent”   by enabling them to both understand concepts in the environment and to learn. Advanced machine   learning gives rise to a spectrum of smart machine implementations — including robots, autonomous   vehicles, virtual personal assistants (VPAs) and smart advisors — that act in an autonomous (or at least   semiautonomous) manner. Closely connected to this discussion is the emergence of artificial intelligence   (AI). AI is driven by exponential increases in computing power and by the availability of large amounts of   data. Many of these algorithms learn from the trails of data that are left in the digital world. This results   in new types of “machine learning” and automated discovery that enables intelligent robots and computers   to self-programme and find optimal solutions from first principles. Applications such as Apple’s Siri provide   a glimpse of what the future holds with respect to the rapidly advancing AI field – so-called intelligent   assistants12. These advantages can be exploited in a range of sectors, including in new digital learning   applications, which can support personalization of learning, be it in school or in a company environment.   All of these key trends boil down to the new digital reality13. The digital mesh and smart machines   require intense computing architecture demands to make them viable for organizations. The mesh app   and service architecture are what enables delivery of apps and services to the flexible and dynamic   environment.    This new reality means that Jordanian companies face a future where digitization is everywhere and in all   sectors. Digitization will affect different sectors at different times and with different intensities. The   increased interconnectivity of everything means that the ability to innovate in the context of large-scale   demand driven innovation projects becomes paramount. Due to the fast development of digital   technology, innovation of components and apps will tend to be optimized towards being phased out again   at some point. Therefore, innovation requires the ability to optimize every single partial innovation   towards a future paradigm.   Therefore, how companies and nations approach digitization is of key importance. A strategy,   which only focuses on efficiency, will eventually lead to a commoditization of products and services and   thus a competitive situation where price is the main determinant14. This means that focus not only should   be on efficiency, but also on elements such as how companies continuously innovate through interaction   with customers, suppliers etc., and how the companies can create increased value-add for customers   without the price increases correspondingly. Networking and collaboration is the key source to such   forms of innovation. Reshaping the full potential of the digital revolution depends on whether the   companies use digitization for cost-effectiveness or as a driver for cost-effectiveness as well as innovation.   Some of the digital tech companies in Jordan may have an understanding of keys to competitiveness, which   are not aligned to rapidly changing markets for digital products and services. On the other hand, Jordan is                                                           12 Schwab, Klaus (2016): The Fourth Industrial Revolution, World Economic Forum   13  Gartner Group (2016): Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends For 2016, http://www.ibaset.com/blog/gartner-top-10-strategic-technology-trends-for-2016-define-the-future-of-  manufacturing/   14 Nielsen, Niels Christian, Jonathan Murray, and John Zysman (2013): The Services Dilemma: Productivity Sinkhole or Commoditization? Book Manuscript     a young nation with much idea generating and support around the start-up culture, which provides an   enabling innovation DNA to unleash the full benefit of digitization.   Furthermore, the disruption that the fourth industrial revolution will have on existing political, economic   and social models will require that empowered actors recognize that they are part of a wider   ecosystem that requires more collaborative forms of interaction to succeed15. Close collaboration not   only entails cooperation among tech companies, but also among the tech companies and the companies   in the key disrupted sectors, and among the public sector and companies, to succeed with a digital   revolution. These leadership competences can be built through high-level strategic partnerships with other   nations and at firm level, to fully exploit the potential that digitization has to create sustainable growth in   Jordan.   Another key trend is how the dynamic of innovation is changing globally. In particular, the following   elements are key:    DEMAND DRIVEN INNOVATION – Demand side innovation is an inclusive paradigm shift   away from supply side innovation to serving the needs of supply chains and customers. As the   Arab region is digitizing exponentially, culturally sensitive content and solutions will be a   particular opportunity to lead in the region. To support demand driven innovation, demand-side   innovation policies – from public procurement of innovation, to standards and regulations, to   lead markets and user-/consumer-driven innovation initiatives needs to be in place16.    THE IMPORTANCE OF TECH START-UPS AND ENTREPRENEURS – Start-ups and   entrepreneurship can create a culture of innovation, of developing ideas and solutions and adding   value in entirely new ways.  Start-up programs play a key role in the attraction of international,   talented and high impact entrepreneurs to come and boost the local ecosystem.    THE MAKERS MOVEMENT – With the advent of digital manufacturing, fabrication   laboratories, or FabLabs, are spreading around the world. These centers provide access to   hardware, machines, and open-source software, along with affordable training and mentoring.   They encourage collaboration among stakeholders and across disciplines, and are increasingly   seen as a powerful way to spur entrepreneurship, address the skills gap, and alleviate youth   unemployment while revolutionizing production processes17.    ECOSYSTEMS AND NETWORKS – the increased digitization of the economy supports a   more efficient way of collaborating, sourcing and developing human capital. Particularly large   companies can take advantage of leveraging their scale advantages and investing in their   ecosystem of start-ups and SMEs by acquiring and partnering with smaller and more innovative                                                           15 Schwab, Klaus (2016): The Fourth Industrial Revolution, World Economic Forum   16 OECD Competences to innovate › Stimulating demand for innovation > https://www.oecd.org/sti/outlook/e-  outlook/stipolicyprofiles/competencestoinnovate/stimulatingdemandforinnovation.htm    17 World Economic Forum (2015): the Global Information Technology Report 2015     businesses. This will enable them to maintain autonomy in their respective businesses while also   allowing for more efficient and agile operations. Small and medium-sized enterprises, on the   other hand, will have the advantages of speed and the agility needed to participate in these   ecosystems18.   JORDAN’S ROLE WITH RESPECT TO KEY TRENDS   The increasingly digitized world requires that Jordan   exploits the advantages that the country has and finds   its place in the global value chains. Below are   discussed five key areas with which to unlock Jordan’s   potential. Jordan’s true differentiator lies in the   combination of these key areas.   LEVERAGING HIGH-LEVEL STRATEGIC   PARTNERSHIPS   As mentioned in the key trends section above, digital   global value chains today are a dominant feature of   the world economy. This means that the production   of goods and services is carried out wherever the necessary skills and materials are available at competitive   cost and quality, creating growing fragmentation of production across borders19, and thereby increasingly   relying on digitization for collaboration across borders. To deliver according to the required quality and   time specifications, lead companies in global value chains increasingly rely on specialized sub-suppliers,   which become knowledge and innovation partners, and provide the small companies privileged access to   global markets. In an upcoming publication from the OECD, they conclude that the winning companies   and countries in a digital economy are those who understand how to leverage resources and overcome   limitations of size through networking and collaboration20. Jordan has a good ICT infrastructure and   historically, a strong focus on skills and education due to a lack of natural resources21, particularly to be   found among professionals with some years of work experience. In addition, Jordan is a source of IT talent   for major companies in the Middle East22. Building on the ICT infrastructure and the human capital, with   the steps that already have been taken to reform the curricula to the needs of the digital economy and   Jordan’s ICT sector23, as well as future steps for further reforming, Jordan will have a strong role to play                                                           18 Schwab, Klaus (2016): The Fourth Industrial Revolution, World Economic Forum   19 OECD (2013): Implications of global value chains for trade, investment, development and jobs   20 OECD (2016) Committee on Digital Economy Policy: Stimulating Digital Innovation for Growth and Inclusiveness: The Role of Policies for the Succesful Diffusion of ICT (Draft background   report for ministerial panel)    21 int@j: Jordan ICT sector profile   22 int@j: Jordan ICT sector profile   23 Current work is being done on this. In collaboration with industry and universities, a process has started to develop industry based occupational profiles, which will be piloted and the   model can be replicated to other ICT occupations and across clusters.     in these value chains. In the future, Jordan should use the partnerships to become the platform for digital   innovation by being an innovation creating center for digital solutions driven by these strong partnerships.   In this regard, Jordan has a long and solid relationship with the US, with a large diaspora situated in the   US and GCC. This relationship could be further utilized to leverage high-level strategic partnerships with   clear task leaders and milestones, although it requires clear tasks and owners.    PRODUCING SPECIALIZED ICT TALENT, BUILDING ON ENTREPRENEURIAL DRIVE &   IMAGINATION   One of Jordan’s strong differentiators is the country’s talent, entrepreneurial drive and imagination. Being   a country of limited natural resources, Jordan’s main strength lies in its human capital, and the   entrepreneurial drive and imagination among the country’s population is being highlighted as one of the   country’s major strengths. Good human capital is particularly found among professionals with some years   of work experience. However, skills are a two-edged sword in Jordan. While Jordanian ICT specialists are   increasingly being hired in other countries in the region, for instance in Dubai and Saudi Arabia, there are   still barriers to overcome with regard to higher education modernization, in particularly curriculum   relevance to the industry, and modes of cooperation between university and industry. These barriers are   of a nature so that they can be addressed and a modernization process can be set fully in motion within a   relatively short period.   DRIVING SMART, DEMAND-DRIVEN DIGITAL INNOVATION ACROSS KEY SECTORS   Smart specialization entails innovative combinations of existing and latent resources in new ways, which   can be enabled further by digital technologies to create outreach and scale with new types of services.   Addressing the issue of specialization in R&D and innovation is particularly crucial for regions/countries   that are not leaders in any of the major science or technology domains.24 Leading benchmark countries   such as the UK have driven growth in their entire economy through a focus on smart specialization and a   digital economy. However, the focus on smart specialization still means that the tech verticals in the ICT   sector (Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Hardware and Artificial Intelligence) are of the utmost   importance to drive growth – the market for such solutions has the potential to grow bigger. A key trend   mentioned above is that the ICT sector is no longer viewed as a stand-alone sector, but that digitization   is highly embedded in other sectors as well. Moreover, there will be a substantial focus on selected tech   verticals, that is, certain areas of the tech sector where Jordan has a comparative strength.    Thus, in Jordan, smart specialization focuses on unlocking the potential for digitization in areas where   Jordan has – or has the potential to develop – a competitive advantage, and through key tech verticals   where Jordan currently has a stronghold. It can also be in areas/sectors of global importance, where   Jordanian firms can be positioned in global value chains and can become a development partner, which   can open up to further market opportunities. The increased digitization of the global economy provides                                                           24 Foray, Dominique et al (2009): Smart Specialization – the concept     an opportunity for Jordan to focus on further developing digitally enabled solutions to meet demands from   key sectors. A focus on smart specialization is therefore of key importance for linking the ICT sector and   the overall economy, and for assisting Jordan in shifting its effort towards the digital economy, which can   drive productivity and service innovation.   In the following, we present the six key sectors and key tech verticals that are of relevance to Jordan, and   it will be argued why they are key to Jordan. To sum up, the driving sectors of the digital economy in   Jordan are shown in the table below.        Table 1: Proposed focus areas and niche sectors for the digital economy in Jordan   Key sectors Global markets   opportunity   Jordan strengths Market enablers Vertical technologies   Health The global eHealth   market is expected   to grow at a CAGR   of 7% from 2011-  2020, and the   MENA market is   expected to grow at   a CAGR of 16%   from 2014-2022.25       Jordan is viewed as a regional center for health and should take   advantage of this position. 26  To reap this potential in Jordan,   opportunities include unified eHealth records, e-health exchange,   telemedicine, Arabic content in health, health insurance exchange and   records, and online booking for doctors, to maximize Jordan’s   competitive edge in medical tourism.       Big data will be transforming the healthcare and integrated care sector   to offer personalized solutions and new ways of providing diagnostics   and care from the preventive care market to the intensive care.   Integrated healthcare   solutions, cloud   based services   Big data, learning analytics, AI      Building on the existing eHealth   program, a particular niche will   be the intersection of eHealth,   AI and the pharma industry   powered by digital analytics   capacity that Jordan can develop,   for instance by using   international big data platforms.   Education The global smart   education & learning   market is expected   to grow at a CAGR   of 24.4% from 2015-  2020.27   Personalized and collaborative digital learning environments will   revolutionize how education will be delivered globally. The latest   advances in learning science, artificial intelligence, learning analytics,   mobile platforms/services, and maker spaces, should enable this.   Jordan will have a world-leading role in developing these types of   solutions and platforms responding to the global need for scalable   solutions that match 21st century skills demands. Jordan pioneered   the adoption of technology as a means to innovate education several   years ago and should exploit this. In Jordan, there are opportunities   around digital curricula, entrepreneurship and digital skills for kids in   schools, makerspaces in education, and online education for refugees,   or in rural areas.    Mobile platform   solutions based on   cloud technology, as   digital educational   content through   advanced techniques   in gamification and   simulations   Learning analytics, AI                                                            25 http://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/e-health-market  26 int@j: Jordan ICT sector profile  27 http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/smart-digital-education.asp   http://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/e-health-market http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/smart-digital-education.asp   Energy &   Cleantech   Globally, the   worldwide   cleantech market is   expected to double   in value to €4.4tr by   2025. 28  Another   prediction shows an   increase in market   size from $601bn in   2014 to $1.3tn in   2020.   Jordan has an impressive history of dealing with scarce resources and   creating livable urban environments in a desert environment. Jordan   will take a leading role in “innovating towards zero”, testing energy   efficient solutions in close collaboration with the construction   industry, adopting smart mobility solutions and delivering optimized   tech-enabled solutions for water resource management.  To reap this   benefit, Jordan should exploit that it has more than 300 sunny days   per year for solar power energy. Other opportunities include energy   storage solutions, energy management and monitoring, and smart   cities/buildings and houses.      Low-carbon led   disruption now   slowing in lighting, in   full swing in the   power sector, and   still in the early   innings in autos.   Require products,   components and   applications &   services.   Collectively LEDs, onshore   wind, solar PV, and hybrid &   electric vehicles present a set of   breakthrough technologies that   are rapidly taking market share   in global lighting (69% by   2020 vs. 28% today), new power   generation (51% by 2025 vs. 20%   today), and autos (22% in 2025   vs. 3% today). This creates   significant new opportunities.   IoT, big data and sensors are   technologies required to enable   energy & cleantech.   Transport The Global   Intelligent   Transport System   Market is poised to   grow at a CAGR of   around 13.1% over   the next decade to   reach   approximately   $49.2 billion by   2025.29   The public transportation system in and around Amman as well as in   the rural areas is relatively poor, which gives a strong incentive to   improve public transportation and focus on Smart City Amman by   GAM. Building on its smart city Amman initiative, Jordan will take a   leading role in developing an effective digital transportation system,   using for instance IoT sensors, Big Data and other new technologies.   Opportunities include traffic management solutions, smart cities   solutions, online ride sharing and booking.    Next generation   products,   components and   applications will need   to be integrated in   back office services   and solutions to   enable real-time data   analysis.

Good internet uptake and 75% of Jordanians unbanked leaves a great   potential for enabling mobile payment solutions in Jordan.    Jordan possess the potential to become the regional FinTech hub, and   can be at the forefront of delivering FinTech solutions and   transforming industry areas like retail banking, investing, and peer-to-  peer lending.   Next generation   payments, lending,   HR solutions and   banking systems.   FinTech, block chain technology    Communications   and security   Particularly in the   MENA region,   CAGRs are high at   around 23% from   2016-2022.31,32   Jordan has strong incentives to drive tech-led/digital security-related   solutions and enable communications and connectivity in rural areas.   Opportunities for Jordan in communications include for instance   online and mobile payment solutions. Also, with the conflict in Syria   and Iraq at its borders, Jordan will take a leading role in driving ICT   led security-related solutions. In terms of security, with Jordan   currently deploying smart IDs, this can include digital signatures as well   for authentication into all applications.       Advanced techniques   in gamification and   simulations, as well   as more donor-  oriented products   and services such as   identification and   registration solutions   Secure digital communications,   specific niche technologies   Source: DTI   All content in the table above are examples of trending technologies adopted in international good practice. They are subject to change with the   advancement of technologies. Moreover, the focus areas can be customized and validated to the local context as the sectors’ digitization grow,   to ensure alignment with stakeholders’ needs and national priorities.                                                          30 http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/bl7gn8/global_fintech  31 http://www.lucintel.com/security_services_market_2018.aspx  32 http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/cyber-security.asp   http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/bl7gn8/global_fintech http://www.lucintel.com/security_services_market_2018.aspx http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/cyber-security.asp   Smart specialization across key sectors in Jordan needs the ongoing support of key enablers and key   vertical tech areas, which help build capacity, expertise and excellence to drive the digital economy. Jordan   already has existing products, services and actors within the enabling sectors predicted to grow   exponentially in terms of market in the MENA region by 2025, 33  i.e., digital content & gaming,   ecommerce and professional services (integration and support services), which need to be encouraged to   invest in becoming regional leaders and of relevance to global digital value chains. Given particularly the   ongoing trend of mobile device uptake in the whole MENA region, and the young population, Jordan   should strive to lead demand-driven innovation across the region. Similarly, key technologies of relevance   across the sectors and the enabling sectors are the vertical tech areas, i.e., IOT, cloud computing,   hardware and artificial intelligence. Here forecasts are predicting growth in the relevant tech markets   and disruptive new business models that may emerge from these technologies. This needs to be   complemented with significant capacity to lead the data revolution and be able to offer secure and reliable   digital products and services.   The above sectors are examples of international trends of sectors that have grown as a result of the   opportunities of digitization. These sectors have been related to the Jordan differentiators and   opportunities. However, the sectors should be seen as input to a wider dialogue and may change in the   course of this strategy.   LEADING THE MAKER REVOLUTION   The maker revolution, where entrepreneurs use open source design, 3D printing etc. to bring   manufacturing, architectural design etc. and technology together 34 , brings opportunities for small   companies that can address markets much more easily, at a lower cost. The maker market allows small   companies to prototype ideas, get funding, and then access manufacturing to scale up35. Moreover,   crowdfunding platforms, where a large number of supporters fund projects and ideas, typically online, have   further boosted the development, as makers can now approach supporters directly and receive funding   for their work.   Jordan is a young nation with much idea generating and support around the start-up culture. In the MENA   region, Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt lead the seed investment culture for start-ups. Incubators such as Oasis   500, iPark, the incubator Darat Al Reyadah which was recently launched by int@j, the Amman Chamber   of Commerce and MoICT, Zain Innovation Campus (ZINC) by ZAIN, Business Innovation Growth (BIG)   by Orange, the Tank by UMNIAH and others are drivers behind this. Young entrepreneurs sees Jordan as   a good place to build on new ideas36.                                                           33 For example, gaming is expected to nearly triple in size in the coming years — from $1.6 billion in 2014 to $4.4 billion in 2022. Demand for  local content will spur rapid MENA media growth. See for example http://www.arabiangazette.com/demand-local-content-spur-mena-media-  growth-20141119/  34 The Maker Revolution is a term first coined in Chris Anderson’s 2012 book “Makers: the new industrial revolution”.

These are key elements   of the maker revolution. Jordan also has a strong focus on providing the right facilities such as incubators   and fab labs to its entrepreneurs, and Jordan is the 5th best place in the MENA region to start a business37.   Therefore, Jordan is in a strong position to lead the maker revolution. It is in this connection important   that Jordan embrace an open source system to allow internal and external resources to access   information, technology and talent, as a way to trigger competitiveness and become a real leader of the   maker revolution regionally. However, there are currently challenges in Jordan related to the bureaucratic   challenges of introducing new technologies such as 3D printing. It is important that these challenges are   overcome to reap the full potential of new technologies and to create the best conditions for makers in   Jordan.   CREATING AND INTEGRATING SOLUTIONS FOR CONTENT PLATFORMS FOR THE ARAB   MARKET    Content and digital commerce solutions are not new trends, but persistent trends. At the same time, very   little content is actually available in Arabic language and the region still has a large potential for growth in   eCommerce uptake. The best guesstimate of the actual content available in Arabic is around 3%, according   to MIT38, whilst on average, 60 % of Arabs prefer digital content to be in Arabic39. In 2015, Jordan’s   eCommerce market was worth 40 million USD, and the eCommerce market in the MENA region is   projected to double its value by 202040. Jordan has strong knowledge and long tradition in the field of   online content and eCommerce, as a large percentage of digital content and e-commerce engines are   either based or have back-offices in Jordan41. This means that there is a huge gap in supply and demand   and that Jordan has a competitive advantage in addressing this gap. Jordan’s strength lies in building the   platforms and technologies that manage e-content and eCommerce. Content creation per se can continue   to grow in parallel but is not perceived to be of high impact compared to the volume and level of content   created in other Arab countries focusing on digital content as well (such as Egypt and Lebanon). However,   with Jordan focusing on building platforms and technologies for managing content, there might be a   potential for regional partnerships with Egypt and Lebanon, where much content is created, to support   these countries in managing and digitizing the Arabic content.       REACH2025 – JORDAN’S DIGITAL VISION AND MISSION   The REACH2025 vision is based on Jordan’s strengths and opportunities for responding to the current   digital strengths and for making Jordan relevant in the global digital economy.                                                           37 http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings   38 https://www.technologyreview.com/s/535591/the-online-language-barrier/   39 http://www.wamda.com/2015/06/gaps-digital-arabic-content-sector-infographic   40 https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/247836   41 http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/opinion/friedman-jobsatarabiadotcom.html?_r=0. The figure from this source is not repeated in the text, as there are no certain figures on the   exact percentage.     18        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |            The digital vision statement is as follows: In 2025, Jordan will:   ...be the platform for digital innovation by being an innovation creating center for next generation solutions   driven by strong partnerships between Jordanian champions and global IT companies.    ...have world-class talent that can compete and collaborate on the global digital skills market with an   emphasis on applied solutions driving value added creation.   ...drive globally competitive and innovative digital solutions in the following key sectors:   - HEALTH – Jordan is viewed as a regional center for health and should take advantage of this   position.  To reap this potential in Jordan, opportunities include unified eHealth records, e-  health exchange, telemedicine, Arabic content in health, health insurance exchange and records,   and online booking for doctors. Building on the existing eHealth program, a particular niche will   be the intersection of the Health sector, AI and the pharma industry powered by digital analytics   capacity.   - EDUCATION – Personalized and collaborative digital learning environments will revolutionize   how education will be delivered globally. The latest advances in learning science, artificial   intelligence, learning analytics, mobile platforms/services, and maker spaces, should enable this.   Jordan will have a world-leading role in developing these types of solutions and platforms   responding to the global need for scalable solutions that match 21st century skills demands. Jordan   pioneered the adoption of ICT as a means to innovate education several years ago and should   exploit this. In Jordan, there are opportunities around digital curricula, entrepreneurship and   digital skills for kids in schools, makerspaces in education, and online education for refugees.    - ENERGY & CLEANTECH – Jordan has an impressive history of dealing with scarce resources   and creating livable urban environments in a desert environment. Jordan will take a leading role in   “innovating towards zero”, testing energy efficient solutions in close collaboration with the   construction industry, adopting smart mobility solutions and delivering optimized tech-enabled   solutions for water resource management.  To reap this benefit, Jordan should exploit that it has   more than 300 sunny days per year for solar power energy. Other opportunities include energy   storage solutions, energy management and monitoring, and smart cities/buildings and houses.   - FINANCIAL SECTOR – Jordan possess the potential to become the regional FinTech hub, and   can be at the forefront of delivering FinTech solutions and transforming industry areas like retail   banking, investing, and peer-to-peer lending.   - TRANSPORT – building on its smart city Amman initiative, Jordan will take a leading role in   developing an effective digital transportation system, using for instance IoT sensors, Big Data and   other new technologies.   - COMMUNICATION AND SECURITY – Jordan has strong incentives to drive ICT-led security-  related solutions and enable communications and connectivity in rural areas. Also, with the conflict   in Syria and Iraq at its borders, Jordan will take a leading role in driving ICT led security-related   solutions. In terms of security, with Jordan currently deploying smart IDs, this can include digital   signatures as well for authentication into all applications.     19        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |            Moreover, there will be a substantial focus on selected tech verticals. Tech verticals such as IoT, cloud   computing, hardware (including electronics design) and artificial intelligence (AI) are among the verticals   where Jordan is perceived to have a stronghold.   ...lead the maker revolution across the region. Led by the established hardware industry, product   innovation will be increasingly supported by embedding cutting-edge technologies directly into industrial   zones and tech hubs.   ...establish itself as the leading solutions builder and integrator for content platforms for the Arab   market, which will serve the demand of the exponentially growing young digital Arabic speaking customer   base across the region and beyond.    …be the preferred place in the region for starting, scaling & growing a tech company by ensuring clear   rules, procedures and policies, as well as acceleration and incubation.   The above vision statement translates into the following vision and mission statements:   Vision   A digital economy that empowers people, sectors and businesses to raise productivity and ensure   growth and prosperity, creating a highly attractive business destination for investments and   international collaboration.    Mission   Jordan will   • Ensure a highly stable, nurturing business environment.   • Drive creative and innovative technologies in key niche sectors and markets.   • Strengthen the entrepreneurial mindset of the country, supported by specialized skills.   • Support the transformation towards being a platform for innovation in international   partnerships.   • Spur innovation through open access in technology, people, standards and data.      By focusing on these areas, Jordan will increase its relevance to regional and global niche markets.      GROWTH TARGETS TO ASPIRE TO BY 2025   It is imperative to secure growth in Jordan’s economy and, subsequently, to measure this growth to ensure   progress. Consequently, the vision and action plan are accompanied by the development of concrete,   realistic and measurable targets.   The Key Performance Indicators (presented under each action in Annex1) are the outputs and the   immediate results of the actions if implemented to the required scope and within the proposed timeframe.   As part of the assessment phase, relevant key benchmarks were assembled that reflect key indicators of     20        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |            the digital economy and the necessary business environment. Here, further positive change is expected   to be seen. Finally, the overall targets of growth in GDP, revenue, jobs and digital economy businesses are   expected to be reached by 2025. Figure 1 illustrates the logic behind the need for an intervention/action   plan, the actions, KPIs and targets.   Figure 1: Intervention logic      Source: DTI   In the following, we present the overall target opportunities to aspire to by 2025 as well as Jordan’s   position in key indices.         TARGET OPPORTUNITIES TO ACCELERATE GROWTH IN JORDAN BY 2025   The overall targets are built on benchmarks from international good practice countries. This means that   they are based on growth figures from other countries that have invested heavily in the digital economy   and benefitted from it. This also means that the targets should be seen as growth opportunities for Jordan,   if the country succeeds in the transformation to a digital economy. This requires a full implementation of   the proposed action framework within the proposed timeframe. If timely action is not taken immediately,   other key sectors will not benefit from digitization and the tech sector will continue to decline and loose   relevance on the global market.   The key proposed high-level targets to be set up for each of these high-level areas are shown in Table 2.   The targets set are assuming a serious implementation effort starting in the first year and constant push   for results and impact.           21        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |            Table 2: Key proposed high-level targets   Type   Target   Acceleration of   growth in Gross   Domestic Product   (GDP) (national level)   3%-4% extra growth annually by 2025.

Source: DTI   ACCELERATION OF GROWTH IN GDP   From the international literature42, it is clear that digitization used with a view to both being more effective   and more innovative creates growth in companies and for the economy as a whole. One way of monitoring   growth due to increased digital economy presence is to measure the contribution to Gross Value Added   (GVA)43 or Gross Domestic Product (GDP)44.    Table 3: International examples of targets for acceleration of growth in GDP/GVA   The UK has chosen to focus on GVA and has seen an increase of 27% between 2010 and 2014 in its digital tech   industries (the UK term). This translates into a yearly growth rate of approx. 7%.45    A Parliament-led enquiry in the UK found that he digital economy in the United Kingdom is a success story: the British   economy has the highest percentage of gross domestic product attributed to the digital economy of all European                                                           42  Hanne Shapiro, Martin Eggert Hansen og Simon Fuglsang Østergaard, DTI (2014): Kortlægning af kompetencebehov og barrierer for  videregående VEU for faglærte inden for det tekniske og produktionsrettede område  43 Defined as output minus intermediate consumption  44 Defined as market value of all final goods and services produced in a period  45  http://www.techcityuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Tech-Nation-2016_FINAL-ONLINE-  1.pdf?utm_content=buffer2e58f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer   0 420 840 1,260 1,680 2,100 2,520 2,940 3,360 3,780  0 200  600 1,000  1,200 1,600  2,000 2,200  2,600 3,000  0  2,000  4,000  6,000  8,000  2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025  Growth in Number of new Businesses in Digital Economy Sectors  New businesses created in Digital Economy sectors through REACH intervention programs  New businesses created in Digital Economy sectors through natural and spillover growth  5,000 to 7,000 new Digital   Economy Businesses     25        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |            nations; UK digital industries grew two and a half times as fast as the economy as a whole between 2003 and 2013; and   the United Kingdom has the highest percentage of individual internet usage of any G7 economy.46   Dubai, which is also a very ambitious country and currently the leading MENA country in many international indices   such as World Economic Forum, has set a yearly GDP growth target (exclusive of oil) of 5% up to 2021.47          Digitization clearly has an impact on GDP growth. A recent study shows that a 10% increase in digitization   contributes to a 0.59% increase in GDP for a transitional economy like Jordan.48 Jordan clearly has to be   ambitious in its goal setting. At the same time, the country has much catching up to do before it can have   similar growth rates as the UK or even Dubai, which are both advanced economies in terms of digitization   and thus experience higher GDP growth rates than transitional economies49. Based on international   literature and Jordan’s strengths, opportunities, and weaknesses, it is estimated that a yearly growth rate   of between 3% and 4% on top of the traditional GDP growth (currently estimated by IMF at 2.8 % increase   for 2016 and 3.2 % increase for 201750) is the target for Jordan by 2025. This digital economy target will   be effective after two years and will gradually increase to up to 4%. The first two years will see a 3%   growth rate in accordance with IMF figures, but no extra growth from digital economy interventions. Year   3, with the assumption than the digital economy action plan has been implemented at the proposed speed   and extent, is predicted to see a growth rate of 1% additional growth on top of IMF projections. In year   4 and 5, an annual additional growth on minimum 2% is expected. In year 6 to 9, an annual additional   growth of 3%-4% is expected. This corresponds to a 6%-8% total increase in GDP by 2025 (A 3-4% extra   growth annually plus the 3-4% projected growth that will happen regardless of an intervention, according   to IMF figures).   GROWTH IN REVENUE   To measure digitization in companies, other countries are focusing on revenue, or turnover as it is termed   in the UK. Revenue is defined as the income of a company, both including domestic and international   (export).    Table 4: International example of targets for growth in turnover   The UK’s Tech Nation initiative clearly shows that digital tech industries grew 32% faster in terms of turnover than the   national average in a five-year time span.51                                                              46 http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmbis/87/87.pdf  47 https://www.vision2021.ae/en/national-priority-areas/national-key-performance-indicators  48 Strategy& (2012): Maximizing the impact of digitization  49 Strategy& (2012): Maximizing the impact of digitization  50 IMF World Economic Outlook 2016, http://www.imf.org/external/country/JOR/  51 http://www.techcityuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Tech-Nation-2016_FINAL-ONLINE-  1.pdf?utm_content=buffer2e58f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer   http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmbis/87/87.pdf http://www.imf.org/external/country/JOR/   26        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |               Thus, if digitization is used proactively in sectors and companies in Jordan, growth can be expected within   the period between now and 2025. However, for digital companies to grow it is necessary to have an   open and sound regulatory business environment, which the assessment has shown that Jordan does not   yet fully have and need to focus on. Therefore, Jordanian digital economy companies cannot be expected   to grow as much as their UK counterparts. However, once the regulatory environment is in place, Jordan   has the advantage of a creative population and a strong setup around a startup culture that can boost   growth in digital economy industries. The regulatory environment is assumed to be fully in place within   the first two years, meaning that Jordanian digital economy companies can be expected to start growing   faster after two years. After 10 years, it is estimated that the accumulative and gradual growth for digital   economy industries should be between 25% and 30% for Jordan, giving Jordanian companies a few more   years to reach a growth similar to the British companies.   GROWTH IN JOBS   The proposed focus of Jordan on selected sectors where digitization has the potential to create a   competitive edge is expected to drive job creation and growth in these sectors. At the same time,   international experience from Europe shows that digitization will drive productivity increase, which will   have a negative impact on jobs in the short term. Nevertheless, benchmark countries have largely   experienced high growth in digital economy jobs as a result of digital economy.      Table 5: International examples of targets for growth in jobs   In the UK, digital tech economy jobs grew approximately 11% between 2011 and 2014, which is an average yearly   increase of nearly 4%. The UK has experienced a 2.8 times faster job growth in the digital tech economy compared to   the rest of the economy.52    Ireland, a leading European ICT hub, expects a yearly increase in tech jobs of approx. 5%, between 2014 and 2018.53           The digital economy is expected to create new jobs in two different categories: by scaling up existing new   companies in key sectors and by either creating new companies or registering new branches (new   entrants), in addition to the spill-over effect.   To estimate jobs created in existing companies, the following calculation has been made: The International   Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that there are 1.2 million working Jordanians, 463,000 of whom are   in the public sector. That leaves a little over 700,000 people in the private sector.54 It is estimated that   half of these jobs potentially pertain to the future digital economy – the ICT sector as well as the six                                                           52 http://www.techcityuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Tech-Nation-2016_FINAL-ONLINE-  1.pdf?utm_content=buffer2e58f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer  53  http://www.ictireland.ie/Sectors/ICT/ICT.nsf/vPages/Papers_and_Sector_Data~ict-skills-action-plan-2014-14-03- 2014/$file/ICT+Skills+Action+Plan+2014.pdf  54 Jordan’s National Employment Strategy 2011-2020     27        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |            selected key sectors (totaling 350,000 jobs). It is widely recognized that digitization creates both direct   and indirect jobs. For instance, in the US, one digital job creates 5 indirect jobs55. In the international   benchmark examples above, the yearly job growth in the digital economy in the UK and Ireland are   between 4% and 5%. In Jordan, the service industry is not necessarily entirely local, which means that the   job growth in the digital economy will be a little less. Therefore, it is estimated that Jordan can manage an   average yearly job growth of 3%-3.5%. This amounts to the digital economy creating a multiplier effect of   1.3 over 10 years, amounting to 105,00056 jobs.   To estimate new digital economy jobs created, the following estimations have been made: As a result of   the acceleration programme under action 5, 1,000 digital economy start-ups would be incubated in the   first three years. For the next 3-year period, an additional 1,000 start-ups would be incubated and for the   last 3-year period, another 1,000 start-ups would be incubated. This amounts to 3,000 digital economy   startups in total which are created within the acceleration prorgamme. It is estimated that on average   these start-ups will create on average five jobs each (15,000 jobs in a 10-year life span). Moreover,   approximately 700 new businesses are created in all sectors every month outside of the acceleration   programme, representing new businesses, spinoffs from existing companies and/or universities, and   companies coming from outside registering as new companies in Jordan. Of these companies, it is expected   that 10% of these pertain to sectors relevant in the future digital economy. This amounts to 840 businesses   annually. Assuming that half of these companies survive (amounting to 420 companies), this amounts to   the creation of 4,200 companies in ten years. Assuming that these companies create 5 jobs each on   average, this is an additional 21,000 jobs.    The total job creation is the following:    the new jobs within existing companies within core sectors & tech sector (105,000 jobs in 10   years) PLUS     the jobs created in digital economy startups or spin offs outside of the acceleration programs   (18,900 jobs in 10 years) PLUS     the new jobs created by digital economy start-ups within the acceleration program (15,000 jobs   in 10 years).    This totals 138,900 jobs. This means setting a political goal of between 130,000 and150,000 new jobs   over a 10-year period. This figure does also factor in possible growth in university spin-outs and non-  for-profit sector jobs, which may also potentially be growing. However, the figure does not factor in the   potential job loss that Jordan may experience as a result of digitization.                                                               55 See for instance Moretti, Enrico (2012): The new geography of jobs  56 350,000 x 0.3 equals the extra job growth of 105,000     28        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |            GROWTH IN DIGITAL BUSINESSES   Closely linked to the growth in jobs is the growth in digital businesses. As of 2016, Jordan has a baseline   of 600 digital economy companies according to int@j estimates. In all sectors, approximately 700 new   businesses are created in all sectors every month, representing new businesses, spinoffs from existing   companies and/or universities, and companies coming from outside registering as new companies in   Jordan. Of these companies, it is expected that 10% of these pertain to sectors relevant in the digital   economy. This amounts to 840 businesses annually. From international benchmarks, it can be seen that   approximately half of the companies survive. Assuming that half of these are expected to survive, which   amounts to 420 digital companies created every year. In ten years, this will amount to 3,780 companies.   In addition, 3,000 new digital economy companies are created under Action 5. In total, this amounts to   6,780 digital companies. For the purpose of setting a target, the range of 5,000-7,000 new digital businesses   is set.  Digital businesses can be companies in key sectors that venture into the digital economy as well as   newly created digital companies.   FUTURE SOCIO-ECONOMIC INDICATORS   The healthiness of the future society and the attractiveness of an economy are increasingly being measured   in additional socio-economic indicators such as livability, happiness, sustainability and resilience as well as   the potential for social innovation. Actual indicators in this field are at the explorative stage and aim to   capture the socio-economic value the digital economy can deliver. Relevant trackers that Jordan should   be considering are inclusiveness of the digital economy with a specific emphasis on the inclusion of   immigrants and refugees as well as fostering a digital economy that is nationwide rather than focused on   Amman, the empowerment of women, the contribution of the digital economy to the green economy and   as a very important issue the impact of the digitization to improve transparency and working processes of   government and the non-for -profit sector. All of these outcome indicators attract huge international   attention currently and there is significant potential to become a regional leader in demonstrating impact   and solutions that work in the MENA region. International literature point to a number of socio-economic   indicators that could be taken into consideration in the future to track progress. Examples of these   indicators are found below.

Value derived from the   digital future are beyond GDP, not only measured in economic value but also in specific added social value.   We have selected key metrics from independent global rankings that should be monitored to track   Jordan’s performance. The reason for choosing to measure Jordan’s performance in these key areas is to   instill investor confidence and help ensure that Jordan is perceived to be an attractive country to work   and do business in.         30        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |            Table 7: Jordan’s position in selected international indices           The table above shows that there are success stories in Jordan, particularly in respect to the   effectiveness of the law-making bodies and venture capital availability, which have both increased.   However, Jordan is declining in a number of areas central to the digital economy. The business   environment in terms of number of days, procedures, and cost to start a business and number of days to   enforce a contract are at a level too low for Jordan to excel, even though two of the indicators show   signs of increasing. In addition, in the skills area, particularly the quality of mathematics and science   education, the indicator is dropping at an alarming rate. The impact on ICTs on new organizational   models also dropped quite alarmingly, clearly showing a need for immediate action if Jordan is to fulfil its   Indicator 2016 Trend Source  Selected Sub-Indicators RANK   /140  2015 to   2016  Political and regulatory environment  Effectiveness of law-making bodies* 45 20 WEF Global Competitiveness Report  No. procedures to enforce a contract 89 2 World Bank Doing Business  No. days to enforce a contract 104 2 World Bank Doing Business  Business and innovation environment  Availability of latest technologies* 47 -6 WEF Global Competitiveness Report  Venture capital availability* 19 4 WEF Global Competitiveness Report  No. days to start a business 72 -3 World Bank Doing Business  No. procedures to start a business 74 4 World Bank Doing Business  Intensity of local competition* 57 0 World Bank Doing Business  Gov’t procurement of advanced tech* 42 -7 WEF Global Competitiveness Report  Infrastructure  Mobile network coverage, % pop 67 -1 International Telecommunications Union ICT Indicators  Secure Internet servers/million pop 75 -4 World Bank Development Indicators  Affordability  Prepaid mobile cellular tariffs, PPP $/min 7 46 International Telecommunications Union ICT Indicators  Skills  Quality of educational system* 32 -8 WEF Global Competitiveness Report  Quality of math & science education* 64 -25 WEF Global Competitiveness Report  Individual usage  Mobile phone subscriptions/100 pop 24 9 International Telecommunications Union ICT Indicators  Use of virtual social networks* 57 1 WEF Global Competitiveness Report  Business usage  Firm-level technology absorption* 35 1 WEF Global Competitiveness Report  Capacity for innovation* 47 11 WEF Global Competitiveness Report  Government usage  Importance of ICTs to gov’t vision* 35 -9 WEF Global Competitiveness Report  Government Online Service Index, 0–1 (best) 62 0 UNDESA UN E-Government Development  Economic impacts  Impact of ICTs on new services & products* 50 -9 WEF Global Competitiveness Report  Impact of ICTs on new organizational models* 56 -25 WEF Global Competitiveness Report  Social impacts  Impact of ICTs on access to basic services* 43 -8 WEF Global Competitiveness Report  ICT use & gov’t efficiency* 47 -17 WEF Global Competitiveness Report  E-Participation Index, 0–1 (best) 70 -1 UNDESA UN E-Government Development    31        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |            digital economy vision. Lastly, the level of the eGovernment indicator is a clear sign that government   needs a more active role in developing a digital economy for Jordan. All of the above clearly shows a   need for immediate action, if Jordan is to be perceived as a leading digital economy in the future.   KEY QUESTIONS/ISSUES TO ADDRESS   The insights above leads to a number of key questions or   issues to address for Jordan to move in the direction of the   vision towards an action plan. The following key questions   have been identified:   1. How can Jordan shift its efforts to support demand   driven innovation across key sectors and ecosystems   in Jordan in collaboration with the ICT sector, tech   start-ups and universities?   2. How can Jordan ensure world-class talent and build   relevant skills and capacity for tomorrow’s global digital economy?    3. How can Jordan ensure collaboration within the ICT sector, and among the ICT sector and other   key sectors to leverage its strategic partnerships to stimulate digitization in key sectors?   4. How can Jordan facilitate an environment that provides companies with the most favorable   business environment and laws/regulations?   5. How can Jordan be inclusive and open to new technologies and new technologies business models   transformation?   6. How can Jordan ensure a strong leadership position in the development of culturally adapted and   localized Arab content and solutions?   7. How can Jordan ensure the right conditions for startups leading a maker revolution?    COST OF INACTION   The above questions require that actions are taken immediately. If Jordan continues without changes, it   will imply that the tech sector will continue to be challenged. Already now, the sector is witnessing a   decline in turnover. The average development from 2011-2014 has been a decline of 9 percent57. Also,   exports to key markets have declined, both to Saudi Arabia and the US, which are the two major export                                                           57 int@j (2014): ICT & ITES Industry Statistics & Yearbook     32        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |            destinations58. This situation clearly needs to be turned around if Jordan is to prosper and to play a key   role in the digital economy.   Key weaknesses that need to be rectified for Jordan to turn around the above situation include the relative   mismatch between the university curricular and the requirements from the industry, and the lack of a   unanimous interpretation of the regulatory framework in Jordan. However, if action is taken, Jordan can   take advantage of its good human capital and strong conditions for startups and position itself as a strong   digital player in the MENA region.   Therefore, the stepping stones for bridging the gap between the current situation and Jordan’s place in   the digital economy in 2025 is illustrated below.   Figure 0.1: Bridging the “valley of death”   Source: DTI                                                              58 int@j (2014): ICT & ITES Industry Statistics & Yearbook     33        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |            It is clear that Jordan faces a number of declining indicators, such as declining revenue in the ICT sector,   a skills mismatch and lack of collaboration among companies and sectors. If nothing is done to revitalize   the tech sector and move the country as a whole towards a digital economy, the declining figures are   expected to continue and the cost of inaction will be paramount to Jordan, resulting in a lack of relevance   in global value chains.   KEY FOCUS AREAS THAT DRIVE INITIATIVES LEADING TO TRANSFORMATION   To bridge the cost of inaction – or “valley of death” – a number of focus areas have been identified that   drive transformation change and are the pillars of the digital economy. These focus areas have been based   on two assessments: They are drivers of the digital economy addressed in comparative transformational   national strategies, and they are key drivers and indicators used in recognized digital economy benchmarks,   such as by the OECD’s Measuring the digital economy 59 , the World Economic Forum’s global   competitiveness index 60 , the World Economic Forum’s information and communication technology   benchmark61 and ITU’s ICT development index62 .    The six key focus areas that will drive the initiatives and actions are as follows:     Smart Specialization and demand-driven innovation    Tech Start-ups and Entrepreneurs    Public Sector Innovation    Enabling Business Environment    ICT Skills, Capacity and Talent    Smart Infrastructure   The key focus areas are elaborated more below. In addition, in placing Jordan on the path towards   excellence, a number of high-level actions have been identified. These high-level actions are linked to the   aforementioned focus areas. Each high-level action will inform a number of concrete actions, with clear   owners and targets attached to them.    SMART SPECIALIZATION 63  AND DEMAND-DRIVEN INNOVATION focuses on unlocking the   potential for digitization in areas where Jordan has – or has the potential to develop – a competitive   advantage. It can also be in areas/sectors of global importance, where Jordan can be relevant in global   value chains. The increased digitization of the global economy provides an opportunity for Jordan to focus   on further developing digitally enabled solutions to fit the demands from key sectors.   TECH START-UPS AND ENTREPRENEURS sets out to build on the strength of the tech startup   environment in Jordan, and to give the companies the best possibilities for scaling and growing. The startup                                                           59 http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/science-and-technology/measuring-the-digital-economy_9789264221796-en#page1   60 http://reports.weforum.org/global-competitiveness-report-2015-2016/   61 http://reports.weforum.org/global-information-technology-report-2015/   62 http://www.itu.int/net4/ITU-D/idi/2015/   63 We are aware that our use of this term conflicts with how for instance the European Commission uses it.      34        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |            companies – and later on, the growing companies – will typically need to have a regional and/or global   focus, as the Jordan market is typically too small and poor for companies to prosper. However, a key   barrier in Jordan is the concrete legal and regulatory challenges that make starting and closing a tech   business too risky and unattractive.   PUBLIC SECTOR INNOVATION: Government plays a large role in ensuring that a digital strategy can   unfold and become a reality on the ground. As a lawmaker, but also as enabling partner and a law enforcer   or interpreter, and as a market, where digital solutions can be tested and unfolded.   ENABLING BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT: To be an important player in the global digital economy,   Jordan needs world-class companies. To support these, Jordan needs to have favorable business conditions   spanning from opening a business and running it to closing it down, but clearly also the most transparent   laws. These business conditions are not only pertaining to ICT, but should be favorable to companies   across the economy.   ICT SKILLS, CAPACITY AND TALENT: Building on one of the other clear strengths that Jordan has,   namely its human capital, is also important for positioning Jordan in the global value chains and in the   region. The skills should be further developed to ensure that Jordan has the innovative skills for bringing   ICT verticals into other key sectors. One of the current initiatives to build on is the Jordan Skills   Standardization Organization (JSSO) focusing on bridging the gap between universities’ graduates and   private sector requirements and working on improving skills of unemployed resources according to the   unique sector needs and trends64 based on a qualifications framework. Another is the int@j initiative,   offering - through its international partners and local training centers - a certification program related to   IoT, Cloud Computing and Big Data. The aim of this is to better equip ICT professionals and fresh   graduates.   SMART INFRASTRUCTURE is highly relevant for the uptake and use of digital solutions among   businesses and its employees. The digital infrastructure should be in place in Jordan and should be able to   meet the demands and enable the advancement to a digital economy, for the benefit of the tech sector   and the wider digital economy sectors.   APPROACH AND LOGIC FRAMEWORK TO DRIVE THE   TRANSFORMATION FORWARD   The action plan builds on a strong foundation in Jordan as highlighted in the vision paper:    The first REACH Initiative, which was launched in year 2000 as the official kick-start of a   comprehensive public-private partnership, aimed at developing the country’s ICT sector and pave   the way for the other economic sectors to move into the Knowledge Economy.                                                           64 http://www.intaj.net/content/jordan-skills-standardization-organization-jsso     35        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |             There are over 600 Jordanian ICT companies in the ICT cluster, which drive digitization and are   a key resource for skills and capacity in Jordan.    As a country with few natural resources, Jordan’s economy diversified early based on investments   in new technologies and infrastructure. The key to reaching the future will be to build on these   enablers and accelerate digital innovation through cross-sectoral collaboration.    Jordanians are a people that have shaped their future over centuries. There is a deeply engrained   tradition to make the future happen through informed decisions and enable the future to the   benefit of everyone.   Additionally, there is a tradition in Jordan for collaborative effort across industry, government, non-for-  profit organizations and even the Royal Court to drive change and to ensure that Jordan is globally   competitive and not 'left behind'. This action plan has been compiled and built based on a review of existing   initiatives and programs and clearly identifying where they can be scaled, accelerated or expanded, as well   as based on good practice and benchmarks with other economies’ and countries’ key actions.   To reach the vision statements presented above, a number of actions were developed. These actions build   on stakeholder and expert input as well as international good practice. The following logic framework   explains how the actions relate to the vision statements and key differentiators for Jordan.     Figure 2: Logic framework linking vision and action        Source: DTI        As can be seen from Figure 1, the differentiators/opportunities, vision, mission and core elements translate   into a set of strategic objectives as well as high-level actions with specific objectives, sub-actions, owners,   budget considerations & KPIs. The high-level actions are specified in further detail below and in Annex 1.   The actions set out to put Jordan amongst the leading digital economies of the world. Focus is on creating   an institutionalized and sustainable, transformative ecosystem for a digital economy, opening up Jordan to   be a regional hub for makers and tech start-ups. Steps on the way include delivering a policy push to   enable the ICT sector and the key economic sectors to grow Jordan through a digital economy, and   leveraging existing platforms and programs with a focus on strengthening the Jordanian start-ups and   companies.   THE ACTION FRAMEWORK   The digital economy in Jordan has four key focus areas, i.e., smart specialization, tech start-ups &   entrepreneurs, public sector innovation, and skills capacity & talent. Under smart specialization, the digital   economy can be accelerated by focusing on three driving core elements to enable the digital economy:     The six leading sectors (Health, Education, Energy & Cleantech, Transport & logistics, Financial   sector, and Communications & security)    The key enablers (Content & gaming, E-commerce and Professional services)    The vertical tech areas (IOT, Cloud Computing, Hardware and Artificial Intelligence)   Taking an ecosystem perspective, emphasis of lead actions need to be further on activating and motivating   makers and their transition to become startups or inform the innovation system around Jordan’s   companies. Startups need to be increased in numbers and encouraged to venture into the digital economy   focus areas, whilst both startups and Jordan companies need to investigate partnerships with international   companies and shift to a demand-led market development paradigm informed by considerations across   global value chains and markets. Finally, activating public sector innovation is also of key importance for   government to act as a market for Jordanian innovations. Underlying this is open access to world-class   talent (both talent graduating from educational systems and talent in the active labor force).         38        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |            Figure 3: Framework for the actions       Source: DTI      The supporting actions towards the transformation of a digital economy in Jordan are the enabling   business environment and smart digital economy infrastructure. Here, particularly the accessibility and   adoption rate of emerging technologies as well as continuous updating of underlying telecommunications   business models matter.   Underlying the effort of accelerating smart specialization in Jordan is also the establishment of a strong,   visible, accountable and fundamentally co-owned governance structure. For this reason, Jordan needs to   consider a governance structure that will directly oversee the performance and impact of the lead actions.   This document presents an ideal governance model highlighting three specific governance actions in   developing and maintaining multiple layers of leadership, smart regulation and strong monitoring and   evaluation. To finalize the governance model, all relevant actors, roles and mandates should be reviewed   in the near future to ensure an effective implementation set-up.    THE ACTIONS   Based on the core elements and strategic objectives presented above, 15 high-level actions and 3   governance actions have been developed. They are based on Jordan’s key differentiators/opportunities,   strengths, opportunities, and weaknesses, as well as international experience in terms of how other   benchmark countries have set the path for achieving a digital vision. The sub-actions with clear owners   and timelines are specified for the 15 high-level actions and 3 governance actions later in the report.   To set a roadmap for the high-level actions to reach their KPIs, it is important to further spell out how   the actions will be specified. This section presents the high-level actions and a short explanation of the     39        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |            detailed sub-actions underlying each of the high-level actions. The sub-actions are designed for the next   three years. After a period of three years, the action plan will have to be revised and new sub-actions   identified. Owners – or coordinators – have been assigned for each of the sub-actions. These will lead the   transformation of Jordan towards a digital economy.    The 15 high-level actions and 3 governance actions have owners, budget indications and clear KPIs to   ensure the progress and success of the digital strategy. The actions are presented below. For a full   overview of the details for each action, please see Annex 1.   As can be seen from the figure below, the lead, supporting and governance actions are closely interlinked.   The lead actions sets out to drive smart specialization whilst the support actions are the prerequisites for   the lead actions to succeed. The governance actions ensure visibility and accountability.

Moreover, they are important for reaching the concrete vision of social change and a sustainable digital   economy. They are presented below. It should be noted that some of the actions are already being   initiated.   Box 2: Lead actions   Smart Specialization & Growth   Action 1 – Adopting the Digital Economy Framework in Jordan’s economy                     …by launching a Digital Economy Catapult and Launchpads in key sectors and verticals     Create an independent digital economy catapult – a platform for the digital economy in Jordan. It should be   established as a network of specialized centers of excellence with one headquarter/umbrella. A digital   economy catapult will be established with one headquarter and nine catapults in the six leading sectors (Health,   Education, Energy & Cleantech, Transport & logistics, Financial sector, and Communications & security) and   three key enablers (Content & gaming, E-commerce and Professional services). The vertical tech areas (IOT,   Cloud Computing, Hardware and Artificial Intelligence) will be embedded in the relevant catapults.      Action 2 – Creating globally relevant, high value digital applications, solutions and IP                   …  by supporting in-licensing and the reuse of IPs     Create national agreement on utilizing local intellectual property/innovations/solutions for the digital economy.   The action is building on the differentiator of leveraging high-level strategic partnerships. A way of doing this   is to reuse IPs from international companies. Leading countries are experimenting with the reuse of local   intellectual property/existing solutions to create an open economy that facilitates digital innovation.      Action 3 - Driving global partnerships and bridges with international digital hubs                     … through a network of international innovation centers in key markets      Strengthen and promote Jordan’s digital solutions and market development potential in key export markets.   The main focus is to enable business-to-business partnerships between Jordanian digital economy companies   and international partners, to create international awareness of Jordan’s strengths, differentiators and   capabilities.   Public sector innovation   Action 4 – Transforming government and public sector to be “digital by default” by 2020                    …by developing open data policy, changing models of implementation based on Public-  Private Partnerships and leading and accelerating digital innovation across government     Transform government and public sector to be a regionally and globally recognized leader in public sector   innovation and digitization by going digital by default. The aims for Jordan are to achieve a strong and open   public infrastructure key for developing a strong digital economy and create a more efficient government as   shown by leading countries. Moreover, the actions are responding to the weakness of government not acting   as a competent market and user that can drive digital economy.      Startups & entrepreneurship   Action 5 - Boosting digital economy startups                   …in Jordan and special zones, by increasing incubation, acceleration & support capacity     41        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |              Support and scale tech start-ups, particularly in venturing into the digital economy. This is done through   physical and/or virtual tech zones, where companies enjoy special benefits.      Action 6 – Making Jordan the regional hub for makers                   …by giving all makers access to the innovation infrastructure/ecosystem     The maker movement, where entrepreneurs use open source design, 3D printing etc. to bring manufacturing,   architectural design etc. and technology together65, brings opportunities for small companies that can address   markets much more easily, at a lower cost. Jordan has an opportunity of leading the maker movement in the   region by building a national program co-owned between local industry, foundations, universities and other   educational institutions. The action is responding to the key differentiator of leading the maker revolution and   aims at strengthening the local innovation and entrepreneurship culture.      Action 7 – Enabling a culture of digital entrepreneurship & intrapreneurship across Jordan                     …by launching a national campaign and through building specialized corporate funds   and action for intrapreneurship     To create awareness and support of the culture of entrepreneurship; launch national campaign, support   program for entrepreneurs & intrapreneurs, and integrate the concepts of entrepreneurship into education.   The action is building on Jordan’s differentiator on leveraging high-level strategic partnerships, with the aim of   creating ecosystems and collaboration including the public sector, private sector, and universities, around the   digital economy.      Skills, capacity & talent   Action 8  - Implementing 21st century skills to support the digital economy                   …by linking digital economy skills needs to the nation-wide overhaul of the education   system     Link digital economy to the nation-wide overhaul of the education system, linking the education policy   framework to the digital economy and 21st century skills needs. The action is building on the differentiator of   producing specialized tech talent, entrepreneurial drive and imagination. It is also addresses the weakness of   the mismatch between the university curricular and graduates and industry requirements.       Action 9 – Creating a world-class talent pool to support and drive the digital economy demand   locally and globally                   …by supporting training & qualifications and enabling an open labor market     Create an attractive labor market by focusing on key smart specialization areas and supporting knowledge   transfer programs. Create an open (for local and foreign investors and employees) labor market linked to the   global skills market and actively focused on export of Jordanian products and solutions and services-built   Jordanian skills. The aim of this action is to enable the industry to access the right talent at the right time.      Action 10 – Creating models and tools for better women participation in the digital economy                    …in workplaces and as active users                                                           65 The Maker Revolution is a term first coined in Chris Anderson’s 2012 book “Makers: the new industrial revolution”.

The aim of this action is to unlock the untapped potential the educated female workforce. According to UN   and int@j figures, the current percentage of women in tech sectors is 30%, but the potential is 50%. Moreover,   the action sets out to empower women to be part of the digital economy, allowing women to drive usage and   demand for digital services.     Source: DTI      Support actions    The supporting actions have the purpose of ensuring that the lead actions can be reached. In other words,   they can be said to be the prerequisites for the success of the lead actions.   The supporting actions have the strategic objective of improving the enabling and investment environment   for tech companies and digital innovation, including emerging industries.   Box 3: Support actions   Enabling business environment   Action 11 – Creating an open, stable and enabling business environment for the digital economy                   …by streamlining and revising processes, laws and regulations     Lead government-wide overhaul of policies and regulations to develop enabling legislative framework for digital   companies, products and services, reduce administrative burden on companies and create regulatory stability   and visibility.      Action 12 – Building a high-performance and attractive investment environment                    …with an emphasis on the availability of scaling and growth capital and FDI     Significantly increase the availability of growth capital (Seed and follow-on investments). The action aims to   address the weakness of gaps in funding cycles, and provides a potential for the market to make up to the lack   of government funding and drive one of the most competitive digital economies of the world.      Action 13 - Becoming an early adopter country and regional beta-tester for key emerging   technologies                  …by supporting experimentation     Map and drive the adoption of new technologies and support experimentation, in particularly by the public   sector. The action addresses the weakness of several key technologies being heavily controlled in Jordan.   Controlled openness is necessary to allow for the experimentation needed to be the beta tester of the region.      Smart digital economy infrastructure   Action 14  - Establishing a state-of-the-art secure digital infrastructure                  …by developing information and cyber security practices and regulations, revising   spectrum pricing and investing in the national broadband infrastructure and laying the path for 5G     Create a competitive, privately owned infrastructure with a focus on data traffic across networks. Leading   digital economies continuously focus on supporting commercially feasible models for the development of   future telecommunication networks, and so should Jordan, to ensure a state-of-the-art digital infrastructure   for its businesses and citizens.     43        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |               Action 15 – Leading nation-wide focus on data-driven transformation                   …by developing regional standards and secure operational models for open data     Drive data-driven solutions across the MENA region, linked to higher education and developing digital   economy solutions. International benchmark countries show that the backbone of the digital economy is data-  led. This requires standards, security and interoperable business protocols across the economy for example   FinTech and eHealth protocols.

Action 17 -  Reforming the regulatory system to support the integrated digital economy                      …by launching a review process of the existing regulators and shifting towards a more                       dynamic ex-post system focusing on enabling a competitive market     Establish smart regulation for the digital economy to ensure that the regulatory system supports the digital   economy in the best way possible.      Action 18 – Exercising strong program accountability and progress monitoring                    …by establishing a systematic but dynamic program monitoring and evaluation system     Create a strong accountability structure to effectively and dynamically manage the transformation towards a   digital economy, and to ensure continuous progress.     Source: DTI   The recommended next steps to operationalise and implement these actions are:    Ensure commitment from recommended main owners and ensure their willingness and ability   to drive the actions on time and required scale of impact.    For the targets and Key Performing Indicators (KPIs) to be met, it is imperative that:   o actions are executed together (no picking and choosing)   o actions are delivered within the specified timeframe    Focus on the identified required immediate actions.     Ensure in particular the impact of the smart specialization aim initiate pilots as quickly as possible.     44        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |            Lastly, a sound communications and change management process needs to be put in place for the action   plan to move at the required speed and with the necessary commitment and owners to create the growth   that Jordan needs to prosper.    DRIVING THE ACTIONS FORWARD IN A 3-YEAR TIMEFRAME TO FACILITATE   TRANSFORMATION    From the actions and KPIs presented earlier, it is clear that the actions are interlinked. Some of the actions   are prerequisites for others, and some institutions – such as the digital economy catapult – will have to   be set up to drive other actions.   In Annex 1 under each high-level action and its corresponding sub actions, the 3-year timeframe for setting   in place the actions and its sub-actions is presented. Please note that the sub-actions are designed for a 3-  year period only. This timeframe has been selected, because three years is estimated to be the maximum   timeframe for which detailed actions in a dynamic digital economy can meaningfully be designed. After   three years, the action plan should be revisited and new detailed actions should be determined.    For the lead actions, it is clear that much action needs to be taken immediately. Identifying the champions   to drive REACH2025 and establishing Digital Economy Catapults and Launchpads are among the top   priorities for these actions.    For the supporting actions, it is equally important that a number of initiatives be initiated within the first   year. For instance, the supporting actions related to skills and enabling environment need to be addressed   quickly for the digital economy catapults to reach their goals.    Please see Annex 1 for further details on the timeframe.   Having briefly discussed the time line for the action, it is now presented how the action plan should be   governed and monitored to ensure continuous progress.    FUTURE SUCCESS BUILT ON STRONG GOVERNANCE    The effort of accelerating smart specialization in Jordan to increase the significance of the Jordan digital   economy in global value chains is based on the fundamental principle of co-ownership of this action   plan between the private sector (the tech sector and the key sectors of the digital economy)   and the government.    The emphasis of the transformation path towards a strong digital economy is for Jordan to become an   'open access' country – open to technologies, talent, and investment and particularly for global   collaboration. Whilst actors have concrete role to play, the key to the digital economy will be that Jordan   becomes a platform for digital innovation and supports, in particular, communities of experts and talents   and smart specialization across the country focusing on strong and systematic support of regional and   global partnerships.   Box 5: Important considerations for a governance model     45        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |             Digital Economy Catapult (led by industry) to be institutionalized, thus creating independent   and stable push environment    Strong focus on key market enablers and a strong market push by co-creating (industry and   government) assessments and recommendations    Establishment of a digital economy fund to seed-fund further investment or directly fund pre-  commercial procurement of innovation processes/Public Procurement of Innovative Solutions   (PPI)66.    Jordan as a driver for regional development of the digital economy and open for business   leaders to come to Jordan    Strong focus on exports and supporting international partnerships and the activation of the   Jordanian diaspora    Establishment of smart regulation across all regulators in key sectors, including at local level   to enable digital economy business models     A strong accountability structure includes the involvement of the Cabinet/Economic Policies   Council as an oversight body and to establish strong legal basis for the digital economy (Digital   Economy Bill67)   Source: DTI   GOVERNING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY IN JORDAN BY CREATING A DYNAMIC AND YET   ACCOUNTABLE NETWORK OF CHAMPIONS, MOVERS & SHAKERS THAT DRIVE THE   AGENDA TOGETHER   The key to attracting investor confidence and ensure business leaders and those considering to start a   company in Jordan must be a strong, visible and accountable governance structure that will work together   to drive impact and reach the envisioned outcomes. This action plan and roadmap toward the digital   economy requires collaborative leadership across the spectrum of industry, government and the non-for-  profit organizations. Moreover, it requires that the digital economy is seen as relevant for the entire   economy, and that the Tech/ICT sector must become an integral part of this economic reality for Jordan.   For this reason, there needs to be a high-level governance structure driving smart specialization                                                           66 Pre-commercial procurement or PPI refers to the procurement of research and development of new innovative solutions before they are  commercially available. https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/pre-commercial-procurement   67 The Digital Economy Bill is inspired by the UK. The country decided that if it is to remain ahead and be a world leader in the digital economy   it needs to continue to raise its ambition. The tool for this is introducing a Digital Economy Bill, which includes a range of measures in support  of this. The bill will 1) empower consumers and provide better connectivity so that everyone has access to broadband wherever they live, 2)  build a better infrastructure fit for the digital future, 3) enable better public services using digital technologies, and 4) provide important protections   for citizens from spam email and nuisance calls etc. https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-economy-bill-2016       https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/pre-commercial-procurement https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-economy-bill-2016   46        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |            throughout the Jordan economy. This also requires fundamental changes in the way government operates   and needs to be supported by the non-for-profit sector to enable the society’s transformation towards a   digital Jordan.   Setting up a short-term governance structure to drive the right and sustainable governance model for Jordan’s   transformation    The following figure outlines the key layers, roles and responsibilities underlying the proposed short-term   governance structure that should drive the dialogues and process adopting a more sustainable governance   model and advanced economic structure in Jordan that addresses the digital economy as a key growth   pillar.   Figure 5: Governance structure to lead the digital economy      Source: DTI   The key drivers of the short-term governance structure are:    To identify the right governance set-up and at the same time create immediate momentum   following the announcement of the action, it is recommended that the Cabinet takes ownership   in the short-term to review and advise the Jordan government on the sustainable governance set-  up to drive the commitment towards the digital economy in Jordan.     47        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |             At the same time it is recommended to immediately set-up the digital economy catapult and   immediately start piloting 1-3 digital launchpads in key priority sectors to define the   structural requirements and required conditions for successful smart specialization and   acceleration.    At the heart of the transformation is the commitment of a co-funded digital economy fund.   It would be recommended that a 100Mio JDs fund can be launched immediately. This fund should   be co-owned.    The digital economy catapult and all other activities leading to smart specialisation laid out in this   action plan should be in the short-term overseen by a digital economy group. It is advisable to   include a high-level reporting mechanism on a monthly/quarterly basis to the royal court and to   the prime minister to ensure progress.   Within the first period of the digital economy action plan, all relevant roles and mandates of key leading   institutions need to be investigated and potentially revised (int@j, MoICT, etc.) leading to the following   key elements of a strong governance model for the digital economy in Jordan.   STRONG LEADERSHIP AT NATIONAL LEVEL   The vision is national transformation supported by high level steering groups across the private sector,   government and non-for-profit sector to create and sustain momentum in partnership with each other.   The leadership required by government is across three action areas: 1) enabling the digital economy, 2)   becoming a leader in digital government services and solutions itself (see action 3), 3) smart regulation to   enable state-of-the-art infrastructure and new tech business models for the digital economy.   As part of the shift away from focusing on ICT/Tech as a sector and towards a digital economy, Ministry   of ICT will increasingly become more focused on the digital economy instead of ICT. We recommend   that focus be on this development at ministerial level and the potential necessary changes be supported.   Furthermore, in supporting the digital economy, it is important that the ICT association int@j moves away   from being an ICT sector organization only and expands into at least the key digital economy sectors of   this action paper. Therefore, it is recommended that int@j’s mandate be reviewed to include additional   sectors to become more inclusive and representative.   Furthermore, the government needs to demonstrate leadership across the supporting actions as laid out   in the actions above.   SMART SPECIALISATION PUSHED BY THE PRIVAT AND PUBLIC SECTOR ACROSS KEY   SECTORS   The digital catapult will require a headquarter and the establishment of a network of individual launch   pads working on the different focus sectors, enablers and vertical tech areas. A qualified high-performing   individual should lead the digital catapult. Moreover, an executive board consisting of the current ICTAC   group, 10 leading next generation digital economy leaders as well as the economic team under the Cabinet,   should support it. It needs to be evaluated whether each catapult also has external advisory boards to   ensure effective diffusion and maximization of impact of the catapults.     48        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |            As opposed to the previous REACH models, it is important that strong champions drive the individual   launch pads, which will accelerate digitization in priority sectors, across enabling sectors and in key vertical   tech areas. The strong champions should be young leaders with new ideas and drive, who will in turn put   together working groups across key partners to diffuse digitization, create capacity, drive excellence, and   experiment with new products, services and approaches. A key task for the catapults will be to seek to   set up global partnerships to drive knowledge and tech transfer as well as drive digitization and innovation   capacity across the relevant sectors ecosystems. These champions are accountable to the Executive Board   of the Digital Economy Catapult.   Closely related, the entire ecosystem supporting start-ups will need to be strengthened and   collaboration and coordination improved. Moreover, there is a particular need to support the scaling and   growth of start-ups more effectively.   A key mechanism to drive smart specialization is the establishment of a JD 100 million digital economy   fund, which should be co-financed by public and private funds.    Eventually, the innovation system should also include close collaboration between industry players,   universities in local, regional and global partnerships. This capacity will be supported by government-led   innovation centers in key markets and should be revised and further expanded after the initial 3 years.   Overall, the commitments of the different actors can be summarized as follows:   Box 6: What is needed for the next digital revolution in Jordan - commitment of different actors   Private sector will…    Own and drive the digital economy catapults and thus create strong innovation partnerships   and collaborations across the smart specialization agendas (related to the key sectors,   enablers and vertical tech areas) to enable the digital economy in Jordan    Take responsibility for raising a JD 100 million digital economy fund    Increase expenditure on digital R&D, and drive an open innovation culture to support digital   innovation in companies and at start-ups and entrepreneurs    Actively seek to improve skills and build up talent of relevance to the digital economy     Drive nation-wide state-of-the-art infrastructure and new and emerging business models for   tomorrow's state-of-the-art infrastructure   Government will…    Set up a Digital Economy Group/Committee to accelerate digitization across key sectors,   enablers and tech areas    Review and revise the role of existing ministries    Revise and re-allocate funds and programs to support the efforts of the digital economy   transformation, particularly by creating an enabling business environment, investing in     49        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |            relevant education and skills and fostering a nation-wide digital entrepreneurship & maker   culture    Create arbitration services for digital companies to ensure the ongoing resolution of   regulatory conflict    Lead the setting up of global partnerships for businesses and start-ups in leading target   markets    Allow an environment of experimentation and testing, and lead innovation in public sector    Enable use and adoption of PPP and PPI models to accelerate the implementation of the   digital economy      Source: DTI   Finally, the non-for-profit sector (particularly foundations, but also funds and universities) also has a key   role to play, particularly in driving some of the launch pads. The non-for-profit sector will be particularly   engaged in driving the maker revolution and the entrepreneurial culture across the region, in supporting   youth in creating ideas for digital business for the future, and in disseminating social goals such as green   economy goals, bringing women into the active workforce, becoming a regional hub and for digital   innovation to become a nation-wide strength.   HOW TO MEASURE SUCCESS – CONSIDERATIONS FOR A DYNAMIC FRAMEWORK FOR   MONITORING AND EVALUATION    To ensure progress towards reaping the benefits of a digital economy, it is imperative to have a solid   monitoring and evaluation process in place. While the action plan contains a certain detail of the necessary   monitoring arrangements, particularly reflected in the detailing of the actions and KPIs, it should be   stressed that not everything can or should be included in this document. Hence, the first phase of this   action plan should be used to confirm and refine this. Moreover, at the very beginning of the action plan,   a clear baseline of information should be established, against which progress and performance will be   subsequently assessed. In addition, both the action plan and the monitoring arrangements should be   subject to ongoing review and revision during the next ten years, based on experience and lessons   learned.68   Monitoring focuses on collecting and using information to help determine if project objectives are being   achieved. It is therefore important that the project objectives are the right ones from the outset and are   clearly specified. As a first step, the institutions responsible for the monitoring exercise should double-  check this. Likewise, the final selection of appropriate indicators should be carried out by those   responsible for collecting and using the information, as they are the only ones having enough insight to                                                           68 European Commission (2007): Strengthening project internal monitoring     50        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |            ensure the appropriateness of the indicators.69 In setting up the monitoring and evaluation system, it is   advisable to develop a digital economy impact forecast and assessment model to establish a dynamic   measuring framework across the economy. Such a task is a major task, and it should be carefully   considered at the very beginning of the entire action plan to set up a sound model capturing the right   baseline, KPIs, targets, etc.    As with the selection and use of indicators, it is important that those responsible for implementation on   the ground take the lead in the setting of targets. Ownership of targets by implementing partners is   critical. In addition, the targets need to be reviewed regularly, as part of the ongoing monitoring and   review process. This helps ensure their continued relevance.70   Summing up, the following recommendations for a strong governance structure for the digital economy   emerge from international good practice:   Box 7: Recommendations for the future sustainable governance structure to support the digital economy in Jordan    Engage strong public and private sector leaders to be champions of the digital economy and its   potential across Jordan.    Manage the digital economy as a cross-cutting policy priority across government. Key ministries   aligned with the priority sectors should be leading this effort. This could take the form of a   committee or a working group, and could be chaired by a private sector leader or a high-level   government figure. It is important that the digital economy is driven by an economy or industry   relevant ministry (ies).    Consider strong government leadership by nominating a digital economy minister.    Prove to the world that you can create a vibrant and dynamic digital economy with re-prioritising   existing funds only and by smartly working in close partnership with the private sector to build   value for Jordan together.    To create the transformative push required to create the digital economy in Jordan a strong   accountability structure is required, including the mandate to withhold funds and roles and   mandates if performance is not met. This needs to apply to the private and the public sector and   rules for enforcement need to be clearly laid out.    In the long-term the parliament could have an oversight role into how the digital economy is   functioning and how it could be approved as a regular mechanism to advise the government.   Similarly, international reviews or competitions could be held to bring in scrutiny.   Celebrate digital economy success stories.                                                              69 European Commission (2007): Strengthening project internal monitoring  70 European Commission (2007): Strengthening project internal monitoring     51        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |            INSPIRING INTERNATIONAL EXAMPLES OF CONCRETE   TRANSFORMATIONAL ACTIONS   Faced with the digital future, many countries have taken concrete actions to create a competitive   advantage. Here are some examples of concrete transformational actions that Jordan could consider   adapting to its own context:    DENMARK - DIGITIZATION OF SUPPLY CHAINS AND SMART PRODUCTION - Market   Development Fund (2013-15), a new type of initiative, supports the development process just   before commercialization, when a functioning prototype must be customized to fit the demands   of the market. The fund co-finances facilitation of end-consumer testing and adaptation of the   new product or service, thereby shortening the developer’s time to market and strengthening   the potential for growth and employment.    DENMARK - FOCUS ON SMART CITIES - Copenhagen Smart City Solutions lab - The   Copenhagen Solutions Lab will be a new governing body for smart city projects across all sectors   in the city and will have focus on creating triple helix partnerships. Copenhagen Solutions Lab   will lead the implementation of innovation and smart city development in close collaboration   with knowledge institutions and companies as well as citizens. New intelligent transportation   system solutions, reduced carbon emissions, implementation of sensors that create real time   data and information on current situations in the city and the buildup and architecture of a new   ‘Big Data Digital Infrastructure Platform’ that shares data across public and private sectors will   all be working focus points within the Lab.    DUBAI – THE NATIONAL INNOVATION STRATEGY:   The strategy sets out specific strands of action:   o Developing government innovation by institutionalizing innovative practices with the   support of an integrated system of modern tools, requiring all government entities to   reduce spending by 1 percent and to dedicate the savings to research and innovation   projects;    o Encouraging private sector innovation by stimulating companies to establish innovation   and scientific research centres, to adopt new technologies and to develop innovative   products and services;    o Qualifying individuals with highly innovative skills by concentrating on science, technology,   engineering and mathematics, including the creation of educational material for schools   and universities.   The Dubai National Innovation Strategy includes the following focus areas:   o In the field of renewable energy, the strategy will establish a new organisation to facilitate   decentralised power generation projects such as small-scale solar installations. The   strategy will also encourage innovation in the renewables industry while also supporting   applied research in clean technology.     52        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |            o In transportation, the strategy will stimulate innovation in air and sea travel as well as   logistics. The aim is to provide new products and services, make procedures more   effective, and save time. The strategy will also focus on innovation in the field of unmanned   drones.   o In education, the strategy will establish innovation labs in schools and universities as part   of a drive to equip students with targeted skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving,   creativity, perseverance and adaptability.   o In health, the strategy will promote advanced technologies in healthcare services. It will   stimulate the growth of the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries while also   working with strategic partners to support medical research.   o On the topic of water, the strategy will seek innovative solutions to the challenge of water   scarcity.   o Finally, the strategy will support space technology for the purpose of exploration as well   as satellite communications and specialised research on terrestrial applications.    IRELAND – HELPING SMES ONLINE - Grow small businesses and create jobs by helping   micro and small enterprises to trade online and access new markets. By mid-2015, get 10,000   businesses online for the first time and through the Trading Online Voucher Scheme help   2,000 more small businesses trade online for the first time.    IRELAND – GRAND COALITION FOR ESKILLS - The ICT Skills Working Group of   Northern Ireland is a regional coalition of stakeholders. The ICT Skills Working Group brings   together a wide range of stakeholders, including representatives from relevant government   departments, higher education, further education, employers, employer representative bodies,   sector skills councils and trade associations. The Group manages an Action Plan setting out the   short, medium and long term actions required to ensure that the local ICT industry has access   to the skilled workforce it needs to grow and flourish, both now and in the future.    IRELAND – COMMUNICATION & AWARENESS CAMPAIGNS TO PROMOTE THE   DIGITAL SOCIETY – Ireland has been running a number of campaigns to promote trust, safety   and skills. Similar aspects could promote wide-scale digital innovation.    UK – DEVELOPING OPEN DATA - The Open Data Institute is already championing innovation   in industry and society through open data. A growing body of evidence points towards the   economic benefits of open data, and the trend of public and private organizations opening up   their data sets should be encouraged to continue.     UK – TECH NATION VISION AND BENCHMARKING APPROACH – The strategy   focuses on areas like digital skills, smart capital investment, infrastructure, international   development and leadership to support the tech industry in the UK.        53        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |            INTERNATIONAL EXAMPLES - GOVERNANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION   The platforms, systems and supply chains that underpin the emerging digital economy in Jordan will need   consistent investment, a shared innovation strategy and a broad-based cross-industry collaborative   approach. Concrete actions and commitment will be the transformatory engine in Jordan. However, this   roadmap to excellence, which is currently being developed, will require joint leadership from the private   sector as well as government. To assure all partners and stakeholders, a strong governance and   implementation model will need to be set in place to ensure follow-through and guide effort in a dynamic   way based on consistent monitoring of impact achieved against key targets. To determine the right model   international approaches and best practice will be taken into consideration.    Different approaches and components displayed by leading countries include the following:    UK - The UK currently has a tech nation strategy at city level, led by an independent organization   called Tech City UK. Launched in 2010, Tech City UK focusses on areas like digital skills, smart   capital investment, infrastructure, international development and leadership to support the tech   industry in the UK focusing on the ICT clusters in key cities. At the same time, the UK has   national digital economy strategy focusing on unlocking digital growth, transforming government,   transforming day-to-day life, and building the foundations – infrastructure, emphasis on   cybersecurity, privacy, trust, skills. The strategy is led by the Digital Economy Minister in the   Department for Culture, Media & Sport.    DENMARK - The focus of the current digital vision in Denmark is on Digitization of Supply   Chains and Smart Production. The vision is to enable the rapid design, implementation and   evaluation of innovative value creating automated digital business solutions in the supply chain.   There is a particular emphasis on key sectors and on SMEs. This is supported by policy,   investment solutions and by a set-up of tech transfer organizations, for instance the GTS   institutes. GTS stands for Godkendt Teknologisk Service (approved technology service   provider) and are independent not-for-profit organizations whose purpose is to spread technical   know-how, new methods and knowledge to industry and society. The GTS institutes are   independent from political or economic interests and profit is reinvested in research and   development.     DENMARK - The Copenhagen Solutions Lab is a new governing body for smart city projects   across all sectors in the city and will have focus on creating triple helix partnerships. Copenhagen   Solutions Lab leads the implementation of innovation and smart city development in close   collaboration with knowledge institutions and companies as well as citizens. New intelligent   transportation system solutions, reduced carbon emissions, implementation of sensors that   create real time data and information on current situations in the city and the build-up and   architecture of a new ‘Big Data Digital Infrastructure Platform’ that shares data across public   and private sectors are working focus points within the Lab.    DUBAI - Dubai has a strong top-down, government led approach. In 2014 His Highness Sheikh   Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE, launched a   National Innovation Strategy with a seven-year plan that aims to make the UAE among the most   innovative nations in the world. Innovation strategy focusses on 7 key constituents: Innovative   products and services, knowledge and technology, infrastructure, competitive environment,     54        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |            funding and investment, human capital and research, institutions and regulatory environment. To   support the transformation within government, the UAE has announced the creation of a new   job post – CEO of Innovation – for every government department and has announced multiple   private sector, or zone relevant partnerships or targets such as the Dubai Global Innovation   Centre in partnership with Dutch technology firm Philips for the 3D printing targets.    IRELAND - Historically, Ireland set its ambitions to become the European ICT hub in the late   1990. This received high level backing from the Irish Information Society Commission (ISC),   which was established in 2001. This was an independent advisory body to the Irish Government,   reporting directly to the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister). It drew on high-level representation   from the business community, the social partners, and government itself. The ISC had a key role   in shaping the evolving public policy framework for the Information Society in Ireland. It   contributed to the policy formulation process, monitored progress, and highlighted issues that   needed to be prioritized. The Commission served until the end of 2004.    IRELAND - In 2014, major industry players including General Motors, Johnson & Johnson and   Kerry Group got together with UL, LIT, Limerick City & County Council and IDA Ireland and   formed a unique IT skills partnership ‘Limerick for IT’. Since its establishment, the initiative has   created over 200 high skilled IT jobs and has been acknowledged as a major FDI skills innovation   developer.   Further inspiration can be derived from the private sector71, and from emerging smart cities, which   increasingly look to collaborative governance models 72  to lead the digital transformation. Such   international best practices will be further investigated as to their relevance to Jordan.   Summarizing, the governance for the digital economy requires a collaborative approach, specific approach   to handling data, creation of digital building blocks and platforms, working with acceleration & digital   champions, clear commitment to impact measurement and continuous alignment of policies and programs   based on real-time evidence.                                                                  71 See for instance an overview of central components to manage a successful digital transformation four example companies display - https://www.capgemini-consulting.com/resource-  file-access/resource/pdf/Governance__A_Central_Component_of_Successful_Digital_Transformation.pdf    72 See for instance the BSI Standards Publication (2014) Smart city framework – Guide to establishing strategies for smart cities and communities   https://www.capgemini-consulting.com/resource-file-access/resource/pdf/Governance__A_Central_Component_of_Successful_Digital_Transformation.pdf https://www.capgemini-consulting.com/resource-file-access/resource/pdf/Governance__A_Central_Component_of_Successful_Digital_Transformation.pdf   55        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |            ANNEX 1: DETAILED ACTIONS   The actions are based on Jordan’s key differentiators, strengths and weaknesses, as well as international   experience in terms of how other benchmark countries have set the path for achieving a digital vision.   Under all actions, other actions and responsibilities can be added based on need.         Action 1   Smart Specialization and Growth      Adopting the Digital Economy Framework in Jordan’s   economy    …thus driving the digital economy in Jordan    Create an independent digital economy catapult – a platform for the digital economy in Jordan. It should be established as a network   of specialized centers of excellence with one headquarter/umbrella. Establishing the digital economy catapult puts Jordan among the   frontrunners of the digital economy and allows Jordan to develop relevant digital products and services across leading sectors of   relevance to global digital value chains. Building on the Jordan differentiators of leveraging high-level strategic partnerships, drive   demand-driven digital innovation, creating and integrating solutions for the digital economy, the catapults set out to diffuse and   accelerate digitization across sectors that are lagging behind currently, and where linkages between sectors and the tech sector are   not yet established.      A digital economy catapult will be established with one headquarter and nine catapults in the six leading sectors (Health, Education,   Energy & Cleantech, Transport & logistics, Financial sector, and Communications & security) and three key enablers (Content &   gaming, E-commerce and Professional services). The vertical tech areas (IOT, Cloud Computing, Hardware and Artificial Intelligence)   will be embedded in the relevant catapults. The catapults will be working across the horizontal and vertical emphasis areas and the   digital enablers.      The digital economy catapult HQ will have the following responsibilities:    Provide tech innovation support service to entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs and makers    Develop understanding of value of in-licensing and create support program    Support prototyping and service design, for instance through an innovation fund    Create a disruption program for the existing tech sector which should lead to the immediate development of a pipeline of new products   services targeting the digital economy     Provide advocacy support for digital economy    Initiate cross-sectoral digital economy standards development    Initiate communications campaign & promotion of the digital economy across sectors    Establish an open data center to drive the opening of data and the development of new solutions based on this data.       The nine sector/enabler catapults/launchpads will have the following responsibilities:    Market development & match making (national and international) within the relevant key digital sector/enabler and across the   relevant verticals      Recommended main owner   Government (Cabinet/Economic Policies Council)   https://www.google.dk/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjKtIP4h57PAhXEDpoKHfQYAx8QjRwIBw&url=https://digital.catapult.org.uk/&psig=AFQjCNEr15u-h6F95QuiET2tUVd6IOdiLw&ust=1474464841884675   56        REACH 2025 ACTION PLAN – ROADMAP TO EXCELLENCE     |            Action specified (3-year timeframe)   Immediate actions   Establish Digital Economy Catapult HQ (including a Programme Management   Unit and a Monitoring and Evaluation unit).   The catapult HQ will be tasked to set up nine catapults in the six key sectors   and three enabling sectors.         Pilot one launchpad with good leadership. While multiple sector- and tech   vertical-based catapults should be built, one with good leadership should be   fast-tracked (could be FinTech (CBJ) or Health (Hakeem)).      Subsequent actions   Establish Digital Economy Launchpads in remaining key sectors and enablers.   There is no one Launchpad model fits all sectors; it depends on the   stakeholders and dynamics of each sector in terms of how to drive dialogue   and transformation.

The aims for Jordan are to achieve a strong and open public infrastructure key for developing a strong   digital economy and create a more efficient government as shown by leading countries. Moreover, the actions are responding to the   weakness of government not acting as a competent market and user that can drive digital economy. Strengthening government   innovation will give access to world-class government services, which is a driver for the digital economy companies to grow and/or   settle in Jordan, and it will stimulate eGovernment products and services within existing tech companies to sell/export regionally.   Lastly, it will generate accountability and transparency for FDI into Jordan.

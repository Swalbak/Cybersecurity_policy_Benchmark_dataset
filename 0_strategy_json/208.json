INTRODUCTION 1.1. Reasons for adopting a new Strategy for fight against terrorism The threat of potential terrorist attacks has grown in all countries of the Coalition against Terrorism, including BiH. There is an infrastructure (both legal and institutional) in place but it requires vigilant upgrade and expansion. This issue has not been approached in a synergic and coordinated way for various reasons, for example because laws in force do not suffice or are only partially implemented, while, on the other hand, potential threats have grown and, if negative trends continue, we may soon face a serious security crisis with far fetching consequences. The Strategy for prevention and fight against terrorism (hereinafter: the Strategy) establishes a general framework for Bosnia and Herzegovina's actions in its fight against terrorism and offers guidelines for improving the existing and developing new measures and instruments for the prevention and suppression of terrorism. Protection against terrorism is a state competence, a part of its fundamental function to establish conditions allowing for peaceful and safe life of all its citizens, free from violence and fear, democratic, creative and prosperous, respectful of law and order. Any form of terrorism directed against Bosnia and Herzegovina would be a grave and intolerable threat to the country's fundamental values and interests as it would directly affect security and lives of its citizens. Therefore, Bosnia and Herzegovina's priority is to develop comprehensive measures, national and international, for the prevention of and protection from all forms of terrorism, measures which should produce, along with direct benefits, a strong deterrent effect against any terrorist act targeting Bosnia and Herzegovina. A stable security environment in BiH means also that the country must keep the upper hand in dealing with terrorism and other crimes connected with terrorism, as it is one of the key requirements for BiH’s accession to the EU and NATO. Whether problems in this field will be solved quickly does not hinge on the security situation alone but also on the country’s general progress, especially in the context of the EU and NATO enlargement. The present Strategy is therefore very important for BiH as a means for initiating changes which should provide for a long-term framework of the antiterrorist fight; at the same time, the Strategy is a vehicle for the transfer and application of European antiterrorist standards and regulations into the constitutional and legal system of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This document was drafted on the basis of an analysis of the achievements of the previous Strategy, and as an attempt to answer the following question: ‘Which improvements must be done and activities initiated in order to find an effective solution to the issue of preventing and fighting terrorism in BiH?’ For all the above reasons, this document describes the current situation in the field of prevention and fight against terrorism, considers problems, and suggests objectives to be achieved, starting from the highest relevant institutional level. 5 1.2. National policy BiH’s geostrategic position is that of a country in the Southeast Europe, and, as a rule, its institutions are well aware of potential terrorist threats and pay increasingly more attention to the prevention and suppression of all types of terrorism. In the 2006 Security Strategy, BiH already recognized potential dangers, as illustrated by this stipulation, “In the conduct of its internal policies, subjects of the BiH security system will direct their efforts to the fight against terrorism, organized crime and corruption through the strengthening of control and disciplinary mechanisms. The fight against terrorism will be one of the drivers of interagency cooperation, which will be functionally and institutionally shaped to fit legal and constitutional arrangements and fulfill endorsed international commitments.”1 Through its actions, BiH has reaffirmed its position as an active member of the Antiterrorist Coalition against international terrorism. By the same token, BiH offered to contribute to the efforts on establishing a safe and secure environment in Iraq: a Bosnian contingent, whose soldiers carried out demining and demolition of found or seized UXO, was deployed to Iraq as part of the UN peace mission. Deployment to the peace mission within ISAF is currently under consideration. To the extent of its possibilities, BiH will continue to take part in the efforts of the International Antiterrorist Coalition; BiH has also declared its willingness to join EU activities on the suppression of terrorism, including the harmonization of its legislation and signing and ratification of relevant resolutions and protocols, and the adoption of concrete action plans. In addition, within the framework of the legitimate fight against terrorism, BiH will strive towards respecting individual and collective human rights, which is also an obligation under the BiH Constitution. Consequently, Bosnia and Herzegovina advocates for a quick completion of negotiations on the Comprehensive UN Convention on International Terrorism. In the larger context of fight against terrorism, BiH invests considerable efforts in the prevention of and fight against organized crime and illegal migrations, as confirmed by a number of statements and declarations to which BiH subscribed under regional and international initiatives and, more importantly, by activities of BiH law enforcement agencies. Unfortunately, the media have often linked BiH to terrorism; through its institutional and legislative development and reforms and the active fight against terrorism, locally and globally, BiH has proved its commitment to fighting all types of terrorist activities. The country’s cooperative relations with the US and EU member countries deserve to be quoted as a prominent example of this commitment. Bosnia and Herzegovina will persist in the fight against terrorism, and will focus in particular on the coordination of its national institutions responsible for the fight against terrorism and development of international cooperative instruments, especially with 1 Security Policy, BiH Presidency, February 2006. 6 relation to the US, EU member countries and countries of the region. Also, BiH will need to be more proactive in existing international police organizations. 1.3. EU and NATO partnership and membership as BiH’s security objectives The enlargement of the EU and NATO are the most important international processes for BiH. By the same token, rapprochement and the eventual accession are also among the most important national and security objectives of BiH. BiH shares and fully upholds the values and objectives on which the EU and NATO are based. Since their establishment, these organizations have been instrumental to maintaining peace, stability, social progress, human rights and economic growth. The links between these two organizations and the complementary nature of their mechanisms and procedures in the field of military and political cooperation and security have become more prominent and strong, across the systems. The common European Security and Defence Policy is based on direct cooperation with NATO and does not challenge the autonomy of the countries involved. To BiH, membership in the EU and NATO will provide a unique historical opportunity for safeguarding and strengthening democracy, protecting independence, establishing a fully secure environment, as well as unlimited potentials for economic progress. Geostrategically, BiH is located between the lines of communication with areas whose inherent instability can affect its own stability. This is particularly true with regard to the Southern Mediterranean basin, North Africa, Middle East, and the Caucuses. As a consequence of crises, conflicts, high population growth and the depletion of energy resources, these regions suffer from instability which overspills into Europe, in particular its parts that can be considered weak links, including Bosnia and Herzegovina with its unfavorable economic and security situation, worsened by the transition. Economic uncertainties, corruption, negative demographic changes, reduction in active population, and a high unemployment rate all together create a fertile soil for all kinds of organized crime, money laundering, terrorism and the financing of terrorism. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, nuclear, chemical or biological, generation of refugee crises, ethnic conflicts or violations of human rights are just a small part of the spectrum of developments that the phenomenon of globalization brings along. The international community therefore strives towards creating supranational capabilities to respond to globalization challenges. Terrorism is a global threat and its consequences underline the importance of the principle of indivisible security. After the attacks on the US on September 11th, terrorism became a global challenge, and the International Antiterrorist Coalition led by the US, that is to say international cooperation, is the only appropriate response to this development. For all the above reasons, BiH considers cooperation to be of utmost importance, bilateral and regional, same as its involvement in the work of international organizations such as the UN, OSCE, EC, CoE, WTO, RCC, RACVIAC, MARRI, SECI, DICAF, etc. Bosnia and Herzegovina sees the UN as an international umbrella organization capable of not only catering to the collective security but also of conducting preventive diplomatic actions, peace operations and implementing other peace and security building measures at global level. The OSCE is the staple of the European cooperative security, and its field missions contribute to the propagation of security and highest international standards of democracy. Both organizations together invest efforts in developing the tenets of 7 indivisible security and establishing security coalitions, in particular in the areas where some occurrences must be stopped, such as BiH. BiH’s position, history and regional links, on the one hand, and its integration ambitions and prospects, on the other, point at the country’s weaknesses. The territory of BiH is 51,129 square kilometers, with a 1,551 km-long border, and 89 border crossings; the terrain configuration makes for a great number of potential or ‘crossable’ illegal border crossings, which is an important factor in relation to migrations from the regions that we have identified earlier in this text as BiH’s unstable surroundings. A poorly regulated field of information technology in BiH is a specific destabilizing factor, and at the same time a factor in the potential growth of the economic power of terrorism. The growing trend of intense reliance on information technology, in commercial and private spheres, is accompanied by the growing risk of cyber crime, including the hacking of financial systems and abuse of BiH citizens’ personal information or company information; these crimes are often used as vehicles for financing terrorism and contributing to its economic power. Finally, we should not forget a challenge common to all transition countries, which can also contribute to terrorism: the problem of small calibre arms and light weapons (SALW), which, because of how easily SALW can be smuggled and the permeability of borders, also calls for a coordinated international approach. Clearly, Bosnia and Herzegovina needs a single national action plan. BiH’s constitutional arrangements are complex, including security, but it is necessary to establish a unified plan for the work of all BiH bodies that have relevant competencies or play a role in the prevention of terrorism. The decision was made to make the BiH Strategy for Preventing and Fighting Terrorism that plan. The issuing authority for the Strategy is the Council of Ministers. The Strategy will give to all the responsible and relevant bodies in BiH the task to develop their action or operational plans within their respective fields of expertise. 8 2. GENERAL OBJECTIVES OF THE STRATEGY FOR PREVENTION AND FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM Taking into account the existing security structure, as well as its development in the past period, the present Strategy defines objectives in the prevention of all forms of terrorism and crimes related to it, as well as in the prevention of all their negative effects. 1. To conduct continued activities with the aim of deterring any support to terrorism, terrorist activities or radical movements through public awareness2 activities directed at positive communication; 2. To implement the Strategy in such a way as to prevent violations of fundamental human rights and freedoms guaranteed by international conventions and regulations3; 3. To improve interagency coordination and cooperation and develop capabilities in those institutions or agencies that lack them; 4. To ensure monitoring and supervision of the Strategy’s implementing documents. 2 Disabling indoctrination into radical and negative ideologies, which may lead to terrorist acts as a means to achieve certain goals. 3 In particular the Euroepan Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms which BiH signed, ratified and included in full in its Constitution. 9 3. OVERVIEW OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH BY THE 2006-2009 STRATEGY 1 Legislation Responsible body Deadlines 1.1 Compile draft amendments to the BiH Law on Criminal Procedure and the BiH Criminal Law with the aim of including international instruments and standards (in particular UN and EU standards) in the field of the antiterrorist fight. The BiH Ministry of Security and the BiH Ministry of Justice 6 months from the adoption of the Strategy. A comprehensive analysis of the portion of the BiH Criminal Law pertaining to terrorism was carried out, and it was established that the Law, to a great degree, was in agreement with international instruments and standards but required some corrections, primarily a clearer and more encompassing definition of some provisions and terms; it was also established that BiH needed to begin implementing international instruments and standards to which the country subscribed after 2003. Along those lines, in November 2006, the BiH Ministry of Security agreed with UNDOC and the Council of Europe to initiate the work on Draft Amendments to the BiH Criminal Law, that is to say to the portion of the Law pertaining to terrorism, through the Technical Assistance Programme. Along with domestic experts, OHR, CoE, and UNODC experts also took part in the drafting process. The Law on the Amendments to the BiH Law on Criminal Procedure was adopted on 30 December 2009. The BiH Law on Criminal Procedure – Amendments to the BiH Law on Criminal Procedure - was published in BiH Official Gazette 58/8, and it included the recommendations of the BiH Ministry of Security. 1.2 Compile a Draft Law on the Fight against Terrorism and Financing of Terrorism as lex specialis, in parallel with the activities on the drafting of amendments to the BiH Criminal Law and the BiH Law on Criminal Procedure in item 1.1. The BiH Ministry of Security and the BiH Ministry of Justice 6 months from the adoption of the Strategy. A preliminary analysis of the BiH Criminal Law and talks with OHR, CoE, and UNODC experts led to the joint position that only Amendments to the BiH Criminal Law should be tackled, and that adopting a separate law on terrorism as lex specialis was superfluous. 1.3 Carry out an analysis and draft a proposal of amendments to the Law on State Agencies – OSA, SIPA, SBS (taking into account activities in items 1.1 and 1.2) The BiH Ministry of Security (taking into account the already conducted activities of the OHR Security Sector Reform Working Group) 6 months from the adoption of the Strategy. 10 Article 33 of the Law on the Directorate for Coordination of BiH Police Bodies and on Support Agencies to the BiH Police Structures set forth that the BiH Ministry of Security was responsible for harmonizing all relevant laws. On 27 April 2009, the Parliament adopted the Amendments to the Law on Police Officials of BiH, Official Gazette 27/04, 03/04, 05/06, 333/06, 15/08, 63/08, 35/09, the Law on the BiH Border Police, Official Gazette 59/08, 35/09, the Law on the Sate Investigation and Protection Agency, Official Gazette 27/04, 63/04, 35/05, 49/04. The adoption of these laws and the appointment of the Independent Board will complete the first phase of the police reform in BiH. 1.4. Conduct activities on drafting amendments to laws and adopting new laws and bylaws in the fields that are indirectly linked with the fight against terrorism: the Law on Movement and Stay of Aliens, Law on Witness Protection Programme, Law on the Protection of Classified Information, Law on the Import/Export of Weapons, Law on the Movement of Weapons and Military Equipment and the Law on the Protection of Rescue of People and Material Goods from Natural and Other Disasters in BiH The BiH Ministry of Security as the coordinator of activities. Bodies responsible for the drafting of each individual law are listed on pages 15 and 19, in item 5.1. – Legislation. 6 months from the adoption of the Strategy. The Law on Protection and Rescue of People and Material Property from Natural and Other Disasters in BiH (adopted in 2008); The Law on Movement and Stay of Foreign Nationals and Asylum (Official Gazette 81/08) The Law on Protection of Classified Information (Official Gazette 54/05) The Amendments to the Law on Protection of Classified Information (Official Gazette 12/09) The Law on Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorist Activities (59/09) The Law on Movement of Weapons and Military Equipment (53/09) The Law on Control of Foreign Trade in Goods and Services of Strategic Importance to BiH) (adopted in 2009 - it will replace the Law on Import and Export of Arms and Military Equipment and Control of Import and Export of Dual-Use Items) 1.5 Use bylaws to define the critical infrastructure, set up a plan for its protection, and establish ‘an early warning system’ The BiH Ministry of Security and the State Investigation and Protection Agency 6 months from the adoption of the Strategy. Not implemented 11 2 Institution-building Responsible body Deadline 2.1 Fully man teams and departments for the fight against terrorism The BiH Ministry of Security (coordinator) and all relevant institutions/agencies, SIPA in particular End of 2006 The Antiterrorist Department of the BiH Ministry of Security, the level of manning 50% The Antiterrorist Department of SIPA, the level of manning 100% as of 1 January 2009 The BiH Border Police does not have an element dedicated solely to the fight against terrorism 2.2 Intensify the work of the Antiterrorist Task Force BiH Council of Ministers Now In 2006, 2007 and the first nine months of 2008, the Antiterrorist Task Force met regularly (once a month on average). 2.3 Establish a Central Analysis HQ (with SIPA) and work on the establishment of a central record and connection with relevant INTERPOL databases. State Investigation and Protection Agency with the assistance from the Antiterrorist Task Force. 12 months from the adoption of the Strategy. The Analytical HQ was not established but SIPA has personnel working on the analysis of developments in the fight against terrorism. The Analysis HQ is to be established ad hoc, as the need arises 2.4. Create circumstances for the establishment of joint investigative teams (among all law enforcement bodies) for efficient discovery and prosecution of attempted or committed criminal acts of terrorism. State Investigation and Protection Agency 9 months from the adoption of the Strategy. Circumstances for the establishment of joint investigative teams were not established; as a result, cooperation between law enforcement agencies depends mostly on cooperation agreements signed and the good will of agencies. 12 3 Strategic operability Responsible body Deadlines 3.1 Fully support and intensify the work of the Commission for the citizenship review BiH Council of Ministers Meet the deadlines for the citizenship review The Commission for the citizenship review completed its work pertaining to individuals of African/Asian origin within the given timeframe. 3.2 Adopt a national action plan for combating terrorism. All relevant institutions/agencies should previously develop their own action plans (List of action plans that need to be adopted is given in Appendix 1a) State Investigation and Protection Agency (as the body responsible for coordination of activities and development of the National Action Plan) The deadline for development of action plans by relevant institutions is four months after the adoption of the Strategy. SIPA’s task is to adopt a National Action Plan within two months from the adoption of the Strategy Implementation stage: The State Investigation and Protection Agency adopted its own Action Plan for Combating Terrorism no. 17-02/1-04-1-1154/07, dated 23 January 2007. The Intelligence-Security Agency (OSA) also adopted its own, classified action plan for combating terrorism. 3.3 Control and improve the procedures for registration of residence and address.

Active projects, such as AFIS, SPI, ROS, ISM, are at different stages of implementation. 3.6 Make an assessment of material and technical requirements of all bodies involved in combating terrorism BiH Ministry of Security Six months of the date of adoption of the Strategy State Investigation and Protection Agency is the only agency that submitted the Assessment and the Material and Technical Equipment Plan (no.17-02/1-04-1-1154/06, of 12 January 2007). 3.7. Develop plans of civil- military cooperation (in response to terrorist attacks) BiH Ministry of Security in cooperation with BiH Ministry of Defense Four months of the day of adoption of the Strategy The plan for civil-military cooperation in case of terrorist attacks and elimination of consequences was adopted at the 51st session of the Council of Ministers, held on 3 June 2008. The implementation is in progress and it involves development of an SOP, signing of the memorandum on cooperation between the Ministry of Security and Ministry of Defense, and organization of a training exercise by the end of 2009. 3.8 Strengthen border surveillance, develop a national action plan for border management BiH Ministry of Security, Working Group for Integrated Border Management and BiH State Border Service Six months of the day of adoption of the Strategy In line with the Integrated border management strategy and Action Plan, and the obligation to strengthen the surveillance of the state border, the BiH Border Police signed a number of agreements and protocols with other agencies (for instance, with the BiH ITA). In cooperation with the Republic of Croatia, BiH began with the implementation of the project of joint border patrols. Also, the first joint course was organized for leaders from both border services. As part of the efforts to strengthen surveillance and control of border crossings, a document titled „Preliminary specification of software requirements – IT systems for comprehensive control of persons at border crossings“(a tender for equipment is to be launched during this year) was developed. There are ongoing activities on the establishment of communication links between border crossings. The SPIN communications network has been established and it covers 85% of field offices, 57% of Border Police units and 39% of the busiest border crossings. 14 4 Inter-agency and international cooperation Responsible body Deadline 4.1 Upon providing necessary legal prerequisites, commence with the implementation and establishment of full inter- agency cooperation, particularly in the area of information exchange. BiH Ministry of Security and State Investigation and Protection Agency Two years of the day of adoption of the Strategy Projects for establishment of a communication network for law enforcement agencies have been launched with the purpose of facilitating exchange of information.

ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT SECURITY SITUATION AND TERRORISM THREAT IN AND FROM BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA4 4.1. Terrorism threat assessment in BiH By mid 2009, the security situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina was significantly impacted by some local, regional and global developments in certain aspects of terrorism and extremism, and other violent acts and intolerance. The current situation is similar. The general situation in the above indicated security segments is characterized by relatively steady tendencies with occasional periods of higher intensity or stagnation of certain aspects of the mentioned problems. Generally, it can be concluded that there were no events which resulted in long-term or major deterioration of the security situation in BiH as a whole or in some parts of BiH. Not a single act which could be qualified as international terrorism was perpetrated in BiH by mid 2009.5 There is no evidence to substantiate that BiH is currently used for preparation of execution of such acts, but they are yet not entirely dismissed and this should be always considered as a possibility. Security-related data on certain persons of foreign descent in BiH do not indicate, for time being, any concrete connection between those individuals and international terrorism. However, some indications suggest that they maintain contacts with individuals abroad from the same milieu, and potential use of BiH as a transit country. A certain number of foreigners who had BiH citizenship and are still living in BiH, were stripped of BiH citizenship because, based on previous assessments, it was established that they posed threat to national security; the deportation procedure is ongoing. It is worth mentioning that earlier, when such individuals were stripped of citizenship or while their status was deliberated, this caused various reactions, mainly verbal, but also those that indicated some security challenges. However, in 2009 there were no reactions that may have resulted in any significant security consequences. Except for some instances of individual and group verbal dissatisfaction with the activities of the state agencies related to deportation, and some minor incidents regarding the deportation procedure itself, there has been no information to suggest possible situations that would be of security interest in this context. Up to now, in 2009, there are no data on newly established humanitarian organizations in BiH which abuse their purpose in terms of being transformed and continuing illegal activities under a different form or name. In that context, allegations by some media were continuously checked during the past period, as well as allegations of some ‘experts’, but no confirmation or evidence was found to substantiate their allegations on activities that would be of security interest. Regarding potential internal terrorist acts or terrorist acts against certain national, religious or other groups, not a single terrorist act or another act which would have a direct impact 4 The assessment made by members of the working group of police agencies and OSA. 5 This term is introduced based on Article 5, the Law on OSA, Official Gazette 12/04 From 2005 to today, only one substantiated terrorist act has been committed in BiH, which was qualified as an act international terrorism. In October 2005, OSA and FBiH Ministry of the Interior stopped illegal activities of a terrorist group whose aim was to carry out terrorist attacks in BiH and abroad. The perpetrators were arrested and processed before the BiH Court in Sarajevo. 18 on lives and property of citizens and the state was committed in the course of this year on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, in mid December 2009, BiH Office of the Prosecutor pressed charges against five individuals as co-perpetrators who acted as an organized group in the period November 2007 – November 2009 with the purpose to commit a terrorist attack on the territory of BiH against an identified target i.e. desired targets with an aim to intimidate the community and seriously destabilize the constitutional, political, economic and social establishment. The process against this group is ongoing before BiH Court.6 However, in 2009 and several years earlier, a number of violent acts were registered throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina against certain national, religious or other groups, their property, buildings and symbols, as well as other incidents, which affected interethnic relations and general safety and security of the population (damage to sacral buildings, graves and other monuments of all denominations in BiH, disturbance of law and order on ethnic grounds, activation of explosive ordnance, writing and dissemination of insulting nationalistic graffiti, posters and stickers, sending threatening and radical email and text messages, destruction of state symbols and insignia, etc.). Provocative and destructive behavior of a number of football supporters (mainly younger population) continued in this period. Unlike in the previous period when they caused public disturbances (harassment of citizens, property destruction, verbal conflicts, fights under influence of alcohol, offensive graffiti, etc.), the recent events in Široki Brijeg resulted in a homicide. This caused revolt in BiH citizens and significantly affected safety and security, but also had a negative impact on interethnic relations. Incidents perpetrated by football fans, strongly charged with very negative and even nationalist emotions, but with less severe consequences, were registered in other communities during 2009. This problem is an alarming indicator of the prevailing inclinations and mood among the young population, and the possible extent of ensuing destruction, which may turn into violent acts in more complex situations. Based on available information, it may be said that there is a continuing trend of aggressive and provocative action by some individuals or groups from legally established 6 In August 2006, a bomb was planted under the gravestone of former chair of BiH Presidency Alija Izetbegović. This act was characterized as a terrorist attack. So far, the investigation has proved that the background of this terrorist act could be political, national, or religious or all of the above. A perpetrator or perpetrators have still not been found. In March 2008, a group of individuals was arrested (whose whereabouts were known to the law-enforcement agencies at the time). The group leader was a R.R. from Sarajevo. Authorized BiH agencies found and seized a large quantity of weapons and explosives after searching several apartments in Sarajevo and Bugojno. The BiH Office of the Prosecutor detained those persons for one month, but they were released after a couple of days in detention only because the relevant office of the prosecutor decided that there was no credible evidence to substantiate reasonable suspicion that they had engaged or conspired to commit terrorist acts. Nevertheless, the BiH Office of the Prosecutor continued the investigation and collected evidence based on which the same persons were rearrested at the end of October and beginning of November 2009. They are all currently held in the detention unit of the BiH Court. On 9 October 2008, a bomb was planted and activated in the FIS Vitez shopping center. One person was killed, one sustained severe and several others minor injuries. Three persons were indicted of this act. One person was charged with terrorism under Article 201, BiH Criminal Code, and it is believed that this individual is directly linked with a crime committed in FIS Vitez. The second individual was charged with terrorism and production and possession of explosives which may be linked to terrorist activities and lead to suspicion of potential preparation for a terrorist attack, and the third person was charged with an act of terrorism. The trial is ongoing. 19 organizations, ethnic or religious associations active in BiH. On various occasions in 2009, individuals and groups belonging to those associations and organizations caused incidents by displaying intolerant, provocative and aggressive attitude, varying in form and intensity, towards members of other ethnicities, religions or religious beliefs, creating incidents, perpetrating incidents, and expressing intolerance and hatred, sometimes under the false pretext of their own national and religious interests. All those activities further affected the security situation in parts of BiH where they were committed or in the whole of BiH. They are more or less of the same intensity, characteristics and background as in the previous period. Same or intensified activities of some members of radical religious groups in BiH and the region continued in the previous period. Those activities aim at spreading radical religious ideology and recruiting new followers. Some of them, through intensive religious and ideological activity (mainly verbal), generally deny the constitutional order and rule of law, regulations and laws of any state, including BiH, and democracy and democratic trends, calling for disrespect for the rule of law, democratically elected government, etc. In terms of active display of hatred and creating of incidents, some individuals and groups have been more prominent lately. They belong to legally established organizations and associations with ethnic or religious denominators, active in BiH, whose members or followers display, spread, and incite ethnic and religious hatred and intolerance. This is done mainly verbally, but also through writing and dissemination of offensive nationalistic graffiti, posters and stickers, sending threatening and radical email and text messages, disturbance of law and order and participation in incidents and fights due to disagreement and disapproval of ideas and beliefs of others. The impression may be that the intensity and background of those activities are directly linked to certain “current public developments in the society” (and general negative atmosphere) related to the resolution of problems in BiH (primarily political, but economic and social as well as of lately) and its neighborhood. A relatively new trend in BiH is abuse of cyber technology by extreme radical subjects of security interest (individuals, groups, organizations, associations, etc.). However, there are no reliable indicators as to the extent of problem. There are some indications that cyber technology is used by individuals and groups from this area for purposes which have or may have security implications. The main characteristic of the mentioned structures is that they use cyber technology primarily for their mutual communication, to spread radical ideology, to indoctrinate declared or potential followers, to distribute various materials (such as propaganda and support to global terrorist organizations and movements using chat, web forums and web sites), to collect and exchange data and information (documents, brochures, books, audio and video materials), to raise funds, to woo, recruit, mobilize and train new members, for networking, and connecting cells and members, for planning, coordination and control of activities, and to conduct computer and psychological warfare. By analyzing some web sites, it becomes clear that cyber attacks are no longer sporadic individual activities and that they become increasingly coordinated. In BiH and in the region, the use of modern technology for promotion and spreading of radical beliefs and ideas is a new phenomenon, primarily targeting young people, who are computer literate and most eager Internet users. 20 According to available information, there has been no abuse of the Internet for traditional terrorist purposes or cyber terrorism in BiH so far. According to available information, there are several web sites in Bosnia and Herzegovina which, according to their content, incite or call for intolerance, even hatred. These are mainly web sites hosted outside Bosnia and Herzegovina, in other European countries (Austria, Germany, Norway, etc). It is believed that free Internet distribution of such contents, which openly call to violence and retaliation, considerably motivates consumers of such sites to display intolerance and hatred and to spread negative atmosphere and create an overall negative security and safety situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Additionally, individuals use such web sites to state their verbal support to some global terrorist organizations and movements by broadcasting videos produced by the media outlet supported by Al Qaida. Some videos openly call to violence and retaliation against the coalition troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. In some cases, the Internet was used to incite national intolerance, conflict, to frighten other ethnic and religious groups. 4.2. Assessment of potential terrorist-related threats in BiH The security situation in BiH is still heavily burdened by various problems, which is manifested, inter alia, through nationalism- or religion-driven acts of intolerance, provocations and even violence. A great number of individuals participate in such activities, though at various degrees and with different roles. The total of available information makes us believe that nationalism- and religion-driven acts of violence in various forms will remain a problem that will block BiH’s progress in the future, although the system is trying to eliminate or alleviate it. The security situation in BiH will be crucially affected by the development and outcome of the world economic crisis. With the current negative trend, and especially if the impact of the global economic crisis deepens, it is expected not only that all forms of illegal activities in BiH will persist but that they will be intensified, which will create new negative aspects and further complicate security circumstances. Since the 2009 assessments do not predict changes in the current financial and economic trends, the potential negative impact seems even more likely. If the economic crisis persists and becomes more complicated, all aspects of violent may increase in scope and content. If the economic/social dissatisfaction grows, this may result in various politically motivated negative displays of intolerance towards representatives of other social and political groups, as well as other ethnic and religious groups. In that context, we must not dismiss the possibility of massive rallies with some elements of violent behavior, but also individual illegal violent acts, used by individuals and groups to express their negative views and even the intent to make the economic situation ever worse by jeopardizing lives and property of citizens. We cannot entirely dismiss a situation where announced protest rallies, with different motives and causes, could be used by some individuals or groups of security significance, or other disgruntled persons, who might, wittingly or with no regard for consequences of their actions, independently or encouraged by someone, create some type of threat or apply different forms of violence against current authorities in BiH and the entities, but also the facilities they work or stay in or the assets they use. 21 Based on the current intelligence and information from the previous period, it is estimated that in the future period as well it is possible to expect security incidents and violent acts in a similar or larger volume, inspired by the economic/social situation and other causes, but also acts against returnees, their property, religious facilities and so forth (damaging sacral buildings, tombstones and markings, ethnically-motivated disturbances of public peace and order, activation of explosive devices, offensive nationalistic graffiti, destruction of state symbols, etc.) The economic and social status of individuals may be taken advantage of by some legally established organizations and associations with an ethnic or religious denominator, for the purpose of continued demonstration of intolerance, individually or as a group, towards other ethnicities or religions. Based on the available intelligence, it is estimated that the current course of activity by some individuals or groups from certain legally established organizations and associations with an ethnic or religious denominator, which are active in BiH, will continue in different forms and with varying intensity, as an individual or group demonstration of intolerant, resentful, provocative or aggressive attitude towards other ethnicities, religions and beliefs, or by creating incidents or participating in incidents that reflect intolerance and hatred, sometimes even under the pretext of “protection” of ethnic and religious interests. In doing that, they will continue to use global communication systems as well. Despite the lack of information suggesting that such organizations or individuals are actually preparing large-scale acts of violence or acts with some elements of terrorism, they still cannot be excluded from the mentioned categories, especially in the event of complex internal circumstances. Estimates indicate that the provocative and destructive behavior of some football supporter groups (mostly younger ones) may cause large-scale public disturbances during sport events in the future period, unless the relevant authorities take appropriate legal action and if the society in general, different organizations and civil associations around which this particular population gathers, do more in terms of prevention. Currently available information does not suggest that acts of international terrorism are being prepared in any form in Bosnia and Herzegovina, either targeting BiH or any foreign subject or facility within or outside BiH borders. However, presence of a certain number of foreign nationals of Afro-Asian descent who still reside in our country and who earlier maintained contacts with persons connected with international terrorism, and some of whom still do not have a regulated status in BiH, creates a possibility for them, under certain circumstances and enhanced by their dissatisfaction over their legal status, to reactivate their indicated connections and develop them into an activity of specific security importance, even play a role in a specific operation that may involve assistance or possible participation in acts of terrorism, as an ultimate consequence. Although some illegally obtained weapon caches were located and then found by the relevant authorities, based on bulk information it may be supposed that some amounts of weapon and explosive ordnance are still secretly kept by individuals and groups in BiH. This fact will have a significant negative impact in the context of possible threats to BiH security in the future period. Therefore, realistic assessments suggest that some quantities will continue to end up on foreign black market, but also in the hands of buyers who are contemplating terrorist actions. Available information indicates that the stage of such 22 activities will remain larger than BiH, with an international dimension and elements of organized crime. Abuse of the Internet, as a global communication medium, is becoming a serious security threat, especially in the context of what we call, since 11 September 2001, the fight against terrorism. «Cyber» attacks can be planned as to target the key infrastructure of any country, overload communication systems and cause severe consequences on the security system of the country under attack. The Internet, as a true virtual training camp, is increasingly taking over the role previously played by Al Qaida’s camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan. A growing number of young people resort to individual web page development and advocate creation of autonomous extremist cells and construction of explosive devices made of freely retailed substances, and attempt to independently plan terrorist attacks (e.g. the case Bektašević and alia). In order to successfully counter cyber terrorism, and with the aim of suppressing all forms of abuse of cyber technology for terrorist purposes, based on existing (and global) experiences, it is required to take certain general steps in order to reduce potential risks to a minimum and gradually shrink the available room for possible abuse. 23 5.

INTRODUCTION      1.1. Reasons for adopting a new Strategy for fight against terrorism      The threat of potential terrorist attacks has grown in all countries of the Coalition  against Terrorism, including BiH. There is an infrastructure (both legal and institutional) in  place but it requires vigilant upgrade and expansion. This issue has not been approached in  a synergic and coordinated way for various reasons, for example because laws in force do  not suffice or are only partially implemented, while, on the other hand, potential threats  have grown and, if negative trends continue, we may soon face a serious security crisis  with far fetching consequences.      The Strategy for prevention and fight against terrorism (hereinafter: the Strategy)   establishes a general framework for Bosnia and Herzegovina's actions in its fight against  terrorism and offers guidelines for improving the existing and developing new measures  and instruments for the prevention and suppression of terrorism.      Protection against terrorism is a state competence, a part of its fundamental   function to establish conditions allowing for peaceful and safe life of all its citizens, free  from violence and fear, democratic, creative and prosperous, respectful of law and order.  Any form of terrorism directed against Bosnia and Herzegovina would be a grave and  intolerable threat to the country's fundamental values and interests as it would directly  affect security and lives of its citizens.  Therefore, Bosnia and Herzegovina's priority is to  develop comprehensive measures, national and international, for the prevention of and  protection from all forms of terrorism, measures which should produce, along with direct  benefits, a strong deterrent effect against any terrorist act targeting Bosnia and  Herzegovina.      A stable security environment in BiH means also that the country must keep the   upper hand in dealing with terrorism and other crimes connected with terrorism, as it is one  of the key requirements for BiH’s accession to the EU and NATO. Whether problems in  this field will be solved quickly does not hinge on the security situation alone but also on  the country’s general progress, especially in the context of the EU and NATO enlargement.  The present Strategy is therefore very important for BiH as a means for initiating changes  which should provide for a long-term framework of the antiterrorist fight; at the same time,  the Strategy is a vehicle for the transfer and application of European antiterrorist standards  and regulations into the constitutional and legal system of Bosnia and Herzegovina.      This document was drafted on the basis of an analysis of the achievements of the   previous Strategy, and as an attempt to answer the following question: ‘Which  improvements must be done and activities initiated in order to find an effective solution to  the issue of preventing and fighting terrorism in BiH?’ For all the above reasons, this  document describes the current situation in the field of prevention and fight against  terrorism, considers problems, and suggests objectives to be achieved, starting from the  highest relevant institutional level.           5   1.2. National policy      BiH’s geostrategic position is that of a country in the Southeast Europe, and, as a   rule, its institutions are well aware of potential terrorist threats and pay increasingly more  attention to the prevention and suppression of all types of terrorism.      In the 2006 Security Strategy, BiH already recognized potential dangers, as   illustrated by this stipulation, “In the conduct of its internal policies, subjects of the BiH  security system will direct their efforts to the fight against terrorism, organized crime and  corruption through the strengthening of control and disciplinary mechanisms. The fight  against terrorism will be one of the drivers of interagency cooperation, which will be  functionally and institutionally shaped to fit legal and constitutional arrangements and  fulfill endorsed international commitments.”1       Through its actions, BiH has reaffirmed its position as an active member of the   Antiterrorist Coalition against international terrorism. By the same token, BiH offered to  contribute to the efforts on establishing a safe and secure environment in Iraq: a Bosnian  contingent, whose soldiers carried out demining and demolition of found or seized UXO,  was deployed to Iraq as part of the UN peace mission. Deployment to the peace mission  within ISAF is currently under consideration.      To the extent of its possibilities, BiH will continue to take part in the efforts of the   International Antiterrorist Coalition; BiH has also declared its willingness to join EU  activities on the suppression of terrorism, including the harmonization of its legislation and  signing and ratification of relevant resolutions and protocols, and the adoption of concrete  action plans.      In addition, within the framework of the legitimate fight against terrorism, BiH will   strive towards respecting individual and collective human rights, which is also an  obligation under the BiH Constitution. Consequently, Bosnia and Herzegovina advocates  for a quick completion of negotiations on the Comprehensive UN Convention on  International Terrorism.      In the larger context of fight against terrorism, BiH invests considerable efforts in   the prevention of and fight against organized crime and illegal migrations, as confirmed by  a number of statements and declarations to which BiH subscribed under regional and  international initiatives and, more importantly, by activities of BiH law enforcement  agencies.      Unfortunately, the media have often linked BiH to terrorism; through its   institutional and legislative development and reforms and the active fight against terrorism,  locally and globally, BiH has proved its commitment to fighting all types of terrorist  activities. The country’s cooperative relations with the US and EU member countries  deserve to be quoted as a prominent example of this commitment.      Bosnia and Herzegovina will persist in the fight against terrorism, and will focus in   particular on the coordination of its national institutions responsible for the fight against  terrorism and development of international cooperative instruments, especially with     1 Security Policy, BiH Presidency, February 2006.      6   relation to the US, EU member countries and countries of the region. Also, BiH will need  to be more proactive in existing international police organizations.      1.3. EU and NATO partnership and membership as BiH’s security objectives      The enlargement of the EU and NATO are the most important international  processes for BiH. By the same token, rapprochement and the eventual accession are also  among the most important national and security objectives of BiH. BiH shares and fully  upholds the values and objectives on which the EU and NATO are based. Since their  establishment, these organizations have been instrumental to maintaining peace, stability,  social progress, human rights and economic growth. The links between these two  organizations and the complementary nature of their mechanisms and procedures in the  field of military and political cooperation and security have become more prominent and  strong, across the systems. The common European Security and Defence Policy is based  on direct cooperation with NATO and does not challenge the autonomy of the countries  involved. To BiH, membership in the EU and NATO will provide a unique historical  opportunity for safeguarding and strengthening democracy, protecting independence,  establishing a fully secure environment, as well as unlimited potentials for economic  progress.      Geostrategically, BiH is located between the lines of communication with areas   whose inherent instability can affect its own stability. This is particularly true with regard  to the Southern Mediterranean basin, North Africa, Middle East, and the Caucuses. As a  consequence of crises, conflicts, high population growth and the depletion of energy  resources, these regions suffer from instability which overspills into Europe, in particular  its parts that can be considered weak links, including Bosnia and Herzegovina with its  unfavorable economic and security situation, worsened by the transition. Economic  uncertainties, corruption, negative demographic changes, reduction in active population,  and a high unemployment rate all together create a fertile soil for all kinds of organized  crime, money laundering, terrorism and the financing of terrorism.      The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, nuclear, chemical or biological,   generation of refugee crises, ethnic conflicts or violations of human rights are just a small  part of the spectrum of developments that the phenomenon of globalization brings along.  The international community therefore strives towards creating supranational capabilities  to respond to globalization challenges.      Terrorism is a global threat and its consequences underline the importance of the   principle of indivisible security. After the attacks on the US on September 11th, terrorism  became a global challenge, and the International Antiterrorist Coalition led by the US, that  is to say international cooperation, is the only appropriate response to this development.      For all the above reasons, BiH considers cooperation to be of utmost importance,   bilateral and regional, same as its involvement in the work of international organizations  such as the UN, OSCE, EC, CoE, WTO, RCC, RACVIAC, MARRI, SECI, DICAF, etc.  Bosnia and Herzegovina sees the UN as an international umbrella organization capable of  not only catering to the collective security but also of conducting preventive diplomatic  actions, peace operations and implementing other peace and security building measures at  global level. The OSCE is the staple of the European cooperative security, and its field  missions contribute to the propagation of security and highest international standards of  democracy. Both organizations together invest efforts in developing the tenets of      7   indivisible security and establishing security coalitions, in particular in the areas where  some occurrences must be stopped, such as BiH.       BiH’s position, history and regional links, on the one hand, and its integration   ambitions and prospects, on the other, point at the country’s weaknesses. The territory of  BiH is 51,129 square kilometers, with a 1,551 km-long border, and 89 border crossings;  the terrain configuration makes for a great number of potential or ‘crossable’ illegal border  crossings, which is an important factor in relation to migrations from the regions that we  have identified earlier in this text as BiH’s unstable surroundings.      A poorly regulated field of information technology in BiH is a specific   destabilizing factor, and at the same time a factor in the potential growth of the economic  power of terrorism.  The growing trend of intense reliance on information technology, in  commercial and private spheres, is accompanied by the growing risk of cyber crime,  including the hacking of financial systems and abuse of BiH citizens’ personal information  or company information; these crimes are often used as vehicles for financing terrorism  and contributing to its economic power.      Finally, we should not forget a challenge common to all transition countries, which   can also contribute to terrorism: the problem of small calibre arms and light weapons  (SALW), which, because of how easily SALW can be smuggled and the permeability of  borders, also calls for a coordinated international approach.      Clearly, Bosnia and Herzegovina needs a single national action plan. BiH’s   constitutional arrangements are complex, including security, but it is necessary to establish  a unified plan for the work of all BiH bodies that have relevant competencies or play a role  in the prevention of terrorism. The decision was made to make the BiH Strategy for  Preventing and Fighting Terrorism that plan. The issuing authority for the Strategy is the  Council of Ministers. The Strategy will give to all the responsible and relevant bodies in  BiH the task to develop their action or operational plans within their respective fields of  expertise.                     8   2. GENERAL OBJECTIVES OF THE STRATEGY FOR PREVENTION AND  FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM      Taking into account the existing security structure, as well as its development in the past  period, the present Strategy defines objectives in the prevention of all forms of terrorism  and crimes related to it, as well as in the prevention of all their negative effects.     1. To conduct continued activities with the aim of deterring any support to terrorism,   terrorist activities or radical movements through public awareness2 activities directed at  positive communication;       2. To implement the Strategy in such a way as to prevent violations of fundamental   human rights and freedoms guaranteed by international conventions and regulations3;      3. To improve interagency coordination and cooperation and develop capabilities in those   institutions or agencies that lack them;      4.  To ensure monitoring and supervision of the Strategy’s implementing documents.                              2 Disabling indoctrination into radical and negative ideologies, which may lead to terrorist acts as a means to  achieve certain goals.   3 In particular the Euroepan Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms   which BiH signed, ratified and included in full in its Constitution.         9   3. OVERVIEW OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OBLIGATIONS SET FORTH  BY THE  2006-2009 STRATEGY      1 Legislation  Responsible body  Deadlines   1.1    Compile draft amendments to  the BiH Law on Criminal  Procedure and the BiH Criminal  Law with the aim of including  international instruments and  standards (in particular UN and  EU standards) in the field of the  antiterrorist fight.       The BiH Ministry of  Security and the BiH  Ministry of Justice      6 months from the  adoption of the  Strategy.      A comprehensive analysis of the portion of the BiH Criminal Law pertaining to terrorism was  carried out, and it was established that the Law, to a great degree, was in agreement with  international instruments and standards but required some corrections, primarily a clearer and  more encompassing definition of some provisions and terms; it was also established that BiH  needed to begin implementing international instruments and standards to which the country  subscribed after 2003. Along those lines, in November 2006, the BiH Ministry of Security  agreed with UNDOC and the Council of Europe to initiate the work on Draft Amendments to  the BiH Criminal Law, that is to say to the portion of the Law pertaining to terrorism, through  the Technical Assistance Programme. Along with domestic experts, OHR, CoE, and UNODC  experts also took part in the drafting process. The Law on the Amendments to the BiH Law on  Criminal Procedure was adopted on 30 December 2009.  The BiH Law on Criminal Procedure  – Amendments to the BiH Law on Criminal Procedure - was published in BiH Official Gazette  58/8, and it included the recommendations of the BiH Ministry of Security.       1.2   Compile a Draft Law on the  Fight against Terrorism and  Financing of Terrorism as lex  specialis, in parallel with the  activities on the drafting of  amendments to the BiH  Criminal Law and the BiH Law  on Criminal Procedure in item  1.1.      The BiH Ministry of  Security and the BiH  Ministry of Justice     6 months from the  adoption of the  Strategy.      A preliminary analysis of the BiH Criminal Law and talks with OHR, CoE, and UNODC  experts led to the joint position that only Amendments to the BiH Criminal Law should be  tackled, and that adopting a separate law on terrorism as lex specialis was superfluous.    1.3           Carry out an analysis and draft a   proposal of amendments to the  Law on State Agencies – OSA,  SIPA, SBS (taking into account  activities in items 1.1 and 1.2)      The BiH Ministry of  Security   (taking into account the  already conducted  activities of the OHR  Security Sector Reform  Working Group)      6 months from the  adoption of the  Strategy.      10   Article 33 of the Law on the Directorate for Coordination of BiH Police Bodies and on Support  Agencies to the BiH Police Structures set forth that the BiH Ministry of Security was  responsible for harmonizing all relevant laws. On 27 April 2009, the Parliament adopted the  Amendments to the Law on Police Officials of BiH, Official Gazette 27/04, 03/04, 05/06,  333/06, 15/08, 63/08, 35/09, the Law on the BiH Border Police, Official Gazette 59/08, 35/09,  the Law on the Sate Investigation and Protection Agency, Official Gazette 27/04, 63/04, 35/05,  49/04. The adoption of these laws and the appointment of the Independent Board will complete  the first phase of the police reform in BiH.   1.4. Conduct activities on drafting   amendments to laws and  adopting  new laws and bylaws  in the fields that are indirectly  linked with the fight against  terrorism: the Law on Movement  and Stay of Aliens, Law on  Witness Protection Programme,  Law on the Protection of  Classified Information, Law on  the Import/Export of Weapons,  Law on the Movement of  Weapons and Military  Equipment and the Law on the  Protection of Rescue of People  and Material Goods from Natural  and Other Disasters in BiH        The BiH Ministry of  Security as the  coordinator of activities.  Bodies responsible for  the drafting of each  individual law are listed  on pages 15 and 19, in  item 5.1. – Legislation.      6 months from the  adoption of the  Strategy.       The Law on Protection and Rescue of People and Material Property from Natural and Other  Disasters in BiH (adopted in 2008);   The Law on Movement and Stay of Foreign Nationals and Asylum (Official Gazette 81/08)   The Law on Protection of Classified Information (Official Gazette 54/05)   The Amendments to the Law on Protection of Classified Information (Official Gazette 12/09)   The Law on Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorist Activities (59/09)   The Law on Movement of Weapons and Military Equipment (53/09)   The Law on Control of Foreign Trade in Goods and Services of Strategic Importance to  BiH) (adopted in 2009 -  it will replace the Law on Import and Export of Arms and  Military Equipment and Control of Import and Export of Dual-Use Items)     1.5    Use bylaws to define the critical  infrastructure, set up a plan for  its protection, and establish ‘an  early warning system’          The BiH Ministry of  Security and the State  Investigation and  Protection Agency      6 months from the  adoption of the  Strategy.   Not implemented                       11   2     Institution-building  Responsible body   Deadline    2.1   Fully man teams and  departments for the fight  against terrorism      The BiH Ministry of Security  (coordinator) and all relevant  institutions/agencies, SIPA in  particular      End of 2006    The Antiterrorist Department of the BiH Ministry of Security, the level of manning 50%   The Antiterrorist Department of SIPA, the level of manning 100% as of 1 January 2009   The BiH Border Police does not have an element dedicated solely to the fight against terrorism     2.2 Intensify the work of the   Antiterrorist Task Force   BiH Council of Ministers  Now      In 2006, 2007 and the first nine months of 2008, the Antiterrorist Task Force met regularly  (once a month on average).    2.3                Establish a Central   Analysis HQ (with SIPA)  and work on the  establishment of a central  record and connection with  relevant INTERPOL  databases.

The Analysis HQ is to be established ad hoc, as the  need arises   2.4. Create circumstances for   the establishment of joint  investigative teams (among  all law enforcement bodies)  for efficient discovery and  prosecution of attempted or  committed criminal acts of  terrorism.    State Investigation and  Protection Agency    9 months from the  adoption of the  Strategy.   Circumstances for the establishment of joint investigative teams were not established; as a  result, cooperation between law enforcement agencies depends mostly on cooperation  agreements signed and the good will of agencies.                                12   3 Strategic operability Responsible body Deadlines  3.1    Fully support and intensify  the work of the  Commission for the  citizenship review       BiH Council of Ministers     Meet the deadlines  for the citizenship  review     The Commission for the citizenship review completed its work pertaining to individuals of  African/Asian origin within the given timeframe.     3.2    Adopt a national action  plan for combating  terrorism.

In cooperation  with the Republic of Croatia, BiH began with the implementation of the project of joint border  patrols. Also, the first joint course was organized for leaders from both border services. As part  of the efforts to strengthen surveillance and control of border crossings, a document titled  „Preliminary specification of software requirements – IT systems for comprehensive control of  persons at border crossings“(a tender for equipment is to be launched during this year) was  developed. There are ongoing activities on the establishment of communication links between  border crossings. The SPIN communications network has been established and it covers 85% of  field offices, 57% of Border Police units and 39% of the busiest border crossings.         14     4     Inter-agency and  international cooperation   Responsible body Deadline   4.1 Upon providing necessary  legal prerequisites,  commence with the  implementation and  establishment of full inter- agency cooperation,  particularly in the area of  information exchange.

ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT SECURITY SITUATION AND TERRORISM  THREAT IN AND FROM BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA4        4.1. Terrorism threat assessment in BiH    By mid 2009, the security situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina was significantly impacted  by some local, regional and global developments in certain aspects of terrorism and  extremism, and other violent acts and intolerance.  The current situation is similar.  The  general situation in the above indicated security segments is characterized by relatively  steady tendencies with occasional periods of higher intensity or stagnation of certain  aspects of the mentioned problems. Generally, it can be concluded that there were no  events which resulted in long-term or major deterioration of the security situation in BiH as  a whole or in some parts of BiH.    Not a single act which could be qualified as international terrorism was perpetrated in BiH  by mid 2009.5  There is no evidence to substantiate that BiH is currently used for  preparation of execution of such acts, but they are yet not entirely dismissed and this  should be always considered as a possibility.    Security-related data on certain persons of foreign descent in BiH do not indicate, for time  being, any concrete connection between those individuals and international terrorism.   However, some indications suggest that they maintain contacts with individuals abroad  from the same milieu, and potential use of BiH as a transit country.  A certain number of  foreigners who had BiH citizenship and are still living in BiH, were stripped of BiH  citizenship because, based on previous assessments, it was established that they posed  threat to national security; the deportation procedure is ongoing.  It is worth mentioning  that earlier, when such individuals were stripped of citizenship or while their status was  deliberated, this caused various reactions, mainly verbal, but also those that indicated some  security challenges.  However, in 2009 there were no reactions that may have resulted in  any significant security consequences.  Except for some instances of individual and group  verbal dissatisfaction with the activities of the state agencies related to deportation, and  some minor incidents regarding the deportation procedure itself, there has been no  information to suggest possible situations that would be of security interest in this context.    Up to now, in 2009, there are no data on newly established humanitarian organizations in  BiH which abuse their purpose in terms of being transformed and continuing illegal  activities under a different form or name.  In that context, allegations by some media were  continuously checked during the past period, as well as allegations of some ‘experts’, but  no confirmation or evidence was found to substantiate their allegations on activities that  would be of security interest.    Regarding potential internal terrorist acts or terrorist acts against certain national, religious  or other groups, not a single terrorist act or another act which would have a direct impact     4 The assessment made by members of the working group of police agencies and OSA.  5 This term is introduced based on Article 5, the Law on OSA, Official Gazette 12/04   From 2005 to today, only one substantiated terrorist act has been committed in BiH, which was qualified as  an act international terrorism.  In October 2005, OSA and FBiH Ministry of the Interior stopped illegal  activities of a terrorist group whose aim was to carry out terrorist attacks in BiH and abroad. The perpetrators  were arrested and processed before the BiH Court in Sarajevo.      18   on lives and property of citizens and the state was committed in the course of this year on  the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.  However, in mid December 2009, BiH Office of  the Prosecutor pressed charges against five individuals as co-perpetrators who acted as an  organized group in the period November 2007 – November 2009 with the purpose to  commit a terrorist attack on the territory of BiH against an identified target i.e. desired  targets with an aim to intimidate the community and seriously destabilize the  constitutional, political, economic and social establishment. The process against this group  is ongoing before BiH Court.6     However, in 2009 and several years earlier, a number of violent acts were registered  throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina against certain national, religious or other groups,  their property, buildings and symbols, as well as other incidents, which affected interethnic  relations and general safety and security of the population  (damage to sacral buildings,  graves and other monuments of all denominations in BiH, disturbance of law and order on  ethnic grounds, activation of explosive ordnance, writing and dissemination of insulting  nationalistic graffiti, posters and stickers, sending threatening and radical email and text  messages, destruction of state symbols and insignia, etc.).    Provocative and destructive behavior of a number of football supporters (mainly younger  population) continued in this period.  Unlike in the previous period when they caused  public disturbances (harassment of citizens, property destruction, verbal conflicts, fights  under influence of alcohol, offensive graffiti, etc.), the recent events in Široki Brijeg  resulted in a homicide.  This caused revolt in BiH citizens and significantly affected safety  and security, but also had a negative impact on interethnic relations.  Incidents perpetrated  by football fans, strongly charged with very negative and even nationalist emotions, but  with less severe consequences, were registered in other communities during 2009. This  problem is an alarming indicator of the prevailing inclinations and mood among the young  population, and the possible extent of ensuing destruction, which may turn into violent acts  in more complex situations.     Based on available information, it may be said that there is a continuing trend of aggressive  and provocative action by some individuals or groups from legally established     6 In August 2006, a bomb was planted under the gravestone of former chair of BiH Presidency Alija  Izetbegović. This act was characterized as a terrorist attack.  So far, the investigation has proved that the  background of this terrorist act could be political, national, or religious or all of the above.  A perpetrator or  perpetrators have still not been found.  In March 2008, a group of individuals was arrested (whose whereabouts were known to the law-enforcement  agencies at the time).  The group leader was a R.R. from Sarajevo.  Authorized BiH agencies found and  seized a large quantity of weapons and explosives after searching several apartments in Sarajevo and  Bugojno.  The BiH Office of the Prosecutor detained those persons for one month, but they were released  after a couple of days in detention only because the relevant office of the prosecutor decided that there was  no credible evidence to substantiate reasonable suspicion that they had engaged or conspired to commit  terrorist acts.  Nevertheless, the BiH Office of the Prosecutor continued the investigation and collected  evidence based on which the same persons were rearrested at the end of October and beginning of November  2009.  They are all currently held in the detention unit of the BiH Court.  On 9 October 2008, a bomb was planted and activated in the FIS Vitez shopping center.  One person was  killed, one sustained severe and several others minor injuries.  Three persons were indicted of this act.  One  person was charged with terrorism under Article 201, BiH Criminal Code, and it is believed that this  individual is directly linked with a crime committed in FIS Vitez.  The second individual was charged with  terrorism and production and possession of explosives which may be linked to terrorist activities and lead to  suspicion of potential preparation for a terrorist attack, and the third person was charged with an act of  terrorism.  The trial is ongoing.           19   organizations, ethnic or religious associations active in BiH. On various occasions in 2009,  individuals and groups belonging to those associations and organizations caused incidents  by displaying intolerant, provocative and aggressive attitude, varying in form and intensity,  towards members of other ethnicities, religions or religious beliefs, creating incidents,  perpetrating incidents, and expressing intolerance and hatred, sometimes under the false  pretext of their own national and religious interests.  All those activities further affected the  security situation in parts of BiH where they were committed or in the whole of BiH.  They  are more or less of the same intensity, characteristics and background as in the previous  period.    Same or intensified activities of some members of radical religious groups in BiH and the  region continued in the previous period. Those activities aim at spreading radical religious  ideology and recruiting new followers.  Some of them, through intensive religious and  ideological activity (mainly verbal), generally deny the constitutional order and rule of law,  regulations and laws of any state, including BiH, and democracy and democratic trends,  calling for disrespect for the rule of law, democratically elected government, etc.     In terms of active display of hatred and creating of incidents, some individuals and groups  have been more prominent lately.  They belong to legally established organizations and  associations with ethnic or religious denominators, active in BiH, whose members or  followers display, spread, and incite ethnic and religious hatred and intolerance.  This is  done mainly verbally, but also through writing and dissemination of offensive nationalistic  graffiti, posters and stickers, sending threatening and radical email and text messages,  disturbance of law and order and participation in incidents and fights due to disagreement  and disapproval of ideas and beliefs of others.     The impression may be that the intensity and background of those activities are directly  linked to certain “current public developments in the society” (and general negative  atmosphere) related to the resolution of problems in BiH (primarily political, but economic  and social as well as of lately) and its neighborhood.    A relatively new trend in BiH is abuse of cyber technology by extreme radical subjects of  security interest (individuals, groups, organizations, associations, etc.).  However, there are  no reliable indicators as to the extent of problem.  There are some indications that cyber  technology is used by individuals and groups from this area for purposes which have or  may have security implications.     The main characteristic of the mentioned structures is that they use cyber technology  primarily for their mutual communication, to spread radical ideology, to indoctrinate  declared or potential followers, to distribute various materials (such as propaganda and  support to global terrorist organizations and movements using chat, web forums and web  sites), to collect and exchange data and information (documents, brochures, books, audio  and video materials), to raise funds, to woo, recruit, mobilize and train new members, for  networking, and connecting cells and members, for planning, coordination and control of  activities, and to conduct computer and psychological warfare.     By analyzing some web sites, it becomes clear that cyber attacks are no longer sporadic  individual activities and that they become increasingly coordinated.  In BiH and in the  region, the use of modern technology for promotion and spreading of radical beliefs and  ideas is a new phenomenon, primarily targeting young people, who are computer literate  and most eager Internet users.       20   According to available information, there has been no abuse of the Internet for traditional  terrorist purposes or cyber terrorism in BiH so far.    According to available information, there are several web sites in Bosnia and Herzegovina  which, according to their content, incite or call for intolerance, even hatred.   These are  mainly web sites hosted outside Bosnia and Herzegovina, in other European countries  (Austria, Germany, Norway, etc).   It is believed that free Internet distribution of such  contents, which openly call to violence and retaliation, considerably motivates consumers  of such sites to display intolerance and hatred and to spread negative atmosphere and  create an overall negative security and safety situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.    Additionally, individuals use such web sites to state their verbal support to some global  terrorist organizations and movements by broadcasting videos produced by the media  outlet supported by Al Qaida.  Some videos openly call to violence and retaliation against  the coalition troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.  In some cases, the Internet was used to incite  national intolerance, conflict, to frighten other ethnic and religious groups.      4.2. Assessment of potential terrorist-related threats in BiH     The security situation in BiH is still heavily burdened by various problems, which is  manifested, inter alia, through nationalism- or religion-driven acts of intolerance,  provocations and even violence. A great number of individuals participate in such  activities, though at various degrees and with different roles.  The total of available  information makes us believe that nationalism- and religion-driven acts of violence in  various forms will remain a problem that will block BiH’s progress in the future, although  the system is trying to eliminate or alleviate it.     The security situation in BiH will be crucially affected by the development and outcome of  the world economic crisis.  With the current negative trend, and especially if the impact of  the global economic crisis deepens, it is expected not only that all forms of illegal activities  in BiH will persist but that they will be intensified, which will create new negative aspects  and further complicate security circumstances.  Since the 2009 assessments do not predict  changes in the current financial and economic trends, the potential negative impact seems  even more likely.     If the economic crisis persists and becomes more complicated, all aspects of violent may  increase in scope and content. If the economic/social dissatisfaction grows, this may result  in various politically motivated negative displays of intolerance towards representatives of  other social and political groups, as well as other ethnic and religious groups.  In that  context, we must not dismiss the possibility of massive rallies with some elements of  violent behavior, but also individual illegal violent acts, used by individuals and groups to  express their negative views and even the intent to make the economic situation ever worse  by jeopardizing lives and property of citizens.     We cannot entirely dismiss a situation where announced protest rallies, with different  motives and causes, could be used by some individuals or groups of security significance,  or other disgruntled persons, who might, wittingly or with no regard for consequences of  their actions, independently or encouraged by someone, create some type of threat or apply  different forms of violence against current authorities in BiH and the entities, but also the  facilities they work or stay in or the assets they use.        21   Based on the current intelligence and information from the previous period, it is estimated  that in the future period as well it is possible to expect security incidents and violent acts in  a similar or larger volume, inspired by the economic/social situation and other causes, but  also acts against returnees, their property, religious facilities and so forth (damaging sacral  buildings, tombstones and markings, ethnically-motivated disturbances of public peace and  order, activation of explosive devices, offensive nationalistic graffiti, destruction of state  symbols, etc.)     The economic and social status of individuals may be taken advantage of by some legally  established organizations and associations with an ethnic or religious denominator, for the  purpose of continued demonstration of intolerance, individually or as a group, towards  other ethnicities or religions.    Based on the available intelligence, it is estimated that the current course of activity by  some individuals or groups from certain legally established organizations and associations  with an ethnic or religious denominator, which are active in BiH, will continue in different  forms and with varying intensity, as an individual or group demonstration of intolerant,  resentful, provocative or aggressive attitude towards other ethnicities, religions and beliefs,  or by creating incidents or participating in incidents that reflect intolerance and hatred,  sometimes even under the pretext of “protection” of ethnic and religious interests.  In  doing that, they will continue to use global communication systems as well.  Despite the  lack of information suggesting that such organizations or individuals are actually preparing  large-scale acts of violence or acts with some elements of terrorism, they still cannot be  excluded from the mentioned categories, especially in the event of complex internal  circumstances.    Estimates indicate that the provocative and destructive behavior of some football supporter  groups (mostly younger ones) may cause large-scale public disturbances during sport  events in the future period, unless the relevant authorities take appropriate legal action and  if the society in general, different organizations and civil associations around which this  particular population gathers, do more in terms of prevention.    Currently available information does not suggest that acts of international terrorism are  being prepared in any form in Bosnia and Herzegovina, either targeting BiH or any foreign  subject or facility within or outside BiH borders.  However, presence of a certain number  of foreign nationals of Afro-Asian descent who still reside in our country and who earlier  maintained contacts with persons connected with international terrorism, and some of  whom still do not have a regulated status in BiH, creates a possibility for them, under  certain circumstances and enhanced by their dissatisfaction over their legal status, to  reactivate their indicated connections and develop them into an activity of specific security  importance, even play a role in a specific operation that may involve assistance or possible  participation in acts of terrorism, as an ultimate consequence.    Although some illegally obtained weapon caches were located and then found by the  relevant authorities, based on bulk information it may be supposed that some amounts of  weapon and explosive ordnance are still secretly kept by individuals and groups in BiH.  This fact will have a significant negative impact in the context of possible threats to BiH  security in the future period.  Therefore, realistic assessments suggest that some quantities  will continue to end up on foreign black market, but also in the hands of buyers who are  contemplating terrorist actions. Available information indicates that the stage of such      22   activities will remain larger than BiH, with an international dimension and elements of  organized crime.    Abuse of the Internet, as a global communication medium, is becoming a serious security  threat, especially in the context of what we call, since 11 September 2001, the fight against  terrorism.     «Cyber» attacks can be planned as to target the key infrastructure of any country, overload  communication systems and cause severe consequences on the security system of the  country under attack.    The Internet, as a true virtual training camp, is increasingly taking over the role previously  played by Al Qaida’s camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan. A growing number of young  people resort to individual web page development and advocate creation of autonomous  extremist cells and construction of explosive devices made of freely retailed substances,  and attempt to independently plan terrorist attacks (e.g. the case Bektašević and alia).    In order to successfully counter cyber terrorism, and with the aim of suppressing all forms  of abuse of cyber technology for terrorist purposes, based on existing (and global)  experiences, it is required to take certain general steps in order to reduce potential risks to a  minimum and gradually shrink the available room for possible abuse.                                                                   23   5.  MAIN PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS     5.1. Problems    1. Due to a large number of institutional and legislative frameworks, there is a distinct   problem with surveillance coordination and oversight. A problem caused by the  diversity and discord between some legislative arrangements has also been  identified;     2. Another problem observed (and analysis proved it to be a consequence of the   previous problem) is delayed exchange of information such as fresh intelligence,  experience, good practice, new forms of crime associated with terrorism and even  specific situations connected with terrorist activities;     3. Inadequate education in the areas of counterterrorism and a low rate of specialized  training;     4. Inadequate single analytic approach to the fight against terrorism;     5. Absence of clearly defined political objectives by the National Security Council  and the Joint Committee for Defense and Security of the BiH Parliamentary  Assembly, authorities responsible to lay down the fundamental political platform  with a definition of future political challenges and clearly formulated objectives;     6.

Establishment of teams to handle terrorism-related cases in a manner that the State   Investigation and Protection Agency leads teams based on the local jurisdiction  over the crime in question;     8. Strengthening the crime detecting/intelligence capabilities of the relevant agencies   in BiH in response to any type of terrorist threat; in that context, appropriate human  resources need to be ensured in order to enhance the existing counterterrorist  capabilities.     9.   Continuous adjustment of the domestic legislation to the requirements of modern   counterterrorism in accordance with the international instruments in the fight  against terrorism and its prevention;     10.

BASIS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF ACTION PLANS OF INSTITUTIONS AND  AGENCIES    6.1. Problem definition     For proper articulation of objectives, it is required to first identify the problems and  obstacles within the purview of the institution/agency in question in prevention and fight  against terrorism, whereas the general objectives will be derived from the Strategy.     6.2. Articulation of objectives and tasks     The objectives need to be articulated as to be realistically achievable within the validity  period of the Strategy.      6.3. Deadlines and task assignment     Specific objectives and tasks are to be assigned to specific personnel or entire departments  and realistic deadlines are to be set.     6.4. Success measuring     Success indicators are to be set for each task (implemented, established, executed,  realized).      7. PLANNED STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION DYNAMIC     7.1. Validity period of the Strategy     The Strategy is valid for a period of three (3) years (2009 - 2012). Since the Strategy  and the Action Plan for prevention of money laundering and financing of terrorist activities  in BiH were adopted for the period 2009-2013, it would be required to extend the Strategy  validity period to another year.   Given the ever-present threat of terrorist attacks, all relevant institutions and agencies  are invited to undertake appropriate measures and activities without further delay.     7.2. Deadlines for issuance of Action Plans      The deadline for issuance of action plans for institutions/agencies is six (6) months  from the date of the adoption of the Strategy.  Each institution shall appoint a responsible person - the leader of the activities from the  finalized Action Plan.                           27   8. BODIES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STRATEGY    8.1. Supervisory body for the implementation of the Strategy    The Ministry of Security of Bosnia and Herzegovina and all other institutions will be  responsible for the implementation of the Strategy. At the proposal of the BiH Ministry of  Security, a supervisory body for the implementation of the Strategy and Action Plans of  the institutions and agencies, envisaged by the Strategy, will be formed within three  months after the adoption of the Strategy. This body will be appointed by the decision of  the BiH Council of Ministers and will comprise representatives of the BiH Ministry of  Security, SIPA, BiH Border Police, RS Ministry of Internal Affairs, Federation Ministry of  Internal Affairs, Brčko District Police. The supervisory body shall report on the  implementation of the Strategy and Action Plans to the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and  Herzegovina. The Body shall adopt its book of rules, while other rights and duties will be a  subject of a special regulation.     8.2.

Reaffirming its unequivocal condemnation of the 9/11 terrorist attack   on the USA, the UN Security Council, on 28 September 2001, unanimously adopted a  comprehensive resolution with strategies to combat international terrorism. By  Resolution 1373 the Council also established a Committee of the Council to monitor  the resolution’s implementation.  Under the terms of the text, the Council decided that  all States should take measures in prevention of terrorism, such as freezing funds of  persons who commit, or attempt to commit terrorist acts, or participate in or facilitate  the commission of terrorist acts. The Council decided that states should ensure that  terrorist acts are established as serious criminal offences in domestic laws and  regulations and that the seriousness of such acts is duly reflected in sentences served.  States were also called on to exchange information in prevention of terrorist attacks,     17 BiH Official Gazette, no. 50/04.  18 BiH official Gazette, no. 59/08, 35/09.  19 BiH Official Gazette, no. 55/08.  20 BiH Official Gazette, no. 50/08.  21 BiH Official Gazette, no. 53/09.  22 BiH Official Gazette, no. 53/09.      29   become parties to the relevant anti-terrorist conventions and ensure that the refugee and  asylum status is not abused by terrorists.      • R-1390 (2002).

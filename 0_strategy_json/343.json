Boasting a highly connected population, buoyed by sustained growth in its digital economy, France draws on talents and strengths on the cutting edge of European and global innovation. Yet, the digital universe is also a locale for competition and confrontation. Cyberspace has become a new domain for unfair competition and espionage, disinformation and propaganda, terrorism and criminality. The ‘Actions to promote the digital Republic’ planned by the French government are intended to promote our values, our economy and protect our citizens. By reinforcing digital security, we favour the development of a cyberspace that provides a sustainable source of growth and opportunities for French companies, thus asserting our democratic values and safeguarding our citizens’ digital lives and personal data. I have high ambitions in this regard. The national digital security strategy must be founded, in particular, on training and international cooperation. It must be supported by the entire national community: the government and the public sector at national and local levels, businesses, and, more broadly, all our countrymen. This is each and all of us’ concern. Meeting the security challenges of the digital world is a key to our collective success. I hope that this national digital security strategy will launch a new dynamic that will simultaneously provide better protection and unfetter our energies. Manuel Valls Prime minister Courtesy translation. Foreword from Manuel Valls, Prime Minister of France, French national digital security strategy FRENCH NatioNal digital sECuRity stRatEgy The digitalisation of French society is accelerating, with relentless growth in digital services, products and jobs. This has become a national issue. The digital transition favours innovation and growth, yet it simultaneously carries risks for the State, economic stakeholders and citizens. Cybercrime, espionage, propaganda, sabotage and excessive exploitation of personal data threaten digital trust and security, thus calling for a collective, coordinated response based on five strategic objectives. 3 # Fundamental interests, defence and security of State information systems and critical infrastruc- tures, major cybersecurity crisis. By developing autonomous strategic thinking, sup- ported by world-class technical expertise, France will ensure the ongoing defence of its fundamental inte- rests in cyberspace. In parallel, France will continue to reinforce the security of its critical networks and its resilience in case of a major cyberattack by expanding cooperation with private stakeholders at national and international levels. # Digital trust, privacy, personal data, cybermale- volence. For cyberspace to remain safe for businesses of all sizes and for individuals, protective measures and remedial actions will be adopted. Protection will be based on public authorities’ heightened vigilance regar- ding the use of personal data and the development of a range of digital security products tailored to the gene- ral public. Remedial actions will be structured around aid to victims of cybermalevolence, providing technical and legal assistance. # Awareness raising, initial training, continuing education. Individuals still lack sufficient awareness of the risks associated with the digitalisation of society. This is why steps will be taken to raise the awareness of school- children and students. In addition, to meet increasing demands from the public and private sector regarding cybersecurity, training of experts in this domain will be enhanced. # Environment of digital technology businesses, industrial policy, export and internationalisation. The growth of digital markets worldwide, together with the associated security imperatives, constitutes an opportunity to differentiate French digital products and services that have a security level adapted to their uses. By supporting investment, innovation and exports, but also via public procurement, the State will develop a favourable environment for French companies in the digital sector offering secure products and services. # Europe, digital strategic autonomy, cyberspace stability. The regulation of international relations in cybers- pace has become a major issue. France, along with like- minded Member States, will promote a road map for European digital strategic autonomy. France will also fortify its influence in international bodies and provi- de support to the least-protected countries, with their consent, to build their cybersecurity capabilities, the- reby contributing to the overall stability of cyberspace. Digital security underpins the digital Republic project. In this regard, the State plays a major role in elaborating this strategy and in launching a dy- namic that must now be maintained by digital-sec- tor professionals, public and private decision-ma- kers and citizens. iNdEX iNtRoduCtioN Page 7 objECtivE 1 Fundamental interests, defence and security of State information systems and critical infrastructures, major cybersecurity crisis.

Page 37 7 French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — iNtRoduCtioN iNtRoduCtioN France is going through its digital transition. Networks are omnipresent in the functioning of the State, economic activity and the daily lives of citizens. Digital technology engenders new uses, new products and new services and is therefore a factor of innovation. It leads to transformation in most trades. It transforms sectors of activity and bu- sinesses giving them more flexibility and competi- tiveness. Boosted by digital support, these sectors are simultaneously more exposed to digital threats. Doing without digital technology or the lack of access to it results in a form of economic and social exclusion. Similarly, the sovereignty of a State that does not have the autonomy required in the digital sector would be threatened. For digital technology to remain an area of freedom, exchanges and growth, trust and security must be established and defended. Only through a collaborative and coordinated effort can this objec- tive be attained. * * * An initial cybersecurity strategy was developed in France in early 2010 and was published in early 2011 shortly after the discovery of a cyberattack, the inten- tion of which was to spy on the economic and finance ministries. The attackers, who had been acting for se- veral months, had taken control of the core of one of the ministerial networks and were regularly collecting political, economic and financial information. This type of cyberattack targets many French bu- sinesses of all sizes in all sectors of activity. Businesses are also the target of all types of fraud such as malware infection that makes the business’ files unusable until a ransom is paid by means that are difficult to trace. In parallel, computer system intrusions aimed at stealing personal information (identity, identification data on commercial websites and bank details) are on the rise. Most of the times, it concerns criminals com- mitting crimes that are identical to those known in the material world such as theft, fraud and blackmail, but in an industrialised manner, with less risk of being identified and prosecuted. Organised crime has seized the opportunity provided by electronic communication networks. Their technical capabilities are increasing to the point where they are now capable of carrying out acts of sabotage or taking production tools hostage, for themselves or through subcontracting by hybridisation. Harassment campaigns are developing on social networks, such as cases of fraud victimisation where- by gullible subjects are persuaded to transfer money abroad. The defacement of many websites, notably those be- longing to territorial authorities, following the attacks of January 2015 and the cyberattack a few weeks later on a French international media have demonstrated the intention and ability of organised groups to cripple in- formation system resources that support our daily lives. What was recognised as «the state of threat» esta- blished in 2010, therefore turned out to be accurate. At present, the threat is intensified by the increase in the capabilities of attackers, the proliferation of techniques 8 French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — iNtRoduCtioN of attack and the development of organised crime in cyberspace. But another type of challenge has arisen; that posed by the appropriation of digital wealth by a business oligopoly using their dominant position to interfere with the arrival of new businesses and to harness the added value of this budding economy, which will ex- ploit data intended to invent new services, improve our daily lives or make public services more accessible. At the forefront of these data is our personal data; inclu- ding those related to our privacy. Control of this mass of data opens the way to economic destabilisation and to sophisticated forms of propaganda or ways to mislead people’s judgments and habits. In this respect, this threat is a matter for national defence and security, because of its national extent and strategic issues. * * * In light of these risks, which unfortunately are already established, much has already been accompli- shed. As was announced in the 2008 French White Paper on Defence and National Security, a national agency was created as of 2009 to address cyberattacks and to protect the State information systems and critical in- frastructures. An industrial policy in favour of the national cyber- security industry is notably supported by the future investments programme and in the framework of the «Future industry» plan. In 2013 the French Parliament voted for the mea- sures recommended by the Government aimed at rein- forcing the cybersecurity of operators of vital impor- tance and of those who participate in their most critical information systems. France’s positions are supported within all inter- national bodies, and notably the United Nations (UN) which acknowledged the application of international law to cyberspace in 2013. In addition, bilateral opera- tional relations with several countries have been ini- tiated by the State’s services. The ministries have become aware of the political and technical impact of information technologies on their missions and administration activity and are be- coming equipped with coordinators in charge of digital issues and the security aspects thereof. A State Infor- mation Systems Security Policy was developed and is progressively being implemented. In the coming years it should be possible to reap the benefits of the measures taken and to extend the scope of public action and stakeholders. It must now be acknowledged and made known that the defence and security of digital technology depends on the national community and not only on the action of the State. * * * Up until the past few years, our defence and natio- nal security depended on the expertise, behaviour and decisions of men and women with access to the most sophisticated, protected and secret installations and equipment. But with the emergence of a society that is massively connected, this responsibility is now par- tially shared by all French people. One connected ob- ject or one service that is inadequately secured by its developers, negligence by one information systems’ se- curity decision-maker, dangerous behaviour by one ser- vice provider or by one employee who carelessly mixes private life and professional life can lead to losses in availability, confidentiality or integrity of essential in- formation, suspensions in activity and economic losses, industrial accidents and losses of human lives or eco- logical catastrophes and disturbances in public order, capable of affecting the life of the entire nation. In fact, never has the stability of our future, sup- ported by digital technology, been so dependent on each person’s responsibilities and on the collective res- ponsibilities of three communities of stakeholders. The first community is responsible for recommen- ding and implementing technologies, products and ser- vices equipped with the level of security that is adap- 9 French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — iNtRoduCtioN ted to the uses and capable of mitigating the identified risks. The main stakeholders in this community are researchers, product and service inventors and integra- tors, cybersecurity businesses, electronic communica- tions network operators, internet service providers and remote data processing services. The second community is responsible for protecting the nation from digital pirates. Besides the implemen- tation of cybersecurity policies, an aggressive policy to develop the required technical competences should be adopted, and an environment of trust should be esta- blished that supports the society’s digital transforma- tion by defending citizens, our values and our interests in cyberspace. This responsibility obliges the bearer to express his position in favour of qualified security solu- tions and to promote national industry, also in relation to export. This community consists of elected officials, the Government, central and territorial administra- tions and trade unions. The third community is responsible for using the available services and technologies in a well thought- out manner, making rational choices and avoiding high-risk behaviours in actions related to digital life. This community consists of all users, companies’ mana- gers, participants in civil society and citizens. These are synallagmatic commitments made by each stakeholder that enable France to fully benefit from the contributions of digital technology, transform the choices related to digital security into national com- petitive advantages – which are often currently expe- rienced as an economic and behavioural constraint – and to promote our values, products and services. The role of the State in cyberspace is to ensure France’s freedom of expression and action as well as the security of its critical infrastructures in case of a major cyberattack (objective 1), to protect the digital lives of citizens and businesses and combat cybercriminality (objective 2), to ensure the education and training re- quired for digital security (objective 3), to contribute to the development of an environment that is conducive to trust in digital technology (objective 4) and to promote cooperation between Member States of the European Union (EU) in a manner favourable to the emergence of a European digital strategic autonomy, a long-term guarantor of a cyberspace that is more secure and res- pectful of our values (objective 5). FIVE STRATEGIC objECtivEs 1 FUNDAMENTAL INTERESTS, DEFENCE AND SECURITY OF STATE INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES, MAJOR CYBERSECURITY CRISIS 14 French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 1 STAKES France is the target of cyberattacks that da- mage its fundamental interests. Today, when an attacker targets the State, operators of vital importance or strategic bu- sinesses, the aim is for long-term installation in the information system in order to steal confidential data (political, diplomatic, military, technological, economic, financial or commercial). In the future, an attacker could take control of connected objects, remotely interrupt an industrial activity or destroy its target. Since 2011, about one hundred major cy- berattacks have been addressed, most often in com- plete confidentiality, by competent administrations and service providers. In parallel, the positions taken by France on the international scene, its military operations and cer- tain public debates are followed by cyberattacks aimed at marking public opinion. For example, the defacement of many websites after the terro- rist attacks that targeted France in the beginning of 2015 had a technically low but symbolically high impact desired by the attackers. Similarly, the cy- berattack that led to the interruption of an inter- national French media was also aimed at making a strong impression and contributes to the radica- lisation that leads to terrorist acts. This attack also demonstrated the capacity of attackers determined to disrupt the functioning of a highly symbolic in- frastructure. For several years now many States have imple- mented their political will and considerable hu- man, technical and financial means to carry out large-scale cyberspace operations against us. Whether they are known through publicly dis- closed documents or revealed during the treatment of cyberattacks, the excesses of such practices harm the credibility of some of these States on the inter- national scene and destroy the trust that would be naturally attributed to their businesses’ digital pro- ducts and services. Therefore, the cyber risk, which was placed in third position for major threats to France by the 2013 White Paper on Defence and National Security, is now reinforced and constitutes a major challenge facing France. OBJECTIVE France will ensure the defence of its fundamen- tal interests in cyberspace. It will reinforce the digi- tal security of its critical infrastructures and do its utmost to ensure that of its essential operators to the economy. ORIENTATIONS > Having the scientific, technical and industrial capabilities required to protect sovereign informa- tion, ensure cybersecurity and develop a trustwor- thy digital economy. An Expert Panel for Digital Trust will be created, under the aegis of the State Secretariat for Digital Technology and the National Authority for the Secu- rity of Information Systems. The Expert Panel for Digital Trust will very regu- larly unite the competent administrations of the Prime Minister, the Ministries of National Education, Higher Education and Research, Justice, Defence, Social Af- fairs, Health and Women’s Rights, Economy, Industry, and Digital Technology and the Ministry of the Inte- rior, the General Commission for Investment, the Na- tional Research Agency and the research organisations concerned. The panel can include stakeholders from the « the excesses of such practices harm the credibility of some of these States on the international scene and destroy the trust that would be naturally attributed to their businesses’ digital products and services. » 15 French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 1 private sector and qualified key figures in their work. The mission of this panel will notably be to identify the key technologies for which in-depth knowledge is required for cybersecurity professions and in general for the development of a trustworthy digital environ- ment. It will evaluate the initial and continuing edu- cation needs, will monitor Research and support its de- velopment, participate in improving support for young PhD holders. In the field of digital technologies, it will contribute to setting the strategic goals of systems for financing and supporting research and industrial deve- lopment. This work will be implemented in consistence with that of the structures that have already been es- tablished such as the French Security Industries Sector Association (CoFIS). In general, the choice of major private stakehol- ders in terms of economic or technological model, which are sometimes external to any normalisation framework, or simply certain innovations in digital uses, can consolidate trust or incite mistrust. The Ex- pert Panel for Digital Trust will organise technological and economic monitoring through which evolutions of digital related issues can be anticipated. If necessary, adapted measures will be recommended to support or supervise these changes. These measures could, for exa- mple, concern the protection of the Nation’s scientific and technical potential or the control of foreign invest- ments in critical national businesses. The ministerial coordinators for cyberspace issues in collaboration with the General Secretary of Defence and National Security will come together in an Expert Panel Commission for the subjects that fall within its competence. This Expert Panel will also give an annual report to the Prime Minister on its activities. > Ensuring active monitoring of the security of technologies and uses for the State, businesses and citizens. In anticipation of major technological develop- ments, such as the 5th generation of mobile telecommu- nications (5G) or «software-defined networks», France will remain attentive to the type and capabilities of equipment and software installed within these electro- nic communication networks, to protect the privacy of correspondences, that of its citizens and the resilience of these infrastructures, and will continue to adapt its regulatory framework to new emerging technologies. The National Authority on Information Systems Se- curity will regularly inform the ministries, businesses, territorial authorities and citizens, by means adapted to the target community, of factors that might present a danger in terms of digital use. These information will have been consolidated beforehand with the competent administrations. > Accelerating the reinforcement of State Informa- tion Systems Security. Since 2010, several measures have been taken to raise the level of security of State information systems. A State Information Systems Security Policy (PSSIE) was developed, an inter-ministerial electronic commu- nications network is in rapid growth and the roll-out of secured mobile terminals has been initiated. These measures, like those aimed at producing the security equipment to protect sovereign information, mobilise human and budgetary resources. They will be pursued in order to provide to the Government and our military capabilities with the level of security adapted to long- term preservation of France’s autonomy in making de- cisions and taking action. The application of the State Information Systems Security Policy and the effectiveness of the measures adopted will be evaluated annually. An annual confi- dential report will be transmitted to the Prime Minis- ter and the Parliament will be informed by means of indicators. With the same objective of informing the Parlia- ment, as of 2016, bills will have a section in their impact assessment dedicated to digital technology which will also include cybersecurity, established under the aus- pices of the senior civil servants in charge of the qua- lity of regulation. More broadly, senior civil servants in charge of the quality of regulation will ensure that the 16 French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 1 17 French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 1 issues related to the reinforcement of the security of in- formation systems is taken into account in the steering of the normative process. > Preparing France and the multilateral organisa- tions to which it belongs to face major cybersecurity crises. Reinforcement of the security of the most sensitive information systems of operators of vital importance, which was announced in the 2013 White Paper on De- fence and National Security, was the subject of legisla- tive measures (Articles 21 and 22 of law n° 2013-1168 of 18 December 2013). The work started with these opera- tors will continue over the long term, notably by rou- tine updating of regulatory texts. This work will be pro- gressively extended, as is specified by the law, to public and private operators who participate in these sensitive information systems. This choice made by France will have made it pos- sible to actively participate in the development of the orientations of the European Directive concerning measures to ensure a high common level of network and information systems security across the Union and to anticipate its transposition. At the right moment, France will specify the operators who are essential to its economy according to the orientations of the Direc- tive and will participate in the European initiatives in- tended to reinforce their digital security. Over time, cybersecurity crises management exer- cises carried out at the national level will progressively concern the entire territory and vitally important acti- vity sectors. The Ministry of Defence, in collaboration with the National Authority on Information Systems Security, will continue to implement a cyberdefence reserve for operational purposes to face major informa- tion technology crises. In parallel, France will continue to contribute to the emergence of an environment of voluntary cooperation for cybernetic crisis management at the European level, by supporting the work of the European agency ENISA (European Union Agency for Network and Information Security) in particular. It is up to the CERT-EU (Computer Emergency Res- ponse Team of the European Union (EU) institutions, bodies and agencies) and to the NCIRC (Computer Inci- dence Response Capability) within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to ensure the cyberde- fence of their respective institutions. France, which is active during cybersecurity crisis management exer- cises organised by these organisations, and which is highly represented in proceedings that orient EU and NATO choices concerning secured digital technologies, will continue to provide its support to these institutions and their members according to their respective com- petences. France will also contribute to reinforcing the cyber- security of other international organisations to which it belongs, on a political and technical level, notably those hosted on the national territory that benefit from the national technical environment. > Developing an autonomous way of thinking that is in line with our values. The strategic choices made by France immediately after the Second World War led to the emergence of an autonomous way of thinking and the development of a doctrine that gave France a unique place on the inter- national scene and today still permeates its diplomacy and the concepts behind the use of its armed forces. Although digital technology fundamentally changes our societies, its impact on other realities such as those of sovereignty, national territory, currency or the fun- damental interests of the Nation is yet to be measured and the organisation and means of public action to make the law apply to it or to ensure their protection must be reconsidered. A discussion, coordinated by the General Secretary of Defence and National Security, will be held to develop an intellectual corpus related to cyberspace. 2 DIGITAL TRUST, PRIVACY, PERSONAL DATA, CYBERMALEVOLENCE 20 French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 2 STAKES Although in general the French trust in digital technology, they are wary of its impact on their daily lives and especial- ly their personal lives. But despite being generally careful in the use and preservation of their personal data, they entrust them to platforms for which the conditions of use are one-sided to users’ detriment. The technique noted during certain cyberattacks against businesses or administrations also shows a real difficulty separating private and professional life when using equipment and services. The objective of cyberattacks against indivi- duals is usually financial gain. By taking control of the personal equipment used (computers, tablets, smartphones), usurping identity and stealing users’ banking or commercial website credentials, star- ting a friendly virtual relationship that ends with a request for a money transfer, or encoding data wit- hout the user’s knowledge resulting in the payment of a ransom, racketeering is today widely practised by a criminal element that has become organised and increasingly efficient. While no special technique of attack is used, ha- rassment, which is facilitated and amplified by elec- tronic communication networks, is a digital aggres- sion against people with results that are sometimes tragic. Although the National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI) is the identified State contact in case of serious cybersecurity incidents that affect the ad- ministrations and operators of vital importance, there is far less clarity regarding the public offer for assistance to victims of cybermalevolence for the other stakeholders, whether it concerns interme- diate-sized enterprises, small and medium-sized en- terprises, liberal professions, territorial authorities or individuals. Victims of cybermalevolent acts are encouraged to file a complaint with the police or gendarme- rie services which have adapted to the treatment of such disputes. Nevertheless, the response with which they are provided in this framework is fo- cused on the identification of those suspected of the cybermalevolent acts and on the commitment, if applicable, to filing proceedings against these sus- pects. Victims must be able to reach a service that is competent in the treatment of the cybersecurity incidents as these incidents are often the source of the cybermalevolent acts. Digital platforms, including social networks, can shape opinion more insidiously and are often vectors of values that are not those of the French Republic. In certain cases, they can be used for pur- poses of disinformation and spreading propaganda to French citizens, in particular the youngest ones. The opinions that are disseminated are therefore against France’s fundamental interests and are an attack on defence and national security which is sanctioned by law. Another area of concern is the recent and simul- taneous developments of new uses and new data sto- rage and processing techniques which contribute to the emergence of risks of economic imbalance and attacks on individual and national security. For exa- mple, the desire to introduce the free flow of data, including personal data collected by connected objects, through commercial treaties, does not suc- cessfully mask the intent to appropriate these data by oligopolies whose values and practices do not correspond with the French or European concept of privacy or with its legal framework. Massive and il- licit appropriation of certain types of personal data, for example, health-related data, can actually affect individual and collective security, or simply result in abusive commercial exploitation (resale to insu- « Digital platforms, including social networks, can shape opinion more insidiously and are often vectors of values that are not those of the French Republic. » 21 French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 2 rance companies, for example). Digital technology development cannot be sus- tainable in a cyberspace where States do not respect the good practices required for a balanced digital transition that is beneficial to all nations and where a few economic players monopolise the wealth that constitutes digital data, notably personal data, true resources for future generations. OBJECTIVE France will develop cyberspace use that is in line with its values and will protect the digital lives of its citizens. It will increase its combat against cy- bercrime and its assistance to victims of cybermale- volence acts. ORIENTATIONS > Advocating and defending our values on electro- nic communication networks and in international proceedings. Individual rights are applicable in the same way «on-line» and «off-line». Cyberspace should therefore remain a place of free expression for all citizens, where abuses can only be prevented within the limits set by the law and in line with our international agreements. In international proceedings, France advocates this ap- proach aimed at preserving a free and open cyberspace. It is the State’s responsibility to inform citizens of the risks of manipulation and propaganda techniques used by malicious players on the Internet. After the ter- rorist attacks against France in January 2015, the Go- vernment established an information platform on the risks related to Islamic radicalisation via the electronic communication networks : « Stop-djihadisme.gouv.fr ». This approach could be extended to respond to other phenomena of propaganda or destabilisation. The com- petent defence and security services are responsible for detecting these phenomena and providing the Govern- ment with recommendations for implementing these measures. > Providing local assistance to victims of cyber- malevolent acts. Co-piloted by the Ministry of the Interior and the National Agency for Information Systems Security, with the support of the Department of Justice, the Mi- nistries of Finance and Public Accounts, Defence, Eco- nomy and Industry, and Digital Technology, a national system will be established as of 2016 to provide assistan- ce for victims of cybermalevolence. This system will also be aimed at increasing aware- ness of the challenges of protecting digital privacy and of prevention which, on a local level, will be based on measures taken by prefects and State services. ANSSI’s territorial network, the regional economic intelligence delegates and the competent economic security depart- ments of the Ministry of the Interior, the «digital tran- sition» network and that of the Bank of France (which could in the long run, integrate a criterion related to the consideration of the cyber risk in its company lis- ting) will participate in this mission. An appeal will be made to the Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the Guild Chambers and in general all the professional networks. The system will have a legal form and an organisa- tion that will enable it to benefit from the contribution of economic stakeholders from the cybersecurity sec- tor; software editors, digital platforms and solution pro- viders. Thanks to the technologies implemented, the system should provide victims with technical solutions supported by local stakeholders and facilitate adminis- trative procedures, notably to encourage the lodging of complaints. « Digital technology development cannot be sustainable in a cyberspace where States do not respect the good practices required for a balanced digital transition that is beneficial to all nations » 22 French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 2 > Measuring cybercrime. The inter-ministerial work initiated by the Ministry of the Interior since 2013 has led to the conclusion that there are currently no reliable statistics specifically re- lated to digital delinquency or cybercriminality since most of the offences concerned are registered under a classification that does not take into account this di- mension, which is currently absent from the reference systems used. The absence of such statistics is detrimental to the elaboration by the public authorities of policies conti- nuously reassessed and to the implementation of ade- quate measures. This is why the Ministry of the Interior will implement new instruments to monitor the develop- ment of cybercrime in order to guide public action. The National Delinquency and Penal Solutions Monitoring Agency will also contribute to it by dedicating a section of its work to the statistical examination of cybercrime. This section will integrate data transmitted by the Na- tional Authority on Information Systems Security and by the system for the assistance of victims of cybermale- volent acts, which have contributed to its elaboration. > Protecting the digital lives, privacy and personal data of the French people. With the prospect of the European Regulation on electronic identification (eIDAS - Electronic Identifica- tion and Trust Services), France will equip itself with a clear road map for digital identity delivered by the State. This road map will be established before the end of 2015 under the aegis of the Ministry of the Interior and Secretaries of State in charge of Digital Technolo- gy and State Reform, supported by the Departments of the Prime Minister, and should include a section that will define a framework of reference to the benefit of the territorial authorities to use digital identity delive- red by the State. This road map will take into account the Govern- ment’s digital strategy which provides for the roll-out of federated identity systems to enable the use of the same digital identity to authenticate the same person on different services. Thanks to these systems, digital identities can be provided by different entities as long as the third party responsible for managing the fede- rated identity is capable of determining the level of 23 French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 2 trustworthiness associated with the identity. Subject to compliance with the security require- ments adapted to the uses and threats, these systems are intended to increase users’ trust in their digital wor- ld and contribute to its smooth flow while minimising the risk of unwanted processing of their personal data. For more sensitive use, such as that which concerns de- mocratic life or international exchanges related to the law, high levels of trustworthiness of the systems and services will be systematically enforced. These high le- vels of trustworthiness will rely on the national indus- trial make-up and the established security certification scheme. France will protect its citizens’ privacy and personal data. The right to privacy and individual and collective control of personal data will be reaffirmed whenever necessary and notably during commercial negotiations between States, whether bilateral or multilateral. To inform the French people on the use made of their data entrusted to digital services, an identifica- tion system adapted and shared with the participating States and consistent with the European work carried out in the framework of the European Regulation re- lated to the protection of personal data will be establi- shed during 2016. This identification system will make it possible to view the essential characteristics and conditions of use for digital platforms and services or means of payment used. > Recommending technical solutions aimed at securing digital life and which are accessible to all businesses and the general public. The competent State services will label securing so- lutions for personal terminals. An identification system that is consistent with the one recommended above will enable users to be informed of the potential transmis- sion of information to third parties in the framework of this protection. Once created, the system for the as- sistance of victims of cybermalevolent acts mentioned above, as part of its mission of prevention, will advocate these systems to the public concerned. In addition, and since it was possible to initiate this by the future investments programme, the offer of accessible and adapted solutions to secure the digital lives of small and medium-sized enterprises will be sup- ported. Support for the development of French solutions will be provided as well as for the free software com- munities that develop security solutions. > Reinforcing the operational mechanisms of le- gal international mutual aid and universalising the principles of the Budapest Convention on Cyber- crime. The Budapest Convention, which was adopted in 2001 in the framework of the Council of Europe, has become a reference instrument that enables States of the five continents to cooperate in the combat against cybercrime. Ratified by 46 States, including 7 non- members of the Council of Europe, this instrument now unites 125 States for one reason or another (signa- tories, States invited to become members, States recei- ving technical assistance in view of future membership, States that have adapted their internal law to the model of the Convention). It is now essential to universalise and consolidate the base of norms as well as the tool of cooperation that this text is composed of. In addition, France will advocate the definition of a system of simplified legal cooperation between Member States within the European Union in order to accelerate the transmission of data and put an end to illegal activities. stratégie nationale pour la sécurité du numérique - INTRODUCTION 24 stratégie nationale pour la sécurité du numérique - INTRODUCTION 25 3 RAISING AWARENESS, INITIAL TRAINING, CONTINUING EDUCATION 26 French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 3 STAKES France is late in comparison to its partners in terms of raising the awareness of its po- pulation to the risks associated with the use of digital technologies and in cybersecurity trai- ning. In general, the French neglect good practices when using electronic communication networks. In private use of electronic communication networks, children and adolescents confronted with unsuitable content, exposed to harassment or pre- dation, are the primary victims. In order to break the silence and enable legal proceedings, the youn- gest subjects should be taught how to proceed when they are victims of digital malevolence. Raising the awareness of everyone is a required prerequisite for elected officials, administrative or business leaders to be able to take «cyber risk» into account at the right level and to choose measures capable of protecting the citizens whom they repre- sent or the organisations that they run, in light of the threats of information or intellectual property theft, violation of personal data, or even exposure to breakdowns in activity and production accidents, with the technological or environmental impacts to which they are potentially exposed. Besides raising the awareness of the youngest subjects, training in digital technology professions should provide future professionals in the field with extensive information systems security skills, which remains currently absent from many higher educa- tion programmes. In addition, the content and number of initial training and higher education programmes for cy- bersecurity professions do not meet the needs of bu- sinesses and administrations. OBJECTIVE France will raise children’s awareness of digital security and responsible cyberspace behaviours as of school age. Initial higher education and conti- nuing education will include a section dedicated to digital security adapted to the sector under consi- deration. ORIENTATIONS > Raising the awareness of all French people. An ambitious awareness-raising programme for all French people should be initiated. Under the command of the Ministry of National Education, Higher Education and Research and the State Secretariat for Digital Technology, with the sup- port of the Government’s Information Department and the National Agency for Information Systems Security, a call for a show of interest in the creation of educatio- nal content for the general public will be launched. The Ministry of the Interior will continue the «In- ternet Licence» operation which was initiated in 2014 by the Gendarmerie in collaboration with a private foundation, and taken over by the National Police since the beginning of 2015. This operation makes it possible to raise the awareness of risks and to give advice to more than 300,000 sixth-year students to protect their Internet browsing. The visibility of the “A digital education for all” por- tal of the CNIL will be reinforced. The associations will be invited to develop adver- tising campaign projects aimed at increasing trust in digital technology and which could become a part of a «great national cause». 27 French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 3 > Integrating cybersecurity awareness into all higher and continuing education programmes. The Ministry of National Education, Higher Educa- tion and Research, with the assistance of the University Presidents’ Conference, the Grandes Ecoles Conference and the competent administrations, will encourage the establishment of cybersecurity awareness correspon- ding to the educational field in all initial higher educa- tion programmes as of the start of the 2016 academic year. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment, supported by the competent cybersecurity State admi- nistrations, will initiate the consultations required for the organisations that provide continuing education to integrate cybersecurity issues adapted to the training in the curriculum as of 2016. Finally, the State Secretariat in charge of Digital Technology, along with the ministries concerned and the support of ANSSI, will coordinate the initiation of the awareness programme for the professional catego- ries in which an inculcation of cybersecurity issues is particularly necessary in relation to their societal res- ponsibilities. These categories will be specified by the Strategic Committee for Digital Trust. > Integrating cybersecurity training into all higher education that includes some information technology. The «CyberÉdu» initiative launched in 2013 confir- med that teachers involved in the higher education cur- ricula for information technology professions are inte- rested in the subjects related to information systems security. This initiative should be reinforced. The Ministry of National Education, Higher Educa- tion and Research, with the assistance of the University Presidents’ Conference, the Grandes Ecoles Conference, the administrations and competent professional orga- nisations, will ensure that information systems security training adapted to the field and which covers issues related to digital technology is provided in all initial hi- gher education programmes as of the start of the 2016 academic year. The priority should be to integrate these security elements in the existing courses and in a per- tinent manner in the broader context of each field that is taught. It would be useful to base these steps on the educational contents being developed, in close collabo- ration with the teaching community, in the framework of the CyberEdu project. The Ministry of Decentralisation and Public Service will ensure that training programmes for public service functions include elements of cybersecurity training. In collaboration with the Ministry of the Interior, it will ensure that the recruitment examination for the civil servants corps of information and communication sys- tems engineers regulated by Decree n° 2015-576 of 27 May 2015, as well as the training that will be provided for the members of the corps will have a cybersecurity section. In light of a growing demand from our partners, whenever possible, a part of the training and educa- tion offer should be adapted to an international public, notably by providing programmes in the English lan- guage. > Recording and anticipating the initial and conti- nuing education needs. Under the aegis of the Expert Panel for Digital Trust, the short, medium and long-term initial training needs will be established in collaboration with all the stakeholders concerned in the administration and the private sector. The professional trade unions will be called on to develop and implement continuing education pro- grammes adapted to the needs of employees and bu- sinesses. stratégie nationale pour la sécurité du numérique - INTRODUCTION 28 stratégie nationale pour la sécurité du numérique - INTRODUCTION 29 4 THE ENVIRONMENT OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY BUSINESSES, INDUSTRIAL POLICY, EXPORT AND INTERNATIONALISATION 30 French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 4 STAKES Cyberspace is under rapid growth. 100,000 new objects connect to the Internet eve- ry hour. Many French businesses partici- pate in international shows and the success of the «French Tech» initiative for example, shows a real dynamism of French innovation in digital products and services. However, this reality should not hide a certain loss of control and real technological de- pendence. Large equipment that ensures the functioning of electronic communication networks with in- frastructures located in France, is often designed, developed and managed from centres located out- side Europe. The same goes for most of the com- munications and data security equipment of our operators of vital importance. The operation of an increasing number of businesses is based on the use of applications and data processing hosted in uncontrolled virtual spaces, supported by physical infrastructures located outside the national territo- ry and not subject to European law. With the increase in the number of connected objects or the concentration of on-line service plat- forms in the hands of only a few stakeholders for example, current developments both in techno- logy and in economic models magnify this loss of control in the national cyberspace. In the event of an international crisis, access to entire sections of cyberspace could be contested. The answer to this issue of sovereignty requires first and foremost the maintenance of a strong and competitive national and European industry in the specialised field of cybersecurity products and ser- vices. In general, it requires the development, in France and Europe, of a digital equipment and ser- vice offer that provides clients with the guarantees of security and trust adapted to the issues and uses. Users do not have the means to ensure the le- vel of security of digital objects and services them- selves. The promotion of security in marketing arguments by suppliers is becoming widespread without, however, allowing for an objective evalua- tion of the level of security actually achieved. The development of greater clarity in terms of security in the digital offer based on objective elements that can be verified by a third party, constitutes a major challenge for ensuring trust in the digital economy. The development of an offer of cybersecurity products and services by national businesses in the digital technology sector should also be seen as an essential factor of competitiveness for these businesses. The field of payment methods (smart cards, payment terminals, etc.) is the archetype of an economic sector in which an adapted level of se- curity against threats which can be verified by third parties constitutes a first-line marketing argument. Several national businesses hold a competitive in- ternational position in this sector that is largely due to the excellence that they were able to develop and demonstrate in the field of security. The increase in cyber threats and the growing awareness of the reality of these threats will lead to making security an essential purchase criterion in many other sectors a few years from now. Acting now to improve the security and transparency of the national offer for digital solutions also means preparing their future competitiveness. In 2015, the share of French businesses, and es- pecially SMEs, that widely use digital technology is only within the average of the European countries. Catching up from behind should be accompanied by improved security of the digital lives of businesses starting with better security of their information systems. This is essential for our competitiveness and therefore our jobs. The challenge for French businesses is to re- concile the search for productivity, savings and « The development of an offer of cybersecurity products and services by national businesses in the digital technology sector should also be seen as an essential factor of competitiveness for these businesses. » 31 French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 4 profitability with the use or development of digital products and services that do not endanger their competitiveness or security, those of their partners or their clients. Most digital equipment, objects and services that are currently available on the market do not have the level of data security that enables them to avoid an incident: data leakage, malfunction or break in service. For French businesses, ergonomics, the pro- tection of personal data and the level of security of digital products and services that they develop and produce, in the short term should become a diffe- rentiator, a competitive advantage for them and in return, for the nation. In addition, although counterfeiting does not directly fall under information systems security, counterfeit cybersecurity products can endanger the activity of organisations that purchase them. In terms of the internationalisation of bu- sinesses and export, considering the environment of extreme international competition in which our partners provide solid and structured support to their industry, the State services should become sus- tainably organised to support French cybersecurity businesses. The mobilisation and coordination of all the pu- blic and private resources available are essential to increase the visibility and competitiveness of the French offer on an international level and to pool knowledge and feedback and thereby contribute to the sharing of information between the different stakeholders in the field. OBJECTIVE France will develop an environment that is fa- vourable to research and innovation and will make digital security a factor in competitiveness. It will support the development of the economy and the international promotion of its digital products and services. It will ensure that digital products and ser- vices with levels of ergonomics, trust and security adapted to the uses and cyber threats are available to its citizens, businesses and administrations. ORIENTATIONS > Developing and accentuating the national and European offer of security products and services. In collaboration with the competent administra- tions of the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Digital Technology and the Ministry of Defence, in 2012 the National Agency for Information Systems Security ini- tiated an industrial policy to develop the national fabric of businesses that develop cybersecurity products and services. The launch of the New Industrial France «cyber- security» plan in 2013, now included in the «Digi- tal Trust» solution, and the support of the General Commission for Investment and of BpiFrance made it possible to organise the sector and issue requests for proposals aimed at creating an offer for trustworthy equipment to detect cyberattacks, essentially for opera- tors of vital importance, and secured mobile products for all businesses. The State services will increase their efforts to qua- lify and monitor cybersecurity products and services, and support the development of new security products that correspond to the changes in usage patterns. They « For French businesses, ergonomics, the protection of personal data and the level of security of digital products and services that they develop and produce, in the short term should become a differentiator, a competitive advantage for them and in return, for the nation. » 32 French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 4 33 French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 4 will also support the enhancement and perpetuation of these offers through public contracting that chooses se- curity products and services qualified at the right level, as well as by communication and educational measures for the private sector. In addition, the State services will endeavour to disseminate the results of research and development which they finance for high-level security equipment in order to raise the security level of products for bu- sinesses and the general public. Finally, France will endeavour to take full advan- tage of leverage offered by the European Union to sup- port, promote and defend French scientific, technolo- gical and industrial competences in the cybersecurity fields. It will also discourage the EU from limiting itself to the role of consumer, and will incite it rather to stand out as an indispensable global stakeholder for the offer in this sector. > Transferring acquired knowledge to the private sector to contribute to the handling of its cyberse- curity. For five years now France has equipped itself with the capacity to detect and respond to cyberattacks, as announced in the 2008 White Paper on Defence and National Security. Although this effort should be pur- sued, notably by ANSSI, it is up to the private sector to ensure its own security in the field of information tech- nology as is the case in other fields, since the State ser- vices are only required to intervene in case of serious crisis. Supported by the transfer of this knowledge ac- quired by the administrations to the private sector, labelling of competent and trustworthy service provi- ders should enable the detection and treatment of the inevitable growth in the number of cyberattacks that businesses are subjected to. > Preparing a safer digital world through better anticipation of uses, adapted support and stakehol- ders’ information. For the next five years, the priority for the compe- tent information systems security authorities should be anticipation and prevention. This will entail ensuring that the digital products and services or those that involve digital technology, which are designed, developed and produced in France, are among the safest in the world. To achieve this ob- jective, the competent authorities should direct their communication efforts towards the public and private scientific community, and the innovation centres; com- petitive clusters, technological research institutes, incu- bators and «fab labs»; by devoting specific means to these areas as needed, as is the case with the Ministry of Defence, and more recently, the Ministry of the In- terior. When digital products and services store personal data or are intended for the business sectors of vital im- portance, the State services will provide the elements that are useful for risk analysis or the recommenda- tions required to obtain the level of security that cor- responds to the use of the product or the service being designed or developed. For uses that justify it, they will also contribute to establishing systems to independent- ly evaluate the level of security and trustworthiness of these products and services, and to providing their potential users with adapted guarantees through label- ling. In parallel, the legal environment to accommodate new products and services should be anticipated. For example, the imminent arrival of autonomous cars should incite the regulator to prepare the conditions to ensure the security of their circulation. Cybersecu- rity should be taken into account in the international working groups that define the framework and control technical procedures. For other types of products or services, an adapted identification system should inform the consumer of their essential digital features and notably the proces- sing of the data that is collected. For certain sectors such as the health sector, systematic labelling of digital products and services will be considered. France will endeavour to include other EU Member States in the implementation of these practices in order 34 French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 4 to create a zone of digital trust and security. The work initiated with Germany on cloud computing or secured messaging is moving in this direction. > Integrating the requirements for cybersecurity in public contracting and support. For the protection of its sovereignty and notably the protection of its information concerning the national defence secret, France will preserve its financial and in- dustrial capacity to develop solutions with the highest levels of security. In general, the entire administration should set an example in public contracting by integrating the right level of security criteria in its choices of digital products and services. Finally, as of 2016 any product or service that is em- bedded in or is based on an information system and wants to answer a call for tenders, a request for public projects, or be eligible for public funds, will benefit from a bonus factor if it is accompanied by a cybersecu- rity risk analysis that corresponds to the intended use of the product or service. > Supporting export and internationalisation of the businesses in the sector. To support the economic development of the cy- bersecurity industrial sector, France will endeavour to reinforce the visibility and competitiveness of the French offer worldwide and to facilitate access of SMEs and start-ups notably to the international markets. Inter-ministerial coordination will be structured and reinforced. An adapted French business support organisation will be established in addition to the oc- casional and often isolated measures that are currently led by the different ministries and State entities. Along with the possible creation of specific support systems for the stakeholders in the cybersecurity sec- tor, the conditions for access to the existing support systems, as well as their implementation methods will be clarified and optimised. The procedures to control exportations of cybersecurity solutions will be clarified and optimised. In addition, as is the case with «French Tech» crea- tions, the collaborative initiatives generated by the pri- vate sector and intended to assist SMEs and start-ups on an international level will be supported. 35 French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 4 5 EUROPE, DIGITAL STRATEGIC AUTONOMY, CYBERSPACE STABILITY 38 French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 5 STAKES Cyberspace has become a major subject for negotiation within international organi- sations whose work now concerns the en- tire digital field. In 2013, the States acknowledged that far from being a space without rules, cyberspace was go- verned by existing international law. Despite this, the international normative framework is still being debated, which, without any advancement in negotiations, could harm the preservation of a stable safe cyberspace that is compliant with the fundamental laws and is appropriate for the deve- lopment of a prosperous trustworthy economy in the digital era. While an increasing number of countries are de- claring themselves equipped with offensive capabi- lities, the level of conflict between States is increa- singly being expressed in cyberspace. In addition, the massive revelations of practices and espionage techniques carried out by major States or alliances of States against other States (sometimes allies), people and businesses, have increased the political mistrust of countries that are at the origin of these practices and technical mistrust of their products and services. These revelations also contribute to the proliferation of similar technical methods. In parallel, groups of individuals with diverse motivations and supports, mercenaries recruited worldwide and associated according to the circums- tances, regularly take recourse in cyberattacks to attempt to destabilise the governing authorities of many countries or businesses that symbolise them. In addition, terrorist organisations take advan- tage of the audience provided by social networks to disseminate propaganda intended to attract vo- lunteers and terrorise the populations. These diffe- rent groups benefit from continuous media impact. On the economic level, the trend at the begin- ning of the decade is being confirmed. A small nu- mber of businesses supported by the States which enabled their development use their technological advance, their domination on the market and their financial capacities to pre-empt digital innovation. This privatisation of cyberspace to the benefit of a few monopolies condemns the other stakeholders in digital technology to dependence and harnesses a share of the added value of digital technology that is too great for this situation to be bearable for the economies of the other countries. Although it supports world growth, cyberspace has become a place of conflict and often unfair competition, which until now has been one of low intensity in terms of information technology, and of political destabilisation and economic hegemony. Europe has been able to identify these issues and through dialogue and regulations is trying to pro- vide ideas and solutions that are more respectful of sustainable digital development, both in terms of Internet governance and protection of personal data or cybersecurity of the operators who are es- sential to the economy. Despite having adopted a cybersecurity strategy in 2013, Europe is still strug- gling to assert digital strategic autonomy and equip itself with the tools required to re-balance cybers- pace in its favour, even though this subject is now on the agenda for many European centres for dis- cussions and negotiations. Because it shares common values with other EU Member States, France and these Member States should play a driving role in digital technology. France wants to participate in the digital trans- formation of Europe through alliances. Europe built itself in the past through an alliance based on raw materials. Digital Europe will build itself on al- liances, trust and data control, the raw materials of the coming decades. « Although it supports world growth, cyberspace has become a place of conflict and often unfair competition » 39 French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 5 OBJECTIVE Along with voluntary Member States, France will be the driving force behind European strategic autonomy. It will play an active role in the promo- tion of a safe, stable and open cyberspace. ORIENTATIONS > Establishing a road map for European strategic autonomy with voluntary Member States. This road map, which is open to the European Union Member States, will determine the key factors of success of the short-term implementation of the policies that are adequate for the emergence of a European digi- tal strategic autonomy, notably in terms of regulations, standardisation and certification, research and develop- ment, trust in digital technology — while respecting Member States’ sovereignty — the protection of priva- cy and personal data conceived of as a public interest property. Similarly, France will ensure that the international treaties negotiated in the name of Europe do not lead to technological or economic dependence of European stakeholders and to the alienation of the personal data of its citizens or sensitive data of its administrations, sources of destabilization of cyberspace. This will involve making Europe the digital terri- tory that is most respectful of the fundamental rights of individuals and implementing a zone of trust and economic prosperity, in line with the precursor work between France and Germany on Cloud computing and the encrypted exchange of e-mails between the two countries. > Reinforcing French presence and influence in the international discussions on cybersecurity. In order to reinforce trust on an international le- vel and to explore new regulation mechanisms aimed at preventing conflicts in cyberspace, France will rein- force its contact with all the parties directly involved who are willing to engage in dialogue on the issues of cybersecurity. Participation in multilateral negotiations on cy- bersecurity (UNO, OSCE) will be intensified in order to consolidate a global base of commitments to good 40 French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 5 conduct in cyberspace for the States, in compliance with international law. Bilateral contact will be reinforced, notably in the framework of inter-ministerial diplomatic dialogue on the issues concerning cyberspace, headed by the Mi- nistry of Foreign Affairs and International Develop- ment. Finally, to assert its influence, France will increase its investment in more informal international forums in which the technical and academic communities and the political decision-makers come together to discuss the future balances. > Contributing to the global stability of cyberspace by assisting voluntary countries to establish cyber- security capabilities. Digital transition, the bearer of political, social and economic opportunities, is far from being uniformly controlled in all countries. This harms the security and development of States that are less protected, and weakens all digital environments on an international level. In order to contribute to a reliable and sustainable roll-out of digital technologies in all countries, and in particular the developing ones, France owes it to itself to assist in reinforcing the capabilities of countries that would like to increase the resilience and security of their information systems, notably in terms of the protection of critical infrastructures and the combat against cybercrime. To ensure the durability and sustainability of pro- jects to reinforce capabilities, France will preferably act through long-term trustworthy partnerships. This action should also enable France to reinforce its own cybersecurity. Text and illustrations Licence Ouverte/Open Licence (Etalab — V1) Illustration credit : Marc Renaudin",

Boasting a highly  connected population, buoyed by sustained growth in its digital economy,  France draws on talents and strengths on the cutting edge of European and  global innovation.

Cyberspace has become a new domain for unfair competition and espionage,  disinformation and propaganda, terrorism and criminality.

Foreword from Manuel Valls, Prime Minister of France, French national digital security strategy    FRENCH NatioNal   digital sECuRity    stRatEgy  The digitalisation of French society  is accelerating, with relentless   growth in digital services, products  and jobs. This has become a   national issue. The digital transition  favours innovation and growth, yet  it simultaneously carries risks for  the State, economic stakeholders   and citizens. Cybercrime, espionage,  propaganda, sabotage and excessive   exploitation of personal data  threaten digital trust and security,   thus calling for a collective,  coordinated response based on five   strategic objectives.    3  # Fundamental interests, defence and security of  State information systems and critical infrastruc- tures, major cybersecurity crisis.  By developing autonomous strategic thinking, sup- ported by world-class technical expertise, France will  ensure the ongoing defence of its fundamental inte- rests in cyberspace. In parallel, France will continue  to reinforce the security of its critical networks and its  resilience in case of a major cyberattack by expanding  cooperation with private stakeholders at national and  international levels.  # Digital trust, privacy, personal data, cybermale- volence.  For cyberspace to remain safe for businesses of  all sizes and for individuals, protective measures and  remedial actions will be adopted. Protection will be  based on public authorities’ heightened vigilance regar- ding the use of personal data and the development of a  range of digital security products tailored to the gene- ral public. Remedial actions will be structured around  aid to victims of cybermalevolence, providing technical  and legal assistance.  # Awareness raising, initial training, continuing  education.  Individuals still lack sufficient awareness of the risks  associated with the digitalisation of society. This is why  steps will be taken to raise the awareness of school- children and students. In addition, to meet increasing  demands from the public and private sector regarding  cybersecurity, training of experts in this domain will  be enhanced.  # Environment of digital technology businesses,  industrial policy, export and internationalisation.  The growth of digital markets worldwide, together  with the associated security imperatives, constitutes an  opportunity to differentiate French digital products and  services that have a security level adapted to their uses.  By supporting investment, innovation and exports, but  also via public procurement, the State will develop a  favourable environment for French companies in the  digital sector offering secure products and services.  # Europe, digital strategic autonomy, cyberspace  stability.  The regulation of international relations in cybers- pace has become a major issue. France, along with like- minded Member States, will promote a road map for  European digital strategic autonomy. France will also  fortify its influence in international bodies and provi- de support to the least-protected countries, with their  consent, to build their cybersecurity capabilities, the- reby contributing to the overall stability of cyberspace.  Digital security underpins the digital Republic  project. In this regard, the State plays a major role  in elaborating this strategy and in launching a dy- namic that must now be maintained by digital-sec- tor professionals, public and private decision-ma- kers and citizens.      iNdEX  iNtRoduCtioN Page 7  objECtivE 1 Fundamental interests, defence and security of State information systems    and critical infrastructures, major cybersecurity crisis.

Page 37      7  French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — iNtRoduCtioN  iNtRoduCtioN  France is going through its digital transition.  Networks are omnipresent in the functioning of  the State, economic activity and the daily lives of  citizens.   Digital technology engenders new uses, new  products and new services and is therefore a factor  of innovation. It leads to transformation in most  trades. It transforms sectors of activity and bu- sinesses giving them more flexibility and competi- tiveness. Boosted by digital support, these sectors  are simultaneously more exposed to digital threats.    Doing without digital technology or the lack of  access to it results in a form of economic and social  exclusion. Similarly, the sovereignty of a State that  does not have the autonomy required in the digital  sector would be threatened.  For digital technology to remain an area of  freedom, exchanges and growth, trust and security  must be established and defended. Only through a  collaborative and coordinated effort can this objec- tive be attained.  *     * *  An initial cybersecurity strategy was developed in  France in early 2010 and was published in early 2011  shortly after the discovery of a cyberattack, the inten- tion of which was to spy on the economic and finance  ministries. The attackers, who had been acting for se- veral months, had taken control of the core of one of  the ministerial networks and were regularly collecting   political, economic and financial information. This type of cyberattack targets many French bu-  sinesses of all sizes in all sectors of activity. Businesses  are also the target of all types of fraud such as malware  infection that makes the business’ files unusable until a  ransom is paid by means that are difficult to trace.  In parallel, computer system intrusions aimed at  stealing personal information (identity, identification  data on commercial websites and bank details) are on  the rise. Most of the times, it concerns criminals com- mitting crimes that are identical to those known in  the material world such as theft, fraud and blackmail,  but in an industrialised manner, with less risk of being  identified and prosecuted. Organised crime has seized  the opportunity provided by electronic communication  networks. Their technical capabilities are increasing to  the point where they are now capable of carrying out  acts of sabotage or taking production tools hostage, for  themselves or through subcontracting by hybridisation.  Harassment campaigns are developing on social  networks, such as cases of fraud victimisation where- by gullible subjects are persuaded to transfer money  abroad.   The defacement of many websites, notably those be- longing to territorial authorities, following the attacks  of January 2015 and the cyberattack a few weeks later  on a French international media have demonstrated the  intention and ability of organised groups to cripple in- formation system resources that support our daily lives.  What was recognised as «the state of threat» esta- blished in 2010, therefore turned out to be accurate. At  present, the threat is intensified by the increase in the  capabilities of attackers, the proliferation of techniques     8  French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — iNtRoduCtioN  of attack and the development of organised crime in  cyberspace.  But another type of challenge has arisen; that posed  by the appropriation of digital wealth by a business  oligopoly using their dominant position to interfere  with the arrival of new businesses and to harness the  added value of this budding economy, which will ex- ploit data intended to invent new services, improve our  daily lives or make public services more accessible. At  the forefront of these data is our personal data; inclu- ding those related to our privacy. Control of this mass  of data opens the way to economic destabilisation  and to sophisticated forms of propaganda or ways to  mislead people’s judgments and habits. In this respect,  this threat is a matter for national defence and security,  because of its national extent and strategic issues.   *     * *  In light of these risks, which unfortunately are  already established, much has already been accompli- shed.   As was announced in the 2008 French White Paper  on Defence and National Security, a national agency  was created as of 2009 to address cyberattacks and to  protect the State information systems and critical in- frastructures.  An industrial policy in favour of the national cyber- security industry is notably supported by the future  investments programme and in the framework of the  «Future industry» plan.  In 2013 the French Parliament voted for the mea- sures recommended by the Government aimed at rein- forcing the cybersecurity of operators of vital impor- tance and of those who participate in their most critical  information systems.  France’s positions are supported within all inter- national bodies, and notably the United Nations (UN)  which acknowledged the application of international  law to cyberspace in 2013. In addition, bilateral opera- tional relations with several countries have been ini-  tiated by the State’s services. The ministries have become aware of the political   and technical impact of information technologies on  their missions and administration activity and are be- coming equipped with coordinators in charge of digital  issues and the security aspects thereof. A State Infor- mation Systems Security Policy was developed and is  progressively being implemented.  In the coming years it should be possible to reap  the benefits of the measures taken and to extend the  scope of public action and stakeholders. It must now be  acknowledged and made known that the defence and  security of digital technology depends on the national  community and not only on the action of the State.   *     * *  Up until the past few years, our defence and natio- nal security depended on the expertise, behaviour and  decisions of men and women with access to the most  sophisticated, protected and secret installations and  equipment. But with the emergence of a society that  is massively connected, this responsibility is now par- tially shared by all French people. One connected ob- ject or one service that is inadequately secured by its  developers, negligence by one information systems’ se- curity decision-maker, dangerous behaviour by one ser- vice provider or by one employee who carelessly mixes  private life and professional life can lead to losses in  availability, confidentiality or integrity of essential in- formation, suspensions in activity and economic losses,  industrial accidents and losses of human lives or eco- logical catastrophes and disturbances in public order,  capable of affecting the life of the entire nation.  In fact, never has the stability of our future, sup- ported by digital technology, been so dependent on  each person’s responsibilities and on the collective res- ponsibilities of three communities of stakeholders.  The first community is responsible for recommen- ding and implementing technologies, products and ser- vices equipped with the level of security that is adap-    9  French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — iNtRoduCtioN  ted to the uses and capable of mitigating the identified  risks. The main stakeholders in this community are  researchers, product and service inventors and integra- tors, cybersecurity businesses, electronic communica- tions network operators, internet service providers and  remote data processing services.   The second community is responsible for protecting  the nation from digital pirates. Besides the implemen- tation of cybersecurity policies, an aggressive policy to  develop the required technical competences should be  adopted, and an environment of trust should be esta- blished that supports the society’s digital transforma- tion by defending citizens, our values and our interests  in cyberspace. This responsibility obliges the bearer to  express his position in favour of qualified security solu- tions and to promote national industry, also in relation  to export. This community consists of elected officials,  the Government, central and territorial administra- tions and trade unions.  The third community is responsible for using the  available services and technologies in a well thought- out manner, making rational choices and avoiding  high-risk behaviours in actions related to digital life.  This community consists of all users, companies’ mana- gers, participants in civil society and citizens.    These are synallagmatic commitments made by  each stakeholder that enable France to fully benefit  from the contributions of digital technology, transform  the choices related to digital security into national com- petitive advantages – which are often currently expe- rienced as an economic and behavioural constraint –  and to promote our values, products and services.  The role of the State in cyberspace is to ensure  France’s freedom of expression and action as well as the  security of its critical infrastructures in case of a major  cyberattack (objective 1), to protect the digital lives of  citizens and businesses and combat cybercriminality  (objective 2), to ensure the education and training re- quired for digital security (objective 3), to contribute to  the development of an environment that is conducive to  trust in digital technology (objective 4) and to promote  cooperation between Member States of the European  Union (EU) in a manner favourable to the emergence   of a European digital strategic autonomy, a long-term  guarantor of a cyberspace that is more secure and res- pectful of our values (objective 5).      FIVE STRATEGIC objECtivEs      1  FUNDAMENTAL INTERESTS,   DEFENCE AND SECURITY OF STATE  INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND   CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURES,   MAJOR CYBERSECURITY CRISIS    14  French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 1   STAKES  France is the target of cyberattacks that da- mage its fundamental interests. Today, when an attacker targets the State,   operators of vital importance or strategic bu- sinesses, the aim is for long-term installation in the  information system in order to steal confidential  data (political, diplomatic, military, technological,  economic, financial or commercial). In the future,  an attacker could take control of connected objects,  remotely interrupt an industrial activity or destroy  its target. Since 2011, about one hundred major cy- berattacks have been addressed, most often in com- plete confidentiality, by competent administrations  and service providers.  In parallel, the positions taken by France on the  international scene, its military operations and cer- tain public debates are followed by cyberattacks  aimed at marking public opinion. For example,  the defacement of many websites after the terro- rist attacks that targeted France in the beginning  of 2015 had a technically low but symbolically high  impact desired by the attackers. Similarly, the cy- berattack that led to the interruption of an inter- national French media was also aimed at making  a strong impression and contributes to the radica- lisation that leads to terrorist acts. This attack also  demonstrated the capacity of attackers determined  to disrupt the functioning of a highly symbolic in- frastructure.   For several years now many States have imple- mented their political will and considerable hu- man, technical and financial means to carry out  large-scale cyberspace operations against us.  Whether they are known through publicly dis- closed documents or revealed during the treatment  of cyberattacks, the excesses of such practices harm  the credibility of some of these States on the inter- national scene and destroy the trust that would be  naturally attributed to their businesses’ digital pro- ducts and services.  Therefore, the cyber risk, which was placed in   third position for major threats to France by the  2013 White Paper on Defence and National Security,  is now reinforced and constitutes a major challenge  facing France.   OBJECTIVE  France will ensure the defence of its fundamen- tal interests in cyberspace. It will reinforce the digi- tal security of its critical infrastructures and do its  utmost to ensure that of its essential operators to  the economy.   ORIENTATIONS  > Having the scientific, technical and industrial  capabilities required to protect sovereign informa- tion, ensure cybersecurity and develop a trustwor- thy digital economy.  An Expert Panel for Digital Trust will be created,  under the aegis of the State Secretariat for Digital  Technology and the National Authority for the Secu- rity of Information Systems.  The Expert Panel for Digital Trust will very regu- larly unite the competent administrations of the Prime  Minister, the Ministries of National Education, Higher  Education and Research, Justice, Defence, Social Af- fairs, Health and Women’s Rights, Economy, Industry,  and Digital Technology and the Ministry of the Inte- rior, the General Commission for Investment, the Na- tional Research Agency and the research organisations  concerned. The panel can include stakeholders from the   « the excesses of such practices harm  the credibility of some of these States   on the international scene and destroy  the trust that would be naturally   attributed to their businesses’   digital products and services. »    15  French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 1  private sector and qualified key figures in their work. The mission of this panel will notably be to identify   the key technologies for which in-depth knowledge is  required for cybersecurity professions and in general  for the development of a trustworthy digital environ- ment. It will evaluate the initial and continuing edu- cation needs, will monitor Research and support its de- velopment, participate in improving support for young  PhD holders. In the field of digital technologies, it will  contribute to setting the strategic goals of systems for  financing and supporting research and industrial deve- lopment. This work will be implemented in consistence  with that of the structures that have already been es- tablished such as the French Security Industries Sector  Association (CoFIS).  In general, the choice of major private stakehol- ders in terms of economic or technological model,  which are sometimes external to any normalisation  framework, or simply certain innovations in digital  uses, can consolidate trust or incite mistrust. The Ex- pert Panel for Digital Trust will organise technological  and economic monitoring through which evolutions of  digital related issues can be anticipated. If necessary,  adapted measures will be recommended to support or  supervise these changes. These measures could, for exa- mple, concern the protection of the Nation’s scientific  and technical potential or the control of foreign invest- ments in critical national businesses.  The ministerial coordinators for cyberspace issues  in collaboration with the General Secretary of Defence  and National Security will come together in an Expert  Panel Commission for the subjects that fall within its  competence.   This Expert Panel will also give an annual report to  the Prime Minister on its activities.  > Ensuring active monitoring of the security of  technologies and uses for the State, businesses and  citizens.  In anticipation of major technological develop- ments, such as the 5th generation of mobile telecommu- nications (5G) or «software-defined networks», France   will remain attentive to the type and capabilities of  equipment and software installed within these electro- nic communication networks, to protect the privacy of  correspondences, that of its citizens and the resilience  of these infrastructures, and will continue to adapt its  regulatory framework to new emerging technologies.  The National Authority on Information Systems Se- curity will regularly inform the ministries, businesses,  territorial authorities and citizens, by means adapted  to the target community, of factors that might present  a danger in terms of digital use. These information will  have been consolidated beforehand with the competent  administrations.  > Accelerating the reinforcement of State Informa- tion Systems Security.  Since 2010, several measures have been taken to  raise the level of security of State information systems.  A State Information Systems Security Policy (PSSIE)  was developed, an inter-ministerial electronic commu- nications network is in rapid growth and the roll-out  of secured mobile terminals has been initiated. These  measures, like those aimed at producing the security  equipment to protect sovereign information, mobilise  human and budgetary resources. They will be pursued  in order to provide to the Government and our military  capabilities with the level of security adapted to long- term preservation of France’s autonomy in making de- cisions and taking action.   The application of the State Information Systems  Security Policy and the effectiveness of the measures  adopted will be evaluated annually. An annual confi- dential report will be transmitted to the Prime Minis- ter and the Parliament will be informed by means of  indicators.  With the same objective of informing the Parlia- ment, as of 2016, bills will have a section in their impact  assessment dedicated to digital technology which will  also include cybersecurity, established under the aus- pices of the senior civil servants in charge of the qua- lity of regulation. More broadly, senior civil servants in  charge of the quality of regulation will ensure that the     16  French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 1    17  French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 1  issues related to the reinforcement of the security of in- formation systems is taken into account in the steering  of the normative process.  > Preparing France and the multilateral organisa- tions to which it belongs to face major cybersecurity  crises.  Reinforcement of the security of the most sensitive  information systems of operators of vital importance,  which was announced in the 2013 White Paper on De- fence and National Security, was the subject of legisla- tive measures (Articles 21 and 22 of law n° 2013-1168 of  18 December 2013). The work started with these opera- tors will continue over the long term, notably by rou- tine updating of regulatory texts. This work will be pro- gressively extended, as is specified by the law, to public  and private operators who participate in these sensitive  information systems.  This choice made by France will have made it pos- sible to actively participate in the development of the  orientations of the European Directive concerning  measures to ensure a high common level of network  and information systems security across the Union and  to anticipate its transposition. At the right moment,  France will specify the operators who are essential to  its economy according to the orientations of the Direc- tive and will participate in the European initiatives in- tended to reinforce their digital security.   Over time, cybersecurity crises management exer- cises carried out at the national level will progressively  concern the entire territory and vitally important acti- vity sectors. The Ministry of Defence, in collaboration  with the National Authority on Information Systems  Security, will continue to implement a cyberdefence  reserve for operational purposes to face major informa- tion technology crises.   In parallel, France will continue to contribute to the  emergence of an environment of voluntary cooperation  for cybernetic crisis management at the European level,  by supporting the work of the European agency ENISA  (European Union Agency for Network and Information  Security) in particular.  It is up to the CERT-EU (Computer Emergency Res- ponse Team of the European Union (EU) institutions,  bodies and agencies) and to the NCIRC (Computer Inci- dence Response Capability) within the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization (NATO) to ensure the cyberde- fence of their respective institutions. France, which is  active during cybersecurity crisis management exer- cises organised by these organisations, and which is  highly represented in proceedings that orient EU and  NATO choices concerning secured digital technologies,  will continue to provide its support to these institutions  and their members according to their respective com- petences.  France will also contribute to reinforcing the cyber- security of other international organisations to which it  belongs, on a political and technical level, notably those  hosted on the national territory that benefit from the  national technical environment.  > Developing an autonomous way of thinking that  is in line with our values.  The strategic choices made by France immediately  after the Second World War led to the emergence of an  autonomous way of thinking and the development of a  doctrine that gave France a unique place on the inter- national scene and today still permeates its diplomacy  and the concepts behind the use of its armed forces.  Although digital technology fundamentally changes  our societies, its impact on other realities such as those  of sovereignty, national territory, currency or the fun- damental interests of the Nation is yet to be measured  and the organisation and means of public action to  make the law apply to it or to ensure their protection  must be reconsidered. A discussion, coordinated by the  General Secretary of Defence and National Security,  will be held to develop an intellectual corpus related to  cyberspace.      2  DIGITAL TRUST, PRIVACY,   PERSONAL DATA, CYBERMALEVOLENCE    20  French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 2   STAKES  Although in general the French trust in  digital technology, they are wary of its  impact on their daily lives and especial-  ly their personal lives. But despite being generally  careful in the use and preservation of their personal  data, they entrust them to platforms for which the  conditions of use are one-sided to users’ detriment.   The technique noted during certain cyberattacks  against businesses or administrations also shows a  real difficulty separating private and professional  life when using equipment and services.   The objective of cyberattacks against indivi- duals is usually financial gain. By taking control of  the personal equipment used (computers, tablets,  smartphones), usurping identity and stealing users’  banking or commercial website credentials, star- ting a friendly virtual relationship that ends with a  request for a money transfer, or encoding data wit- hout the user’s knowledge resulting in the payment  of a ransom, racketeering is today widely practised  by a criminal element that has become organised  and increasingly efficient.   While no special technique of attack is used, ha- rassment, which is facilitated and amplified by elec- tronic communication networks, is a digital aggres- sion against people with results that are sometimes  tragic.  Although the National Cybersecurity Agency  (ANSSI) is the identified State contact in case of  serious cybersecurity incidents that affect the ad- ministrations and operators of vital importance,  there is far less clarity regarding the public offer for  assistance to victims of cybermalevolence for the  other stakeholders, whether it concerns interme- diate-sized enterprises, small and medium-sized en- terprises, liberal professions, territorial authorities  or individuals.   Victims of cybermalevolent acts are encouraged  to file a complaint with the police or gendarme- rie services which have adapted to the treatment  of such disputes. Nevertheless, the response with   which they are provided in this framework is fo- cused on the identification of those suspected of the  cybermalevolent acts and on the commitment, if  applicable, to filing proceedings against these sus- pects. Victims must be able to reach a service that  is competent in the treatment of the cybersecurity  incidents as these incidents are often the source of  the cybermalevolent acts.  Digital platforms, including social networks,  can shape opinion more insidiously and are often  vectors of values that are not those of the French  Republic. In certain cases, they can be used for pur- poses of disinformation and spreading propaganda  to French citizens, in particular the youngest ones.  The opinions that are disseminated are therefore  against France’s fundamental interests and are an  attack on defence and national security which is  sanctioned by law.  Another area of concern is the recent and simul- taneous developments of new uses and new data sto- rage and processing techniques which contribute to  the emergence of risks of economic imbalance and  attacks on individual and national security. For exa- mple, the desire to introduce the free flow of data,  including personal data collected by connected  objects, through commercial treaties, does not suc- cessfully mask the intent to appropriate these data  by oligopolies whose values and practices do not  correspond with the French or European concept of  privacy or with its legal framework. Massive and il- licit appropriation of certain types of personal data,  for example, health-related data, can actually affect  individual and collective security, or simply result  in abusive commercial exploitation (resale to insu-  « Digital platforms, including social  networks, can shape opinion more  insidiously and are often vectors    of values that are not those   of the French Republic. »    21  French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 2  rance companies, for example).  Digital technology development cannot be sus-  tainable in a cyberspace where States do not respect  the good practices required for a balanced digital  transition that is beneficial to all nations and where  a few economic players monopolise the wealth that  constitutes digital data, notably personal data, true  resources for future generations.   OBJECTIVE  France will develop cyberspace use that is in line  with its values and will protect the digital lives of  its citizens. It will increase its combat against cy- bercrime and its assistance to victims of cybermale- volence acts.   ORIENTATIONS  > Advocating and defending our values on electro- nic communication networks and in international  proceedings.  Individual rights are applicable in the same way  «on-line» and «off-line». Cyberspace should therefore  remain a place of free expression for all citizens, where  abuses can only be prevented within the limits set by  the law and in line with our international agreements.  In international proceedings, France advocates this ap- proach aimed at preserving a free and open cyberspace.   It is the State’s responsibility to inform citizens of  the risks of manipulation and propaganda techniques  used by malicious players on the Internet. After the ter- rorist attacks against France in January 2015, the Go-  vernment established an information platform on the  risks related to Islamic radicalisation via the electronic  communication networks : « Stop-djihadisme.gouv.fr ».  This approach could be extended to respond to other  phenomena of propaganda or destabilisation. The com- petent defence and security services are responsible for  detecting these phenomena and providing the Govern- ment with recommendations for implementing these  measures.  > Providing local assistance to victims of cyber- malevolent acts.  Co-piloted by the Ministry of the Interior and the  National Agency for Information Systems Security,  with the support of the Department of Justice, the Mi- nistries of Finance and Public Accounts, Defence, Eco- nomy and Industry, and Digital Technology, a national  system will be established as of 2016 to provide assistan- ce for victims of cybermalevolence.   This system will also be aimed at increasing aware- ness of the challenges of protecting digital privacy and  of prevention which, on a local level, will be based on  measures taken by prefects and State services. ANSSI’s  territorial network, the regional economic intelligence  delegates and the competent economic security depart- ments of the Ministry of the Interior, the «digital tran- sition» network and that of the Bank of France (which  could in the long run, integrate a criterion related to  the consideration of the cyber risk in its company lis- ting) will participate in this mission. An appeal will  be made to the Chambers of Commerce and Industry,  the Guild Chambers and in general all the professional  networks.   The system will have a legal form and an organisa- tion that will enable it to benefit from the contribution  of economic stakeholders from the cybersecurity sec- tor; software editors, digital platforms and solution pro- viders. Thanks to the technologies implemented, the  system should provide victims with technical solutions  supported by local stakeholders and facilitate adminis- trative procedures, notably to encourage the lodging of  complaints.  « Digital technology development  cannot be sustainable in a cyberspace  where States do not respect the good   practices required for a balanced digital  transition that is beneficial    to all nations »    22  French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 2  > Measuring cybercrime. The inter-ministerial work initiated by the Ministry   of the Interior since 2013 has led to the conclusion that  there are currently no reliable statistics specifically re- lated to digital delinquency or cybercriminality since  most of the offences concerned are registered under a  classification that does not take into account this di- mension, which is currently absent from the reference  systems used.  The absence of such statistics is detrimental to the  elaboration by the public authorities  of policies conti- nuously reassessed and to the implementation of ade- quate measures. This is why the Ministry of the Interior  will implement new instruments to monitor the develop- ment of cybercrime in order to guide public action. The  National Delinquency and Penal Solutions Monitoring  Agency will also contribute to it by dedicating a section  of its work to the statistical examination of cybercrime.  This section will integrate data transmitted by the Na- tional Authority on Information Systems Security and  by the system for the assistance of victims of cybermale- volent acts, which have contributed to its elaboration.  > Protecting the digital lives, privacy and personal  data of the French people.  With the prospect of the European Regulation on  electronic identification (eIDAS - Electronic Identifica- tion and Trust Services), France will equip itself with  a clear road map for digital identity delivered by the  State. This road map will be established before the end  of 2015 under the aegis of the Ministry of the Interior  and Secretaries of State in charge of Digital Technolo- gy and State Reform, supported by the Departments of  the Prime Minister, and should include a section that  will define a framework of reference to the benefit of  the territorial authorities to use digital identity delive- red by the State.  This road map will take into account the Govern- ment’s digital strategy which provides for the roll-out  of federated identity systems to enable the use of the  same digital identity to authenticate the same person  on different services. Thanks to these systems, digital  identities can be provided by different entities as long  as the third party responsible for managing the fede- rated identity is capable of determining the level of     23  French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 2  trustworthiness associated with the identity. Subject to compliance with the security require-  ments adapted to the uses and threats, these systems  are intended to increase users’ trust in their digital wor- ld and contribute to its smooth flow while minimising  the risk of unwanted processing of their personal data.  For more sensitive use, such as that which concerns de- mocratic life or international exchanges related to the  law, high levels of trustworthiness of the systems and  services will be systematically enforced. These high le- vels of trustworthiness will rely on the national indus- trial make-up and the established security certification  scheme.  France will protect its citizens’ privacy and personal  data. The right to privacy and individual and collective  control of personal data will be reaffirmed whenever  necessary and notably during commercial negotiations  between States, whether bilateral or multilateral.  To inform the French people on the use made of  their data entrusted to digital services, an identifica- tion system adapted and shared with the participating  States and consistent with the European work carried  out in the framework of the European Regulation re- lated to the protection of personal data will be establi- shed during 2016. This identification system will make  it possible to view the essential characteristics and  conditions of use for digital platforms and services or  means of payment used.  > Recommending technical solutions aimed at  securing digital life and which are accessible to all  businesses and the general public.  The competent State services will label securing so- lutions for personal terminals. An identification system  that is consistent with the one recommended above will  enable users to be informed of the potential transmis- sion of information to third parties in the framework  of this protection. Once created, the system for the as- sistance of victims of cybermalevolent acts mentioned  above, as part of its mission of prevention, will advocate  these systems to the public concerned.   In addition, and since it was possible to initiate this   by the future investments programme, the offer of  accessible and adapted solutions to secure the digital  lives of small and medium-sized enterprises will be sup- ported.  Support for the development of French solutions  will be provided as well as for the free software com- munities that develop security solutions.  > Reinforcing the operational mechanisms of le- gal international mutual aid and universalising the  principles of the Budapest Convention on Cyber- crime.  The Budapest Convention, which was adopted in  2001 in the framework of the Council of Europe, has  become a reference instrument that enables States of  the five continents to cooperate in the combat against  cybercrime. Ratified by 46 States, including 7 non- members of the Council of Europe, this instrument  now unites 125 States for one reason or another (signa- tories, States invited to become members, States recei- ving technical assistance in view of future membership,  States that have adapted their internal law to the model  of the Convention).   It is now essential to universalise and consolidate  the base of norms as well as the tool of cooperation that  this text is composed of.  In addition, France will advocate the definition  of a system of simplified legal cooperation between  Member States within the European Union in order to  accelerate the transmission of data and put an end to  illegal activities.    stratégie nationale pour la sécurité du numérique - INTRODUCTION  24    stratégie nationale pour la sécurité du numérique - INTRODUCTION  25  3  RAISING AWARENESS, INITIAL   TRAINING, CONTINUING EDUCATION    26  French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 3   STAKES  France is late in comparison to its partners  in terms of raising the awareness of its po- pulation to the risks associated with the   use of digital technologies and in cybersecurity trai- ning.    In general, the French neglect good practices  when using electronic communication networks.   In private use of electronic communication  networks, children and adolescents confronted with  unsuitable content, exposed to harassment or pre- dation, are the primary victims. In order to break  the silence and enable legal proceedings, the youn- gest subjects should be taught how to proceed when  they are victims of digital malevolence.    Raising the awareness of everyone is a required  prerequisite for elected officials, administrative or  business leaders to be able to take «cyber risk» into  account at the right level and to choose measures  capable of protecting the citizens whom they repre- sent or the organisations that they run, in light of  the threats of information or intellectual property  theft, violation of personal data, or even exposure  to breakdowns in activity and production accidents,  with the technological or environmental impacts to  which they are potentially exposed.   Besides raising the awareness of the youngest  subjects, training in digital technology professions  should provide future professionals in the field with  extensive information systems security skills, which  remains currently absent from many higher educa- tion programmes.   In addition, the content and number of initial  training and higher education programmes for cy- bersecurity professions do not meet the needs of bu- sinesses and administrations.   OBJECTIVE  France will raise children’s awareness of digital  security and responsible cyberspace behaviours as  of school age. Initial higher education and conti- nuing education will include a section dedicated to  digital security adapted to the sector under consi- deration.   ORIENTATIONS  > Raising the awareness of all French people. An ambitious awareness-raising programme for all   French people should be initiated. Under the command of the Ministry of National   Education, Higher Education and Research and the  State Secretariat for Digital Technology, with the sup- port of the Government’s Information Department and  the National Agency for Information Systems Security,  a call for a show of interest in the creation of educatio- nal content for the general public will be launched.    The Ministry of the Interior will continue the «In- ternet Licence» operation which was initiated in 2014  by the Gendarmerie in collaboration with a private  foundation, and taken over by the National Police since  the beginning of 2015. This operation makes it possible  to raise the awareness of risks and to give advice to  more than 300,000 sixth-year students to protect their  Internet browsing.  The visibility of the “A digital education for all” por- tal of the CNIL will be reinforced.  The associations will be invited to develop adver- tising campaign projects aimed at increasing trust in  digital technology and which could become a part of a  «great national cause».    27  French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 3  > Integrating cybersecurity awareness into all   higher and continuing education programmes.  The Ministry of National Education, Higher Educa- tion and Research, with the assistance of the University  Presidents’ Conference, the Grandes Ecoles Conference  and the competent administrations, will encourage the  establishment of cybersecurity awareness correspon- ding to the educational field in all initial higher educa- tion programmes as of the start of the 2016 academic  year.  The Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment,  supported by the competent cybersecurity State admi- nistrations, will initiate the consultations required for  the organisations that provide continuing education to  integrate cybersecurity issues adapted to the training  in the curriculum as of 2016.   Finally, the State Secretariat in charge of Digital  Technology, along with the ministries concerned and  the support of ANSSI, will coordinate the initiation of  the awareness programme for the professional catego- ries in which an inculcation of cybersecurity issues is  particularly necessary in relation to their societal res- ponsibilities. These categories will be specified by the  Strategic Committee for Digital Trust.  > Integrating cybersecurity training into all   higher education that includes some information  technology.  The «CyberÉdu» initiative launched in 2013 confir- med that teachers involved in the higher education cur- ricula for information technology professions are inte- rested in the subjects related to information systems  security. This initiative should be reinforced.  The Ministry of National Education, Higher Educa- tion and Research, with the assistance of the University  Presidents’ Conference, the Grandes Ecoles Conference,  the administrations and competent professional orga- nisations, will ensure that information systems security  training adapted to the field and which covers issues  related to digital technology is provided in all initial hi- gher education programmes as of the start of the 2016  academic year. The priority should be to integrate these   security elements in the existing courses and in a per- tinent manner in the broader context of each field that  is taught. It would be useful to base these steps on the  educational contents being developed, in close collabo- ration with the teaching community, in the framework  of the CyberEdu project.   The Ministry of Decentralisation and Public Service  will ensure that training programmes for public service  functions include elements of cybersecurity training. In  collaboration with the Ministry of the Interior, it will  ensure that the recruitment examination for the civil  servants corps of information and communication sys- tems engineers regulated by Decree n° 2015-576 of 27  May 2015, as well as the training that will be provided  for the members of the corps will have a cybersecurity  section.   In light of a growing demand from our partners,  whenever possible, a part of the training and educa- tion offer should be adapted to an international public,  notably by providing programmes in the English lan- guage.  > Recording and anticipating the initial and conti- nuing education needs.  Under the aegis of the Expert Panel for Digital  Trust, the short, medium and long-term initial training  needs will be established in collaboration with all the  stakeholders concerned in the administration and the  private sector.  The professional trade unions will be called on to  develop and implement continuing education pro- grammes adapted to the needs of employees and bu- sinesses.    stratégie nationale pour la sécurité du numérique - INTRODUCTION  28    stratégie nationale pour la sécurité du numérique - INTRODUCTION  29  4  THE ENVIRONMENT OF DIGITAL  TECHNOLOGY BUSINESSES, INDUSTRIAL   POLICY, EXPORT AND INTERNATIONALISATION    30  French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 4   STAKES  Cyberspace is under rapid growth. 100,000  new objects connect to the Internet eve- ry hour. Many French businesses partici-  pate in international shows and the success of the  «French Tech» initiative for example, shows a real  dynamism of French innovation in digital products  and services. However, this reality should not hide  a certain loss of control and real technological de- pendence.  Large equipment that ensures the functioning  of electronic communication networks with in- frastructures located in France, is often designed,  developed and managed from centres located out- side Europe. The same goes for most of the com- munications and data security equipment of our  operators of vital importance. The operation of an  increasing number of businesses is based on the  use of applications and data processing hosted in  uncontrolled virtual spaces, supported by physical  infrastructures located outside the national territo- ry and not subject to European law.   With the increase in the number of connected  objects or the concentration of on-line service plat- forms in the hands of only a few stakeholders for  example, current developments both in techno- logy and in economic models magnify this loss of  control in the national cyberspace. In the event of  an international crisis, access to entire sections of  cyberspace could be contested.   The answer to this issue of sovereignty requires  first and foremost the maintenance of a strong and  competitive national and European industry in the  specialised field of cybersecurity products and ser- vices. In general, it requires the development, in  France and Europe, of a digital equipment and ser- vice offer that provides clients with the guarantees  of security and trust adapted to the issues and uses.   Users do not have the means to ensure the le- vel of security of digital objects and services them- selves. The promotion of security in marketing  arguments by suppliers is becoming widespread   without, however, allowing for an objective evalua- tion of the level of security actually achieved. The  development of greater clarity in terms of security  in the digital offer based on objective elements that  can be verified by a third party, constitutes a major  challenge for ensuring trust in the digital economy.  The development of an offer of cybersecurity  products and services by national businesses in  the digital technology sector should also be seen  as an essential factor of competitiveness for these  businesses. The field of payment methods (smart  cards, payment terminals, etc.) is the archetype of  an economic sector in which an adapted level of se- curity against threats which can be verified by third  parties constitutes a first-line marketing argument.  Several national businesses hold a competitive in- ternational position in this sector that is largely due  to the excellence that they were able to develop and  demonstrate in the field of security.   The increase in cyber threats and the growing  awareness of the reality of these threats will lead  to making security an essential purchase criterion  in many other sectors a few years from now. Acting  now to improve the security and transparency of  the national offer for digital solutions also means  preparing their future competitiveness.    In 2015, the share of French businesses, and es- pecially SMEs, that widely use digital technology is  only within the average of the European countries.  Catching up from behind should be accompanied by  improved security of the digital lives of businesses  starting with better security of their information  systems. This is essential for our competitiveness  and therefore our jobs.  The challenge for French businesses is to re- concile the search for productivity, savings and   « The development of an offer of  cybersecurity products and services  by national businesses in the digital   technology sector should also  be seen as an essential factor of   competitiveness for these businesses. »    31  French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 4  profitability with the use or development of digital  products and services that do not endanger their  competitiveness or security, those of their partners  or their clients.  Most digital equipment, objects and services that  are currently available on the market do not have  the level of data security that enables them to avoid  an incident: data leakage, malfunction or break in  service. For French businesses, ergonomics, the pro- tection of personal data and the level of security of  digital products and services that they develop and  produce, in the short term should become a diffe- rentiator, a competitive advantage for them and in  return, for the nation.   In addition, although counterfeiting does not  directly fall under information systems security,  counterfeit cybersecurity products can endanger  the activity of organisations that purchase them.  In terms of the internationalisation of bu- sinesses and export, considering the environment  of extreme international competition in which our  partners provide solid and structured support to  their industry, the State services should become sus- tainably organised to support French cybersecurity  businesses.   The mobilisation and coordination of all the pu- blic and private resources available are essential to  increase the visibility and competitiveness of the  French offer on an international level and to pool  knowledge and feedback and thereby contribute to   the sharing of information between the different  stakeholders in the field.   OBJECTIVE  France will develop an environment that is fa- vourable to research and innovation and will make  digital security a factor in competitiveness. It will  support the development of the economy and the  international promotion of its digital products and  services. It will ensure that digital products and ser- vices with levels of ergonomics, trust and security  adapted to the uses and cyber threats are available  to its citizens, businesses and administrations.   ORIENTATIONS  > Developing and accentuating the national and  European offer of security products and services.  In collaboration with the competent administra- tions of the Ministry of Economy, Industry and Digital  Technology and the Ministry of Defence, in 2012 the  National Agency for Information Systems Security ini- tiated an industrial policy to develop the national fabric  of businesses that develop cybersecurity products and  services.  The launch of the New Industrial France «cyber- security» plan in 2013, now included in the «Digi- tal Trust» solution, and the support of the General  Commission for Investment and of BpiFrance made it  possible to organise the sector and issue requests for  proposals aimed at creating an offer for trustworthy  equipment to detect cyberattacks, essentially for opera- tors of vital importance, and secured mobile products  for all businesses.  The State services will increase their efforts to qua- lify and monitor cybersecurity products and services,  and support the development of new security products  that correspond to the changes in usage patterns. They   « For French businesses, ergonomics,  the protection of personal data and the  level of security of digital products and  services that they develop and produce,   in the short term should become a  differentiator, a competitive advantage   for them and in return,   for the nation. »    32  French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 4    33  French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 4  will also support the enhancement and perpetuation of  these offers through public contracting that chooses se- curity products and services qualified at the right level,  as well as by communication and educational measures  for the private sector.  In addition, the State services will endeavour to  disseminate the results of research and development  which they finance for high-level security equipment  in order to raise the security level of products for bu- sinesses and the general public.   Finally, France will endeavour to take full advan- tage of leverage offered by the European Union to sup- port, promote and defend French scientific, technolo- gical and industrial competences in the cybersecurity  fields. It will also discourage the EU from limiting itself  to the role of consumer, and will incite it rather to stand  out as an indispensable global stakeholder for the offer  in this sector.  > Transferring acquired knowledge to the private  sector to contribute to the handling of its cyberse- curity.  For five years now France has equipped itself with  the capacity to detect and respond to cyberattacks, as  announced in the 2008 White Paper on Defence and  National Security. Although this effort should be pur- sued, notably by ANSSI, it is up to the private sector to  ensure its own security in the field of information tech- nology as is the case in other fields, since the State ser- vices are only required to intervene in case of serious  crisis.   Supported by the transfer of this knowledge ac- quired by the administrations to the private sector,  labelling of competent and trustworthy service provi- ders should enable the detection and treatment of the  inevitable growth in the number of cyberattacks that  businesses are subjected to.  > Preparing a safer digital world through better  anticipation of uses, adapted support and stakehol- ders’ information.  For the next five years, the priority for the compe- tent information systems security authorities should be  anticipation and prevention.   This will entail ensuring that the digital products  and services or those that involve digital technology,  which are designed, developed and produced in France,  are among the safest in the world. To achieve this ob- jective, the competent authorities should direct their  communication efforts towards the public and private  scientific community, and the innovation centres; com- petitive clusters, technological research institutes, incu- bators and «fab labs»; by devoting specific means to  these areas as needed, as is the case with the Ministry  of Defence, and more recently, the Ministry of the In- terior.   When digital products and services store personal  data or are intended for the business sectors of vital im- portance, the State services will provide the elements  that are useful for risk analysis or the recommenda- tions required to obtain the level of security that cor- responds to the use of the product or the service being  designed or developed. For uses that justify it, they will  also contribute to establishing systems to independent- ly evaluate the level of security and trustworthiness  of these products and services, and to providing their  potential users with adapted guarantees through label- ling.   In parallel, the legal environment to accommodate  new products and services should be anticipated. For  example, the imminent arrival of autonomous cars  should incite the regulator to prepare the conditions  to ensure the security of their circulation. Cybersecu- rity should be taken into account in the international  working groups that define the framework and control  technical procedures.    For other types of products or services, an adapted  identification system should inform the consumer of  their essential digital features and notably the proces- sing of the data that is collected. For certain sectors  such as the health sector, systematic labelling of digital  products and services will be considered.   France will endeavour to include other EU Member  States in the implementation of these practices in order     34  French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 4  to create a zone of digital trust and security. The work  initiated with Germany on cloud computing or secured  messaging is moving in this direction.  > Integrating the requirements for cybersecurity  in public contracting and support.  For the protection of its sovereignty and notably the  protection of its information concerning the national  defence secret, France will preserve its financial and in- dustrial capacity to develop solutions with the highest  levels of security.  In general, the entire administration should set an  example in public contracting by integrating the right  level of security criteria in its choices of digital products  and services.  Finally, as of 2016 any product or service that is em- bedded in or is based on an information system and  wants to answer a call for tenders, a request for public  projects, or be eligible for public funds, will benefit  from a bonus factor if it is accompanied by a cybersecu- rity risk analysis that corresponds to the intended use  of the product or service.  > Supporting export and internationalisation of  the businesses in the sector.  To support the economic development of the cy- bersecurity industrial sector, France will endeavour  to reinforce the visibility and competitiveness of the  French offer worldwide and to facilitate access of SMEs  and start-ups notably to the international markets.  Inter-ministerial coordination will be structured  and reinforced. An adapted French business support  organisation will be established in addition to the oc- casional and often isolated measures that are currently  led by the different ministries and State entities.    Along with the possible creation of specific support  systems for the stakeholders in the cybersecurity sec- tor, the conditions for access to the existing support  systems, as well as their implementation methods will  be clarified and optimised. The procedures to control  exportations of cybersecurity solutions will be clarified   and optimised. In addition, as is the case with «French Tech» crea-  tions, the collaborative initiatives generated by the pri- vate sector and intended to assist SMEs and start-ups on  an international level will be supported.    35  French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 4      5  EUROPE, DIGITAL STRATEGIC   AUTONOMY, CYBERSPACE STABILITY    38  French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 5   STAKES  Cyberspace has become a major subject for  negotiation within international organi- sations whose work now concerns the en-  tire digital field. In 2013, the States acknowledged that far from   being a space without rules, cyberspace was go- verned by existing international law. Despite this,  the international normative framework is still  being debated, which, without any advancement  in negotiations, could harm the preservation of a  stable safe cyberspace that is compliant with the  fundamental laws and is appropriate for the deve- lopment of a prosperous trustworthy economy in  the digital era.   While an increasing number of countries are de- claring themselves equipped with offensive capabi- lities, the level of conflict between States is increa- singly being expressed in cyberspace. In addition,  the massive revelations of practices and espionage  techniques carried out by major States or alliances  of States against other States (sometimes allies),  people and businesses, have increased the political  mistrust of countries that are at the origin of these  practices and technical mistrust of their products  and services. These revelations also contribute to  the proliferation of similar technical methods.  In parallel, groups of individuals with diverse  motivations and supports, mercenaries recruited  worldwide and associated according to the circums- tances, regularly take recourse in cyberattacks to  attempt to destabilise the governing authorities of  many countries or businesses that symbolise them.  In addition, terrorist organisations take advan- tage of the audience provided by social networks  to disseminate propaganda intended to attract vo- lunteers and terrorise the populations. These diffe- rent groups benefit from continuous media impact.   On the economic level, the trend at the begin- ning of the decade is being confirmed. A small nu- mber of businesses supported by the States which  enabled their development use their technological   advance, their domination on the market and their  financial capacities to pre-empt digital innovation.  This privatisation of cyberspace to the benefit of a  few monopolies condemns the other stakeholders  in digital technology to dependence and harnesses  a share of the added value of digital technology that  is too great for this situation to be bearable for the  economies of the other countries.   Although it supports world growth, cyberspace  has become a place of conflict and often unfair  competition, which until now has been one of low  intensity in terms of information technology, and of  political destabilisation and economic hegemony.  Europe has been able to identify these issues and  through dialogue and regulations is trying to pro- vide ideas and solutions that are more respectful  of sustainable digital development, both in terms  of Internet governance and protection of personal  data or cybersecurity of the operators who are es- sential to the economy. Despite having adopted a  cybersecurity strategy in 2013, Europe is still strug- gling to assert digital strategic autonomy and equip  itself with the tools required to re-balance cybers- pace in its favour, even though this subject is now  on the agenda for many European centres for dis- cussions and negotiations.  Because it shares common values with other EU  Member States, France and these Member States  should play a driving role in digital technology.    France wants to participate in the digital trans- formation of Europe through alliances. Europe  built itself in the past through an alliance based on  raw materials. Digital Europe will build itself on al- liances, trust and data control, the raw materials of  the coming decades.  « Although it supports world growth,  cyberspace has become a place    of conflict and often unfair   competition »    39  French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 5   OBJECTIVE  Along with voluntary Member States, France  will be the driving force behind European strategic  autonomy. It will play an active role in the promo- tion of a safe, stable and open cyberspace.   ORIENTATIONS  > Establishing a road map for European strategic  autonomy with voluntary Member States.  This road map, which is open to the European  Union Member States, will determine the key factors of  success of the short-term implementation of the policies  that are adequate for the emergence of a European digi- tal strategic autonomy, notably in terms of regulations,  standardisation and certification, research and develop- ment, trust in digital technology — while respecting  Member States’ sovereignty — the protection of priva- cy and personal data conceived of as a public interest  property.  Similarly, France will ensure that the international  treaties negotiated in the name of Europe do not lead   to technological or economic dependence of European  stakeholders and to the alienation of the personal data  of its citizens or sensitive data of its administrations,  sources of destabilization of cyberspace.   This will involve making Europe the digital terri- tory that is most respectful of the fundamental rights  of individuals and implementing a zone of trust and  economic prosperity, in line with the precursor work  between France and Germany on Cloud computing  and the encrypted exchange of e-mails between the  two countries.  > Reinforcing French presence and influence in  the international discussions on cybersecurity.  In order to reinforce trust on an international le- vel and to explore new regulation mechanisms aimed  at preventing conflicts in cyberspace, France will rein- force its contact with all the parties directly involved  who are willing to engage in dialogue on the issues of  cybersecurity.  Participation in multilateral negotiations on cy- bersecurity (UNO, OSCE) will be intensified in order  to consolidate a global base of commitments to good     40  French nATIOnAL DIGITAL SecUrITY STrATeGY — objECtivE 5  conduct in cyberspace for the States, in compliance  with international law.   Bilateral contact will be reinforced, notably in the  framework of inter-ministerial diplomatic dialogue on  the issues concerning cyberspace, headed by the Mi- nistry of Foreign Affairs and International Develop- ment.  Finally, to assert its influence, France will increase  its investment in more informal international forums  in which the technical and academic communities and  the political decision-makers come together to discuss  the future balances.  > Contributing to the global stability of cyberspace  by assisting voluntary countries to establish cyber- security capabilities.  Digital transition, the bearer of political, social and  economic opportunities, is far from being uniformly  controlled in all countries. This harms the security  and development of States that are less protected, and  weakens all digital environments on an international  level.   In order to contribute to a reliable and sustainable  roll-out of digital technologies in all countries, and in  particular the developing ones, France owes it to itself  to assist in reinforcing the capabilities of countries  that would like to increase the resilience and security  of their information systems, notably in terms of the  protection of critical infrastructures and the combat  against cybercrime.   To ensure the durability and sustainability of pro- jects to reinforce capabilities, France will preferably  act through long-term trustworthy partnerships.  This  action should also enable France to reinforce its own  cybersecurity.      Text and illustrations Licence Ouverte/Open Licence (Etalab — V1) Illustration credit : Marc Renaudin",

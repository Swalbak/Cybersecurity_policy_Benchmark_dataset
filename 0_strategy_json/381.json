During this period, information and communications technology has proven to be an important factor in productivity growth and innovative power. The Netherlands is the European leader in responding to technological trends and the effective use of ICT tools and skills. The Netherlands is also an international internet hub, has the world’s most competitive internet market and has one of the highest number of internet users. Safeguarding digital security and freedom and maintaining an open and innovative digital domain are preconditions for the proper functioning of our society. Therefore, we published the first National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS1) in 2011. The purpose of the NCSS1 was to realise a secure, reliable and resilient digital domain through an integral cyber security approach based on public-private partnerships, as well as to seize the ensuing opportunities for society. Developments in the digital domain, both national and international, are taking place at a rapid rate. In recent years, the potential and actual impact of cyber security threats have become clearer due to a number of highly publicised incidents. These threats may not only disrupt our digital infrastructure, but may also compromise the integrity, availability and confidentiality of the information we document, analyse and exchange in the digital domain. In order to be able to continue to respond to these threats, the Netherlands plans to further strengthen and extend their alliances with public and private parties, both national and international. This involves not viewing cyber security as an isolated element, but rather in correlation with human rights, internet freedom, privacy, social-economic benefits and innovation. The National Cyber Security Strategy 2 (NCSS2) explains this broader government vision on cyber security and states responsibilities and concrete steps. About 130 parties, including public and private parties, knowledge institutions and social organisations, were involved in the drafting of this new cyber security strategy. Furthermore, extensive consultations were held with the wider ICT community. At the request of the government, the Cyber Security Board, consisting of representatives from public and private parties as well as the world of academia, gave recommendations about the course of the new strategy. With this strategy, the Netherlands wants to continue to be the world leader in the area of cyber security. Fortunately, we do not have to start from scratch. The Netherlands already has a solid digital infrastructure and has many internet pioneers and innovative ICT entrepreneurs who are active the world over. Furthermore, the Netherlands has a proven talent in building coalitions: not only within its borders, but also in the area of international peace and security. Together, we can create a secure, free and profitable digital domain. Everyone will have to take responsibility for his or her own digital resilience and for society’s digital resilience. The government is taking the lead with this new strategy and will publish annual reports about the progress made. The Minister of Security and Justice I.W.

The Netherlands has made substantial investments in the way in which it responds to technological trends and the effective use of ICT tools and skills. Partly for that reason, the Netherlands has become an international internet hub, with the world’s most competitive internet market and one of the highest number of internet users. As a result of this, the digital domain has become more intertwined with our daily lives. Having a secure digital domain is a precondition to making optimal use of the opportunities offered by digitisation to society. Cyber security refers to efforts to prevent damage caused by disruptions to, breakdowns in or misuse of ICT and to repair damage if and when it has occurred. Such damage may consist of any or all of the following: reduced reliability of ICT, limited availability and violation of the confidentiality and/or integrity of information stored in the ICT systems. In recent years, we have gained more insight into the threats and vulnerabilities in the digital domain. According to the Cyber Security Assessment Netherlands (CSBN), the biggest threats come from other states and professional criminals. The threats from other states mostly concern the theft of confidential or competition- sensitive information (cyber espionage), while professional criminals mainly focus on digital fraud and theft of information. Due to the increased complexity of, dependence on and vulnerability of ICT-based products and services, our digital resilience to these and other cyber threats is currently still insufficient. In addition to these threats, we are also facing other challenges in the digital domain. For instance, major international private parties have increased their influence in determining the rules in the digital domain, and the civil and military domains have become more intertwined. Furthermore, the international policy context of cyber security has become wider. Cyber security cannot be realised in isolation and therefore will have to be viewed in correlation with internet freedom, including freedom of speech and privacy, and social- economic benefits, in terms of the economic and social opportunities digitisation offers. All these developments require us to now take the next step in the approach to cyber security, based on the following vision: Working with international partners, the Netherlands aims to create a secure and open digital domain, in which the opportunities for our society offered by digitisation are used to the full, threats are countered effectively and fundamental rights and values are protected. The table on the next page provides a rough idea of the step we will take with the NCSS2. The correlation between security, freedom and social- economic benefits proposed in the NCSS2 is a dynamic balance that is intended to be realised in a constantly open and pragmatic dialogue between all stakeholders, both national and international. For this, we need a clear governance model. The underlying fundamental principle is that the responsibilities that apply in the physical domain should also be taken in the digital domain. In order to bring the dialogue about cyber security between the various stakeholders to a new level Executive summary 1 The digital domain is the conglomerate of ICT tools and services and comprises all entities that can be or are digitally linked. The domain comprises both permanent, temporary or local connections, as well as information, such as data and programme codes, located in this domain where geographical limitations do not apply. 8 | National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2 From awareness to capability of maturity, the following three management areas are of the utmost importance: (self) regulation, transparency and knowledge development. These themes have been included in this strategy in various forms. The government will play a more active role in the digital domain. On the one hand, by increasing investments in the security of its own networks and services and, on the other hand, by bringing parties together and by taking action if the security of companies and private individuals or the latter’s privacy come under threat. Where necessary, the government will establish frameworks and standards, for instance when it comes to the security requirements of vital services and processes. Private individuals are expected to apply some form of ‘cyber hygiene’ (basic security measures) and to take a certain amount of personal responsibility. For their part, the government and the business community will facilitate this by improving their digital skils and by emphasising their duty of care with respect to their clients. This also includes offering secure ICT products and services. Companies and government bodies have to be accountable for their responsibility in this respect and practise transparency about which cyber security measures they take and about how they handle user data. It is the government’s goal to enable citizens and businesses to digitally and safely handle their affairs with the government by 2017. The Netherlands also plans to promote the outlined integral approach on an international, involving all parties, which is aimed the correlation between security, freedom and social-economic benefits. The Netherlands wants to play a prominent role in the search for new coalitions for defence, diplomacy and development in which all parties involved are represented, in order to reach internationally accepted standards related to actions in the digital domain. Therefore, the Netherlands works actively towards international cooperation and will take up a clear position as cyber security mediator and hub. Based on the vision, the government aims to realise the following ambitions: The Netherlands is a leader in cyber security: – Dutch society knows how to make safe, optimal use of the advantages of digitisation. – Dutch businesses and the research community are pioneers in ‘security by design’ and ‘privacy by design’. – Together with its international partners, the Netherlands is part of a progressive coalition that seeks to protect fundamental rights and values in the digital domain. The realisation of these ambitions will be detailed on the basis of the following strategic objectives which serve as a guideline to the 2014-206 action programme. 2 Not all parties in the Netherlands are sufficiently aware of cyber security. We will have to continue to give it our attention. ncSS1 ncSS2 Public-private partnership Private-public participation Focus on structures Focus on networks / strategic coalitions Formulation of multi-stakeholder model Clarifying the relationships between the various stakeholders Capacity-building in the Netherlands Capacity-building both in the Netherlands and abroad General approach: deploy wide capacity for resilience-increasing measures Risk-based approach: balance between protection of interests, threat to interests and acceptable risks in society Formulation of fundamental principles Presentation of (policy) vision From ignorance to awareness From awareness to capability2 National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2 From awareness to capability | 9 Annual progress reports will be drawn up and the action programme will be updated when necessary. 1. The Netherlands is resilient to cyber attacks and protects its vital interests in the digital domain. 2. The Netherlands tackles cyber crime. 3. The Netherlands invests in secure ICT products and services that protect privacy. 4. The Netherlands builds coalitions for freedom, security and peace in the digital domain. 5. The Netherlands has sufficient cyber security knowledge and skills and invests in ICT innovation to attain cyber security objectives. The following themes are central elements of the objectives: 1 Risk analyses, security requirements and information sharing within critical infrastructure sectors Within the framework of the protection of critical infrastructure, the government, working with vital parties, identifies critical ICT-dependent systems, services and processes. These efforts are linked to a programme that will establish basic security requirements on the basis of risk analyses. 2 More active approach to cyber espionage The Dutch government is committed to raising awareness among citizens, businesses, organisation and government bodies about information security and privacy. The government also ensures that the issue is prioritised within the intelligence and security services, which will be given the tools to better document cyber threats and investigate and combat advanced attacks. To this end, the intelligence and security services have combined their cyber capabilities in the Joint Sigint Cyber Unit (JSCU). 3 Feasibility study on separate vital network An exploratory study is conducted to determine whether it is possible and useful, from both a technical and organisational perspective, to create a separate ICT network for public and private vital processes. A separate network widens the range of options for safeguarding the continuity of vital processes. It also makes it possible to set up private, cloud-based data storage, thus strengthening the privacy and integrity of the data in storage or in the cloud concerned. 4 Enhancing civil-military cooperation Civil and military domains within the digital domain have become more intertwined. Therefore, options for deploying the digital capabilities of the Netherlands Defence organisation on a national level in preventing and countering attacks on the civil infrastructure will be detailed. The central question is how to optimally share knowledge and expertise between civil parties and the Defence organisation. Government private individuals business ncSS2 transparancy knowledge (self)regulation Security Social-economic benefits Freedom 10 | National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2 From awareness to capability 5 Strengthening the National Cyber Security Centre The position of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is bolstered by means of a stronger structure for confidential information-sharing and analysis. Furthermore, the NCSC assumes the role of expert authority, providing advice to private and public parties involved, both when asked and at its own initiative. Finally, based on its own detection capability and its triage role in crises, the NCSC develops into Security Operations Centre (SOC)3 in addition to its role as a Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT). 6 International approach to cyber crime: updating and strengthening legislation (including the Criminal Code). There is a need for effective, swift and efficient investigation of cyber crime in accordance with clear rules. Scarce capabilities have to be targetedly deployed among vulnerable sectors and groups. The Netherlands assumes a vanguard role in harmonising legislation governing international investigations, for instance in the Council of Europe. The Netherlands will also work to strengthen and expand international partnerships like EC3, at Europol. 7 Supported standards, ‘security by design’ and ‘privacy by design’ Together with private sector partners, the government works to develop standards that can be used to protect and improve the security of ICT products and services. 8 Cyber diplomacy: hub for expertise for conflict prevention The Netherlands aims to develop a hub for expertise on international law and cyber security. The goal of the hub for expertise is to promote the peaceful use of the digital domain. To this end, the Netherlands combines knowledge from existing centres. The centre brings together international experts and policymakers, diplomats, military personnel and NGOs. 9 Taskforce on cyber security education To enlarge the pool of cyber security experts and enhance users’ proficiency with cyber security, the business community and the government join forces to improve the quality and breadth of ICT education at all academic levels (primary, secondary and professional education). A PPP taskforce on cyber security education is set up which will focus on giving advice about cyber security education. 10 Encouraging innovation in cyber security There is a need for more coordination of supply and demand, which can be achieved by linking innovation initiatives to leading sector policy. In addition, the government, the business community and the world of academia will launch a cyber security innovation platform where start-ups, established companies, students and researchers can connect, inspire one another and attune research supply and demand. The PPP implementation of the second edition of the National Cyber Security Research Agenda (NCSRA) will also contribute to this development. 3 In addition to response, SOC comprises other aspects from the cyber security chain, such as awareness, resilience, detection, alerting, reporting and crisis management. National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2 From awareness to capability | 11 We are taking the step from being aware to being capable. Expertise development, transparency and (self-) regulation are essential means to realise this. 12 | National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2 From awareness to capability More products and services are being connected with each other and with the internet. How safe is this and what does it mean for our privacy? National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2 From awareness to capability | 13 1.1 inTroducTion The digital domain4 has become more intertwined with our daily lives. Citizens, government bodies and businesses are using digital applications for online interactions, transactions, more efficient collaboration, communication and entertainment. More equipment with integrated ICT services is connected to the internet: computers and telephones, but also cars, thermostats and medical equipment. This increasing digitisation is not only for ease, efficiency and pleasure, but is also an important drive behind innovation and economic growth. Key indicators of internet use in the netherlands5 – In 2012, the Netherlands had 1.2 million internet users. – The Netherlands has the most competitive internet market and the second highest percentage of computers per household in the world (94% of all households). – The Dutch are pioneers in using innovative, digital services: 95% of Dutch youth use social media; the Netherlands is the front runner in online banking in Europe, and in 2012, circa 10 million Dutch people shopped online. – The turnover of the Dutch ICT sector amounted to 29.8 billion euros in 2011, which is 5% of the GDP. – The ICT sector in the Netherlands is the most innovative in the world. More than two-thirds of Dutch ICT businesses conducted research or other innovative activities in the period between 2008 and 2010. – In fact, the Netherlands functions as the digital gateway to Europe. Together with Germany and the United Kingdom, the Netherlands is responsible for 18% of worldwide internet traffic, owing to the three major internet hubs in Amsterdam, Berlin and London. The risks associated with ICT use have become increasingly clear in recent years due to a number of highly publicised incidents6. The advent of cloud services, mobile services and innovative, ICT-based applications nearly always usher in new vulnerabilities. Cyber security refers to efforts to prevent damage caused by disruptions to, breakdowns in or misuse of ICT and to repair damage if and when it has occurred. Such damage may consist of any or all of the following: reduced reliability of ICT, limited availability and violation of the confidentiality and/or integrity of information stored in the ICT systems. Increasing the Netherlands’ digital resilience cannot be achieved by the government alone, as the ICT infrastructure itself and knowledge about this infrastructure is largely in the hands of national and international private parties. Therefore, cyber security is the sum of joint efforts of government bodies, the business community, organisations and citizens, both on a national and international level. Just like in the physical world, 100% security in the digital domain can never be achieved. 1 The importance of cyber security 4 The digital domain is the conglomerate of ICT tools and services and comprises all entities that can be or are digitally linked. The domain comprises both permanent, temporary or local connections, as well as information, such as data and programme codes, located in this domain where geographical limitations do not apply. 5 ICT Knowledge and Economy 2012, Statistics Netherlands. 6 For instance: the DigiNotar incident, a hacked municipal waste water system and the Pobelka botnet. 14 | National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2 From awareness to capability 7 The five vital interests are: territorial security, physical security, economic security, ecological security, and social and political stability. 8 International Security Strategy, 21 June 2013 9 Defense Cyber Strategy, House of Representatives 2011 – 2013, 33 321, no. 1 10 Letter to Parliament ‘Digital Agenda.nl’, House of Representatives 2010 – 2011, 29 515, no. 331 11 Vision letter on the digital government, House of Representatives 2012 – 2013, 26 643, no. 280 12 Government view on e-privacy: on the road to justified trust. 24 May 2013 13 The EU Cyber Security Strategy ‘Protection of an open and free internet and opportunities in the digital world’ (February 2013) and associated draft directives: Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to ensure a high common level of network and information security across the Union (February 2013). Relation of the NCSS2 to strategic policy documents: The NCSS2 follows on from the insights and recommendations arising from the following strategic policy documents: – The National Security Strategy (NV Strategy) is aimed at preventing the compromise of vital national interests that may lead to social disruption.7 Both in 2010 (cyber conflict) and in 2012 (cyber espionage), cyber security scenarios were included in the NV Strategy. – The International Security Strategy8is aimed at actions taken by the Netherlands abroad and in cooperation with other countries to secure its interests. Cyber security is an important theme in this strategy, which is best acted on in collaboration with our European and international partners. – The Defence Cyber Strategy9 is aimed at the role of the Netherlands armed forces in the digital domain. An important element in this strategy is that it acknowledges that military and civil, public and private, national and international actors have become more intertwined. – In its Digital Agenda10, the Dutch government focuses on ICT being able to contribute to the country’s economic growth. In the Digital Agenda, the government formulates its ambitions for using ICT to further growth and prosperity, including the required preconditions, for having an open, reliable and swift infrastructure and for having sufficient ICT knowledge and making sufficient use of such expertise. – The information security awareness strategy11 for government administrators and managers. With the Taskforce on Management, Information Security and Services, the government pursues an active awareness policy to get the government’s information security at the desired level. This is not only an important precondition for the implementation of the government’s plans concerning the concept of the digital government 2017, but also in view of the Government-Wide Implementation Agenda for eGovernment Services until 2015 (i-NUP), in which a basic infrastructure will be realised. – The ePrivacy Letter12 describes preconditions for a sound protection of personal details privacy, in particular in the relationships between citizens and businesses. – The EU Cyber Security Strategy13, which was launched in 2013 is an important step towards a secure digital environment in Europe. The Dutch NCSS2 is in line with the fundamental principles of the EU Cyber Security Strategy, based on which the Netherlands is taking new steps. – In the autumn of 2013, a medium-term vision on the telecommunications market was presented to the House of Representatives. The starting point of the vision is that the telecommunications market cannot be viewed as being separate from developments on the internet and that public values such as reliability and openness have to be reviewed by the telecommunications market in light of the broader context of internet economics. National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2 From awareness to capability | 15 1.2 ThreaTS In July 2013, the third Cyber Security Assessment Netherlands (CSBN) was published. The findings from this edition of the CSBN14 are an important source for a risk- approach15 to cyber security. The CSBN shows that the biggest threats come from other states and professional criminals. States form a threat particularly in the form of theft of confidential or competition-sensitive information (digital espionage) of businesses, government bodies and citizens. Several states have made substantial investments in cyber capabilities and therefore have highly advanced equipment at their disposal. These states’ digital espionage activities are likely to be widespread, and many of these activities are currently undetected. Professional criminals also continue to pose a substantial threat. Digital fraud and theft of information are the two most common crimes among professional criminals. Citizens, businesses and governments alike regularly fall victim to botnets and ransomware. Furthermore, a criminal cyber services sector, through which ‘cyber- crime-as-a-service’ is made commercially available, has expressly become visible. Access to such remedies has become cheaper and more low threshold for criminals. Despite the fact that good initiatives and measures have been taken to increase resilience to and awareness of such crimes, also based on the NCSS, society’s vulnerability is still on the increase. At many organisations, digital resilience is still below par. Relatively simple yet important technical basic measures, like the timely updating of systems or password policies, are often not implemented. Furthermore, many organisations are struggling with legacy systems. Replacing these outdated systems, on which often a vital part of an organisation’s information provision facilities depend, is a complex and expensive problem. 1.3 challenGeS Future developments in cyber security are hard to predict. However, a clear picture can be painted of the challenges which currently and in the long-term influence the security and openness of the digital domain: – The Internet of Things (everything is connected to the internet) and hyperconnectivity (everything is connected to each other) promotes innovation and results in usability. At the same time, it raises the question of whether or not digitally linked products and services are actually safe and what the implications may be for privacy. – The amount of data available in digital form is only increasing; as will the interest in acquiring such data. Governments and businesses, increasingly working with large data files, which are also increasingly stored in the cloud, are faced with increased risks. – The playing field in the digital domain is not only determined by states, but also by major private market parties. Governance in the digital domain is therefore complex and cannot always be solved in traditional forums, as it requires a multi-stakeholder approach. This applies to security standards as well as to the protection of fundamental rights and values. – In the cyber domain, we see an increasingly interwovenness of civil and military domains due to substantial mutual dependence on similar ICT systems and application and the complex attribution issue. When it comes to the Dutch contingent deployed abroad, we have to take into consideration that civil targets in the Netherlands may be subject to cyber attacks. Furthermore, in case of large-scale attacks, the Defence organisation’s cyber capabilities may be called upon to protect the vital national civil infrastructure. In view of the above, clear parameters for strengthened cooperation in the digital domain are needed. – The increased complexity and dependence on ICT-based products and services require a higher level of expertise. This both concerns the level of expertise of average internet users and sufficiently-qualified experts. The Netherlands is expected to have a shortage of 6,800 IT workers in 2017.16 14 The NCSC publishes the CSBN each year and is produced in close cooperation with public and private parties. 15 The risks desribed are determined based on three correlated factors: interests, threats and resilience. 16 Based on estimations of Nederland ICT. 16 | National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2 From awareness to capability Cyber security cannot be achieved in isolation and will have to be approached in correlation with subjects like fundamental rights, values and social-economic benefits. National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2 From awareness to capability | 17 Working with international partners, the Netherlands aims to create a secure and open digital domain, in which the opportunities for our society offered by digitisation are used to the full, threats are countered effectively and fundamental rights and values are protected. 2.1 inTroducTion: To a new approach and worKinG MeThod In 2011, we published the first National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS1). A lot has happened since then. The partners within the National Cyber Security Centre have succeeded in gaining a better insight into threats. The third Cyber Security Assessment Netherlands has made a more focused approach possible. Furthermore, the international implementation has gained importance. Agreements about cooperation, standards of conduct and standards will have to be made in a European, and wider international, context. The international policy context has also become wider. Cyber security cannot be achieved in isolation and will have to be approached in correlation with subjects like fundamental rights, values and social-economic benefits. All these developments require us to now take the next step in the approach to cyber security, The table below provides a rough idea of the step we will take with the NCSS2. 2.2 SecuriTy, FreedoM and Social-econoMic beneFiTS Cyber security measures require a tailor-made approach. This is shaped in three ways. Firstly, by tailoring measures to the problem they are intended to solve (risk-based), secondly, by always viewing cyber security in correlation with social-economic benefits, more specifically the economic and social opportunities digitisation offers and thirdly, by guaranteeing fundamental rights and values. This correlation between security, freedom and social- economic benefits is a dynamic balance that is intended to be realised in a constantly open and pragmatic dialogue between all stakeholders, both national and international. 2 Vision 17 Not all parties in the Netherlands are sufficiently aware of cyber security. We will have to continue to give it our attention. ncSS1 ncSS2 Public-private partnership Private-public participation Focus on structures Focus on networks / strategic coalitions Formulation of multi-stakeholder model Clarifying the relationships between the various stakeholders Capacity-building in the Netherlands Capacity-building both in the Netherlands and abroad General approach: deploy wide capacity for resilience-increasing measures Risk-based approach: balance between protection of interests, threat to interests and acceptable risks in society Formulation of fundamental principles Presentation of (policy) vision From ignorance to awareness From awareness to capability17 18 | National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2 From awareness to capability 2.2.1. SECURITy Cyber security concerns ICT security and the security of information stored in ICT systems. Disruptions to ICT-based services and processes may have major social consequences, and a disruption to vital services and processes may even lead to social unrest. Protecting personal information, state secrets and other sensitive information is vital for ensuring the trust parties have in the digital domain. Processing personal information and the protection of privacy is subject to strict standards and supervision, partly based on European legislation. Recent revelations about secret activities of states aimed at acquiring information underline the importance of raising awareness about information security among all stakeholders, as well as the necessity to increase our critical infastructures resilience to such activities. A wide approach by the entire ICT security chain is required to reach the desired level of security18. It starts with having insight into the threats and a sound preventative approach, but it also requires parties to adopt an effective response strategy. This also means that criminals in the digital domain will have to be successfully stopped. There is a need for clarification regarding the role of the police service as well as for updated options and powers to realise an effective investigation and prosecution. 2.2.2 FREEDOM Protecting fundamental rights and values requires many parties to make an effort and preferably takes place in a national and international context. The proposed approach entails the development of international standards. In addition to governments, an important role can be played by private sector parties and social organisations. The Netherlands is promoting this approach internationally, at the United Nations, during international cyberspace conferences, like the ones held in London, Budapest and Seoul, in other multi- stakeholder settings like the Internet Governance Forum, by promoting the principles of cyber security as published by the World Economic Forum, and in developing trust- inspiring measures between states, like the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). A good example of the multi-stakeholder approach is the Freedom Online Coalition which was initiated by the Netherlands and of which 21 countries have become a member and who jointly form a powerful lobby. The Netherlands aims to promote the growth of this coalition. We now have to take it a step further and have the starting points we developed become an integral part of meetings about cyber security standards, and incorporate them into the design of new and innovative products and services. 18 The security chain comprises: pro-action, prevention, preparing, repression and after-care (repair).

Social-economic benefits both concerns economic growth and the options digitisation offers society, for instance in the form of education applications, options for maintaining social contacts, but also improved government facilities. The government’s goal of enabling citizens and businesses to digitally handle their affairs with the government by 2017 will make an extra impact in the realisation of iGovernment.19 This will only enhance the social importance of iGovernment. Security and cyber security measures are therefore vital and require making some necessary investments. Organisations have increasingly realised that by investing in cyber security, they can prevent major costs and a damaged reputation. This strategy is aimed at encouraging Dutch companies viewing cyber security as a competitive advantage. Critical consumers have started to attach more and more importance to security and privacy, which is an opportunity for Dutch companies to invest in innovative products and services that take these things into account in the design stages. The government intends to play a stimulating role in this development by means of including cyber security requirements in its purchase conditions. 2.3 clear roleS, acTive parTicipanTS The digital domain comprises an abundance of parties and actors who have become increasingly connected to each other and dependent on each other. In order to be able to act safely in the digital domain, which is characterised by a great (chain) dependence between the parties, it is important for citizens, organisations and government bodies to actively participate (‘do democracy’20), based on a clear allocation of roles and a great degree of transparency. The underlying fundamental principle is that the responsibilities that apply in the physical domain should also be taken in the digital domain. How these roles relate to one another will become clear in the future. The direction in which the actors are moving is explained here. 2.3.1 THE INTERVENING GOVERNMENT: FACILITATE, PROTECT AND CONTROL Security is one of the government’s core tasks, and this also applies to the digital domain. Countering cyber crime and cyber espionage and the prevention of social disruption caused by cyber incidents therefore are important priorities for the government. The starting points are a risk-based approach, strengthened cooperation and setting the right example by investing in the security of its own networks and services. In addition, the government is responsible for the online security and privacy and citizens. The protection of valuable and personal information of citizens and businesses and tackling cyber crime therefore remain the focal points. In May 2013, the government’s vision on e-privacy was published. The aim is to enable citizens to better control their personal information through the inclusion of the requirement of consent. Organisations are obliged to carefully, transparently and legally handle any information issued by citizens, and citizens should be able to call organisation to account. Finally, the government has a duty to promote and facilitate initiatives aimed at increasing cyber security. If required, the government also acts in a controlling manner, which may include determining regulations and standards, for instance for the vital sectors. In consultation with the vital sectors, the government is establishing cyber security requirements where this has not been already done. Existing sectoral regulatory authorities will have to widen their scope, if they have not already done so, to also include cyber security, in which overlap should be prevented. As an expert authority, the NCSC gives advice, both when asked and at its own initiative, when major vulnerabilities are detected or in the event of (imminent) crisis situations. It is then up to the organisations themselves to implement the recommendations, or to be transparent about their reasons for not doing so. This is particularly important when it concerns government bodies, also with respect to the regulatory authorities and/or line ministries. 19 Vision letter on the digital government 2017, 23 May 2013, reference number 2013-0000306907 20 Government standpoint on the promotion of a vital society, the ‘do democracy’, Parliamentary Papers II, 2012-2013, 33400-VII no. 79 20 | National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2 From awareness to capability 2.3.2 THE COMPETENT CITIzEN: CyBER HyGIENE AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITy Citizens are expected to apply some form of basic ‘cyber hygiene’ and skills in using ICT, like surfing the web. This includes carefully using personal information, installing updates, using good passwords and balancing functionality and cyber security. The government works to increase the digital resilience of government, citizens and the business world. It aims to achieve this by means of awareness campaigns, strengthening digital skills, research and innovation and supporting social organisations and initiatives in the context of the ‘do democracy’. A policy that supports responsible disclosure and removes obstacles also fits in with this context. This also enables conscious and involved citizens to safely inform government bodies, businesses and institutions about detected vulnerabilities in their ICT security. 2.3.3 RESPONSIBLE BUSINESSES: DUTy OF CARE AND ACCOUNTABILITy Citizens can no longer be expected to completely understand and assess the security and privacy aspects of ever more complex ICT services and -products, as offered by major international players. This clearly leaves room for ICT suppliers and producers. Security by design and privacy by design should more than currently be standard design principles. Providers of ICT networks and services or other ICT- based services have a specific responsibility (duty of care) with respect to their clients. The substantiation of this responsibility must preferably be achieved by means of self-regulation. An example is the fight against botnets, in which Internet Service Providers (ISPs) play a vital role. The dependencies in the digital domain are also expressed in the chain of producers, providers and clients. These mutual dependencies will have to be discussed by the chain partners in order to conclude joint agreements about minimum requirements, interoperability and reliable information-sharing. This also makes it possible to strengthen the security of the entire chain. Insurance companies can play a major role in insuring residual risks. 2.3.4 (SELF) REGULATION, TRANSPARENCy AND KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPMENT AS CONTROL MECHANISMS The Netherlands is working to realise an active participation of citizens, businesses and government in the digital domain in the context of an ever increasing mutual dependence between these actors and a complex environment in which a balance between security, freedom and social-economic benefits is constantly pursued. This means that steps have to be taken from unaware via aware to capable. In order to make this movement towards a new level of cyber security maturity possible, the following three management areas are of the utmost importance: (self) regulation, transparency and knowledge development. These themes have been included in this strategy in various forms. (Self) regulation concerns the development of standards but also concepts like the duty of care. Transparency is a precondition for strenghtening trust between the actors. Examples of transparency are clear reports about measures taken by the government and the business world to improve cyber security and privacy measures. Knowledge development in the broadest sense of the word (awareness, education, innovation) is necessary to ensure that all actors can take their responsibility and optimally benefit from the opportunities offered by digitisation. 2.4 inTernaTional viSion and uSe: an inTeGraTed approach As an open economy, the Netherlands benefits from a stable and freely accessible digital domain. In view of the fact that cyber security and international cooperation are inextricably linked, the Netherlands will promote its integral public-private cyber security approach outside its own borders. The approach developed in which defence, diplomacy and development come together in international missions to increase stability in the area concerned (crisis management and nation building) is the inspiration for the integral Dutch use of the digital domain21. The Netherlands wants to play a prominent role in the search for new coalitions in which all parties involved are represented in order to reach internationally accepted standards related to actions in the digital domain. To this end, the Netherlands works actively towards international cooperation and takes up a clear position as cyber security mediator and hub. 2.4.1 DEFENCE Defence in the digital domain not only concerns military capabilities, but also the wide civil range of capabilities 21 This is also called the 3D approach. National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2 From awareness to capability | 21 of intelligence and security services, the police service, national cyber security centres and businesses with their own response capabilities. This is a complex whole in which good agreements and coordination are preconditions, both national and international. Strengthened civil-military cooperation is therefore necessary. In order to safeguard the deployability of the Netherlands armed forces and to increase the effectiveness of the armed forces, the Defence organisation is increasing its digital resilience and is developing its own capabilities to conduct cyber operations within the applicable statutory parameters. This concerns both the capability to protect its networks and systems from attacks and the capability to take offensive measures. The Defence organisation’s digital capabilities can be deployed nation-wide at the request of civil authorities. These capabilities will also be deployed in international operations, both as part of our own capabilities and for the benefit of strengthening or building the capabilities of local authorities. In doing so, the capabilities of the armed forces contribute to the integrated approach proposed by the Netherlands. NATO may play an important role as a facilitator, including promoting national capability build-up, improved information exchange and interoperability and public-private cooperation. The Netherlands also strives to participate in exercises and to strengthen EU-NATO cooperation, in which the overlap of capabilities should be avoided. Cooperation in the area of defence in an EU context will be mostly aimed at crisis management, pan- European exercises and the effective investigation and prosecution of cyber crime. In an international context, the Netherlands continues to promote the importance of a broader ratification of the Convention on Cybercrime of the Council of Europe (Budapest Convention). A good cooperation between national Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) is of vital importance for swift actions and an early detection of threats, vulnerabilities and incidents. In the Netherlands, the NCSC fulfils this role. A further expansion and strengthening of existing alliances like the EGC and FIRST is a priority for the Netherlands. Flexibility and mutual trust are of paramount importance in these alliances. 2.4.2 DIPLOMACy The Netherlands attaches great importance to mechanisms that ensure stability in the digital domain. We do this by investing in formal and informal alliances, within and outside of Europe, globally and in multi- stakeholder settings. Therefore, with its position in the area of international law, the Netherlands wants to contribute to the discussions about the application of legal rules in the digital domain. In addition, cyber diplomacy instruments will have to be defined. This may be in the form of so-called trust-inspiring measures, ‘rules of the road’, or standards of conduct.22 With The Hague as the city of international peace and security, the Netherlands aims to develop into an ‘international centre of cyber diplomacy’ where diplomats, policymakers and cyber experts come together. 2.4.3 DEVELOPMENT Threats in the digital domain transcend boundaries. Therefore, the Netherlands can benefit from countries being able to counter such threats. The NCSC focuses on strengthening CERT capabilities in countries that request its support in this matter. The Netherlands also supports capability building in the EU by means of, among other things, the implementation of the EU Cyber Security Strategy. The associated objective is to create a basic level of security and a level playing field. Promoting the cyber security approach in a European framework will be an important issue during the Netherlands’ EU presidency in 2016. Particular themes promoted by the Netherands in a European context, in addition to the forementioned strenghtened CERT cooperation, are: – Maintaining open standards, content and interoperability of the internet – Promoting innovation of secure ICT products (security by design) – Security requirements for new and existing (embedded) ICT. 22 The starting point for the Netherlands in this context are the UN’s Manifesto and the Geneva and The Hague Conventions. 22 | National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2 From awareness to capability Proficient users and a sufficient number of cyber security professionals are necessary for making optimal use of the opportunities offered by digitisation and for being resilient to the ever more advanced threats. National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2 From awareness to capability | 23 The Dutch vision on cyber security is translated into a concrete approach, and is described in this chapter. Section 3.1 states the Dutch ambitions in the area of cyber security and the strategic objectives that support cyber security. Sections 3.2 up to and including 3.6 clarify the NCSS2 objectives, and the most important focal points are clarified per objective. The action programme is included in Annexe 1. The action programme states the action items that are implemented in the NCSS2 context. 3.1 aMbiTion and STraTeGic GoalS Based on the vision, the government aims to realise the following ambitions: The Netherlands is a leader in cyber security: – Dutch society knows how to make safe, optimal use of the advantages of digitisation. – Dutch businesses and the research community are pioneers in ‘security by design’ and ‘privacy by design’. – Together with its international partners, the Netherlands is part of a progressive coalition that seeks to protect fundamental rights and values in the digital domain. The realisation of these ambitions is given shape based on the strategic objectives below. These objectives are the central themes of the 2014-2016 action programme. Annual progress reports will be drawn up and the action programme is updated when necessary. 1. The Netherlands is resilient to cyber attacks and protects its vital interests in the digital domain. 2. The Netherlands tackles cyber crime. 3. The Netherlands invests in secure ICT products and services that protect privacy. 4. The Netherlands builds coalitions for freedom, security and peace in the digital domain. 5. The Netherlands has sufficient cyber security knowledge and skills and invests in ICT innovation to attain cyber security objectives. 3.2 The neTherlandS iS reSilienT To cyber aTTacKS and proTecTS iTS viTal inTereSTS in The diGiTal doMain Our critical infrastructure increasingly depends on ICT systems. Disruptions to these systems or a violation of the confidentiality of information stored in such systems by states and criminals have a major impact. It may even lead to social disruption. There is an increased interwovenness of military and civil dimensions, public and private dimensions, and national and international dimensions in the digital domain. For instance, national security may be threatened by a large-scale cyber attack on one or more private organisations23. The speed with which such attacks can occur and develop requires a swift, coordinated and flexible response and an early involvement of the most important parties involved. Therefore, it is of major importance that we gain more insight into the critical processes and services, and in the risks they may run. It is similarly important to critically view the underlying ICT chain structure and ‘legacy’ systems. Based on this risk-based approach, we will increase the resilience of vital services and processes and work to an effective joint public-private and civil-military response, and with the help of our international partners. 1 Risk analyses, security requirements and information sharing within critical infrastructure sectors Within the framework of the protection of critical infrastructure, the government, working with vital parties, will identify critical ICT-dependent systems, services and processes. These efforts are linked to a programme that will establish basic security requirements on the basis of risk analyses. In addition, a training programme for response to large-scale ICT incidents is set up. In cooperation with its partners, the National Cyber Security Centre sets up a national detection and response network for the central government and other vital sectors. Provided with safeguards related to confidentiality and privacy, these 3 Approach 23 Highly-publicised digital attacks that have caused major damage or that could have been substantially disruptive, such as DigiNotar in the Netherlands, Stuxnet in Iran and the cyber attack on Aramco in Saudi Arabia, were not aimed at military targets, but at strategic civil targets. 24 | National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2 From awareness to capability networks will work to a real-time analysis and sharing of threat information. 2 More active approach to cyber espionage The Dutch government is committed to raising awareness among citizens, businesses, organisation and government bodies about information security and privacy. This means that awareness campaigns will partly focus on increasing knowledge and insight into the risks of cyber espionage. On the other hand, the government also ensures that the issue is prioritised within the intelligence and security services, which are given the tools to better document cyber threats and investigate and combat advanced attacks. To this end, the intelligence and security services have combined their cyber capabilities in the Joint Sigint Cyber Unit (JSCU). Furthermore, the government will prioritise a better protection of data citizens share with the government and being more transparent about data management. 3 Feasibility study on separate vital network An exploratory study is conducted to determine whether it is possible and useful, from both a technical and organisational perspective, to create a separate ICT network for public and private vital processes. A separate network widens the range of options for safeguarding the continuity of vital processes. It also makes it possible to set up private, cloud-based data storage, thus strengthening the privacy and integrity of the data in storage or in the cloud concerned. 4 Enhancing civil-military cooperation Digital means increasingly form an integral part of military actions. In order to safeguard the deployability of the Netherlands armed forces and to increase the effectiveness of the armed forces, the Defence organisation is increasing its digital resilience and is developing its own capabilities to conduct cyber operations . Civil and military domains within the digital domain have become more intertwined. Therefore, options for deploying the digital capabilities of the Netherlands Defence organisation on a national level in preventing and countering attacks on the civil infrastructure will be detailed. The central question is how to optimally share knowledge and expertise between civil parties and the Defence organisation. 5 Strengthening the National Cyber Security Centre In a short period of time, the NCSC has developed into the key entity in the public-private cyber security network. At the same time and in part due to the large number of incidents, expectations regarding the role of the NCSC have grown. In order to give shape to this, the position of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is bolstered by means of a stronger structure for confidential information-sharing and analysis. Furthermore, in its capacity as the expert authority, the NCSC provides advice to private and public parties involved, both when asked and at its own initiative. Finally, based on its own detection capability and its triage role in crises, the NCSC is developing into a Security Operations Centre (SOC), in addition to its role as a Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)24. 3.3 The neTherlandS TacKleS cyber criMe Cyber crime is a frequently occurring and increasing threat for all citizens and organisations in the digital domain. In order to offer adequate protection from cyber crime, the Netherlands will prioritise the fight against cyber crime by means of strengthening the current capabilities in the area of investigation and prosecution. Updated legislation, a close cooperation and informa- tion-exchange between the various players involved is of the utmost importance. The Netherlands will actively pursue national and international alliances, for instance in an EU framework, and deepen such alliances to achieve an all-encompassing and bold approach to cyber crime. 6 International approach to cyber crime: updating and strengthening legislation (including the Criminal Code). There is a need for effective, swift and efficient investigation of cyber crime in accordance with clear rules. Scarce capabilities have to be targetedly deployed among vulnerable sectors and groups. The Netherlands will assume a vanguard role in harmonising legislation governing international investigations, for instance in the Council of Europe. The Netherlands will also work to strengthen and expand international partnerships like the European Cyber Crime Centre EC3, at Europol. This international cooperation will also eventually include, in the long term, a detailed form of arbitration between countries when they are not satisfied with the assistance offered by the investigation process. The Netherlands actively participates in international meetings and related activities, such as the Committee of Contracting States of the Council of Europe, the Convention on Cybercrime, the ‘EU policy cycle on organised crime’, and the discussions 24 In addition to response, SOC comprises other aspects from the cyber security chain, such as awareness, resilience, detection, alerting, reporting and crisis management. National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2 From awareness to capability | 25 within UNODC about a UN treaty in the area of cyber crime. In the Netherlands itself, a bill is being passed that will bestow more powers on the police service and the Public Prosecution Service in investigating cyber crime in the digital domain. 3.4 The neTherlandS inveSTS in Secure icT producTS and ServiceS ThaT proTecT privacy An increasing amount of ICT-based products and services are linked to public networks, such as the internet, which for its part is linked to other products and services. This development offers many advantages, but also introduces new security risks. In the physical domain, it is customary to set security and quality requirements to products and services before they are marketed. However, in the digital domain, this is not common practice yet. For instance, the impact and side-effects of ICT products or services such as online investments or online shopping are hardly included in deliberations of whether or not to use them. Security and privacy requirements help organisations and citizens with protecting themselves against security risks. The government’s digital service provision should set an example. Innovation, security and privacy in the design phase of products and services can not only be successfully combined, but they can also support these products and services in distinguishing them from the competition. The efforts of the government and the business world should therefore be focused on making this rewarding. Cooperation with international partners is an essential element in this process. 7 Supported standards, ‘security by design’ and ‘privacy by design’ Together with private sector partners, the government is working to develop standards that can be used to protect and improve the security of ICT products and services. To this end, the government in an international context will also enter into a dialogue with relevant private parties and will act in a framework-developing and standards- developing fashion to protect the privacy and security of users. Wherever possible, this also takes place in a European or wider international context, and a link is being sought with existing international standards and good practices25. By including standards in tendering requirements stimulates the government to implement it as a ‘launching customer’. 3.5 The neTherlandS buildS coaliTionS For FreedoM, SecuriTy and peace in The diGiTal doMain The Netherlands benefits from a stable, free and accessible digital domain and therefore wants to continue to play a leading role in the protection of this domain. With The Hague as the city of peace and security, the Netherlands aims to develop standards in a multi-stakeholder context and to protect fundamental rights and values in cyberspace. Furthermore, the Netherlands in cooperation with its international partners will work to preventing and fighting conflicts in the digital domain. Effectively responding to these conflicts is not only limited to the digital domain, but also requires an integrated approach, as is the case with other security threats. Use of traditional elements such as diplomacy, imposing sanctions, capability building and Defence capabilities have to be adjusted to the specific character of the digital domain. In light of this objective, cyber capabilities that fit in with the 3D approach (Development, Diplomacy, Defence) are being developed. 8 Cyber diplomacy: hub for expertise for conflict prevention The Netherlands aims to develop a hub for expertise on international law and cyber security in order to promote the peaceful use of the digital domain. To this end, the Netherlands combines knowledge from existing centres. The centre brings together international experts and policymakers, diplomats, military personnel and NGOs. This creates a network that brings together multidisciplinary knowledge about subjects such as international standards for conflict prevention, civil- military cooperation and non-proliferation of cyber weapons in the digital domain. The network also contributes to discussions about this subject. This forms the basis for a series of multi-stakeholder, high-level meetings. 3.6 The neTherlandS haS SuFFicienT cyber SecuriTy KnowledGe and SKillS and inveSTS in icT innovaTion To aTTain cyber SecuriTy obJecTiveS Until now, cyber security has been underexposed in education. Proficient users and sufficient cyber security professionals are necessary for making optimal use of the opportunities offered by digitisation and for being resilient to the ever more advanced threats. Cyber 25 In Dutch society, the Forum and Standardisation Authority promote interoperability and the application of open standards through a list of recommended and compulsory standards for the (semi) public sector. 26 | National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2 From awareness to capability security professionals are also needed to design and build the cyber security solutions of the future. The Netherlands has plenty of talented IT workers. However, their skills need to be honed as early as secondary school and then continued in top degree programmes in senior secondary vocational education, at a university of applied sciences or in university education. For this reason, the Netherlands has opted for a wide approach, ranging from primary education to higher education, and from work-based training to university, and from the board room to the coal face. In addition to education and training, awareness campaigns remain important. In order to be able to take the step from being aware to becoming capable, these campaigns will be used in a more targeted manner and more attention will be paid to the perspectives for action of the target group. An excellent cyber security knowledge infrastructure not only works in support of our society’s resilience, it also offers opportunities for developing expertise and for finding niches. This requires an attractive research and education climate to be created in which cyber security plays a prominent role. A multidisciplinary approach in which the non-technical sub-areas are also included is needed to promote cyber security innovation. The innovative products and services that are developed in this manner will help the Netherlands with anticipating swift technological and other developments in the digital domain. Dutch design (in security) can also become a quality mark for security and privacy in ICT products and services, thereby contributing to economic growth. 9 Taskforce on cyber security education To enlarge the pool of cyber security experts and enhance users’ proficiency with cyber security, the business community and the government have joined forces to improve the quality and breadth of ICT education at all academic levels (primary, secondary and professional education). A PPP taskforce on cyber security education will be set up which will focus on giving advice about the cyber security curriculum, in relation to the certification of information security experts and the further development of learning modules, among other things. For the time being, connections are being sought with current initiatives regarding information sciences education and the Technology Pact 2020. 10 Encouraging innovation in cyber security Technological developments in the digital domain are taking place at an alarming rate. This means that being able to anticipate them is a vital element. Innovation arises where creative people and experts meet. This alone, however, is not enough. There is a need for more coordination of supply and demand, which can be achieved by linking26 innovation initiatives to leading sector policy. In addition, the government, the business community and the world of academia will launch a cyber security innovation platform where start-ups, established companies, students and researchers can connect and inspire one another. In organising a follow- up to the SBIT research programme in 2012-2013, the government contributes to this. The farther-reaching PPP implementation of the second edition of the National Cyber Security Research Agenda (NCSRA) will also contribute to this development. 3.7 a JoinT eFForT The government and the Netherlands have big ambitions in the area of cyber security and comprise a broader long-term vision. This vision reflects the importance of and opportunities offered by ICT to our society and our economy, as well as the current threats and risks.  A joint effort made by all parties involved is required, in which each of the parties is expected to take own responsibility.  Therefore, the government has invited many organisations from government bodies and the business world to help with developing the strategy.  Unfortunately, financial means are limited due to the current economic climate. In the present strategy, the long-term ambition has been given shape in the 2014-2016 action programme (see also Annexe 1), which is detailed within the scope of the regular departmental budgets and the partners’ budgets. Entirely in line with the move initiated by the action programme, the government will implement the broader strategy through participation, reprioritisation, smart coalitions and an integrated approach, which in its entirety will respond to increased problems that threaten our prosperity and wellbeing. The long-term ambition also shows that realising a secure digital domain – also in the long term – is by no means an ambition that is free of obligations. This ambition is given more shape in the future action programmes and will have to fall within the scope of the financial parameters that will be in place at that time. Therefore, the details regarding the implementation of the actions stated in the annexes take place in consultation and/or cooperation with private parties and the government bodies involved. 26 Such as the National Cyber Security Research Agenda (NCSRA) and The Hague Security Delta (HSD).

During this period,  information  and communications technology has proven to be an   important factor in productivity growth and  innovative  power. The Netherlands is the European leader in   responding to technological trends and the  effective  use of ICT tools and skills. The Netherlands is also  an  international internet hub, has the world’s most   competitive internet market and has one of the highest  number of internet users.   Safeguarding digital security and freedom and   maintaining an open and innovative digital domain are  preconditions for the proper functioning of our society.  Therefore, we published the first National Cyber Security  Strategy (NCSS1) in 2011. The purpose of the NCSS1 was  to realise a secure, reliable and resilient digital domain  through an integral cyber security approach based on  public-private partnerships, as well as to seize the ensuing  opportunities for society.   Developments in the digital domain, both national and  international, are taking place at a rapid rate. In recent  years, the potential and actual impact of cyber  security  threats have become clearer due to a number of highly   publicised incidents. These threats may not only  disrupt  our digital infrastructure, but may also  compromise  the integrity, availability and confidentiality of the   information we document, analyse and exchange in the  digital domain.   In order to be able to continue to respond to these  threats, the Netherlands plans to further strengthen  and extend their alliances with public and private  parties, both national and international. This involves  not viewing cyber security as an isolated element, but  rather in correlation with human rights, internet freedom,  privacy, social-economic benefits and innovation. The  National Cyber Security Strategy 2 (NCSS2) explains this  broader government vision on cyber security and states  responsibilities and concrete steps.   About 130 parties, including public and private parties,  knowledge institutions and social organisations, were  involved in the drafting of this new cyber security strategy.   Furthermore, extensive consultations were held with the  wider ICT community. At the request of the government,  the Cyber Security Board, consisting of representatives  from public and private parties as well as the world of  academia, gave recommendations about the course of the  new strategy.  With this strategy, the Netherlands wants to continue  to be the world leader in the area of cyber security.   Fortunately, we do not have to start from scratch. The   Netherlands already has a solid digital  infrastructure  and has many internet pioneers and innovative  ICT  entrepreneurs who are active the world over.   Furthermore, the Netherlands has a proven talent in  building coalitions: not only within its borders, but also  in the area of international peace and security. Together,  we can create a secure, free and profitable digital domain.  Everyone will have to take responsibility for his or her own  digital resilience and for society’s digital resilience. The  government is taking the lead with this new strategy and  will publish annual reports about the progress made.  The Minister of Security and Justice I.W.

The Netherlands has made  substantial investments in the way in which it responds  to technological trends and the effective use of ICT tools  and skills. Partly for that reason, the Netherlands has  become an international internet hub, with the world’s  most competitive internet market and one of the highest  number of internet users. As a result of this, the digital  domain has become more intertwined with our daily  lives. Having a secure digital domain is a precondition  to making optimal use of the opportunities offered by  digitisation to society.   Cyber security refers to efforts to prevent damage caused by  disruptions to, breakdowns in or misuse of ICT and to repair  damage if and when it has occurred.    Such damage may consist of any or all of the following:  reduced reliability of ICT, limited availability and violation of  the confidentiality and/or integrity of information stored in the  ICT systems.    In recent years, we have gained more insight into  the threats and vulnerabilities in the digital domain.  According to the Cyber Security Assessment Netherlands  (CSBN), the biggest threats come from other states and  professional criminals. The threats from other states  mostly concern the theft of confidential or  competition- sensitive information (cyber espionage), while  professional criminals mainly focus on digital fraud and  theft of information. Due to the increased complexity of,  dependence on and vulnerability of ICT-based products  and services, our digital resilience to these and other  cyber threats is currently still insufficient.  In addition to these threats, we are also facing other  challenges in the digital domain. For instance, major  international private parties have increased their  influence in determining the rules in the digital domain,  and the civil and military domains have become more  intertwined. Furthermore, the international policy  context of cyber security has become wider. Cyber  security cannot be realised in isolation and therefore will  have to be viewed in correlation with internet freedom,  including freedom of speech and privacy, and social- economic benefits, in terms of the economic and social  opportunities digitisation offers.   All these developments require us to now take the next  step in the approach to cyber security, based on the  following vision:   Working with international partners, the Netherlands aims  to create a secure and open digital domain, in which the  opportunities for our society offered by digitisation are used  to the full, threats are countered effectively and fundamental  rights and values are protected.   The table on the next page provides a rough idea of the  step we will take with the NCSS2.  The correlation between security, freedom and social- economic benefits proposed in the NCSS2 is a dynamic  balance that is intended to be realised in a constantly  open and pragmatic dialogue between all stakeholders,  both national and international. For this, we need a  clear governance model. The underlying fundamental  principle is that the responsibilities that apply in the  physical domain should also be taken in the digital  domain. In order to bring the dialogue about cyber  security between the various stakeholders to a new level   Executive   summary  1 The digital domain is the conglomerate of ICT tools and services and comprises all entities that can be or are digitally linked. The domain comprises both permanent,   temporary or local connections, as well as information, such as data and programme codes, located in this domain where geographical limitations do not apply.    8  |  National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2    From awareness to capability  of maturity, the following three management areas are  of the utmost importance: (self) regulation, transparency  and knowledge development. These themes have been  included in this strategy in various forms.  The government will play a more active role in the digital  domain. On the one hand, by increasing investments in  the security of its own networks and services and, on the  other hand, by bringing parties together and by taking  action if the security of companies and private individuals  or the latter’s privacy come under threat. Where  necessary, the government will establish frameworks  and standards, for instance when it comes to the security  requirements of vital services and processes.    Private individuals are expected to apply some form of  ‘cyber hygiene’ (basic security measures) and to take  a certain amount of personal responsibility. For their  part, the government and the business community  will facilitate this by improving their digital skils and  by emphasising their duty of care with respect to their  clients. This also includes offering secure ICT products  and services. Companies and government bodies have  to be accountable for their responsibility in this respect  and practise transparency about which cyber security  measures they take and about how they handle user  data. It is the government’s goal to enable citizens and  businesses to digitally and safely handle their affairs with  the government by 2017.  The Netherlands also plans to promote the outlined  integral approach on an international, involving all  parties, which is aimed the correlation between security,  freedom and social-economic benefits.   The Netherlands wants to play a prominent role in  the search for new coalitions for defence, diplomacy  and development in which all parties involved are  represented, in order to reach internationally accepted  standards related to actions in the digital domain.   Therefore, the Netherlands works actively towards  international cooperation and will take up a clear position  as cyber security mediator and hub.   Based on the vision, the government aims to realise the  following ambitions:  The Netherlands is a leader in cyber security:  – Dutch society knows how to make safe, optimal use of the   advantages of digitisation.  – Dutch businesses and the research community are pioneers in   ‘security by design’ and ‘privacy by design’.  – Together with its international partners, the Netherlands   is part of a progressive coalition that seeks to protect  fundamental rights and values in the digital domain.  The realisation of these ambitions will be detailed on the  basis of the following strategic objectives which serve as  a guideline to the 2014-206 action programme.   2 Not all parties in the Netherlands are sufficiently aware of cyber security. We will have to continue to give it our attention.  ncSS1 ncSS2  Public-private partnership Private-public participation   Focus on structures Focus on networks / strategic coalitions  Formulation of multi-stakeholder model  Clarifying the relationships between the various stakeholders   Capacity-building in the Netherlands Capacity-building both in the Netherlands and abroad  General approach: deploy wide capacity for resilience-increasing  measures  Risk-based approach: balance between protection of interests,  threat to interests and acceptable risks in society  Formulation of fundamental principles Presentation of (policy) vision   From ignorance to awareness From awareness to capability2    National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2    From awareness to capability  |  9   Annual progress reports will be drawn up and the action  programme will be updated when necessary.  1. The Netherlands is resilient to cyber attacks and   protects its vital interests in the digital domain.  2. The Netherlands tackles cyber crime.  3. The Netherlands invests in secure ICT products and   services that protect privacy. 4. The Netherlands builds coalitions for freedom, security   and peace in the digital domain. 5. The Netherlands has sufficient cyber security    knowledge and skills and invests in ICT innovation  to attain cyber security objectives.   The following themes are central elements of the  objectives:  1 Risk analyses, security requirements and information  sharing within critical infrastructure sectors  Within the framework of the protection of critical  infrastructure, the government, working with vital  parties, identifies critical ICT-dependent systems,  services and processes. These efforts are linked  to a programme that will establish basic security  requirements on the basis of risk analyses.  2 More active approach to cyber espionage The Dutch government is committed to raising  awareness among citizens, businesses, organisation   and government bodies about information security and  privacy. The government also ensures that the issue is  prioritised within the intelligence and security services,  which will be given the tools to better document cyber  threats and investigate and combat advanced attacks.  To this end, the intelligence and security services have  combined their cyber capabilities in the Joint Sigint Cyber  Unit (JSCU).  3 Feasibility study on separate vital network An exploratory study is conducted to determine whether  it is possible and useful, from both a technical and  organisational perspective, to create a separate ICT  network for public and private vital processes. A separate  network widens the range of options for safeguarding  the continuity of vital processes. It also makes it possible  to set up private, cloud-based data storage, thus  strengthening the privacy and integrity of the data in  storage or in the cloud concerned.  4 Enhancing civil-military cooperation Civil and military domains within the digital domain  have become more intertwined. Therefore, options for  deploying the digital capabilities of the Netherlands  Defence organisation on a national level in preventing  and countering attacks on the civil infrastructure will be  detailed. The central question is how to optimally share  knowledge and expertise between civil parties and the  Defence organisation.  Government  private  individuals  business  ncSS2 transparancy  knowledge (self)regulation  Security  Social-economic benefits  Freedom     10  |  National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2    From awareness to capability  5  Strengthening the National Cyber Security Centre The position of the National Cyber Security Centre  (NCSC) is bolstered by means of a stronger structure  for confidential information-sharing and analysis.  Furthermore, the NCSC assumes the role of expert  authority, providing advice to private and public parties  involved, both when asked and at its own initiative.   Finally, based on its own detection capability and its  triage role in crises, the NCSC develops into Security  Operations Centre (SOC)3 in addition to its role as a  Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT).   6 International approach to cyber crime: updating and  strengthening legislation (including the Criminal  Code).  There is a need for effective, swift and efficient  investigation of cyber crime in accordance with clear  rules. Scarce capabilities have to be targetedly deployed  among vulnerable sectors and groups. The Netherlands  assumes a vanguard role in harmonising legislation  governing international investigations, for instance in  the Council of Europe. The Netherlands will also work to  strengthen and expand international partnerships like  EC3, at Europol.   7 Supported standards, ‘security by design’ and ‘privacy  by design’  Together with private sector partners, the government  works to develop standards that can be used to protect  and improve the security of ICT products and services.   8 Cyber diplomacy: hub for expertise for conflict   prevention  The Netherlands aims to develop a hub for expertise  on international law and cyber security. The goal of the  hub for expertise is to promote the peaceful use of the  digital domain. To this end, the Netherlands combines  knowledge from existing centres. The centre brings  together international experts and policymakers,  diplomats, military personnel and NGOs.   9 Taskforce on cyber security education To enlarge the pool of cyber security experts and enhance  users’ proficiency with cyber security, the business  community and the government join forces to improve  the quality and breadth of ICT education at all academic  levels (primary, secondary and professional education).   A PPP taskforce on cyber security education is set up  which will focus on giving advice about cyber security  education.   10 Encouraging innovation in cyber security There is a need for more coordination of supply and  demand, which can be achieved by linking innovation  initiatives to leading sector policy. In addition, the  government, the business community and the world of  academia will launch a cyber security innovation platform  where start-ups, established companies, students and  researchers can connect, inspire one another and attune  research supply and demand. The PPP implementation  of the second edition of the National Cyber Security  Research Agenda (NCSRA) will also contribute to this  development.  3 In addition to response, SOC comprises other aspects from the cyber security chain, such as awareness, resilience, detection, alerting, reporting and crisis management.    National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2    From awareness to capability  |  11   We are taking the step from being aware  to being capable. Expertise development,  transparency and (self-) regulation are  essential means to realise this.     12  |  National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2    From awareness to capability  More products and services are being  connected with each other and with the  internet. How safe is this and what does  it mean for our privacy?    National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2    From awareness to capability  |  13   1.1 inTroducTion The digital domain4 has become more intertwined  with our daily lives. Citizens, government bodies and  businesses are using digital applications for online  interactions, transactions, more efficient collaboration,  communication and entertainment. More equipment  with integrated ICT services is connected to the internet:  computers and telephones, but also cars, thermostats  and medical equipment. This increasing digitisation is  not only for ease, efficiency and pleasure, but is also an  important drive behind innovation and economic growth.  Key indicators of internet use in the netherlands5  – In 2012, the Netherlands had 1.2 million internet users.  – The Netherlands has the most competitive internet   market and the second highest percentage of computers   per household in the world (94% of all households).  – The Dutch are pioneers in using innovative, digital   services: 95% of Dutch youth use social media; the   Netherlands is the front runner in online banking in   Europe, and in 2012, circa 10 million Dutch people   shopped online.   – The turnover of the Dutch ICT sector amounted to   29.8 billion euros in 2011, which is 5% of the GDP.  – The ICT sector in the Netherlands is the most innovative   in the world. More than two-thirds of Dutch ICT   businesses conducted research or other innovative   activities in the period between 2008 and 2010.  – In fact, the Netherlands functions as the digital gateway   to Europe. Together with Germany and the United   Kingdom, the Netherlands is responsible for 18% of   worldwide internet traffic, owing to the three major   internet hubs in Amsterdam, Berlin and London.  The risks associated with ICT use have become  increasingly clear in recent years due to a number of  highly publicised incidents6. The advent of cloud services,  mobile services and innovative, ICT-based applications  nearly always usher in new vulnerabilities.     Cyber security refers to efforts to prevent damage caused by  disruptions to, breakdowns in or misuse of ICT and to repair  damage if and when it has occurred.    Such damage may consist of any or all of the following:  reduced reliability of ICT, limited availability and violation of  the confidentiality and/or integrity of information stored in the  ICT systems.    Increasing the Netherlands’ digital resilience cannot  be achieved by the government alone, as the ICT  infrastructure itself and knowledge about this  infrastructure is largely in the hands of national and  international private parties. Therefore, cyber security  is the sum of joint efforts of government bodies, the  business community, organisations and citizens, both on  a national and international level. Just like in the physical  world, 100% security in the digital domain can never be  achieved.  1 The importance of   cyber security  4 The digital domain is the conglomerate of ICT tools and services and comprises all entities that can be or are digitally linked.   The domain comprises both permanent, temporary or local connections, as well as information, such as data and programme   codes, located in this domain where geographical limitations do not apply.  5 ICT Knowledge and Economy 2012, Statistics Netherlands.  6 For instance: the DigiNotar incident, a hacked municipal waste water system and the Pobelka botnet.    14  |  National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2    From awareness to capability  7 The five vital interests are: territorial security, physical security, economic security, ecological security, and social and political stability.  8 International Security Strategy, 21 June 2013  9 Defense Cyber Strategy, House of Representatives 2011 – 2013, 33 321, no. 1  10 Letter to Parliament ‘Digital Agenda.nl’, House of Representatives 2010 – 2011, 29 515, no. 331  11 Vision letter on the digital government, House of Representatives 2012 – 2013, 26 643, no. 280  12 Government view on e-privacy: on the road to justified trust. 24 May 2013  13 The EU Cyber Security Strategy ‘Protection of an open and free internet and opportunities in the digital world’ (February 2013) and associated draft   directives: Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to ensure a high common level of network and   information security across the Union (February 2013).  Relation of the NCSS2 to strategic policy documents:   The NCSS2 follows on from the insights and   recommendations arising from the following strategic   policy documents:  – The National Security Strategy (NV Strategy) is aimed   at preventing the compromise of vital national   interests that may lead to social disruption.7 Both in   2010 (cyber conflict) and in 2012 (cyber espionage),   cyber security scenarios were included in the NV   Strategy.   – The International Security Strategy8is aimed at actions   taken by the Netherlands abroad and in cooperation   with other countries to secure its interests. Cyber   security is an important theme in this strategy, which   is best acted on in collaboration with our European   and international partners.   – The Defence Cyber Strategy9 is aimed at the role   of the Netherlands armed forces in the digital   domain. An important element in this strategy is   that it acknowledges that military and civil, public   and private, national and international actors have   become more intertwined.  – In its Digital Agenda10, the Dutch government focuses   on ICT being able to contribute to the country’s   economic growth. In the Digital Agenda, the   government formulates its ambitions for using ICT to   further growth and prosperity, including the required   preconditions, for having an open, reliable and swift   infrastructure and for having sufficient ICT knowledge   and making sufficient use of such expertise.  – The information security awareness strategy11 for   government administrators and managers. With the   Taskforce on Management, Information Security   and Services, the government pursues an active   awareness policy to get the government’s information   security at the desired level. This is not only an   important precondition for the implementation   of the government’s plans concerning the concept   of the digital government 2017, but also in view of   the Government-Wide Implementation Agenda for   eGovernment Services until 2015 (i-NUP), in which a   basic infrastructure will be realised.  – The ePrivacy Letter12 describes preconditions for   a sound protection of personal details privacy, in   particular in the relationships between citizens and   businesses.  – The EU Cyber Security Strategy13, which was launched   in 2013 is an important step towards a secure digital   environment in Europe. The Dutch NCSS2 is in line   with the fundamental principles of the EU Cyber   Security Strategy, based on which the Netherlands is   taking new steps.  – In the autumn of 2013, a medium-term vision on the   telecommunications market was presented to the   House of Representatives. The starting point of the   vision is that the telecommunications market cannot   be viewed as being separate from developments   on the internet and that public values such as   reliability and openness have to be reviewed by the   telecommunications market in light of the broader   context of internet economics.     National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2    From awareness to capability  |  15   1.2 ThreaTS In July 2013, the third Cyber Security Assessment  Netherlands (CSBN) was published. The findings from this  edition of the CSBN14 are an important source for a risk- approach15 to cyber security. The CSBN shows that the  biggest threats come from other states and professional  criminals.   States form a threat particularly in the form of theft  of confidential or competition-sensitive information  (digital espionage) of businesses, government bodies  and citizens. Several states have made substantial  investments in cyber capabilities and therefore have  highly advanced equipment at their disposal. These  states’ digital espionage activities are likely to be  widespread, and many of these activities are currently  undetected.  Professional criminals also continue to pose a substantial  threat. Digital fraud and theft of information are the two  most common crimes among professional criminals.  Citizens, businesses and governments alike regularly  fall victim to botnets and ransomware. Furthermore,  a criminal cyber services sector, through which  ‘cyber- crime-as-a-service’ is made commercially available, has  expressly become visible. Access to such remedies has  become cheaper and more low threshold for criminals.   Despite the fact that good initiatives and measures  have been taken to increase resilience to and  awareness of such crimes, also based on the NCSS,  society’s vulnerability is still on the increase. At many  organisations, digital resilience is still below par.  Relatively simple yet important technical basic measures,  like the timely updating of systems or password  policies, are often not implemented. Furthermore,  many organisations are struggling with legacy systems.  Replacing these outdated systems, on which often a vital  part of an organisation’s information provision facilities  depend, is a complex and expensive problem.   1.3 challenGeS Future developments in cyber security are hard to  predict. However, a clear picture can be painted of the  challenges which currently and in the long-term influence  the security and openness of the digital domain:  – The Internet of Things (everything is connected to the internet)  and hyperconnectivity (everything is connected to each other)  promotes innovation and results in usability. At the  same time, it raises the question of whether or not  digitally linked products and services are actually safe  and what the implications may be for privacy.  – The amount of data available in digital form is only increasing;  as will the interest in acquiring such data. Governments  and businesses, increasingly working with large data  files, which are also increasingly stored in the cloud, are  faced with increased risks.   – The playing field in the digital domain is not only determined by  states, but also by major private market parties. Governance  in the digital domain is therefore complex and cannot  always be solved in traditional forums, as it requires a  multi-stakeholder approach. This applies to security  standards as well as to the protection of fundamental  rights and values.  – In the cyber domain, we see an increasingly interwovenness  of civil and military domains due to substantial mutual   dependence on similar ICT systems and application and the  complex attribution issue. When it comes to the Dutch  contingent deployed abroad, we have to take into   consideration that civil targets in the Netherlands may  be subject to cyber attacks. Furthermore, in case of  large-scale attacks, the Defence organisation’s cyber  capabilities may be called upon to protect the vital  national civil infrastructure. In view of the above, clear  parameters for strengthened cooperation in the digital  domain are needed.  – The increased complexity and dependence on ICT-based   products and services require a higher level of expertise.  This both concerns the level of expertise of average  internet users and sufficiently-qualified experts. The  Netherlands is expected to have a shortage of 6,800 IT  workers in 2017.16  14 The NCSC publishes the CSBN each year and is produced in close cooperation with public and private parties.   15 The risks desribed are determined based on three correlated factors: interests, threats and resilience.  16 Based on estimations of Nederland ICT.    16  |  National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2    From awareness to capability  Cyber security cannot be achieved in  isolation and will have to be  approached in correlation with subjects  like fundamental rights, values and  social-economic benefits.     National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2    From awareness to capability  |  17    Working with international partners, the Netherlands aims  to create a secure and open digital domain, in which the  opportunities for our society offered by digitisation are used  to the full, threats are countered effectively and fundamental  rights and values are protected.   2.1 inTroducTion: To a new approach and   worKinG MeThod In 2011, we published the first National Cyber Security  Strategy (NCSS1). A lot has happened since then. The  partners within the National Cyber Security Centre have  succeeded in gaining a better insight into threats. The  third Cyber Security Assessment Netherlands has made  a more focused approach possible. Furthermore, the  international implementation has gained importance.  Agreements about cooperation, standards of conduct  and standards will have to be made in a European, and  wider international, context. The international policy  context has also become wider. Cyber security cannot be  achieved in isolation and will have to be approached in  correlation with subjects like fundamental rights, values   and social-economic benefits. All these developments  require us to now take the next step in the approach to  cyber security,   The table below provides a rough idea of the step we will  take with the NCSS2.  2.2 SecuriTy, FreedoM and Social-econoMic  beneFiTS Cyber security measures require a tailor-made approach.  This is shaped in three ways. Firstly, by tailoring measures  to the problem they are intended to solve (risk-based),  secondly, by always viewing cyber security in correlation  with social-economic benefits, more specifically the  economic and social opportunities digitisation offers and  thirdly, by guaranteeing fundamental rights and values.  This correlation between security, freedom and social- economic benefits is a dynamic balance that is intended  to be realised in a constantly open and pragmatic  dialogue between all stakeholders, both national and  international.   2 Vision   17 Not all parties in the Netherlands are sufficiently aware of cyber security. We will have to continue to give it our attention.  ncSS1 ncSS2  Public-private partnership Private-public participation   Focus on structures Focus on networks / strategic coalitions  Formulation of multi-stakeholder model  Clarifying the relationships between the various stakeholders   Capacity-building in the Netherlands Capacity-building both in the Netherlands and abroad  General approach: deploy wide capacity for resilience-increasing  measures  Risk-based approach: balance between protection of interests,  threat to interests and acceptable risks in society  Formulation of fundamental principles Presentation of (policy) vision   From ignorance to awareness From awareness to capability17    18  |  National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2    From awareness to capability  2.2.1. SECURITy Cyber security concerns ICT security and the security  of information stored in ICT systems. Disruptions to  ICT-based services and processes may have major social  consequences, and a disruption to vital services and  processes may even lead to social unrest. Protecting  personal information, state secrets and other sensitive  information is vital for ensuring the trust parties have in  the digital domain.    Processing personal information and the protection of  privacy is subject to strict standards and supervision,  partly based on European legislation. Recent revelations  about secret activities of states aimed at acquiring  information underline the importance of raising  awareness about information security among all  stakeholders, as well as the necessity to increase our  critical infastructures resilience to such activities.  A wide approach by the entire ICT security chain is  required to reach the desired level of security18. It  starts with having insight into the threats and a sound  preventative approach, but it also requires parties to  adopt an effective response strategy. This also means  that criminals in the digital domain will have to be  successfully stopped. There is a need for clarification  regarding the role of the police service as well as for  updated options and powers to realise an effective  investigation and prosecution.  2.2.2 FREEDOM Protecting fundamental rights and values requires many  parties to make an effort and preferably takes place  in a national and international context. The proposed  approach entails the development of international  standards. In addition to governments, an important  role can be played by private sector parties and social  organisations. The Netherlands is promoting this  approach internationally, at the United Nations, during  international cyberspace conferences, like the ones  held in London, Budapest and Seoul, in other  multi- stakeholder settings like the Internet Governance Forum,  by promoting the principles of cyber security as published  by the World Economic Forum, and in developing trust- inspiring measures between states, like the Organisation  for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).  A good example of the multi-stakeholder approach is  the Freedom Online Coalition which was initiated by  the Netherlands and of which 21 countries have become  a member and who jointly form a powerful lobby. The  Netherlands aims to promote the growth of this coalition.  We now have to take it a step further and have the  starting points we developed become an integral part of  meetings about cyber security standards, and incorporate  them into the design of new and innovative products and  services.  18 The security chain comprises: pro-action, prevention, preparing, repression and after-care (repair).  Government  private  individuals  business  ncSS2 transparancy  knowledge (self)regulation  Security  Social-economic benefits  Freedom     National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2    From awareness to capability  |  19    2.2.3 SOCIAL-ECONOMIC BENEFITS The innovative power of farther-reaching digitisation  is an important stimulus for social-economic benefits.  Social-economic benefits both concerns economic  growth and the options digitisation offers society, for  instance in the form of education applications, options  for maintaining social contacts, but also improved  government facilities. The government’s goal of enabling  citizens and businesses to digitally handle their affairs  with the government by 2017 will make an extra impact  in the realisation of iGovernment.19 This will only enhance  the social importance of iGovernment. Security and cyber  security measures are therefore vital and require making  some necessary investments.  Organisations have increasingly realised that by  investing in cyber security, they can prevent major costs  and a damaged reputation. This strategy is aimed at  encouraging Dutch companies viewing cyber security as a  competitive advantage.  Critical consumers have started to attach more and  more importance to security and privacy, which is an  opportunity for Dutch companies to invest in innovative  products and services that take these things into account  in the design stages. The government intends to play  a stimulating role in this development by means of  including cyber security requirements in its purchase  conditions.    2.3 clear roleS, acTive parTicipanTS The digital domain comprises an abundance of parties  and actors who have become increasingly connected  to each other and dependent on each other. In order  to be able to act safely in the digital domain, which is  characterised by a great (chain) dependence between  the parties, it is important for citizens, organisations  and government bodies to actively participate (‘do  democracy’20), based on a clear allocation of roles  and a great degree of transparency. The underlying  fundamental principle is that the responsibilities that  apply in the physical domain should also be taken in the  digital domain. How these roles relate to one another  will become clear in the future. The direction in which the  actors are moving is explained here.   2.3.1 THE INTERVENING GOVERNMENT: FACILITATE,   PROTECT AND CONTROL Security is one of the government’s core tasks, and  this also applies to the digital domain. Countering  cyber crime and cyber espionage and the prevention of  social disruption caused by cyber incidents therefore  are important priorities for the government. The  starting points are a risk-based approach, strengthened  cooperation and setting the right example by investing in  the security of its own networks and services.   In addition, the government is responsible for the  online security and privacy and citizens. The protection  of valuable and personal information of citizens and  businesses and tackling cyber crime therefore remain  the focal points. In May 2013, the government’s vision  on e-privacy was published. The aim is to enable citizens  to better control their personal information through the  inclusion of the requirement of consent. Organisations  are obliged to carefully, transparently and legally handle  any information issued by citizens, and citizens should be  able to call organisation to account.  Finally, the government has a duty to promote and  facilitate initiatives aimed at increasing cyber security.   If required, the government also acts in a controlling  manner, which may include determining regulations  and standards, for instance for the vital sectors. In  consultation with the vital sectors, the government is  establishing cyber security requirements where this  has not been already done. Existing sectoral regulatory  authorities will have to widen their scope, if they have not  already done so, to also include cyber security, in which  overlap should be prevented.  As an expert authority, the NCSC gives advice, both when  asked and at its own initiative, when major vulnerabilities  are detected or in the event of (imminent) crisis  situations. It is then up to the organisations themselves  to implement the recommendations, or to be transparent  about their reasons for not doing so. This is particularly  important when it concerns government bodies, also  with respect to the regulatory authorities and/or line  ministries.   19 Vision letter on the digital government 2017, 23 May 2013, reference number 2013-0000306907  20 Government standpoint on the promotion of a vital society, the ‘do democracy’, Parliamentary Papers II, 2012-2013, 33400-VII no. 79    20  |  National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2    From awareness to capability  2.3.2 THE COMPETENT CITIzEN: CyBER HyGIENE AND  PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITy Citizens are expected to apply some form of basic ‘cyber  hygiene’ and skills in using ICT, like surfing the web.  This includes carefully using personal information,  installing updates, using good passwords and balancing  functionality and cyber security. The government  works to increase the digital resilience of government,  citizens and the business world. It aims to achieve this by  means of awareness campaigns, strengthening digital  skills, research and innovation and supporting social  organisations and initiatives in the context of the ‘do  democracy’. A policy that supports responsible disclosure  and removes obstacles also fits in with this context. This  also enables conscious and involved citizens to safely  inform government bodies, businesses and institutions  about detected vulnerabilities in their ICT security.   2.3.3 RESPONSIBLE BUSINESSES: DUTy OF CARE AND   ACCOUNTABILITy Citizens can no longer be expected to completely  understand and assess the security and privacy aspects of  ever more complex ICT services and -products, as offered  by major international players. This clearly leaves room  for ICT suppliers and producers. Security by design and  privacy by design should more than currently be standard  design principles.    Providers of ICT networks and services or other ICT- based services have a specific responsibility (duty of care)  with respect to their clients. The substantiation of this  responsibility must preferably be achieved by means of  self-regulation. An example is the fight against botnets,  in which Internet Service Providers (ISPs) play a vital role.  The dependencies in the digital domain are also  expressed in the chain of producers, providers and  clients. These mutual dependencies will have to be  discussed by the chain partners in order to conclude  joint agreements about minimum requirements,  interoperability and reliable information-sharing. This  also makes it possible to strengthen the security of the  entire chain. Insurance companies can play a major role in  insuring residual risks.  2.3.4 (SELF) REGULATION, TRANSPARENCy AND   KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPMENT AS CONTROL MECHANISMS The Netherlands is working to realise an active  participation of citizens, businesses and government in   the digital domain in the context of an ever increasing  mutual dependence between these actors and a complex  environment in which a balance between security,  freedom and social-economic benefits is constantly  pursued.  This means that steps have to be taken from unaware  via aware to capable. In order to make this movement  towards a new level of cyber security maturity possible,  the following three management areas are of the  utmost importance: (self) regulation, transparency and  knowledge development. These themes have been  included in this strategy in various forms. (Self) regulation  concerns the development of standards but also concepts  like the duty of care. Transparency is a precondition for  strenghtening trust between the actors. Examples of  transparency are clear reports about measures taken by  the government and the business world to improve cyber  security and privacy measures. Knowledge development  in the broadest sense of the word (awareness, education,  innovation) is necessary to ensure that all actors can  take their responsibility and optimally benefit from the  opportunities offered by digitisation.  2.4 inTernaTional viSion and uSe: an inTeGraTed  approach As an open economy, the Netherlands benefits from a  stable and freely accessible digital domain. In view of the  fact that cyber security and international cooperation  are inextricably linked, the Netherlands will promote its  integral public-private cyber security approach outside  its own borders. The approach developed in which  defence, diplomacy and development come together in  international missions to increase stability in the area  concerned (crisis management and nation building) is  the inspiration for the integral Dutch use of the digital  domain21.   The Netherlands wants to play a prominent role in the  search for new coalitions in which all parties involved are  represented in order to reach internationally accepted  standards related to actions in the digital domain.  To this end, the Netherlands works actively towards  international cooperation and takes up a clear position  as cyber security mediator and hub.   2.4.1 DEFENCE Defence in the digital domain not only concerns military  capabilities, but also the wide civil range of capabilities   21 This is also called the 3D approach.    National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2    From awareness to capability  |  21   of intelligence and security services, the police service,  national cyber security centres and businesses with  their own response capabilities. This is a complex  whole in which good agreements and coordination  are preconditions, both national and international.  Strengthened civil-military cooperation is therefore  necessary.  In order to safeguard the deployability of the Netherlands  armed forces and to increase the effectiveness of the  armed forces, the Defence organisation is increasing its  digital resilience and is developing its own capabilities to  conduct cyber operations within the applicable statutory  parameters. This concerns both the capability to protect  its networks and systems from attacks and the capability  to take offensive measures. The Defence organisation’s  digital capabilities can be deployed nation-wide at the  request of civil authorities. These capabilities will also  be deployed in international operations, both as part of  our own capabilities and for the benefit of strengthening  or building the capabilities of local authorities. In doing  so, the capabilities of the armed forces contribute to the  integrated approach proposed by the Netherlands.   NATO may play an important role as a facilitator,  including promoting national capability build-up,  improved information exchange and interoperability and  public-private cooperation. The Netherlands also strives  to participate in exercises and to strengthen EU-NATO  cooperation, in which the overlap of capabilities should  be avoided.  Cooperation in the area of defence in an EU context  will be mostly aimed at crisis management, pan- European exercises and the effective investigation and  prosecution of cyber crime. In an international context,  the Netherlands continues to promote the importance of  a broader ratification of the Convention on Cybercrime  of the Council of Europe (Budapest Convention). A good  cooperation between national Computer Emergency  Response Teams (CERTs) is of vital importance for swift  actions and an early detection of threats, vulnerabilities  and incidents. In the Netherlands, the NCSC fulfils  this role. A further expansion and strengthening of  existing alliances like the EGC and FIRST is a priority  for the Netherlands. Flexibility and mutual trust are of  paramount importance in these alliances.  2.4.2 DIPLOMACy The Netherlands attaches great importance to  mechanisms that ensure stability in the digital domain.  We do this by investing in formal and informal alliances,  within and outside of Europe, globally and in multi- stakeholder settings. Therefore, with its position in  the area of international law, the Netherlands wants  to contribute to the discussions about the application  of legal rules in the digital domain. In addition, cyber  diplomacy instruments will have to be defined. This may  be in the form of so-called trust-inspiring measures,  ‘rules of the road’, or standards of conduct.22 With The  Hague as the city of international peace and security, the  Netherlands aims to develop into an ‘international centre  of cyber diplomacy’ where diplomats, policymakers and  cyber experts come together.  2.4.3 DEVELOPMENT Threats in the digital domain transcend boundaries.  Therefore, the Netherlands can benefit from countries  being able to counter such threats. The NCSC focuses on  strengthening CERT capabilities in countries that request  its support in this matter.  The Netherlands also supports capability building in the  EU by means of, among other things, the implementation  of the EU Cyber Security Strategy. The associated  objective is to create a basic level of security and a level  playing field. Promoting the cyber security approach in  a European framework will be an important issue during  the Netherlands’ EU presidency in 2016. Particular themes  promoted by the Netherands in a European context,  in addition to the forementioned strenghtened CERT  cooperation, are: – Maintaining open standards, content and   interoperability of the internet – Promoting innovation of secure ICT products (security   by design)  – Security requirements for new and existing (embedded)   ICT.  22 The starting point for the Netherlands in this context are the UN’s Manifesto and the Geneva and The Hague Conventions.    22  |  National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2    From awareness to capability  Proficient users and a sufficient number  of cyber security professionals are  necessary for making optimal use of the  opportunities offered by digitisation and  for being resilient to the ever more  advanced threats.    National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2    From awareness to capability  |  23   The Dutch vision on cyber security is translated into  a concrete approach, and is described in this chapter.  Section 3.1 states the Dutch ambitions in the area of cyber  security and the strategic objectives that support cyber  security. Sections 3.2 up to and including 3.6 clarify the  NCSS2 objectives, and the most important focal points  are clarified per objective. The action programme is  included in Annexe 1. The action programme states the  action items that are implemented in the NCSS2 context.  3.1 aMbiTion and STraTeGic GoalS Based on the vision, the government aims to realise the  following ambitions:  The Netherlands is a leader in cyber security:  – Dutch society knows how to make safe, optimal use of the   advantages of digitisation.  – Dutch businesses and the research community are pioneers   in ‘security by design’ and ‘privacy by design’.  – Together with its international partners, the Netherlands   is part of a progressive coalition that seeks to protect  fundamental rights and values in the digital domain.  The realisation of these ambitions is given shape based  on the strategic objectives below. These objectives are  the central themes of the 2014-2016 action programme.  Annual progress reports will be drawn up and the action  programme is updated when necessary.  1. The Netherlands is resilient to cyber attacks and  protects its vital interests in the digital domain.  2. The Netherlands tackles cyber crime.  3. The Netherlands invests in secure ICT products and   services that protect privacy. 4. The Netherlands builds coalitions for freedom,   security and peace in the digital domain. 5. The Netherlands has sufficient cyber security   knowledge and skills and invests in ICT innovation  to attain cyber security objectives.   3.2 The neTherlandS iS reSilienT To cyber   aTTacKS and proTecTS iTS viTal inTereSTS in   The diGiTal doMain Our critical infrastructure increasingly depends on ICT  systems. Disruptions to these systems or a violation  of the confidentiality of information stored in such   systems by states and criminals have a major impact. It  may even lead to social disruption. There is an increased  interwovenness of military and civil dimensions, public  and private dimensions, and national and international  dimensions in the digital domain. For instance, national  security may be threatened by a large-scale cyber attack  on one or more private organisations23. The speed with  which such attacks can occur and develop requires a  swift, coordinated and flexible response and an early  involvement of the most important parties involved.  Therefore, it is of major importance that we gain more   insight into the critical processes and services, and in the  risks they may run. It is similarly important to critically  view the underlying ICT chain structure and ‘legacy’  systems. Based on this risk-based approach, we will  increase the resilience of vital services and processes and  work to an effective joint public-private and civil-military  response, and with the help of our international partners.   1 Risk analyses, security requirements and information  sharing within critical infrastructure sectors Within the framework of the protection of critical  infrastructure, the government, working with vital  parties, will identify critical ICT-dependent systems,  services and processes. These efforts are linked  to a programme that will establish basic security  requirements on the basis of risk analyses.  In addition, a training programme for response to  large-scale ICT incidents is set up. In cooperation with  its partners, the National Cyber Security Centre sets  up a national detection and response network for the  central government and other vital sectors. Provided with  safeguards related to confidentiality and privacy, these   3 Approach   23 Highly-publicised digital attacks that have caused major damage or that could have been substantially disruptive, such as DigiNotar in the Netherlands, Stuxnet in Iran   and the cyber attack on Aramco in Saudi Arabia, were not aimed at military targets, but at strategic civil targets.    24  |  National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2    From awareness to capability  networks will work to a real-time analysis and sharing  of threat information.   2 More active approach to cyber espionage The Dutch government is committed to raising  awareness among citizens, businesses, organisation  and government bodies about information security  and privacy. This means that awareness campaigns will  partly focus on increasing knowledge and insight into  the risks of cyber espionage. On the other hand, the  government also ensures that the issue is prioritised  within the intelligence and security services, which are  given the tools to better document cyber threats and  investigate and combat advanced attacks. To this end,  the intelligence and security services have combined their  cyber capabilities in the Joint Sigint Cyber Unit (JSCU).  Furthermore, the government will prioritise a better  protection of data citizens share with the government  and being more transparent about data management.   3 Feasibility study on separate vital network An exploratory study is conducted to determine whether  it is possible and useful, from both a technical and  organisational perspective, to create a separate ICT  network for public and private vital processes. A separate  network widens the range of options for safeguarding  the continuity of vital processes. It also makes it possible  to set up private, cloud-based data storage, thus  strengthening the privacy and integrity of the data in  storage or in the cloud concerned.  4 Enhancing civil-military cooperation Digital means increasingly form an integral part of  military actions. In order to safeguard the deployability  of the Netherlands armed forces and to increase  the effectiveness of the armed forces, the Defence  organisation is increasing its digital resilience and  is developing its own capabilities to conduct cyber  operations . Civil and military domains within the digital  domain have become more intertwined. Therefore,  options for deploying the digital capabilities of the  Netherlands Defence organisation on a national level  in preventing and countering attacks on the civil  infrastructure will be detailed. The central question  is how to optimally share knowledge and expertise  between civil parties and the Defence organisation.  5 Strengthening the National Cyber Security Centre In a short period of time, the NCSC has developed into the   key entity in the public-private cyber security network.  At the same time and in part due to the large number of  incidents, expectations regarding the role of the NCSC  have grown. In order to give shape to this, the position  of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is bolstered  by means of a stronger structure for confidential  information-sharing and analysis. Furthermore, in its  capacity as the expert authority, the NCSC provides  advice to private and public parties involved, both when  asked and at its own initiative. Finally, based on its own  detection capability and its triage role in crises, the NCSC  is developing into a Security Operations Centre (SOC), in  addition to its role as a Computer Emergency Response  Team (CERT)24.  3.3 The neTherlandS TacKleS cyber criMe  Cyber crime is a frequently occurring and increasing  threat for all citizens and organisations in the digital  domain. In order to offer adequate protection from cyber  crime, the Netherlands will prioritise the fight against  cyber crime by means of strengthening the current  capabilities in the area of investigation and prosecution.  Updated legislation, a close cooperation and informa- tion-exchange between the various players involved is  of the utmost importance. The Netherlands will actively  pursue national and international alliances, for instance  in an EU framework, and deepen such alliances to achieve  an all-encompassing and bold approach to cyber crime.   6 International approach to cyber crime: updating and  strengthening legislation (including the Criminal  Code).  There is a need for effective, swift and efficient  investigation of cyber crime in accordance with clear  rules. Scarce capabilities have to be targetedly deployed  among vulnerable sectors and groups. The Netherlands  will assume a vanguard role in harmonising legislation  governing international investigations, for instance in  the Council of Europe. The Netherlands will also work to  strengthen and expand international partnerships like  the European Cyber Crime Centre EC3, at Europol. This  international cooperation will also eventually include,  in the long term, a detailed form of arbitration between  countries when they are not satisfied with the assistance  offered by the investigation process. The Netherlands  actively participates in international meetings and related  activities, such as the Committee of Contracting States of  the Council of Europe, the Convention on Cybercrime, the  ‘EU policy cycle on organised crime’, and the discussions   24  In addition to response, SOC comprises other aspects from the cyber security chain, such as awareness, resilience, detection, alerting, reporting and crisis management.    National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2    From awareness to capability  |  25   within UNODC about a UN treaty in the area of cyber  crime. In the Netherlands itself, a bill is being passed that  will bestow more powers on the police service and the  Public Prosecution Service in investigating cyber crime in  the digital domain.  3.4 The neTherlandS inveSTS in Secure icT   producTS and ServiceS ThaT proTecT privacy An increasing amount of ICT-based products and services  are linked to public networks, such as the internet, which  for its part is linked to other products and services. This  development offers many advantages, but also introduces  new security risks. In the physical domain, it is customary  to set security and quality requirements to products and  services before they are marketed. However, in the digital  domain, this is not common practice yet. For instance,  the impact and side-effects of ICT products or services  such as online investments or online shopping are hardly  included in deliberations of whether or not to use them.  Security and privacy requirements help organisations and  citizens with protecting themselves against security risks.  The government’s digital service provision should set an  example.   Innovation, security and privacy in the design phase  of products and services can not only be successfully  combined, but they can also support these products and  services in distinguishing them from the competition.  The efforts of the government and the business world  should therefore be focused on making this rewarding.  Cooperation with international partners is an essential  element in this process.   7 Supported standards, ‘security by design’ and ‘privacy  by design’  Together with private sector partners, the government is  working to develop standards that can be used to protect  and improve the security of ICT products and services. To  this end, the government in an international context will  also enter into a dialogue with relevant private parties  and will act in a framework-developing and standards- developing fashion to protect the privacy and security  of users. Wherever possible, this also takes place in a  European or wider international context, and a link is  being sought with existing international standards and  good practices25. By including standards in tendering  requirements stimulates the government to implement it  as a ‘launching customer’.   3.5 The neTherlandS buildS coaliTionS For   FreedoM, SecuriTy and peace in The diGiTal  doMain The Netherlands benefits from a stable, free and accessible  digital domain and therefore wants to continue to play  a leading role in the protection of this domain. With The  Hague as the city of peace and security, the Netherlands  aims to develop standards in a multi-stakeholder  context and to protect fundamental rights and values in  cyberspace. Furthermore, the Netherlands in cooperation  with its international partners will work to preventing  and fighting conflicts in the digital domain. Effectively  responding to these conflicts is not only limited to the  digital domain, but also requires an integrated approach,  as is the case with other security threats. Use of traditional  elements such as diplomacy, imposing sanctions,  capability building and Defence capabilities have to be  adjusted to the specific character of the digital domain.  In light of this objective, cyber capabilities that fit in with  the 3D approach  (Development, Diplomacy, Defence) are  being developed.  8 Cyber diplomacy: hub for expertise for conflict   prevention  The Netherlands aims to develop a hub for expertise on  international law and cyber security in order to  promote  the peaceful use of the digital domain. To this end,  the Netherlands combines knowledge from existing  centres. The centre brings together international experts  and policymakers, diplomats, military personnel and  NGOs. This creates a network that brings together  multidisciplinary knowledge about subjects such as  international standards for conflict prevention, civil- military cooperation and non-proliferation of cyber  weapons in the digital domain. The network also  contributes to discussions about this subject. This forms  the basis for a series of multi-stakeholder, high-level  meetings.  3.6 The neTherlandS haS SuFFicienT cyber   SecuriTy KnowledGe and SKillS and inveSTS  in icT innovaTion To aTTain cyber SecuriTy   obJecTiveS  Until now, cyber security has been underexposed in  education. Proficient users and sufficient cyber security  professionals are necessary for making optimal use of  the opportunities offered by digitisation and for being  resilient to the ever more advanced threats. Cyber   25 In Dutch society, the Forum and Standardisation Authority promote interoperability and the application of open standards through a list of recommended and    compulsory standards for the (semi) public sector.    26  |  National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS) 2    From awareness to capability  security professionals are also needed to design and  build the cyber security solutions of the future. The  Netherlands has plenty of talented IT workers. However,  their skills need to be honed as early as secondary  school and then continued in top degree programmes  in senior secondary vocational education, at a university  of applied sciences or in university education. For this  reason, the Netherlands has opted for a wide approach,  ranging from primary education to higher education,  and from work-based training to university, and from  the board room to the coal face. In addition to education  and training, awareness campaigns remain important.  In order to be able to take the step from being aware to  becoming capable, these campaigns will be used in a  more targeted manner and more attention will be paid to  the perspectives for action of the target group.   An excellent cyber security knowledge infrastructure not  only works in support of our society’s resilience, it also  offers opportunities for developing expertise and for  finding niches. This requires an attractive research and  education climate to be created in which cyber security  plays a prominent role. A multidisciplinary approach  in which the non-technical sub-areas are also included  is needed to promote cyber security innovation. The  innovative products and services that are developed in  this manner will help the Netherlands with anticipating  swift technological and other developments in the digital  domain. Dutch design (in security) can also become a  quality mark for security and privacy in ICT products and  services, thereby contributing to economic growth.   9 Taskforce on cyber security education To enlarge the pool of cyber security experts and enhance  users’ proficiency with cyber security, the business  community and the government have joined forces to  improve the quality and breadth of ICT education at all  academic levels (primary, secondary and professional  education). A PPP taskforce on cyber security education  will be set up which will focus on giving advice about the  cyber security curriculum, in relation to the certification of  information security experts and the further development  of learning modules, among other things. For the time  being, connections are being sought with current initiatives  regarding information sciences education and the  Technology Pact 2020.   10 Encouraging innovation in cyber security Technological developments in the digital domain are  taking place at an alarming rate. This means that being   able to anticipate them is a vital element. Innovation  arises where creative people and experts meet. This  alone, however, is not enough. There is a need for more  coordination of supply and demand, which can be  achieved by linking26 innovation initiatives to leading  sector policy. In addition, the government, the business  community and the world of academia will launch a  cyber security innovation platform where start-ups,  established companies, students and researchers can  connect and inspire one another. In organising a follow- up to the SBIT research programme in 2012-2013, the  government contributes to this. The farther-reaching PPP  implementation of the second edition of the National  Cyber Security Research Agenda (NCSRA) will also  contribute to this development.  3.7 a JoinT eFForT The government and the Netherlands have big ambitions  in the area of cyber security and comprise a broader  long-term vision. This vision reflects the importance  of and opportunities offered by ICT to our society  and our economy, as well as the current threats and  risks.  A joint effort made by all parties involved is  required, in which each of the parties is expected to  take own responsibility.  Therefore, the government has  invited many organisations from government bodies  and the business world to help with developing the  strategy.  Unfortunately, financial means are limited due  to the current economic climate.  In the present strategy, the long-term ambition has  been given shape in the 2014-2016 action programme  (see also Annexe 1), which is detailed within the scope  of the regular departmental budgets and the partners’  budgets. Entirely in line with the move initiated by the  action programme, the government will implement the  broader strategy through participation, reprioritisation,  smart coalitions and an integrated approach, which in its  entirety will respond to increased problems that threaten  our prosperity and wellbeing. The long-term ambition  also shows that realising a secure digital domain – also  in the long term – is by no means an ambition that is  free of obligations. This ambition is given more shape  in the future action programmes and will have to fall  within the scope of the financial parameters that will be  in place at that time. Therefore, the details regarding the  implementation of the actions stated in the annexes take  place in consultation and/or cooperation with private  parties and the government bodies involved.  26 Such as the National Cyber Security Research Agenda (NCSRA) and The Hague Security Delta (HSD).

It is knowledge that has become the engine of the social, economic and cultural development in the today’s world. Knowledge-intensive economic activities are now a factor of production of strategic importance in the leading countries. They have also become the main indicator of the level of development and the readiness of every country for a further economic and cultural growth in the 21st century. Taking into consideration all these factors, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe has launched an initiative of monitoring and analyzing the development of the knowledge-based economy in all the European countries in transition and emerging market economies. The major goal of this initiative is to stimulate the exchange of national experiences, to identify best practices and to promote region-wide and global-wide cooperation of the UNECE member States, which would accelerate the development of a knowledge-based economy in the countries in transition and emerging market economies. It envisages the preparation of country assessment reports on the biennium basis by national experts, nominated by the Governments, the creation of a High-Level Task Force on the Knowledge-Based Economy, which will consider the reports and provide policy advice and recommendations to the participating countries, and the development of progress measurements and indicators, policy guidelines and tools to assist countries in overcoming obstacles to the development of a knowledge-based economy. We hope that the country assessment reports, showing a detailed level of the countries’ potential and providing information on various approaches and solutions, will help policy-makers to take strategic decisions with regards to the challenges facing them in the development of institutions, information and innovation systems, human resources development and other areas crucial for the development of a knowledge- based economy. Brigita Schmőgnerová Executive Secretary United Nations Economic Commission for Europe iii PREFACE The industrial revolution of the 19th century and the scientific revolution of the 20th century have prepared the conditions for the rise of the knowledge-based economy. Economic activities associated with the production and utilization of information and knowledge have become an engine of economic growth in the developed market economies, increasingly transforming all the other dimensions of development and the entire societal modus vivendi and modus operanti of the humanity. What do we mean by “the knowledge-based economy”? It is not just the digital economy, which incorporates the production and use of computers and telecommunication equipment. It is not quite the networked economy, which incorporates the telecommunication and networking growth during the last decades and its impact on human progress. The knowledge-based economy is a much complex and broader phenomenon. There are different dimensions and aspects of the knowledge-based economy: 1. The knowledge-based economy has a very powerful technological driving force – a rapid growth of information and telecommunication technologies (ICT). Every three – four year there appears a new generation of ICT. Today, the ICT companies are among the largest corporations. The ICT sector is among the fastest growing economic sectors. 2. Telecommunication and networking, stimulated by a rapid growth of ICTs, have penetrated all the spheres of human activity, forcing them to work into an absolutely new mode and creating new spheres. The information society has become a reality. 3. Knowledge, based on information and supported by cultural and spiritual values, has become an independent force and the most decisive factor of social, economic, technological and cultural transformation. 4. The knowledge-based economy has allowed a quick integration of the enormous intellectual resources of economies in transition into the European intellectual pool, stimulating the development of the former countries. Every country can benefit from developing a knowledge-based economy to become a more equal participant in the global development process. 5. The emerging knowledge-based economy has been affecting other areas of societal activity in every country, including institutional and innovation system, human resources development and etc. and visa versa. The knowledge-based economy has become an engine of progress in every country. If a country is developed, it has a developed knowledge-based economy, if a country is lagging behind, a knowledge- based economy constitutes just a small fraction of its economy. v The report below was prepared by a national expert, nominated by the Government, and represents an overview of the present situation and an assessment of the emerging trends in all the major areas, constituting the foundation of the knowledge-based economy, such as policy and policy instruments, institutional regime, ICT infrastructure, information system, national innovation capacities and capabilities. vi Contents Introduction  3 1.

The swift advancement of ICT has made it possible to bring together people, economies and cultures. However, more than 850 million people in developing countries are still excluded from this process and remain greatly isolated from the information and progress inherent in science and technology today. The Kyrgyz Republic is a landlocked country, endowed with few natural resources, but it has a tremendously advantageous location on the major crossroads between Asia and Europe. The development of Euro–Asian transport projects will, however, require a wide range of telecommunication services to serve the day-to-day operations of the transport corridor. The country also has potential in industries such as the hydro-electric production, tourism, and management of water resources, each of which require sophisticated information processing. With the help of the World Bank, the EBRD and other international agencies, a basic telecommunications infrastructure has been built in the Kyrgyz Republic. USAID, UNDP and ADB have sponsored development of the network software applications for state agencies and the educational sector. The NATO Science Programme is supporting the National Research and Educational Network (NREN) through provision of satellite communication services for the Kyrgyz academic sector. The Trans-Eurasia fiber optical line (Shanghai – Frankfurt) goes through the territory of this country and is providing access to the World Internet at a capacity of 622 Mbps. The educational level is very high in the Kyrgyz Republic, producing many highly-qualified domestic IT specialists. This offers a challenge for the Kyrgyz Republic to improve linkage with industrialised countries through the rapid development of the telecommunications sector. Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan . 4 1. National Strategy and Action Plan 1.1 National strategy The Decree of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic PD № 54 On the National Strategy ‘Information and Communication Technologies for Development in the Kyrgyz Republic’, entered into force on 10 March 2002. The strategy includes the following five chapters: • Introduction • Main objectives, tasks and priorities of the National Strategy • Main principles and directions of the national ICT policy • State support in the development of the priority areas of the national strategy • Organizational, economic and financial mechanisms in implementation and monitoring of the national strategy Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan 5 1.1.1 Introduction All social relationships have been fundamentally changed by modern information and communication technologies (ICT) that have established a new information society. New technologies alter not only how goods and services are produced, but also create new opportunities in the spheres of civic rights, personal development, knowledge gathering, education for the younger generation and leisure time activities. In an information society the importance of geographical distance is diminished, globalisation occurs, and there are unprecedented opportunities for regional development. During recent years the Kyrgyz Republic has made considerable progress in the development of an information infrastructure, and in the informatisation of state organisations and private companies. This has required the development of relevant legislative and the improvement of education levels. The first telecommunications project and TAE Projects have been completed; the State Computer Network (SCN hereinafter) has been established; information projects are being carried out in various economic sectors; and Internet pages of state and non-governmental organizations and commercial structures are being created. Alluding to this, the President of the Kyrgyz Republic, Askar Akaev, declared in the World Economic Forum in Davos (Switzerland) in 1998: ‘Kyrgyzstan chooses the informational society’. Problems with ICT development in the Kyrgyz Republic have demonstrated the need to move away from a one-sided policy of just developing communications and information technologies, to the formulation of a nation-wide strategy for integration with the world information society. Given the technological opportunities already available, main policy directions could include the formation of an interconnecting information space in the country; and the development of information resources, data bases, knowledge and information infrastructures, which could be used by both state structures and the general public on the parity basis. These directions will involve the development of informational law, technological facilities, and organisations. The National Strategy ‘Information and Communication Technologies for Development in the Kyrgyz Republic’ (National Strategy) sets out the main priorities, objectives and tasks, principles, provisions and directions of the national ICT policy. The National Strategy is viewed as an important area for development for implementation of the Complex Development Framework up to 2010 (CDF hereinafter). ICT provides opportunities to achieve CDF objectives, accelerate economic development and reduce poverty. ICT has the potential to become a catalyst and a driving force in the development of Kyrgyzstan. Potential benefits from ICT development include: achievement of effective management; increased labour productivity; availability of new export opportunities, in particular in the area of software exporting and delivery of ICT services; provision of information to farmers on agricultural markets and weather conditions; creation of primary consultative medical assistance; expansion of distance learning capabilities; improved cooperation between the state, local communities and private sector in regions; and an improved quality of state services rendered to the general population. ICT sector share in GDP needs to increase to 5% by 2010. The National Strategy also describes the organisational, economic and financial mechanisms necessary for its implementation. The mechanisms are based on a targeted programme which respects and is subject to regular monitoring and transparency execution. These mechanisms reflect the speech made by the President of the Kyrgyz Republic, Mr A. Akaev, during the First Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan . 6 National ICT Summit held on 27-28 April, 2001 in Bishkek. During the summit, the President proposed the following: • the creation of a permanent agency in charge of the implementation of the National Strategy; • the need to identify a person responsible for ICT development in each ministry and agency; • the creation of an ICT Development Fund; • the establishment of an ongoing monitoring scheme in this area. The National Strategy determines the basics of funding for ICT development, stipulating; a rational use of funds for the development and modernisation of projects and mass media in various sectors and regions; an increasingly transparent and targeted use of funds. The National ICT Strategy is designed to solve the problem of growing ‘digital inequality’ between industrially advanced and developing countries, as well as internally - between the centre of the Kyrgyz Republic and its regions. In eradicating ‘digital inequality’ and promoting regional cooperation in Central Asia, an important role will be played by international projects intended for the creation or use of satellite telecommunication systems (Silk Sat, Virtual Silk Road). Representatives of different ministries and agencies, international organisations, civil society and the private sector have participated in the ICT Strategy development. Free Internet discussion has taken place in addition to a round table with the participation of representatives from the public sector, civil society, private businesses, and international organisations. It is noteworthy that the development of the National ICT Strategy was done with the active support and direct involvement of the UNDP Resident Office in Kyrgyzstan, Internews, GIPI, and other international and non-governmental organizations.

Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan . 12 1.1.5 Organisational, economic and financial mechanisms to implement and monitor national strategy 1.1.5.1 Methodology for the ICT strategy implementation To achieve the goals set by the National Strategy requires the creation of effective organisational, economic and financial mechanisms that: stimulate ICT development, information infrastructure and information industry; create a favorable investment climate for the strategy’s implementation; optimise utilisation of financial resources allocated to ICT development; and regularly monitor and evaluate the current status of the National Strategy implementation. The methodology for preparing and implementing the National Strategy includes preparation of a medium-term strategy for a period of five years, a government programme of information and communication technologies development in the Kyrgyz Republic, and annual preparations and implementation of the Action plan on the National Strategy implementation. The National Strategy was developed in line with the Comprehensive Development Frameworks. To evaluate current status of ICT in Kyrgyzstan a methodology developed by UNDP has been used. The methodology is based on the Guidelines “Readiness for a Net World” for developing countries prepared by the Center of International Development at Harvard University. The methodology allows the assessment of the ICT development level in Kyrgyzstan at the current stage and plans its development for the near future, identifying indicators for objectives achievement. A group of experts has identified six basic dimensions in the monitoring and evaluation of ICT development in Kyrgyzstan: • access to the Internet (opportunities of access to Internet; cost and quality of ICT nets, service and equipment); • public administration in the information century (electronic governance); • teaching of information technologies (integration of ICT in teaching progress, availability of training-programs for preparation of specialists in ICT sphere); • information society (how society uses ICT for its needs, access to information for citizens), • development of the net Economy (how business uses ICT, partnerships of business, government and civil society); • government policy in ICT area (creation of a favourable environment for the development of the information society). A system of indicators defining the level of readiness for a net world has been developed for each of these dimensions. For effective formulation and implementation of the National Strategy, as well as for ensuring effective mechanisms for implementing programmes in ICT, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic proposed an administrative management structure presented in the Programme of information-communication technologies development in the Kyrgyz Republic. The National Strategy identifies areas where it is necessary to develop a programme of interventions in order to achieve the aims of the National Strategy. Each area will have specific projects. These projects should be developed in detail in annual program measures. Each programme’s objective should be the promotion of an informational society in Kyrgyzstan and the elimination of existing barriers and problems that limit the development and application of Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan 13 ICT. 1.1.5.2 Measures of National Strategy implementation Organisational measures support the following directions: • active propaganda of the National Strategy; • coordination of works on informatisation of public administration bodies, various programmes and projects on ICT development; • introduction of mechanism for the competitive selection of the targeted programmes and projects on informatisation development, and their implementation on the basis of independent expertise; • tax-financial stimulation, and control over utilisation of funds; • regular monitoring and evaluation of the status of the National Strategy implementation. The Council for Information–Communication Technologies, under the President of the Kyrgyz Republic, (ICT Council) carries out the overall coordination of planned activities. The ICT Council reviews materials on the Strategy’s implementation, checks the execution of programmes and projects, as well as the use of funds. A plenipotentiary executive body determined within the framework of the ICT Development Programme performs current work. Projects and programmes for implementation of the National Strategy are directed by the ICT Council through an executive body to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic for inclusion in the republican budget as a separate budget line. 1.1.5.3 Economic and financial measures for implementation of the National Strategy Implementation of the National Strategy and its basic objectives should be embodied in the Programme of Information and Communicational Technologies for Development, approved by the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. It is expedient that financial support to national, social, scientific-technical and educational projects in ICT area be rendered through the Fund on ICT Development created especially by the Kyrgyz Republic Government. The ICT Development Fund accumulates funds of the state budget, non-budgetary resources, credits, investments and commercial funds attracted in accordance with legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic. ICT programs and projects are financed from the ICT Development Fund. Necessary interventions for the ICT area are: • creation of an effective mechanism for attraction of investments, and accumulation, coordination and distribution of resources; • effective monitoring and control over the use of these resources; • ensuring correlation of financing with a strategy for development of a uniform information space in the Kyrgyz Republic. An executive body, authorised by the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, conducts analytical work regarding the status of ICT development in the republic, and produces the summary report on expenditures on ICT development for an accounting year. The results of the budget execution are submitted by the given body to the ICT Council, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic. The ICT Council reviews proposals on financing Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan . 14 the branches and recommends to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic adoption of the corresponding measures. 1.1.5.4 Monitoring and evaluation system creation to track implementation of the National Strategy Monitoring and evaluation of ICT development should be placed as a priority task of the national information policy. Some components of the system of monitoring and evaluation of the status of ICT development in the country have been already created. The President’s Decree of 18 June 2001, №199 ‘On the Council on Information and Communicational Technologies under the President of the Kyrgyz Republic’ established the ICT Council. The Kyrgyz Republic Government’s Resolutions of 8 November 2001, №697 and of 23 July 2001, №367 adopted correspondingly the Program on ICT development in the Kyrgyz Republic, and the Regulations for operations of public administration bodies in the State Computer Network according to which a responsible ICT staff position should be created in all public administration bodies and local state administrations. The Ministry of Justice of the Kyrgyz Republic has registered the Center of ICT Development at the Ministry of Transport and Communication. 1.1.5.5 International cooperation and donor support for the National Strategy Objective: the observance of interests of the Kyrgyz Republic in international information exchange; the inclusion of national information and telecommunication nets and resources in the global infrastructure; the attraction of investments and donors assistance; ensuring security of national information resources and information–telecommunication infrastructure. Donors provide significant and critical support to the initiatives on ICT sector development in Kyrgyzstan. The donors’ assistance is expressed in two different ways: in direct support to ICT sector capacity, and in indirect support to the sector through the application of information technologies in donors’ programs and projects. As regards direct support to the sector, the activities of UNDP, World Bank and EBRD have been notable in the improvement of the overall performance of the telecommunication system. USAID assists in the use of ICT in public health and other sectors. The NATO scientific program supports the development of national academic research and educational networks. UNDP pays great attention to ICT sector development in public administration, development of human resources, and in private and civil sectors, expressed both via a number of projects and programmes in these areas, and via sponsorship of the National ICT Summit, a strategically important contribution towards the formation of Kyrgyzstan’s national strategy. Inter-state programs of partner countries include the Great Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Canada, USA, Turkey, Switzerland and Japan. These have had a significant effect in stimulating development of ICT sector capacity, and on the implementation of information technologies in Kyrgyzstan. At the meeting of the Great Eight countries in Okinava City in Japan, the Japanese Government expressed their intention to increase financing of programmes on capacity development of information technologies in developing countries. For ICT development in Kyrgyzstan it is very important that international organisations and donor countries continue their strategic support for the ICT sector. Donating finance in this way will be a priority programme, allowing donors to play an active part in formation and implementation of the National Strategy.

The Institutional Regime The importance of ICT for the overall socio-economic development of Kyrgyzstan has been recognized at the most senior government level. President A. Akaev declared in Davos in 1998 that “Kyrgyzstan opts for an information society”. Since that time, numerous decrees and normative acts have been adopted to create suitable conditions for ICT development in the country. Since 2000, a Global Internet Program Initiative (GIPI) by Internews Networks has been actively involved in the creation of a favourable legal environment for the development of Internet related issues. The GIPI project is working together with state institutions, NGOs and the commercial sector. The First National ICT Summit took place in February 2001. Significant attention at the Summit was devoted to the development of a legal basis for ICT, and a national legal framework for ICT was presented and discussed. The primary obstacle to telecommunications development in the republic, is Kyrgyztelecom’s monopoly over international. This originates from the necessity pay back a loan taken from the World Bank and EBRD for the First Telecommunications project. The regulations associated with this do not allow the legal development of IP telephony in the country. As a result of Kyrgyzstan’s entry to the WTO, it has been decided to abolish the exclusive rights of Kyrgyztelecom from 2003 to 2008. A further step towards the de-monopolisation of the telecommunications industry has been taken with the development of the “Concept on reorganisation and privatisation of the joint stock venture Kyrgyztelecom”. Executive power in the field of informatisation belongs to the following agencies: • Ministry of Transport and Communications • State Communication Agency • State Commission on radio frequencies Based on the discussions and recommendations of the First National ICT Summit, the State ICT Council was created in June 2001 with President A. Akaev as Chairman. This body is determines strategy, state policy and legal aspects for ICT development, and any major programmes and initiatives in this field now need the approval of the ICT Council. The Ministry of Transport and Communications is responsible for the following: • development of state policy in electronic and traditional mail; • preparation of normative acts relating to electronic mail and to post offices inside the country and at an international level; • conduct of negotiations on communications with foreign states. The State Commission on Radio Frequencies is responsible for the following: • development of regulations regarding the use of radio frequencies; • creation of the National Table on frequencies and long-term development of radio Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan . 20 communications in the Kyrgyz Republic. The National Communication Agency is responsible for the following: • monitoring and support of competition between operators; • provision of equal access to electric communications networks; • monitoring of conditions for the general public to use electriconic communications networks; • creation, development and use of the state system of radio control; • preparation, control and monitoring of the national telephone numbers system; • monitoring of the quality of communication services; • provision of radio frequencies to users. The “Regulation on the Coordination Council on satellite technologies under the President of the Kyrgyz Republic” was approved. The following ICT related normative acts are in place in the Kyrgyz Republic: • “About electronic and mail communications”; • “About informatisation”; • “About legal protection of programmes for computers and databases”; • “About topologies of integral microchips”; • “About scientific technical information”; • “About obligatory sets of documents”; • “About electronic payments”; • “About electronic signatures”. In order to provide legal support to the development of information technologies, it is necessary to provide the following: • transparency of state institutions; • regulation of monopolies in telecommunications; • legal regulation of new relationships arising from the development of information technologies. The “Concept of informatisation development” was approved by the President in February 1998, and aimed at creating favourable conditions to satisfy the information needs of the society. It includes: • regulation of ownership of information; • rights of private and legal entities to information; • regulation of access to information; • safety of information and telecommunication systems; • information safety of the state, the society, and the individual; • responsibilities of the members of the information environment. The law “About informatisation” of 1999 states that informatisation is a stand-alone field in the economy of the Kyrgyz Republic. This law defines the following terms: informatisation infrastructure, state and non-governmental information systems, information resources, protection Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan 21 of information. The laws “About legal protection of computer programs and databases” and “About legal protection of chips” have been approved. A decree on punishment for computer information crimes exists in the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic. However, there are no decrees in the field of management of state and non-governmental information resources. The decree “About insurance of information risks” has not yet been issued. Use of modern technologies can cause financial losses as a result of information risks, and insurance is seen as the solution to this problem. An association of communication operators was established in the Kyrgyz Republic in 2001. The association has actively participated in the formulation of normative acts in the information technologies field. Recently, the association opposed an attempt by Kyrgyztelecom to charge payments for local phone calls on a time basis. Such a step would negatively affect the majority of Internet users who use dial-up access. Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan . 22 3. Present Situation and Trends in the Country’s Informational System 3.1 Main Telecommunication projects The First Telecommunication project was funded via a loan from the World Bank and EBRD to the Kyrgyz Government. The budget of the project was 27,400,000 U.S.D. As a result of this project, the telecommunications infrastructure of the country has been improved considerably: • earth satellite stations of the standards A, F and B were installed; • a network connecting regional centers was reconstructed; • digital telephone stations were built in Bishkek and regional centers; • digital telephone stations in Bishkek were linked by fiber optic cables, with the help of SDH technology. The Chuy Telecommunication project was financed via a loan from the Korean Government of 12,000,000 U.S.D. Digital telephone stations with a capacity of 43 784 lines were established in the Chuy valley. A fiber optic line Bishkek – Kant – Ivanovka – Tokmok – Kemin was built. The Osh Telecommunication project was funded by the Kuwait Fund of Arabic Economic Development, with a sum of 8,700,000 U.S.D. It was used to modernise telecommunications infrastructure in the south of the country, including Osh, Jalal – Abad and Batken provinces. Digital telephone stations with a capacity of 23 400 numbers were installed in Osh City and regional centres. The Trans – Asia – Europe Fiber Optic line, connecting Shanghai, China and Frankfurt – on – Main, Germany, goes through the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic. Right now, eight countries (China, Romania, Hungary, Austria, Iran, Poland, Germany, and the Kyrgyz Republic) have completed their segments, and the total length of the TAE is 27,000 km. In some places in Kyrgyzstan, access to the backbone will be done through radio-relay communication facilities by NERA Co. This backbone will provide access to many countries in Europe and Asia with a speed of 622 Mbps. The National Research and Educational Network (NREN) was sponsored by the NATO Science Programme. Via this project, research and educational institutions have obtained satellite backbone communication lines with a capacity of 2,5 Mbps. 3.2 Communication facilities The prospect of participating in the development of the world’s telecommunications systems has generated increased interest by entrepreneurs in the telecommunications market of Kyrgyzstan. Current conditions The highest growth rates among licenses for electronic communication services relate to licenses (including applications) for data transmission, for telematic services, and for the renting of channels. As a result, the total share of licenses for electronic communication, has increased by 3% during the first 11 months of 2000, totalling 23%. At the same time, the number of applications for this kind of activity is increasing. Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan 23 Despite the fact that the license agreement of “Kyrgyztelecom” grants exclusive rights for long distance and international communication services until 2003 only, in reality “Kyrgyztelecom” still has a monopoly in the local communications market due to the lack of profit from local communications at current tariffs. Traditional communication services Currently, the fixed public telephone network of “Kyrgyztelecom” includes 475,300 lines (data from the annual report of JSC “Kyrgyztelecom” for 2000). “Kyrgyztelecom” has inherited from the former Soviet Union a hierarchical network structure that includes primary, secondary and local networks. The primary network consists of cable, radio-relay, satellite and some air trunk lines. It embraces all oblasts of Kyrgyzstan and connects them with networks of other countries through multi-channel long-distance communication equipment. Additionally, the primary network includes intra-zone and local primary networks that, in turn, include transmission systems which connect automated telephone stations (ATS). The secondary network includes equipment that provides connection from international stations to ATS, to which clients are directly connected. Almost two thirds of the total volume of switching equipment consists of coordinate type stations which are used in rural telephone networks, while digital ones are being installed in urban areas, where high purchasing power and demand for additional services exist. As such, the dynamics of capacity being used in cities and in rural areas differ. The low level of income in rural areas, and the migration of active sectors of that population to urban zones or outside the country, have been a factor in the decrease of the ratio of telephone use in rural areas. In December 1996, under a credit agreement between “Kyrgyztelecom” and the EBRD, a surface satellite station of “A” standard was installed. Currently, this station provides direct international access to Japan, China, Germany, Great Britain, and India, with subsequent transit to other countries of the world. Practically, with their installation of surface satellite stations of “A”, “F”, and “B” standards, and automated long-distance telephone station (ALDTS) with a total capacity of 2.7 thousand channels, Kyrgyz communication networks are broadly integrated with world telecommunication networks. Moreover, construction of the Kyrgyz section of the Trans Eurasia (TE) optical line, which directly connects Shanghai, China and Frankfurt, Germany, has been completed. The total length of TE is 27,000 km, and the length of the Kyrgyz section is 183 km. International connections will be made through Synchronic Digital Hierarchy (SDH) transmission lines, with a capacity of 768 channels (622Mbs). Transmission centres in administrative and regional centers will have a capacity of 1920 channels (155Mbs). Except Bishkek, Sokuluk, Belovodskoe, Kara-Balta, and Kaindy will be connected to TE. This project will provide Kyrgyzstan with direct access to many countries of Europe and Asia. In Bishkek, the largest and most promising communications market of the Kyrgyz republic, trunk transport communication infrastructure is being actively established. An optical cable with utilisation of SDH technologies, for the purpose of arranging inter-station connection with a data transfer speed of 622Mbs, has been installed. The capacity of the optical cable is 24 fibers. However, in spite of all the measures which have been implemented (modernization of network, creation of trunk infrastructure), the level of installation of telephones in Kyrgyzstan is still one of the lowest among CIS countries. In 2000, the level of telephone installations – the telephone density (number of telephone units, including coin telephones and state owned telephones Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan . 24 connected to the general network) was 7.5 per 100 people. In other words, with an average number of four people per family, only about 30% of households have telephones. If coin and state-owned telephones are excluded from this calculation, then the density is lower still. The International Monetary Fund considers telephone density as one of the most important economic indicators of a country’s level of development. Such a low level of telephone installations can be explained partly by features of the Kyrgyz landscape. Almost 67% of the population resides in rural mountainous areas, making telephone installation very costly and requiring substantial capital investment. Accordingly, telephone density in Kyrgyzstan is unevenly distributed. On one hand, the low level of telephone installations indicates a potential growth market for telecommunications. On the other hand, it necessitates heavy capital investment, namely foreign investments as Kyrgyz internal investment capabilities are very low. As in the majority of the former Soviet Union countries, Kyrgyzstan has a low volume of general telephone traffic per line. At the same time, almost all local traffic is free of charge. Only a small proportion of institutions, organizations and enterprises are charged for such traffic. Diagram: General traffic in minutes per line, per month (data from a statistical survey) 250 20 Eastern Europe Kyrgyzstan Kazakhstan The low traffic per line, 10 times below identical indicators in countries of Eastern Europe, underpins the theory that the communications market has substantial reserves of potential revenues. While tariffs for international communications are the tariffs for local and national long-distance services are, by contrast, very low. They constitute a social rather than economic burden, and do not cover costs - especially those of local communication links. As a result, the present tariff system of “Kyrgyztelecom” does not allow for expansion and modernisation of the telecommunication network. In terms of revenues, the Kyrgyz telephone network is one of the poorest among the CIS countries. Recently, new services such as pager, data transmission, Internet, and cellular communications, are developing in the communication market. The Memorandum of the World Bank does not assign a fundamental role to the participation of the National operator “Kyrgyztelecom” in the development of such market niches. The role of “Kyrgyztelecom” is to establish and provide a transport network for private operators. Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan 25 Cellular communication network Presently, mobile cellular communication is managed by two operators: “Katel and “Bitel”. The cellular communication system of “Katel” is based on the American AMPS standard in its digital version. The network has been operating for more than six years, and has about 7,000 clients (expert evaluation). Katel’s base equipment was installed by “Ericsson” and “Motorola”. Presently, the network covers Bishkek, Chui Oblast, Issyk-Kul Oblast, Osh, and Jalal-Abad. The estimated volume of investment is about US$ 5 million. Bitel’s cellular communication system is based on the European GSM standard. The network has been operating for more than three years, and has about 10,000 clients. Most of the equipment used is made by “Ericsson”, “Siemens” and “Huawei”. The GSM network covers Bishkek, Chui Oblast, northern part of Issyk-Kul Oblast, and Osh. The volume of investment is about US$ 6 million. With the appearance of a second operator in the cellular communications market, a rapid decrease of tariffs from US $ 0.25 to 0.5 per minute to US $ 0.25 to 0.30 occurred. Subsequently, with an increase in competition, the tariffs of both companies decreased even further down to US $ 0.07 to 0.15 per minute. However, in spite of these reductions, there has been no substantial growth in the market. The primary users of cellular communication are still businessmen, international organisations and sectors of the state elite. Penetration of the market by cellular communications is only 0.4%. The world average for this indicator is between 3 and 5%, and in European countries, such as Norway and Finland, it is 60%. The primary reason for the poor penetration level of cellular communication services is low income. Paging services Another segment of the communication market is paging. There are three operators working in this segment: “Areopag-Page”, “Smart-Page” and “Gelio-Page”. “Areopag-Page” provides services in Bishkek, Chui Oblast, Ussy-Kul Oblast, Osh and Jalal- Abad. Its clients number approximately 3,000. Russian paging technologies are used on the basis of Motorola’s transmitters. In the near future, the company is planning to transfer to the “Flex” American protocol. “Smart-Page” provides services in Bishkek, Issyk-Kul and Chui Oblasts. Its clients number approximately 2,000. “Gelio-Page” provides services in Bishkek to approximately 500 to 700 clients. All paging providers work on the basis of the outdated “Pocsaq” protocol, using Russian technologies. The major function of paging services includes transmission of text messages through their own operator centers. With increase of competition, tariffs have halved from US $ 20 to between US $ 9 and $ 11. Two companies (“Areopag-Page” and “Smart-Page”) have, for a long time, provided services through the Internet, omitting operator centers. Total investments made by the companies have Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan . 26 not exceeded US $ 500,000. However, in spite of low tariffs and strong competition, this market still attracts only mid-size investors. A Kyrgyz-Chinese joint venture also plans to provide services in the near future. There is growth potential in this market, probably through provision of additional services. In particular, this is likely to involve making pagers into info-commutators via active use of the Internet and automation of message transmission Taking into consideration all of the above, and given sufficient GNP growth, the capacity of the market may reach 10 to 15 thousand clients. Trunk telephone communication services There are several companies working to provide radio-trunking services primarily in Bishkek and Chui Oblast on the basis of the “Smarttrunk-II” protocol. However, this market is not expected to show much further development. One exception to this concerns “Areopag-Bishkek”, which installed the local “Smarttrunk-II” radio communication systems not only in Bishkek, but also in Osh and Balykchi. This company also started to implement a radio communication system on the basis of the MRT-1327 protocol. TV broadcasting services A special place in the market belongs to the radio-relay communication network, TV and radio broadcasting. Services in this market used to be provided by the Republican Production Union of radio-relay trunk lines, TV and radio broadcasting (RPU). However, according to the Resolution of the Government # 220, as of 25 April, RPU has entered the “Kyrgyztelecom” structure. RPU includes companies that provide radio and TV channels to TV and radio companies, for broadcasting of their programmes over the territory of the republic, transportation of TV and radio programmes, and long distance communication channels, via radio-relay lines. Private TV and radio companies do not use the services of RPU due to their small financial capacity. State TV is transmitted via 50 stations, with the number of programmes broadcast not less than two. Bishkek and the neighbouring regions of Chui Oblast receive five TV and two radio programmes. In the last year, “Ala-TV” company has begun to develop the cable TV market. This company is a joint-stock company and one of its investors is a well-known American company, “Metromedia”. This company actively develops cable TV networks and paging services in CIS, and has begun to invest in cellular communication systems. The project is interesting because the company has started to develop its own cable industry infrastructure (mainly optical cable). The company’s tariffs are not high and, as such, client interest is expected to be favourable. To date, the company has only been able to cover only a small part of Bishkek, and without expansion there is a danger the company will not be able to attract a satisfactory number of clients. However, given the rapid development of technologies, it is possible that in the years ahead, this company may become a participant in the market for local telephone communication services. Subsequent to the introduction of card telephones, there have been some developments in the pay-for-telephone segment of the market. This project was launched by the “Telcard” company, using pay-for-telephones of the well-known French “Schlumberger” company, with subsequent transfer of the system to JSC “Kyrgyztelecom”. As such “Kyrgyztelecom” still has a monopoly in the pay-for-telephone services market. Currently, “Kyrgyztelecom” operates about 1,000 coin telephones and 300 chip-card telephones. Approximately 70% of the above- mentioned telephones are in Bishkek, while the rest are distributed among oblast centers. The development Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan 27 of pay-for-telephone services is possible only upon full transfer to telephones with chip-cards. Coin telephones are not well suited for accounting purposes. The transfer to a time-based calculation of telephone conversations assumes a system of advance payment for telephone cards. Merely shifting to a different technology with prepaid telephone cards could revive the pay-for- telephone market without additional, substantial investments. This could be achieved simply by re-equipping functioning coin-telephones. 3.3 Internet in the Kyrgyz Republic 3.3.1 Informational computer networks coming into being in the Kyrgyz Republic (1991- 1993) The history of informational computer networks for the public in the Kyrgyz Republic began in 1991, when a server of the “Ala-Too” telecommunications network was founded, working via Almaty’s RICC server and serving about 20 subscribers. In May 1992, the “Imfiko” (“Imfiko” firm) network subscriber gained the official status of the RELCOM network function, serving about 50 network subscribers by the end of 1992, and sending information through Russian networks. 3.3.2 History of Internet services (1994-1996) Two companies (ElCat and AsiaInfo) were founded in 1994, and these are currently the largest Internet providers on Kyrgyz Republic territory. The joint state-private venture firm ElCat was founded in 1994, based on the IMFIKO server of the “RELCOM” network in Kyrgyzstan, to fulfill the national network creation project. The ElCat firm provided e-mail delivery on the territory of Kyrgyzstan, connection with CIS countries and, since 1995, a full Internet services package connecting to networks all over the world. The ASIAINFO telecommunications enterprise was founded in 1994 as the Kyrgyz branch of the INFOTEL network to provide services using the X.25 protocol. Founders of this firm were the Russian firm INFOTEL and KyrgyzTelecom. TheEnterprise provides connection with more than 200 data transfer networks using the X.25 protocol, and with the Internet society, using the TCP/IP protocol. In 1995, one more company appeared on the network services market – Transfer LTD. 3.3.3 The early Internet development period (1997-1998) The further development of the Internet services market in Kyrgyzstan was interrelated with the reconstruction of telecommunications. In 1997, providers and users considerably improved the quality of modems. Modems with a speed lower than 19,2 Kb/s, although widely spread, were changed for devices of V.34 and V.34+ standards (28,8/33,6 Kb/s). During this period, for the first time non-commercial providers appeared on the Internet services market in Kyrgyzstan: FreeNet (IRIS) TCP/IP, FR ElCat Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan . 28 Soros Foundation in Bishkek TCP/IP, FR AsiaInfo Internet access services provided by FreeNet and the Soros Foundation are free because the providers themselves are non-commercial organisations and operate with the support of foreign sponsors. This Internet access is provided selectively, based on a statement made by the sponsor. In general, it is provided to educational, science or other organisations (eg. the mass media) on a competitive basis. 3.3.4 Current condition of the Internet services market in Kyrgyzstan (1999-2001) The last two years of Internet market development have been characterised not only by an expansion of both the technical potential of providers and the number of Internet users, but also by the increasing number of services being provided. A good indicator of Internet development during the last two years is the increase of the joint Internet access channel. While in 1998, the common channel of providers was about 768 Kb/s, in 2000, the joint channel has risen five times and amounts to more than 4 Mb/s. In fact, the Internet access market has about 6,000 active users. The number of potential users is approximately 20,000. This category includes people that could use the Internet but do not have access to it. Free opportunities to learn about and use the Internet, provided by institutions of higher education and international organisations, considerably influence the number of potential users. An important aspect of this Internet development period is the increase in number of Internet services, meaning that the Internet is not just an economical way to communicate. For example, Internet technologies have now been used for the first time during parliamentary and presidential elections in the Kyrgyz Republic. The State Computer-aided System “Shailoo”, based on Internet technologies, enabled interactive counting of votes in every region of the Republic. For the first time, Internet radio broadcasting also took place. Carried out in cooperation with national television channels, the Interactive voting system can be added to the achievements of the last years, permitting as it did live participation of viewers in social opinion polls. Another peculiarity of this period of Internet market development is KyrgyzTelecom’s, preparation to enter the Internet market, concerning which there is mixed opinion. However, the fact that the biggest communication operator in Kyrgyzstan is entering the field, demonstrates the level of competition which there will be in this market. Competition in the Internet services market is becoming increasingly tough stimulating a growth in the number of special promotions designed to attract clients. While there are special state committees to protect and develop competition, there is no guarantee that KyrgyzTelecom will not seek to pull in customers via special events where inducements from one of the other sectors in which the company has a monopoly, will be offered. With a monopolist providing Internet services as one of its branches, these services could now be provided at lower cost. Questions, however, remain - how will the cost of services will be determined?, and will the new structure be biased, as other providers pay for services obtained from other branches of the monopoly? Even if the Internet branch of KyrgyzTelecom pays market prices, but without direct payments, then conditions of inequality appear due to differences in the cost of finance. KyrgyzTelecom can develop without any additional finance, because it monopolises communication facilities. KyrgyzTelecom should enter the Internet services market on the basis of a warranty of Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan 29 equal conditions of competition. These conditions can be determined only after full economic analysis of pricing, composition of service costs for the monopolist and determination of sharply set rules of competition in this branch, as well as an obligation to maintain transparency. 3.3.5 The web services market and Internet resources of Kyrgyzstan Considerable change has taken place recently in the structure, technology and content of the Internet resources of Kyrgyzstan. Changes have taken place in site creation as a direct result of client demand. Competition for the attention of network users is rising, and projects initiated without precise planning and research of target audiences are doomed to fail. While straightforward information sites were previously in demand, active websites are now the order of the day. Companies are beginning to understand the benefits of using the Internet in business. Most of the websites of local companies can be described as web-based showcases that contain general information about products or services of the company, and about the company itself. Companies are slowly moving from “Internet in Business” to “Business in Internet”, in other words, business is coming to the Internet with commercial aims. It is well known that the electronic commerce market is developing rapidly and is influencing the general direction of web services development. The simplest example is the development of web shops and electronic trading places instead of traditional web showcases. Whether a company sees the need for a web site or not, is still a management decision. However, company websites are becoming an increasingly necessary condition of successful competition in the world economy. It is impossible to review completely and in detail the structure and content of the Internet resources of Kyrgyzstan, which total approximately five hundred in number. 3.4 Sector online software applications State Automatic Election System Shailoo A significant contribution to network software applications was made when the state automatic system Shailoo was created. Shailoo is a network-based software application that is designed to collect and process information for the Election Committee. Client/server technology is used to collect data from 54 rayons (counties) over the whole country into the Oracle database of the Central Election Committee in Bishkek. A sophisticated management system protects the data from being manipulated at the electronic stage of information processing. During the Election campaigns, the results of the votes are shown in real time on the World Wide Web (WWW). Computerized Taxation System A computerised taxation system for State Tax Inspections was implemented by the Ministry of Finance, with the participation of the Barents Group. This is a network-based software application, using the communication channels of Shailoo and PMIS corporate networks. A common information environment exists in the form of an Oracle database that is shared by the Tax Inspection Committee and the Social Fund. Branches in rural areas are sending data to Bishkek through Shailoo communication facilities. Public Management Information System (PMIS) Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan . 30 A WWW-based state corporate network connects, through dedicated lines, 49 major ministries/agencies in Bishkek and six regional state bodies in Osh. Existing telephone lines are used as communication channels and network operations are functioning up to transport layer. This allows e-mail and Internet access to all users of PMIS. Education Management System The purpose of this project is to create a network-based information system for gathering data (teachers, administrative and technical personnel) into a database at the Ministry of Education. Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan 31 4. Characteristics of the Country’s Human Resources High schools The majority of high schools are governmental, the largest sector in the country. Currently, there are 1,680,000 children under the age of 14 years in Kyrgyzstan. In the school year 1999 to 2000, 1,100,000 pupils were studying in the country’s 1,980 schools. The High School education system prescribes an “Informatics and Information Technologies” programme for all state and private high schools. The programme is sub-divided into two stages: • First stage (8 – 9 grades) – basic course on informatics. 102 hours in classes. • Second stage (10 – 11 grades) –study of informatics in subjects that can be selected. In accordance with the specialisation of the school, the course may take from 68 to 136 class hours. It should be noted, however, that programmes in informatics do not satisfy modern requirements. Most of them are oriented towards programming languages but not the use of general information technologies. Due to lack of teaching time as well as of computers, students are neither obtaining real programming skills, nor are they gaining sufficient understanding of information technologies in general. In 1995/96, two national educational programmes “Professionals of the 21st century” and “Bilim” were adopted. The first programme stands for development of international cooperation in the field of science and education, encouraging modern technologies. The second program is devoted to the development of overall strategy in the educational sector with emphasis in the following aspects: • preservation of the availability of education; • increase of quality and efficiency of education; • improvement of financing of education; and • development of legislature in the educational field. Recently, the Asian Development Bank has begun financing of two projects, “Information management system in education” and “Distant training system for high school teachers”. Table 1.

Only a small number of schools have access to the Internet. Most of these are located in Bishkek. According to the Harvard classification, high schools in Kyrgyzstan can be divided into three levels of readiness for the new information network world: • more than a half of schools (56%) are at the first level of readiness (schools do not have computers at all); • about 35-40% of schools are at the second level (schools have old modification computers (486 and less), but they are not integrated into the educational process, etc.); • a small number of schools (mainly schools in Bishkek and private schools) are at the third level of readiness (schools with local networks, access to the web, computers widely used in the education process, etc.). 15 % of schools are equipped with computer classes and endowed with sufficient computers. There is one computer per 330 students in average. 1 to1.5 % of the total number of schools have access to the Internet. Higher education In accordance with data provided by the licensing department of the Ministry of Education and Culture, there are 50 educational institutions and branches of institutions from CIS countries in Kyrgyzstan. There are 188,820 students, and 101,446 are full-time students (1 October 2000). This last figure relates to educational institutions with 168,008 students, i.e. 89% of the total number of students in the country. With respect to the number of students per computer, educational establishments can be sub- divided into four groups: • higher educational institutions with less than 10 students per computer. There are 9,173 full-time students (10% of the total number). The number of computers is 1,545 (33.8% of the total numbers of computers). On average there are six full-time students per computer; • higher educational institutions with 10 – 20 students per computer. There are 20,623 full- time students (22.5% of the total number) in this group. The number of computers is 1,307 (28.6%), equivalent to 16 full-time students per computer; • higher educational institutions with 21 – 50 students per computer. In this group, there are 52,421 full-time students (57.2% of all students), for 1802 (39.5%) computers. The average is 29 full-time students per computer. • higher educational institutions with more than 51 students per computer. In this group, there are 10,324 full-time students (11.3% of all students). The number of computers is 171 (3.7%) giving an average of 60 full-time students per computer. The first group covers institutions that are small in terms of full-time students, while being sufficiently funded. All institutions are connected to the Internet through dedicated lines or through dial-up connections. Students and staff members have practical experience in working with Internet and e-mail, which is heavily used for administrative purposes. There are no old “Soviet” era institutions in this group (ie. pre-1991). Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan 33 The second group consists of private institutions of three older institutions which were previously well-equipped with computers. All of them have Internet access and e-mail services. The third group, the biggest, consists of institutions that were established recently and that are state-owned. They still have no sufficient technical infrastructure. The fourth group includes state-owned institutions with little use of information communication technologies, due to their specialisation. Table 2. Number of students and IBM compatible computers 1996 – 2000 Year Number of students (thousands) Number of computers Number of students per computer 1996 77.8 1200 65 1997 97.8 1850 54 2000 188.8 5100 37 In accordance with the Harvard methodology, the situation in the Higher Educational sector is the following: • 15 % are at stage two of readiness; • 70 % are at stage three; • About 10 % can be considered at stage four. Training of IT specialists has been improved recently. Degrees are offered by numerous institutions in the following fields: • Automatics and management of technical systems, Kyrgyz Technical University • Telecommunications, Kyrgyz Technical University, Osh Technical University • Electronics and microelectronics, Kyrgyz State National University, Jalal-Abad State University, Dastan University • Computers, Systems and Networks. Information Processing and Management Systems. Software for Information Systems and Management. Kyrgyz Technical University, Kyrgyz State National University, International University of Kyrgyzstan, Kyrgyz Slavic University, Dastan University, Manas University and others • Information Technologies in Economics. Kyrgyz Technical University, International University of Kyrgyzstan and others. • Applied Mathematics and informatics. Kyrgyz State National University, International University of Kyrgyzstan Most of the institutions only recently begun teaching the above-mentioned programmes, and they are targeted at the preparation of highly-qualified computer users. As a rule, they do not have laboratories for hardware study, design, and manufacturing of electronic devices and their parts. Table 3.

Absence of a budget for purchase, support and development of ICT at institutional departments; • variance of state educational standards, educational plans and programmes for creating modern conditions and perspectives in the development of ICT. This is related to ICT educational plans and programmes for pupils at high schools and students at secondary schools, as well as plans and programmes for IT specialist training; • shortage and low salary of teachers of informatics and ICT specialists at educational institutions; • absence of educational centers for the training of teachers of informatics and ICT specialists at educational institutions; • absence of ISPs in the regions and at district levels; • absence of educational literature and software in the Kyrgyz language; • schools that are equipped with computers do not necessarily have the staff to serve them, a budget for spare parts or equipment maintenance, or paid access to the Internet. Proposals for a national strategy for the educational sector High school system Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan 35 • improve the quality of training (including upgrading of knowledge) of teachers of informatics at high schools; foresee targeted financing from all sources (state and local budgets, budgets of educational institutions, loans, grants, sponsorship, etc.) for implementation and development of ICT in the educational sector; • conclude establishment of distance training of high school teachers; create a national educational network with ISP functions; • develop new educational programmes, methods and technologies of teaching «informatics» in high school, and related subjects in high and medium professional institutions, including the most recent achievements in this sphere; • 100% computerization of high schools in Kyrgyzstan, less than 50% of them with modern computer classes; medium ratio of not more than 100 students per one computer in high schools; access to Internet of not less than 10% of high schools of Kyrgyzstan. Higher educational institutions • improve quality and quantity of IT specialists’ training in design and development of software for information systems; • create new educational and methodological manuals in accordance with new educational plans and programmes, including their e-versions; • develop special councils for defending doctoral and PhD theses in ICT related fields; • activate the creation of e-libraries with access to the Internet and world information resources in educational and scientific institutions; • expand the National Research and Educational Network (NREN) by connecting universities in southern Bishkek and regional universities to Internet through dedicated channels. Develop distance learning by using modern educational and telecommunication technologies, providing high quality multimedia materials; • establish a National Center of Information Technologies equipped with the most modern technology to develop human resources and train high quality specialists in ICT. The National IT Center would host different training courses, incubate IT investigation projects, create a database and assist in the promotion of e-commerce and other businesses with network use. • equip all higher institutions with modern computer technologies and fully integrate ICT into the educational process; achieve an average ratio in all higher institutions of not more than 20 students per computer; wider usage of Internet by all higher institutions (mainly through dedicated channels) Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan . 36 5. National innovation capacities and capabilities and their effectiveness In the modern world science is the driving force of public progress and it requires a well- educated population to track innovations and understand their impact. In current times, progress depends not only on the level of scientific development in a country, but also on how deeply it penetrates into society. These observations are important for Kyrgyzstan where there have been rapid changes in the economy and society due to globalisation, and where the prestige of science has fallen to a worrying degree both at state level and in society According to the law “About Science and about Bases of State Scientific and Technical Policy” the central body responsible for carrying out state scientific and technical policy is the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. The State Agency on Science and Intellectual Property under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic is responsible for the realisation of state scientific and technical policy. All activities in the field of science and technology are regulated by the following normative acts: • Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “About Science and about Bases of State Scientific and Technical Policy” • Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “About Innovative Activity” • Regulations of the State Agency on Science and Intellectual Property under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic • Regulations of Formation and Realisation of the State Scientific and Technical Programs • Regulations of Financing Scientific, Technical and Innovative Activity at the Expense of the Republican Budget • Regulations of Organisation and Realisation of State (Independent) Scientific and Technical Examination of the Projects on Research and Design • Concept on Reforming Science in the Kyrgyz Republic for the years1999 – 2005” • Regulations of Elections of the Chiefs of the Research Institutions • Regulations of Research Institutions The role of the state in this field is the creation of favourable conditions for the implementation of scientific projects, development of research, and utilisation of state-of-the-art technologies. To achieve these goals the following methods can be used: • attraction of investments; • favorable tax policy; • legal support for innovative solutions; • provision of state financial support; and • development of the banking system and financial market for high-tech industry. Priority directions for science and technology are determined by the economic situation in the country; global tendencies in science and technology; availability of raw materials; and market demand. Currently major priority directions are: • health and environment; • agriculture and consumer products; • electric power production; • development of mountainous regions; Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan 37 • mineral and water resources; • information and telecommunication technologies; • new materials, construction; • development of tourism; and • fundamental research. Key directions in the field of Information and Telecommunication technologies are as follows: • optical electronic components and their usage in communications and computers • high density memory • fiber optical networks • information technologies and Internet in education The Kyrgyz Republic’s economy is in transition stage and has very few opportunities to invest in science and technology. As such, the country relies on international community grants and programmes. Significant results have been achieved via research co-operation with foreign countries, and an agreement has been signed between the Kyrgyz Republic and the International Association on Co-operation with Newly Independent States (INTAS). Kyrgyzstan is a landlocked state located on the crossroads between Asia and Europe and 90 % of its territory is covered with mountains. There are many earth metal deposits in the country and over the last two centuries a mining industry has developed. The semiconductor production process requires heavy usage of electric power. The Kyrgyz Republic has, in fact, excellent natural conditions for producing hydro electricity and, before the break-up of the Soviet Union, a series of hydro electric plants were built in the country which also exported hydro electricity to neighboring States. At this time, the semiconductor production industry was successfully functioning and there were several high- tech equipment manufacturing plants oriented towards the military sector. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, there is no demand for these products and the entire sector has ceased to function. The country, which has great potential for a semiconductor industry - raw materials, inexpensive hydro energy, and qualified personnel – needs investment opportunities. At the same time, investors from South Korea are expressing interest in the semiconductor industry in the Kyrgyz Republic. Kyrgyzstan has the most liberal regime of the Central Asian States. The Internet with its highly democratic principles are implemented into algorithms of the network operations and are sensitive to any restrictions in network access and management. This country has the most favorable conditions for development of network software applications and access to online informational resources and it can serve as a hub for the entire Central Asian region for information and telecommunication initiatives. The development of international transport corridors such as Traceka and the Silk Road, which pass through the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic, will stimulate a demand for all types of IT services to facilitate day-to-day operations of transport routes. Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan . 38 5.1 Development of ICT in different sectors 5.1.1 Legislation For sufficient development of ICTs, the following decrees should be adopted: • About Internet • Information security • Electronic documents • Electronic payment • Digital signatures • Electronic stamps • Information resources • Insurance of information risks • Personal data protection. In view of the rapid development of IT, the process of legislation should be accelerated. 5.1.2 Electronic government Electronic government is the system of interactive communications between citizens and the state. It is necessary to create centres providing information and communication services. 5.1.3 Development of electronic entrepreneurship The following factors are essential for the development of electronic commerce: • an increase in the population’s wealth and an improvement in the market. For buyers, an ability to pay for goods, and for sellers, an ability to pay for the creation and maintenance of electronic commerce systems; • an increase in the number of Internet users; • promotion of Internet in the society; • creation of reliable national electronic payment systems that provide access to financial information (bank accounts, credit cards etc.) through the Internet; • organization of courier delivery services with possibilities to pay in cash; • elimination of psychological barriers in shopping online through marketing and advertisement activities; • creation of a legal basis. Security is one of the most important issues in electronic commerce; and • training of specialists. 5.1.4 ICT development in the educational sector High school system • improve the quality of training (including upgrading of knowledge) of teachers of informatics at high schools; foresee targeted financing from all sources (state and local budgets, budgets of educational institutions, loans, grants, sponsorship, etc.) for implementation and development of ICT in the educational sector; Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan 39 • conclude establishment of distance training of high school teachers; create a national educational network with ISP functions; • develop new educational programmes, methods and technologies of teaching «informatics» in high school, and related subjects in high and medium professional institutions, including the most recent achievements in this sphere; • 100% computerization of high schools in Kyrgyzstan, less than 50% of them with modern computer classes; medium ratio of not more than 100 students per one computer in high schools; access to Internet of not less than 10% of high schools of Kyrgyzstan.

Telemedicine, providing distant healthcare services: • use of ICT for information exchange on diagnostics, treatment and improvement of qualification of employees. Telematics for research in healthcare: • cooperation between specialists and centres for the exchange of ideas, research results and access to sources of information and knowledge; • development of telematics technologies and applications. Telematics for management in healthcare: • use of ICTs for the control of diseases; Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan . 40 • evaluation of the quality, amount and efficiency of healthcare services Funding A significant part of the programme should be implemented through attracted investments. For the projects on improvement and development of the state policy and its legal and normative bases, funding will be allocated from state and local budgets as well as from budgets of state agencies. It may also attract foreign investments and grants of international organizations. The programme’s financial scheme plans to attract domestic commercial structures to the funding of profitable projects. Projects proposed and financed by commercial structures can be included into the Program. The amount of funding required for the first stage of the programme will be determined after projects are chosen for implementation. Projects of the program will be implemented based on tender and selection of the projects will be based on independent expertise. Expert groups will be composed of outstanding scientists and IT specialists. Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan 41 6. National major initiatives There are several major directions in which state institutions are actively involved: • development of the legal basis for the information society; • liberalisation of the information and telecommunications market; • encouragement of competition: de-monopolisation and privatisation; • provision of technical support for human rights via access to informational resources; • state guarantee to citizens on information and telecommunication services (mobile telephones, satellite communications, Internet, e-mail, multi-media, distance learning, telemedicine); • improvement of state management in the ICT field. The Ministry of Transport and Communications, the State Communications Agency and communication operators are jointly developing three programmes: • State programme on the development of communications in rural areas; • regional informatisation programme “Internet for villages”; • development of regional TV and radio broadcasting. Technological modernisation of telecommunications is proceeding as follows: • Digital automatic exchange stations • Digital data transfer technologies • Fiber optical lines • Satellite communications. The international SilkSat project is based on the use of satellite communications along the ancient Silk Road and is important for regional cooperation. In terms of this project, a Commission under the President and Satellite Technologies Center has been created. 70 % of the Kyrgyz territory consists of mountainous regions. In such conditions, instead of laying cables, it is more efficient to use terrestrial satellite technologies VSAT. A cost-efficient approach to the placing of a small satellite in orbit is available through Russian rocket launches. Kyrgyzstan is actively involved in numerous international agreements on the development of information exchange within CIS and regional cooperation in communications. Some of the major state initiatives include: • President’s Decree “About legal concept for informatization in the Kyrgyz Republic”, 17 October 1997; • Concept on informatization development in the Kyrgyz Republic, signed by President of the Kyrgyz Republic, 14 February 1998; • Decree of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic “About creation and use of tax and insurance payers common database”, 25 February1999; • President’s Decree “About creation and development of the State Computer Network and State Automatic System “Shailoo”, 26 March 1999; • President's Decree «About creation of the State Computer Network based on Information Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan . 42 Management System and State Automatic System “Shailoo”, 3 May 2001; • Kyrgyz Government Decree “About regulation of mutual use by state institutions of the State Computer Network”, 23 July 2001 • Decree of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic on the National Strategy ‘Information and Communication Technologies for Development in the Kyrgyz Republic’, 10 March 2002 Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan 43 Conclusion Strategically, Kyrgyzstan has few natural resources that can be used to spur overall economic development. However, it has an educated work force (literacy rate of 97 %), including a sizeable number of qualified computer specialists and programmers. The country has potential in some industries, such as hydro-electricity, tourism and water management. These industries require sophisticated information processing (management of electricity and water supply, promotion of tourism services over Internet, i.e., B2C systems). Kyrgyzstan is located on prospective intercontinental crossroads. The development of TRACEKA and the SilkRoad transport projects will require all types of telecommunication services to serve the day-to-day operations of transport corridors. While most traditional industries require a high level of investment, currently difficult or impossible for Kyrgyzstan, information technologies require relatively low initial investment. For a developing country, the most effective way to develop national ICT capabilities is to concentrate on initiatives that leverage the state’s limited resources to create the preconditions and favorable environment for private business development in ICT. The goal of the National ICT Strategy is to create appropriate conditions for the development of the IT sector of the economy, and to provide a basis for fast growth of private services in IT. Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan . 44 Annex I - Benchmarking Table 1 Stage Information infrastructure Internet availability Internet affordability Stage 1 Stage 2 A small minority in the community has good access to the telecommunications network, but most of the community does not. (Roughly: Teledensity is between two and eight mainlines per 100 people. Mobile wireless penetration is between 0.5 % and 3 %. Cable penetration is below 5 % of all household in the community) . Rates for local telephone calls are high enough to discourage extensive Internet use via local ISPs, even among those, who could afford Internet access. Local access solutions exist, but rates for ISP services are high enough to discourage extensive use. The lack of competition in the provision of commercial leased lines is reflected in prohibitively or very high leasing fees. Stage 3 There are between 0.5 and one million inhabitants per local ISP. ISPs provide full Internet access. Subscribers may have some options between various Internet service packages. There are some opportunities for public Internet access. It is normally possible for users to establish a dial-up connection to a local ISP, except during peak hours. One or two private providers lease lines to businesses. Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan 45 Table 2 Stage Network speed and quality Hardware and software Service and support Stage 1 Stage 2 Some off-the shelf hardware and software solutions are available locally, but there are none or very few in the native language of the community. Basic hardware and software is affordable for some citizens and small and medium-sized businesses. Stage 3 70-90 % of domestic telephone calls are successful. Connections are dropped with noticeable frequency and are somewhat disruptive. Fewer than 50 faults are reported per year for 100 mainlines. Users have access to dial-up modem transfer speeds of up to 28.8 Kbps. Leased lines with transfer speeds of up to 64 Kbps are widely available for businesses and ISPs. Limited higher-speed lines are available in some areas. Backbone facilities servicing the community are usually sufficient, although regular peak demand periods result in slower network response times. Packets loss by the network may occur but it is not generally disruptive. Mainlines take at least one month to be installed. It takes over a week for reported mainline problem to be resolved. There is a growing customer service ethic among service and support providers, although it is not a priority for most. Some ICT maintenance and technical support services are available. A nascent software industry is present in the community, and there are a growing number of hardware technicians, web designers and network administrators. Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan . 46 Table 3 Stage Schools’ access to ICTs Enhancing education with ICTs Developing the ICT workforce Stage 1 Stage 2 Where there are ICTs in schools, it is primarily at university level, and there are generally fewer than five computers in a school or faculty. Access to the computer(s) is limited to computer teachers and/or administrators. Computers tend to be older generation models, such as stand-alone 486 PCs or the equivalent. Where there are multiple computers installed, they are not networked. Use of the computer(s) is limited to electronic documents that are available on the hard drive or diskettes. There may be connectivity for store-and- forward e-mail. Only a few teachers use computers in a very limited fashion. Teachers’ basic computer literacy involves skills such as use of the keyboard and mouse, a basic understanding of the computer operating system, manipulation of files, and cutting and pasting. Computers are mainly used at the university level. Stage 3 Technical classes and programs on ICT-related subjects are available from a variety of public and private centres. Some limited online access to training is available. Some employers offer training in the use of information and communication technologies to their employees. Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan 47 Table 4 Stage People and organisations online Locally relevant content ICTS in everyday life ICTs in the work- place Stage 1 Stage 2 Much of the population has never heard of the Internet, and most people do not know anyone who has used it. Less than 0.5% of the population has used the Internet recently, and few are regular users. Some local businesses and institutions have registered domain names - fewer than two per 1000 inhabitants. No advertising in traditional media for online companies or resources exists. Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan . 48 Stage 3 Some local websites are available – most are static and updated infrequently. Websites carry diverse types of information for different community groups. Many websites are available in local languages or a dominant Web language spoken locally. There is some use of online bulletin-board systems, Usenet groups, newsletters, and/or listservs. Web-related training opportunities exist although can be expensive and accessible only in certain areas. Public telephones may be found in most parts of the community and are heavily used. Some members of the community have Internet access at home. Growing numbers of community members use telecenters, cyber-cafes and other businesses that offer computer use and online services to the public for a fee. Organisations achieve efficiency gains through some degree of deployment of ICT systems in their internal workings. Many computers in business offices are internally networked for data processing, management reporting, and other enterprise applications. Some employees conduct research and business transactions over the Web, though most often they use a shared workstation to do so. Some employees use e-mail for internal communications. Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan 49 Table 5 Stage ICT employment opportunities B2C electronic commerce B2B electronic commerce E-Government Stage 1 Stage 2 A few governmental websites exist, providing basic information, often directed at parties outside of the community. This information is static and infrequently updated. Some limited interaction with the government is possible by phone or fax. The government distributes some information about services, procedures, rights and responsibilities in hard copy. Stage 3 Technical skills in the community are becoming a source of competitive advantage and are beginning to attract investment and employment opportunities by companies from outside the community. Many businesses post key information on websites. Information is often nor kept current and relevant. Websites provide information on goods and services for sale. Purchases take place primarily in person, or by fax or phone, though electronic mail may expedite the process. Some businesses may have introduced online ordering. The deployment of electronic systems has increased efficiency and transparency and lowered transaction costs in B2B interactions. Some B2B transactions are supported by electronic systems (e.g. proprietary systems and databases), but some paper-based transactions (e.g. a signature) is usually required at some point. Electronic B2B transactions are a small percentage of overall B2B commerce. Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan . 50 Table 6 Stage Telecommunications regulation ICT trade policy Stage 1 Stage 2 Trade barriers for ICT equipment have been reduced, but are still relatively high. There has been some opening in service sectors related to electronic commerce and ICT networks. Foreign direct investment is allowed in network sectors under certain conditions. Stage 3 Plans for the liberalisation of the telecommunications sector are in place and are being implemented. Progress is being made in achieving universal access, but there are many hurdles in implementation. Services such as data, paging and mobile telephony are available from competing private providers. Alternative carriers compete for private network services, leased lines and other telecommunications services for businesses.

It is knowledge that has become the engine of the social,  economic and cultural development in the today’s world. Knowledge-intensive economic  activities are now a factor of production of strategic importance in the leading  countries.  They have also become the main indicator of the level of development and the  readiness of every country for a further economic and cultural growth in the 21st  century. Taking into consideration all these factors, the United Nations Economic  Commission for Europe has launched an initiative of monitoring and analyzing the  development of the knowledge-based economy in all the European countries in  transition and emerging market economies.     The major goal of this initiative is to stimulate the exchange of national  experiences, to identify best practices and to promote region-wide and global-wide  cooperation of the UNECE member States, which would accelerate the development of a  knowledge-based economy in the countries in transition and emerging market  economies. It envisages the preparation of country assessment reports on the biennium  basis by national experts, nominated by the Governments, the creation of a High-Level  Task Force on the Knowledge-Based Economy, which will consider the reports and  provide policy advice and recommendations to the participating countries, and the  development of  progress measurements and indicators, policy guidelines and tools to  assist countries in overcoming obstacles to the development of a knowledge-based  economy.       We hope that the country assessment reports, showing a detailed level of the  countries’ potential and providing information on various approaches and solutions,  will help policy-makers to take strategic decisions with regards to the challenges facing  them in the development of institutions, information and innovation systems, human  resources development and other areas crucial for the development of a knowledge- based economy.                                               Brigita Schmőgnerová   Executive Secretary  United Nations Economic Commission for Europe               iii                                                                                                                      PREFACE         The industrial revolution of the 19th century and the scientific revolution of the 20th  century have prepared the conditions for the rise of the knowledge-based economy. Economic  activities associated with the production and utilization of information and knowledge have  become an engine of economic growth in the developed market economies, increasingly  transforming all the other dimensions of development and the entire societal modus vivendi  and modus operanti of the humanity.     What do we mean by “the knowledge-based economy”?      It is not just the digital economy, which incorporates the production and use of  computers and telecommunication equipment. It is not quite the networked economy, which  incorporates the telecommunication and networking growth during the last decades and its  impact on human progress.     The knowledge-based economy is a much complex and broader phenomenon. There  are different dimensions and aspects of the knowledge-based economy:      1. The knowledge-based economy has a very powerful technological driving force – a  rapid growth of information and telecommunication technologies (ICT). Every three –  four year there appears a new generation of ICT.  Today, the ICT companies are  among the largest corporations. The ICT sector is among the fastest growing  economic sectors.     2. Telecommunication and networking, stimulated by a rapid growth of ICTs, have   penetrated all the spheres of human activity, forcing them to work into an absolutely  new mode and creating new spheres. The information society has become a reality.     3. Knowledge, based on information and supported by cultural and spiritual values, has   become an independent force and the most decisive factor of social, economic,  technological and cultural transformation.     4. The knowledge-based economy has allowed a quick integration of the enormous   intellectual resources of economies in transition into the European intellectual pool,  stimulating the development of the former countries. Every country can benefit from  developing a knowledge-based economy to become a more equal participant in the  global development process.     5. The emerging knowledge-based economy has been affecting other areas of societal   activity in every country, including institutional and innovation system, human  resources development and etc. and visa versa. The knowledge-based economy has  become an engine of progress in every country. If a country is developed, it has a  developed knowledge-based economy, if a country is lagging behind, a knowledge- based economy constitutes just a small fraction of its economy.          v        The report below was prepared by a national expert, nominated by the Government, and  represents an overview of the present situation and an assessment of the emerging trends  in all the major areas, constituting the foundation of the knowledge-based economy, such  as policy and policy instruments, institutional regime, ICT infrastructure, information  system, national innovation capacities and capabilities.                                                                                             vi                                                                                                                  Contents    Introduction .............................................................................................................................. 3    1.

The swift  advancement of ICT has made it possible to bring together people, economies and cultures.   However, more than 850 million people in developing countries are still excluded from this  process and remain greatly isolated from the information and progress inherent in science and  technology today.     The Kyrgyz Republic is a landlocked country, endowed with few natural resources, but it has a  tremendously advantageous location on the major crossroads between Asia and Europe. The  development of Euro–Asian transport projects will, however, require a wide range of  telecommunication services to serve the day-to-day operations of the transport corridor. The  country also has potential in industries such as the hydro-electric production, tourism, and  management of water resources, each of which require sophisticated information processing.      With the help of the World Bank, the EBRD and other international agencies, a basic  telecommunications infrastructure has been built in the Kyrgyz Republic. USAID, UNDP and  ADB have sponsored development of the network software applications for state agencies and the  educational sector. The NATO Science Programme is supporting the National Research and  Educational Network (NREN) through provision of satellite communication services for the  Kyrgyz academic sector. The Trans-Eurasia fiber optical line (Shanghai – Frankfurt) goes  through the territory of this country and is providing access to the World Internet at a capacity of  622 Mbps.      The educational level is very high in the Kyrgyz Republic, producing many highly-qualified  domestic IT specialists. This offers a challenge for the Kyrgyz Republic to improve linkage with  industrialised countries through the rapid development of the telecommunications sector.            Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan                                                                               .                                                                                        4  1. National Strategy and Action Plan    1.1 National strategy    The Decree of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic PD № 54 On the National Strategy  ‘Information and Communication Technologies for Development in the Kyrgyz Republic’,  entered into force on 10 March 2002. The strategy includes the following five chapters:     • Introduction  • Main objectives, tasks and priorities of the National Strategy  • Main principles and directions of the national ICT policy  • State support in the development of the priority areas of the national strategy  • Organizational, economic and financial mechanisms in implementation and monitoring of   the national strategy                                                                                             Country Readiness Assessment Report –  Kyrgyzstan                                           5       1.1.1 Introduction    All social relationships have been fundamentally changed by modern information and  communication technologies (ICT) that have established a new information society. New  technologies alter not only how goods and services are produced, but also create new  opportunities in the spheres of civic rights, personal development, knowledge gathering,  education for the younger generation and leisure time activities. In an information society the  importance of geographical distance is diminished, globalisation occurs, and there are  unprecedented opportunities for regional development.      During recent years the Kyrgyz Republic has made considerable progress in the development of   an information infrastructure, and in the informatisation of state organisations and private  companies.  This has required the development of  relevant legislative and the improvement of  education levels. The first telecommunications project and TAE Projects have been completed;  the State Computer Network (SCN hereinafter) has been established; information projects are  being carried out in various economic sectors; and Internet pages of state and non-governmental  organizations and commercial structures are being created. Alluding to this, the President of the  Kyrgyz Republic, Askar Akaev, declared in the World Economic Forum in Davos (Switzerland)  in 1998: ‘Kyrgyzstan chooses the informational society’.      Problems with ICT development in the Kyrgyz Republic have demonstrated the need to move  away from a one-sided policy of just developing communications and information technologies,  to the formulation of a nation-wide strategy for integration with the world information society.  Given  the technological opportunities already available, main policy directions could include the  formation of an interconnecting information space in the country; and the development of  information resources, data bases, knowledge and information infrastructures, which could be  used by both state structures and the general public on the parity basis. These directions will  involve the development of informational law, technological facilities, and organisations.      The National Strategy ‘Information and Communication Technologies for Development in the  Kyrgyz Republic’ (National Strategy) sets out the main priorities, objectives and tasks,   principles, provisions and directions of the national ICT policy.  The National Strategy is viewed  as an important area for development for implementation of the Complex Development  Framework up to 2010 (CDF hereinafter). ICT provides opportunities to achieve CDF objectives,  accelerate economic development and reduce poverty. ICT has the potential to become a catalyst  and a driving force in the development of Kyrgyzstan.    Potential benefits from ICT development include: achievement of effective management;  increased labour productivity; availability of new export opportunities, in particular in the area of  software exporting and delivery of ICT services; provision of information to farmers on  agricultural markets and weather conditions; creation of  primary consultative medical assistance;  expansion of distance learning capabilities; improved cooperation between the state, local  communities and private sector in regions; and an improved quality of state services rendered  to  the general population. ICT sector share in GDP needs to increase to 5% by 2010.    The National Strategy also describes the organisational, economic and financial mechanisms  necessary for its implementation. The mechanisms are based on a targeted programme which  respects and is subject to regular monitoring and transparency execution.  These mechanisms  reflect the speech made by the President of the Kyrgyz Republic, Mr A. Akaev, during the First          Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan                                                                               .                                                                                        6  National ICT Summit held on 27-28 April, 2001 in Bishkek. During the summit, the President  proposed the following:    • the creation of a permanent agency in charge of the implementation of the National  Strategy;   • the need to identify a person responsible for ICT development in each ministry and  agency;   • the creation of an ICT Development Fund;  • the establishment of an ongoing monitoring scheme in this area.      The National Strategy determines the basics of funding for ICT development, stipulating; a  rational use of funds for the development and modernisation of projects and mass media in  various sectors and regions; an increasingly transparent and targeted use of funds.    The National ICT Strategy is designed to solve the problem of growing ‘digital inequality’  between industrially advanced and developing countries, as well as internally - between the  centre of the Kyrgyz Republic and its regions. In eradicating ‘digital inequality’ and promoting  regional cooperation in Central Asia, an important role will be played by international projects  intended for the creation or use of satellite telecommunication systems (Silk Sat, Virtual Silk  Road).    Representatives of different ministries and agencies, international organisations, civil society and  the private sector have participated in the ICT Strategy development. Free Internet discussion   has taken place in addition to a round table with the participation of representatives from the  public sector, civil society, private businesses, and international organisations. It is noteworthy  that the development of the National ICT Strategy was done with the active support and direct  involvement of the UNDP Resident Office in Kyrgyzstan, Internews, GIPI, and other  international and non-governmental organizations.

Main directions:   • effective ICT use in bridging partnership relations between different sectors of the  country and of society engaged in different activities; implementing social  programs and establishing an information society;   • ICT application in the improvement of citizens’ education and the protection of  interests of different groups of population;   • attraction of social attention to key events in social, economic and political life of  the country; involvement of NGOs in activities supporting the poorer layers of the  population;   • development of the information resources network for NGOs and population.          Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan                                                                               .                                                                                        12    1.1.5 Organisational, economic and financial mechanisms to implement and monitor  national strategy       1.1.5.1 Methodology for the ICT strategy implementation       To achieve the goals set by the National Strategy requires the creation of effective organisational,  economic and financial mechanisms that: stimulate ICT development, information infrastructure  and information industry; create a favorable investment climate for the strategy’s  implementation; optimise utilisation of financial resources allocated to ICT development; and  regularly monitor and evaluate the current status of the National Strategy implementation.      The methodology for preparing and implementing the National Strategy includes preparation of a  medium-term strategy for a period of five years, a government programme of information and  communication technologies development in the Kyrgyz Republic, and annual preparations and  implementation of the Action plan on the National Strategy implementation. The National  Strategy was developed in line with the Comprehensive Development Frameworks.     To evaluate current status of ICT in Kyrgyzstan a methodology developed by UNDP has been  used.  The methodology is based on the Guidelines “Readiness for a Net World” for developing  countries prepared by the Center of International Development at Harvard University.  The  methodology allows the assessment of the ICT development level in Kyrgyzstan at the current  stage and plans its development for the near future, identifying indicators for objectives  achievement. A group of experts has identified six basic dimensions in the monitoring and  evaluation of ICT development in Kyrgyzstan:    • access to the Internet (opportunities of access to Internet; cost and quality of ICT nets,  service and equipment);    • public administration in the information century (electronic governance);   • teaching of information technologies (integration of ICT in teaching  progress,   availability of training-programs for preparation of specialists in ICT sphere);   • information society (how society uses ICT for its needs, access to information for   citizens),   • development of the net Economy (how business uses ICT, partnerships of business,   government and civil society);  • government policy in ICT area (creation of a favourable environment for the   development of the information society).      A system of indicators defining the level of readiness for a net world has been developed for each  of these dimensions.     For effective formulation and implementation of the National Strategy, as well as for ensuring  effective mechanisms for implementing programmes in ICT, the Government of the Kyrgyz  Republic proposed an administrative management structure presented in the Programme of  information-communication technologies development in the Kyrgyz Republic.     The National Strategy identifies areas where it is necessary to develop a programme of  interventions in order to achieve the aims of the National Strategy. Each area will have specific  projects. These projects should be developed in detail in annual program measures. Each  programme’s objective should be the promotion of an informational society in Kyrgyzstan and  the elimination of existing barriers and problems that limit the development and application of                                                                                           Country Readiness Assessment Report –  Kyrgyzstan                                           13     ICT.     1.1.5.2 Measures of National Strategy implementation     Organisational measures support the following directions:    • active propaganda of the National Strategy;  • coordination of works on informatisation of public administration bodies, various   programmes and projects on ICT development;  • introduction of mechanism for the competitive selection of the targeted programmes    and projects on informatisation development, and their implementation on the basis of  independent expertise;    • tax-financial stimulation, and control over utilisation of funds;   • regular monitoring and evaluation of the status of the National Strategy   implementation.      The Council for Information–Communication Technologies, under the President of the Kyrgyz  Republic, (ICT Council) carries out the overall coordination of  planned activities. The ICT  Council reviews materials on the Strategy’s implementation, checks the execution of programmes  and projects, as well as the use of funds. A plenipotentiary executive body determined within the  framework of the ICT Development Programme performs current work.      Projects and programmes for implementation of the National Strategy are directed by the ICT  Council through an executive body to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic for inclusion in  the republican budget as a separate budget line.     1.1.5.3 Economic and financial measures for implementation of the National Strategy    Implementation of the National Strategy and its basic objectives should be embodied in the  Programme of Information and Communicational Technologies for Development, approved by  the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic.     It is expedient that financial support to national, social, scientific-technical and educational  projects in ICT area be rendered through the Fund on ICT Development created especially by the  Kyrgyz Republic Government. The ICT Development Fund accumulates funds of the state  budget, non-budgetary resources, credits, investments and commercial funds attracted in  accordance with legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic. ICT programs and projects are financed from  the ICT Development Fund.     Necessary interventions for the ICT area are:    • creation of an effective mechanism for attraction of investments, and accumulation,  coordination  and distribution of resources;    • effective monitoring and control over the use of these resources;   • ensuring correlation of financing with a strategy for development of a uniform   information space in the Kyrgyz Republic.     An executive body, authorised by the Government  of the Kyrgyz Republic, conducts analytical  work regarding the status of ICT development in the republic, and produces the summary  report  on expenditures on ICT development for an accounting year. The results of the budget execution  are submitted by the given body to the ICT Council, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and  the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic. The ICT Council reviews proposals on financing          Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan                                                                               .                                                                                        14  the branches and recommends to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic adoption of the  corresponding measures.      1.1.5.4 Monitoring and evaluation system creation to track implementation of the National   Strategy     Monitoring and evaluation of ICT development should be placed as a priority task of the national  information policy.    Some components of the system of monitoring and evaluation of the status of ICT development  in the country have been already created. The President’s Decree of 18 June 2001, №199 ‘On the  Council on Information and Communicational Technologies under the President of the Kyrgyz  Republic’ established the ICT Council. The Kyrgyz Republic Government’s Resolutions of 8  November 2001, №697 and of 23 July 2001,  №367 adopted correspondingly the Program on  ICT development in the Kyrgyz Republic, and the Regulations for operations of public  administration bodies in the State Computer Network according to which a responsible ICT staff  position should be created in all public administration bodies and local state administrations. The  Ministry of Justice of the Kyrgyz Republic has registered the Center of ICT Development at the  Ministry of Transport and Communication.      1.1.5.5 International cooperation and donor support for the National Strategy    Objective: the observance of interests of the Kyrgyz Republic in international information  exchange; the inclusion of national information and telecommunication nets and resources in the  global infrastructure; the attraction of investments and donors assistance; ensuring security of  national information resources and information–telecommunication infrastructure.     Donors provide significant and critical support to the initiatives on ICT sector development in  Kyrgyzstan. The donors’ assistance is expressed in two different ways: in direct support to ICT  sector capacity, and in indirect support to the sector through the application of information  technologies in donors’ programs and projects.  As regards direct support to the sector, the  activities of UNDP, World Bank and EBRD have been notable in the improvement  of the overall  performance of the telecommunication system.  USAID assists in the use of ICT in public health  and other sectors. The NATO scientific program supports the development of national academic  research and educational networks. UNDP pays great attention to ICT sector development in  public administration, development of human resources, and in private and civil sectors,  expressed both via a number of projects and programmes in these areas, and via sponsorship of  the National ICT Summit, a strategically important contribution towards the formation of  Kyrgyzstan’s national strategy.     Inter-state programs of partner countries include the Great Britain, Germany, the Netherlands,  Denmark, Canada, USA, Turkey, Switzerland and Japan.  These have had a significant effect in  stimulating development of ICT sector capacity, and on the implementation of information  technologies in Kyrgyzstan. At the meeting of the Great Eight countries in Okinava City in Japan,  the Japanese Government expressed their intention to increase financing of programmes on  capacity development of information technologies in developing countries.    For ICT development in Kyrgyzstan it is very important that international organisations and  donor countries continue their strategic support for the ICT sector.  Donating finance in this way  will be a priority programme, allowing donors to play an active part in formation and  implementation of the National Strategy.

The Institutional Regime     The importance of ICT for the overall socio-economic development of Kyrgyzstan has been  recognized  at the most senior government level. President A. Akaev declared in Davos in 1998  that “Kyrgyzstan opts for an information society”. Since that time, numerous decrees and  normative acts have been adopted to create suitable conditions for ICT development in the  country.     Since 2000, a Global Internet Program Initiative (GIPI) by Internews Networks has been actively  involved in the creation of a favourable legal environment for the development of Internet related  issues. The GIPI project is working together with state institutions, NGOs and the commercial  sector.     The First National ICT Summit took place in February 2001. Significant attention at the Summit  was devoted to the development of a legal basis for ICT, and a national legal framework for ICT  was presented and discussed.     The primary obstacle to telecommunications development in the republic, is Kyrgyztelecom’s  monopoly over international.  This originates from the necessity pay back a loan taken from the  World Bank and EBRD for the First Telecommunications project. The regulations associated  with this do not allow the legal development of IP telephony in the country. As a result of  Kyrgyzstan’s entry to the WTO, it has been decided to abolish the exclusive rights of  Kyrgyztelecom from 2003 to 2008. A further step towards the de-monopolisation of the  telecommunications industry has been taken with the development of the “Concept on  reorganisation and privatisation of the joint stock venture Kyrgyztelecom”.     Executive power in the field of informatisation belongs to the following agencies:     • Ministry of Transport and Communications  • State Communication Agency  • State Commission on radio frequencies      Based on the discussions and recommendations of the First National ICT Summit, the State ICT  Council was created in June 2001 with President A. Akaev as Chairman. This body is determines  strategy, state policy and legal aspects for ICT development, and any major programmes and  initiatives in this field now need the approval of the ICT Council.      The Ministry of Transport and Communications is responsible for the following:     • development of state policy in electronic and traditional mail;  • preparation of normative acts relating to electronic mail and to post offices inside the   country and at an international level;  • conduct of negotiations on communications with foreign states.      The State Commission on Radio Frequencies is responsible for the following:     • development of regulations regarding the use of radio frequencies;  • creation of the National Table on frequencies and long-term development of radio          Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan                                                                               .                                                                                        20  communications in the Kyrgyz Republic.    The National Communication Agency is responsible for the following:     • monitoring and support of competition between operators;  • provision of equal access to electric communications networks;  • monitoring of conditions for the general public to use electriconic communications   networks;  • creation, development and use of the state system of radio control;  • preparation, control and monitoring of the national telephone numbers system;  • monitoring of the quality of communication services;  • provision of radio frequencies to users.      The “Regulation on the Coordination Council on satellite technologies under the President of the  Kyrgyz Republic” was approved.       The following ICT related normative acts are in place in the Kyrgyz Republic:     • “About electronic and mail communications”;  • “About informatisation”;  • “About legal protection of programmes for computers and databases”;   • “About topologies of integral microchips”;  • “About scientific technical information”;  • “About obligatory sets of documents”;  • “About electronic payments”;  • “About electronic signatures”.     In order to provide legal support to the development of information technologies, it is necessary  to provide the following:     • transparency of state institutions;  • regulation of monopolies in telecommunications;  • legal regulation of new relationships arising from the development of information   technologies.    The “Concept of informatisation development” was approved by the President in February 1998,   and aimed at creating favourable conditions to satisfy the information needs of the society. It  includes:     • regulation of ownership of information;  • rights of private and legal entities to information;  • regulation of access to information;  • safety of information and telecommunication systems;  • information safety of the state, the society, and the individual;  • responsibilities of the members of the information environment.      The law “About informatisation” of 1999 states that informatisation is a stand-alone field in the  economy of the Kyrgyz Republic. This law defines the following terms: informatisation  infrastructure, state and non-governmental information systems, information resources, protection                                                                                           Country Readiness Assessment Report –  Kyrgyzstan                                           21     of information.     The laws “About legal protection of computer programs and databases” and “About legal  protection of chips” have been approved.    A decree on punishment for computer information crimes exists in the legislation of the Kyrgyz  Republic. However, there are no decrees in the field of management of state and non-governmental  information resources.     The decree “About insurance of information risks” has not yet been issued. Use of modern  technologies can cause financial losses as a result of information risks, and insurance is seen as  the solution to this problem.    An association of communication operators was established in the Kyrgyz Republic in 2001. The  association has actively participated in the formulation of normative acts in the information  technologies field. Recently, the association opposed an attempt by Kyrgyztelecom to charge  payments for local phone calls on a time basis. Such a step would negatively affect the majority  of Internet users who use dial-up access.

The budget of the project was 27,400,000 U.S.D.  As a result of this  project, the telecommunications infrastructure of the country has been improved considerably:      • earth satellite stations of the standards A, F and B were installed;  • a network connecting regional centers was reconstructed;  • digital telephone stations were built in Bishkek and regional centers;  • digital telephone stations in Bishkek were linked by fiber optic cables, with the   help of SDH technology.      The Chuy Telecommunication project was financed via a loan from the Korean Government of  12,000,000 U.S.D. Digital telephone stations with a capacity of 43 784 lines were established in  the Chuy valley. A fiber optic line Bishkek – Kant – Ivanovka – Tokmok – Kemin was built.     The Osh Telecommunication project was funded by the Kuwait Fund of Arabic Economic  Development, with a sum of 8,700,000 U.S.D. It was used to modernise telecommunications  infrastructure in the south of the country, including Osh, Jalal – Abad and Batken provinces.  Digital telephone stations with a capacity of 23 400 numbers were installed in Osh City and  regional centres.       The Trans – Asia – Europe Fiber Optic line, connecting Shanghai, China and Frankfurt – on –  Main, Germany, goes through the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic. Right now, eight countries  (China, Romania, Hungary, Austria, Iran, Poland, Germany, and the Kyrgyz Republic) have  completed their segments, and the total length of the TAE is 27,000 km. In some places in  Kyrgyzstan, access to the backbone will be done through radio-relay communication facilities by  NERA Co. This backbone will provide access to many countries in Europe and Asia with a speed  of 622 Mbps.     The National Research and Educational Network (NREN) was sponsored by the NATO  Science Programme. Via this project, research and educational institutions have obtained satellite  backbone communication lines with a capacity of 2,5 Mbps.       3.2 Communication facilities     The prospect of participating in the development of the world’s telecommunications systems has  generated increased interest by entrepreneurs in the telecommunications market of Kyrgyzstan.     Current conditions    The highest growth rates among licenses for electronic communication services relate to licenses  (including applications) for data transmission, for telematic services, and for the renting of  channels. As a result, the total share of licenses for electronic communication, has increased by  3% during the first 11 months of 2000, totalling 23%. At the same time, the number of  applications for this kind of activity is increasing.                                                                                              Country Readiness Assessment Report –  Kyrgyzstan                                           23     Despite the fact that the license agreement of “Kyrgyztelecom” grants exclusive rights for long  distance and international communication services until 2003 only, in reality “Kyrgyztelecom”  still has a monopoly in the local communications market due to the lack of profit from local  communications at current tariffs.     Traditional communication services    Currently, the fixed public telephone network of “Kyrgyztelecom” includes 475,300 lines (data  from the annual report of JSC “Kyrgyztelecom” for 2000). “Kyrgyztelecom” has inherited from  the former Soviet Union a hierarchical network structure that includes primary, secondary and  local networks. The primary network consists of cable, radio-relay, satellite and some air trunk  lines. It embraces all oblasts of Kyrgyzstan and connects them with networks of other countries  through multi-channel long-distance communication equipment. Additionally, the primary  network includes intra-zone and local primary networks that, in turn, include transmission  systems which connect automated telephone stations (ATS).  The secondary network includes  equipment that provides connection from international stations to ATS, to which clients are  directly connected.     Almost two thirds of the total volume of switching equipment consists of coordinate type stations  which are used in rural telephone networks, while digital ones are being installed in urban areas,  where high purchasing power and demand for additional services exist. As such, the dynamics of  capacity being used in cities and in rural areas differ. The low level of income in rural areas, and  the migration of active sectors of that population to urban zones or outside the country, have been  a factor in the decrease of the ratio of telephone use in rural areas.     In December 1996, under a credit agreement between “Kyrgyztelecom” and the EBRD, a surface  satellite station of “A” standard was installed. Currently, this station provides direct international  access to Japan, China, Germany, Great Britain, and India, with subsequent transit to other  countries of the world. Practically, with their installation of surface satellite stations of “A”, “F”,  and “B” standards, and automated long-distance telephone station (ALDTS) with a total capacity  of 2.7 thousand channels, Kyrgyz communication networks are broadly integrated with world  telecommunication networks.     Moreover, construction of the Kyrgyz section of the Trans Eurasia (TE) optical line, which  directly connects Shanghai, China and Frankfurt, Germany, has been completed. The total length  of TE is 27,000 km, and the length of the Kyrgyz section is 183 km. International connections  will be made through Synchronic Digital Hierarchy (SDH) transmission lines, with a capacity of  768 channels (622Mbs). Transmission centres in administrative and regional centers will have a  capacity of 1920 channels (155Mbs). Except Bishkek, Sokuluk, Belovodskoe, Kara-Balta, and  Kaindy will be connected to TE. This project will provide Kyrgyzstan with direct access to many  countries of Europe and Asia.     In Bishkek, the largest and most promising communications market of the Kyrgyz republic, trunk  transport communication infrastructure is being actively established. An optical cable with  utilisation of SDH technologies, for the purpose of arranging inter-station connection with a data  transfer speed of 622Mbs, has been installed. The capacity of the optical cable is 24 fibers.  However, in spite of all the measures which have been implemented (modernization of network,  creation of trunk infrastructure), the level of installation of telephones in Kyrgyzstan is still one  of the lowest among CIS countries. In 2000, the level of telephone installations – the telephone  density (number of telephone units, including coin telephones and state owned telephones          Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan                                                                               .                                                                                        24  connected to the general network) was 7.5 per 100 people. In other words, with an average  number of four people per family, only about 30% of households have telephones. If coin and  state-owned telephones are excluded from this calculation, then the density is lower still.  The  International Monetary Fund considers telephone density as one of the most important economic  indicators of a country’s level of development.     Such a low level of telephone installations can be explained partly by features of the Kyrgyz  landscape. Almost 67% of the population resides in rural mountainous areas, making telephone  installation very costly and requiring substantial capital investment. Accordingly, telephone  density in Kyrgyzstan is unevenly distributed.     On one hand, the low level of telephone installations indicates a potential growth market for  telecommunications. On the other hand, it necessitates heavy capital investment, namely foreign  investments as Kyrgyz internal investment capabilities are very low.     As in the majority of the former Soviet Union countries, Kyrgyzstan has a low volume of general  telephone traffic per line. At the same time, almost all local traffic is free of charge. Only a small  proportion of institutions, organizations and enterprises are charged for such traffic.     Diagram: General traffic in minutes per line, per month (data from a statistical survey)        250                 20              Eastern Europe       Kyrgyzstan     Kazakhstan      The low traffic per line, 10 times below identical indicators in countries of Eastern Europe,  underpins the theory that the communications market has substantial reserves of potential  revenues.     While tariffs for international communications are the tariffs for local and national long-distance  services are, by contrast, very low. They constitute a social rather than economic burden, and do  not cover costs - especially those of local communication links. As a result, the present tariff  system of “Kyrgyztelecom” does not allow for expansion and modernisation of the  telecommunication network. In terms of revenues, the Kyrgyz telephone network is one of the  poorest among the CIS countries.     Recently, new services such as pager, data transmission, Internet, and cellular communications,  are developing in the communication market. The Memorandum of the World Bank does not  assign a fundamental role to the participation of the National operator “Kyrgyztelecom” in the  development of such market niches. The role of “Kyrgyztelecom” is to establish and provide a  transport network for private operators.                                                                                           Country Readiness Assessment Report –  Kyrgyzstan                                           25       Cellular communication network    Presently, mobile cellular communication is managed by two operators: “Katel and “Bitel”.  The cellular communication system of “Katel” is based on the American AMPS standard in its  digital version. The network has been operating for more than six years, and has about 7,000  clients (expert evaluation).     Katel’s base equipment was installed by “Ericsson” and “Motorola”. Presently, the network  covers Bishkek, Chui Oblast, Issyk-Kul Oblast, Osh, and Jalal-Abad. The estimated volume of  investment is about US$ 5 million.     Bitel’s cellular communication system is based on the European GSM standard. The network has  been operating for more than three years, and has about 10,000 clients. Most of the equipment  used is made by “Ericsson”, “Siemens” and “Huawei”. The GSM network covers Bishkek, Chui  Oblast, northern part of Issyk-Kul Oblast, and Osh. The volume of investment is about US$ 6  million.     With the appearance of a second operator in the cellular communications market, a rapid decrease  of tariffs from US $ 0.25 to 0.5 per minute to US $ 0.25 to 0.30 occurred. Subsequently, with an  increase in competition, the tariffs of both companies decreased even further down to US $ 0.07  to 0.15 per minute. However, in spite of these reductions, there has been no substantial growth in  the market. The primary users of cellular communication are still businessmen, international  organisations and sectors of the state elite. Penetration of the market by cellular communications  is only 0.4%. The world average for this indicator is between 3 and 5%, and in European  countries, such as Norway and Finland, it is 60%. The primary reason for the poor penetration  level of cellular communication services is low income.     Paging services    Another segment of the communication market is paging. There are three operators working in  this segment: “Areopag-Page”, “Smart-Page” and “Gelio-Page”.     “Areopag-Page” provides services in Bishkek, Chui Oblast, Ussy-Kul Oblast, Osh and Jalal- Abad. Its clients number approximately 3,000. Russian paging technologies are used on the basis  of Motorola’s transmitters. In the near future, the company is planning to transfer to the “Flex”  American protocol.     “Smart-Page” provides services in Bishkek, Issyk-Kul and Chui Oblasts. Its clients number  approximately 2,000.     “Gelio-Page” provides services in Bishkek to approximately 500 to 700 clients.     All paging providers work on the basis of the outdated “Pocsaq” protocol, using Russian  technologies. The major function of paging services includes transmission of text messages  through their own operator centers. With increase of competition, tariffs have halved from   US $ 20 to between US $ 9 and $ 11.     Two companies (“Areopag-Page” and “Smart-Page”) have, for a long time, provided services  through the Internet, omitting operator centers. Total investments made by the companies have          Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan                                                                               .                                                                                        26  not exceeded US $ 500,000. However, in spite of low tariffs and strong competition, this market  still attracts only mid-size investors.  A Kyrgyz-Chinese joint venture also plans to provide  services in the near future.    There is growth potential in this market, probably through provision of additional services.  In  particular, this is likely to involve making pagers into info-commutators via active use of the  Internet and automation of message transmission.. Taking into consideration all of the above, and  given sufficient GNP growth, the capacity of the market may reach 10 to 15 thousand clients.     Trunk telephone communication services    There are several companies working to provide radio-trunking services primarily in Bishkek and  Chui Oblast on the basis of the “Smarttrunk-II” protocol. However, this market is not expected to  show much further development.  One exception to this concerns “Areopag-Bishkek”, which  installed the local “Smarttrunk-II” radio communication systems not only in Bishkek, but also in  Osh and Balykchi. This company also started to implement a radio communication system on the  basis of the MRT-1327 protocol.    TV broadcasting services    A special place in the market belongs to the radio-relay communication network, TV and radio  broadcasting. Services in this market used to be provided by the Republican Production Union of  radio-relay trunk lines, TV and radio broadcasting (RPU).  However, according to the Resolution  of the Government # 220, as of 25 April, RPU has entered the “Kyrgyztelecom” structure.    RPU includes companies that provide radio and TV channels to TV and radio companies, for  broadcasting of their programmes over the territory of the republic, transportation of TV and  radio programmes, and long distance communication channels, via radio-relay lines. Private TV  and radio companies do not use the services of RPU due to their small financial capacity. State  TV is transmitted via 50 stations, with the number of programmes broadcast not less than two.  Bishkek and the neighbouring regions of Chui Oblast receive five TV and two radio programmes.     In the last year, “Ala-TV” company has begun to develop the cable TV market. This company is  a joint-stock company and one of its investors is a well-known American company,  “Metromedia”. This company actively develops cable TV networks and paging services in CIS,  and has begun to invest in cellular communication systems. The project is interesting because the  company has started to develop its own cable industry infrastructure (mainly optical cable). The  company’s tariffs are not high and, as such, client interest is expected to be favourable. To date,  the company has only been able to cover only a small part of Bishkek, and without expansion  there is a danger the company will not be able to attract a satisfactory number of clients.  However, given the rapid development of technologies, it is possible that in the years ahead, this  company may become a participant in the market for local telephone communication services.     Subsequent to the introduction of card telephones, there have been some developments in the  pay-for-telephone segment of the market. This project was launched by the “Telcard” company,  using pay-for-telephones of the well-known French “Schlumberger” company, with subsequent  transfer of the system to JSC “Kyrgyztelecom”.  As such “Kyrgyztelecom” still has a monopoly  in the  pay-for-telephone services market. Currently, “Kyrgyztelecom” operates about 1,000 coin  telephones and 300 chip-card telephones. Approximately 70% of the above- mentioned  telephones are in Bishkek, while the rest are distributed among oblast centers. The development                                                                                           Country Readiness Assessment Report –  Kyrgyzstan                                           27     of pay-for-telephone services is possible only upon full transfer to telephones with chip-cards.  Coin telephones are not well suited for accounting purposes. The transfer to a time-based  calculation of telephone conversations assumes a system of advance payment for telephone cards.  Merely shifting to a different technology with prepaid telephone cards could revive the pay-for- telephone market without additional, substantial investments. This could be achieved simply by  re-equipping functioning coin-telephones.       3.3 Internet in the Kyrgyz Republic      3.3.1 Informational computer networks coming into being in  the Kyrgyz Republic (1991-  1993)    The history of informational computer networks for the public in the Kyrgyz Republic began in  1991, when a server of  the “Ala-Too” telecommunications network was founded, working via  Almaty’s RICC server and serving about 20 subscribers.    In May 1992, the “Imfiko” (“Imfiko” firm) network subscriber gained the official status of the  RELCOM network function, serving about 50 network subscribers by the end of 1992, and  sending information through Russian networks.      3.3.2 History of Internet services (1994-1996)    Two companies (ElCat and AsiaInfo) were founded in 1994, and these are currently the largest  Internet providers on Kyrgyz Republic territory.    The joint state-private venture firm ElCat was founded in 1994, based on the IMFIKO server of  the “RELCOM” network in Kyrgyzstan, to fulfill the national network creation project. The  ElCat firm provided e-mail delivery on the territory of Kyrgyzstan, connection with CIS countries  and, since 1995, a full Internet services package connecting to networks all over the world.     The ASIAINFO telecommunications enterprise was founded in 1994 as the Kyrgyz branch of the  INFOTEL network to provide services using the X.25 protocol. Founders of this firm were the  Russian firm INFOTEL and KyrgyzTelecom. TheEnterprise provides connection with more than  200 data transfer networks using the X.25 protocol, and with the Internet society, using the  TCP/IP protocol.     In 1995, one more company appeared on the network services market – Transfer LTD.     3.3.3 The early Internet development period (1997-1998)    The further development of the Internet services market in Kyrgyzstan was interrelated with the  reconstruction of telecommunications. In 1997, providers and users considerably improved the  quality of modems. Modems with a speed lower than 19,2 Kb/s, although widely spread, were  changed for devices of V.34 and V.34+ standards (28,8/33,6 Kb/s).     During this period, for the first time non-commercial providers appeared on the Internet services  market in Kyrgyzstan:       FreeNet (IRIS)  TCP/IP, FR ElCat          Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan                                                                               .                                                                                        28   Soros Foundation in Bishkek TCP/IP, FR AsiaInfo     Internet access services provided by FreeNet and the Soros Foundation are free because the  providers themselves are non-commercial organisations and operate with the support of foreign  sponsors. This Internet access is provided selectively, based on a statement made by the sponsor.  In general, it is provided to educational, science or other organisations (eg. the mass media) on a  competitive basis.     3.3.4 Current condition of the Internet services market in Kyrgyzstan (1999-2001)    The last two years of Internet market development have been characterised not only by an  expansion of both the technical potential of providers and the number of Internet users, but also  by the increasing number of services being provided.     A good indicator of Internet development during the last two years is the increase of the joint  Internet access channel. While in 1998, the common channel of providers was about 768 Kb/s, in  2000, the joint channel has risen five times and amounts to more than 4 Mb/s.    In fact, the Internet access market has about 6,000 active users. The number of potential users is  approximately 20,000. This category includes people that could use the Internet but do not have  access to it. Free opportunities to learn about and use the Internet, provided by institutions of  higher education and international organisations, considerably influence the number of potential  users.     An important aspect of this Internet development period is the increase in number of Internet  services, meaning that the Internet is not just an economical way to communicate. For example,  Internet technologies have now been used for the first time during parliamentary and presidential  elections in the Kyrgyz Republic. The State Computer-aided System “Shailoo”, based on Internet  technologies, enabled interactive counting of votes in every region of the Republic. For the first  time, Internet radio broadcasting also took place. Carried out in cooperation with national  television channels, the Interactive voting system can be added to the achievements of the last  years, permitting as it did live participation of viewers in social opinion polls. Another peculiarity  of this period of Internet market development is KyrgyzTelecom’s, preparation to enter the  Internet market, concerning which there is mixed opinion. However, the fact that the biggest  communication operator in Kyrgyzstan is entering the field, demonstrates the level of   competition which there will be in this market. Competition in the Internet services market is  becoming increasingly tough stimulating a growth in the number of special promotions designed  to attract clients.  While there are special state committees to protect and develop competition,  there is no guarantee that KyrgyzTelecom will not seek to pull in customers via special events  where inducements from one of the other sectors in which the company has a monopoly, will be  offered.    With a monopolist providing Internet services as one of its branches, these services could  now be provided at lower cost. Questions, however, remain - how will the cost of services will be  determined?, and will the new structure be biased, as other providers pay for services obtained  from other branches of the monopoly? Even if the Internet branch of KyrgyzTelecom pays  market prices, but without direct payments, then conditions of inequality appear due to  differences in the cost of finance. KyrgyzTelecom can develop without any additional finance,  because it monopolises communication facilities.    KyrgyzTelecom should enter the Internet services market on the basis of a warranty of                                                                                           Country Readiness Assessment Report –  Kyrgyzstan                                           29     equal conditions of competition. These conditions can be determined only after full economic  analysis of pricing, composition of service costs for the monopolist and determination of sharply  set rules of competition in this branch, as well as an obligation to maintain transparency.      3.3.5 The web services market and Internet resources of Kyrgyzstan    Considerable change has taken place recently in the structure, technology and content of the  Internet resources of Kyrgyzstan. Changes have taken place in site creation as a direct result of  client demand.  Competition for the attention of network users is rising, and projects initiated  without precise planning and research of target audiences are doomed to fail.    While straightforward information sites were previously in demand, active websites are now the  order of the day. Companies are beginning to understand the benefits of using the Internet in  business. Most of the websites of local companies can be described as web-based showcases that  contain general information about products or services of the company, and about the company  itself.  Companies are slowly moving from “Internet in Business” to “Business in Internet”, in  other words, business is coming to the Internet with commercial aims.    It is well known that the electronic commerce market is developing rapidly and is influencing the  general direction of web services development. The simplest example is the development of web  shops and electronic trading places instead of traditional web showcases. Whether a company  sees the need for a web site or not, is still a management decision.  However, company websites  are becoming an increasingly necessary condition of successful competition in the world  economy.    It is impossible to review completely and in detail the structure and content of the Internet  resources of Kyrgyzstan, which total approximately five hundred in number.     3.4 Sector online software applications    State Automatic Election System Shailoo    A significant contribution to network software applications was made when the state automatic  system Shailoo was created. Shailoo is a network-based software application that is designed to  collect and process information for the Election Committee. Client/server technology is used to  collect data from 54 rayons (counties) over the whole country into the Oracle database of the  Central Election Committee in Bishkek. A sophisticated management system protects the data  from being manipulated at the electronic stage of information processing. During the Election  campaigns, the results of the votes are shown in real time on the World Wide Web (WWW).     Computerized Taxation System     A computerised taxation system for State Tax Inspections was implemented by the Ministry of  Finance, with the participation of the Barents Group. This is a network-based software  application, using the communication channels of Shailoo and PMIS corporate networks. A  common information environment exists in the form of an Oracle database that is shared by the  Tax Inspection Committee and the Social Fund. Branches in rural areas are sending data to  Bishkek through Shailoo communication facilities.     Public Management Information System (PMIS)          Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan                                                                               .                                                                                        30    A WWW-based state corporate network connects, through dedicated lines, 49 major  ministries/agencies in Bishkek and six regional state bodies in Osh. Existing telephone lines are  used as communication channels and network operations are functioning up to transport layer.  This allows e-mail and Internet access to all users of PMIS.     Education Management System    The purpose of this project is to create a network-based information system for gathering data  (teachers, administrative and technical personnel) into a database at the Ministry of Education.                                                                                             Country Readiness Assessment Report –  Kyrgyzstan                                           31     4. Characteristics of the Country’s Human Resources    High schools    The majority of high schools are governmental, the largest sector in the country. Currently, there  are 1,680,000 children under the age of 14 years in Kyrgyzstan. In the school year 1999 to 2000,  1,100,000 pupils were studying in the country’s 1,980 schools.     The High School education system prescribes an “Informatics and Information Technologies”  programme for all state and private high schools. The programme is sub-divided into two stages:     • First stage (8 – 9 grades) – basic course on informatics. 102 hours in classes.   • Second stage (10 – 11 grades) –study of informatics in subjects that can be selected. In   accordance with the specialisation of the school, the course may take from 68 to 136  class hours.      It should be noted, however, that programmes in informatics do not satisfy modern requirements.  Most of them are oriented towards programming languages but not the use of general information  technologies. Due to lack of teaching time as well as of computers, students are neither obtaining  real programming skills, nor are they gaining sufficient understanding of information  technologies in general.     In 1995/96, two national educational programmes “Professionals of the 21st century” and “Bilim”  were adopted. The first programme stands for development of international cooperation in the  field of science and education, encouraging modern technologies. The second program is devoted  to the development of overall strategy in the educational sector with emphasis in the following  aspects:   • preservation of the availability of education;  • increase of quality and efficiency of education;  • improvement of financing of education; and  • development of legislature in the educational field.     Recently, the Asian Development Bank has begun financing of two projects, “Information  management system in education” and “Distant training system for high school teachers”.     Table 1.

Only a small number of schools have access to the Internet. Most of  these are located in Bishkek.     According to the Harvard classification, high schools in Kyrgyzstan can be divided into three  levels of readiness for the new information network world:     • more than a half of schools (56%) are at the first level of readiness (schools do not have  computers at all);   • about 35-40% of schools are at the second level (schools have old modification  computers (486 and less), but they are not integrated into the educational process, etc.);   • a small number of schools (mainly schools in Bishkek and private schools) are at the  third level of readiness (schools with local networks, access to the web, computers  widely used in the education process, etc.).     15 % of schools are equipped with computer classes and endowed with sufficient computers.  There is one computer per 330 students in average. 1 to1.5 % of the total number of schools have  access to the Internet.     Higher education    In accordance with data provided by the licensing department of the Ministry of Education and  Culture, there are 50 educational institutions and branches of institutions from CIS countries in  Kyrgyzstan. There are 188,820 students, and 101,446 are full-time students (1 October 2000).  This last figure relates to educational institutions with 168,008 students, i.e. 89% of the total  number of students in the country.       With respect to the number of students per computer, educational establishments can be sub- divided into four groups:      • higher educational institutions with less than 10 students per computer. There are 9,173  full-time students (10% of the total number). The number of computers is 1,545 (33.8%  of the total numbers of computers). On average there are six full-time students  per  computer;     • higher educational institutions with 10 – 20 students per computer. There are 20,623 full- time students (22.5% of the total number) in this group. The number of computers is  1,307 (28.6%), equivalent to 16 full-time students per computer;     • higher educational institutions with 21 – 50 students per computer. In this group, there are  52,421 full-time students (57.2% of all students), for 1802 (39.5%) computers. The  average is 29 full-time students per computer.      • higher educational institutions with more than 51 students per computer. In this group,  there are 10,324 full-time students (11.3% of all students). The number of computers is  171 (3.7%) giving an average of 60 full-time students per computer.         The first group covers institutions that are small in terms of full-time students, while being  sufficiently funded. All institutions are connected to the Internet through dedicated lines or  through dial-up connections. Students and staff members have practical experience in working  with Internet and e-mail, which is heavily used for administrative purposes. There are no old  “Soviet” era institutions in this group (ie. pre-1991).                                                                                            Country Readiness Assessment Report –  Kyrgyzstan                                           33       The second group consists of private institutions of three older institutions which were previously  well-equipped with computers. All of them have Internet access and e-mail services.       The third group, the biggest, consists of institutions that were established recently and that are  state-owned. They still have no sufficient technical infrastructure.     The fourth group includes state-owned institutions with little use of information communication  technologies, due to their specialisation.     Table 2.

Absence of a budget for purchase, support and  development of ICT at institutional departments;   • variance of state educational standards, educational plans and programmes for creating  modern conditions and perspectives in the development of ICT. This is related to ICT  educational plans and programmes for pupils at high schools and students at secondary  schools, as well as plans and programmes for IT specialist training;   • shortage and low salary of teachers of informatics and ICT specialists at educational  institutions;   • absence of educational centers for the training of teachers of informatics and ICT  specialists at educational institutions;   • absence of ISPs in the regions and at district levels;  • absence of educational literature and software in the Kyrgyz language;  • schools that are equipped with computers do not necessarily have the staff to serve them,   a budget for spare parts or equipment maintenance, or paid access to the Internet.                 Proposals for a national strategy for the educational sector      High school system                                                                                           Country Readiness Assessment Report –  Kyrgyzstan                                           35       • improve the quality of training (including upgrading of knowledge) of teachers of   informatics at high schools; foresee targeted financing from all sources (state and local  budgets, budgets of educational institutions, loans, grants, sponsorship, etc.) for  implementation and development of ICT in the educational sector;   • conclude establishment of distance training of high school teachers; create a national  educational network with ISP functions;   • develop new educational programmes, methods and technologies of teaching  «informatics» in high school, and related subjects in high and medium professional  institutions, including the most recent achievements in this sphere;   • 100% computerization of high schools in Kyrgyzstan, less than 50% of them with modern  computer classes; medium ratio of not more than 100 students per one computer in high  schools; access to Internet of not less than 10% of high schools of Kyrgyzstan.     Higher educational institutions     • improve quality and quantity of IT specialists’ training in design and development of  software for information systems;   • create new educational and methodological manuals in accordance with new educational  plans and programmes, including their e-versions;   • develop special councils for defending doctoral and PhD theses in ICT related fields;   • activate the creation of e-libraries with access to the Internet and world information   resources in educational and scientific institutions;  • expand the National Research and Educational Network (NREN) by connecting   universities in southern Bishkek and regional universities to Internet through dedicated  channels. Develop distance learning by using modern educational and telecommunication  technologies, providing high quality multimedia materials;   • establish a National Center of Information Technologies equipped with the most modern  technology to develop human resources and train high quality specialists in ICT. The  National IT Center would host different training courses, incubate IT investigation  projects, create a database and assist in the promotion of e-commerce and other  businesses with network use.   • equip all higher institutions with modern computer technologies and fully integrate ICT  into the educational process; achieve an average ratio in all higher institutions of not more  than 20 students per computer; wider usage of Internet by all higher institutions (mainly  through dedicated channels)          Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan                                                                               .                                                                                        36  5. National innovation capacities and capabilities and their effectiveness    In the modern world science is the driving force of public progress and it requires a well- educated population to track innovations and understand their impact.     In current times, progress depends not only on the level of scientific development in a country,  but also on how deeply it penetrates into society. These observations are important for  Kyrgyzstan where there have been rapid changes in the economy and society due to globalisation,  and where the prestige of science has fallen to a worrying degree both at state level and in society     According to the law “About Science and about Bases of State Scientific and Technical Policy”  the central body responsible for carrying out state scientific and technical policy is the  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. The State Agency on Science and Intellectual Property  under the Government of  the Kyrgyz Republic is responsible for the realisation of state scientific  and technical policy. All activities in the field of science and technology are regulated by the  following normative acts:      • Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “About Science and about Bases of State Scientific and  Technical Policy”    • Law of  the Kyrgyz Republic “About Innovative Activity”  • Regulations of the State Agency on Science and Intellectual Property under the   Government of  the Kyrgyz Republic  • Regulations of Formation and Realisation of the State Scientific and Technical Programs  • Regulations of Financing Scientific, Technical and Innovative Activity at the Expense of   the Republican Budget  • Regulations of Organisation and Realisation of State (Independent) Scientific and   Technical Examination of the Projects on Research and Design  • Concept on Reforming Science in the Kyrgyz Republic for the years1999 – 2005”  • Regulations of Elections of the Chiefs of the Research Institutions  • Regulations of Research Institutions     The role of the state in this field is the creation of  favourable conditions for the implementation  of scientific projects, development of research, and utilisation of state-of-the-art technologies. To  achieve these goals the following methods can be used:     • attraction of investments;  • favorable tax policy;  • legal support for innovative solutions;  • provision of state financial support; and  • development of the banking system and financial market for high-tech industry.     Priority directions for science and technology are determined by the economic situation in the  country; global tendencies in science and technology; availability of raw materials; and market  demand. Currently major priority directions are:     • health and environment;  • agriculture and consumer products;  • electric power production;  • development of mountainous regions;                                                                                            Country Readiness Assessment Report –  Kyrgyzstan                                           37     • mineral and water resources;  • information and telecommunication technologies;  • new materials, construction;  • development of tourism; and  • fundamental research.     Key directions in the field of Information and Telecommunication technologies are as follows:   • optical electronic components and their usage in communications and computers  • high density memory  • fiber optical networks  • information technologies and Internet in education      The Kyrgyz Republic’s economy is in transition stage and has very few opportunities to invest in  science and technology. As such, the country relies on international community grants and  programmes. Significant results have been achieved via research co-operation with foreign  countries, and an agreement has been signed between the Kyrgyz Republic and the International  Association on Co-operation with Newly Independent States (INTAS).     Kyrgyzstan is a landlocked state located on the crossroads between Asia and Europe and 90 % of  its territory is covered with mountains. There are many earth metal deposits in the country and  over the last two centuries a mining industry has developed.     The semiconductor production process requires heavy usage of electric power. The Kyrgyz  Republic has, in fact, excellent natural conditions for producing hydro electricity and, before the  break-up of the Soviet Union, a series of hydro electric plants were built in the country which  also exported hydro electricity to neighboring States.    At this time, the semiconductor production industry was successfully functioning and there were  several high- tech equipment manufacturing plants oriented towards the military sector. With the  collapse of  the Soviet Union, however, there is no demand for these products and the entire  sector has ceased to function.     The country, which has great potential for a semiconductor industry -  raw materials, inexpensive  hydro energy, and qualified personnel – needs investment opportunities. At the same time,  investors from South Korea are expressing interest in the semiconductor industry in the Kyrgyz  Republic.     Kyrgyzstan has the most liberal regime of the Central Asian States. The Internet with its highly  democratic principles are implemented into algorithms of the network operations and are  sensitive to any restrictions in network access and management. This country has the most  favorable conditions for development of network software applications and access to online  informational resources and it can serve as a hub for the entire Central Asian region for  information and telecommunication initiatives.      The development of international transport corridors such as Traceka and the Silk Road, which  pass through the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic, will stimulate a demand for all types of IT  services to facilitate day-to-day operations of transport routes.

Telemedicine, providing distant healthcare services:  • use of ICT for information exchange on diagnostics, treatment and   improvement of qualification of employees.   Telematics for research in healthcare:   • cooperation between specialists and centres for the exchange of ideas,  research results and access to sources of information and knowledge;   • development of telematics technologies and applications.  Telematics for management in healthcare:   • use of ICTs for the control of diseases;          Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan                                                                               .                                                                                        40  • evaluation of the quality, amount and efficiency of healthcare services     Funding    A significant part of the programme should be implemented through attracted investments. For  the projects on improvement and development of the state policy and its legal and normative  bases, funding will be allocated from state and local budgets as well as from budgets of state  agencies. It may also attract foreign investments and grants of international organizations.     The programme’s financial scheme plans to attract domestic commercial structures to the funding  of profitable projects. Projects proposed and financed by commercial structures can be included  into the Program.     The amount of funding required for the first stage of the programme will be determined after  projects are chosen for implementation.     Projects of the program will be implemented based on tender and selection of the projects will be  based on independent expertise. Expert groups will be composed of outstanding scientists and IT  specialists.                                                                                           Country Readiness Assessment Report –  Kyrgyzstan                                           41     6. National major initiatives    There are several major directions in which state institutions are actively involved:     • development of the legal basis for the information society;  • liberalisation of the information and telecommunications market;  • encouragement of competition: de-monopolisation and privatisation;   • provision of technical support for human rights via access to informational resources;   • state guarantee to citizens on information and telecommunication services (mobile   telephones, satellite communications, Internet, e-mail, multi-media, distance learning,  telemedicine);   • improvement of state management in the ICT field.     The Ministry of Transport and Communications, the State Communications Agency and  communication operators are jointly developing three programmes:     • State programme on the development of communications in rural areas;  • regional informatisation programme “Internet for villages”;  • development of regional TV and radio broadcasting.     Technological modernisation of telecommunications is proceeding as follows:      • Digital automatic exchange stations  • Digital data transfer technologies  • Fiber optical lines  • Satellite communications.      The international SilkSat project is based on the use of satellite communications along the ancient  Silk Road and is important for regional cooperation. In terms of this project, a Commission under  the President and Satellite Technologies Center has been created.       70 % of the Kyrgyz territory  consists of mountainous regions. In such conditions, instead of  laying cables, it is more efficient to use terrestrial satellite technologies VSAT. A cost-efficient  approach to the placing of a small satellite in orbit is available through Russian rocket launches.      Kyrgyzstan is actively involved in numerous international agreements on the development of  information exchange within CIS and regional cooperation in communications.      Some of the major state initiatives include:       • President’s Decree “About legal concept for informatization in the Kyrgyz Republic”, 17  October 1997;   • Concept on informatization development in the Kyrgyz Republic, signed by President of  the Kyrgyz Republic, 14 February 1998;   • Decree of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic “About creation and use of tax and  insurance payers common database”, 25 February1999;   • President’s Decree “About creation and development of the State Computer Network and  State Automatic System “Shailoo”, 26 March 1999;    • President's Decree «About creation of the State Computer Network based on Information          Country Readiness Assessment Report – Kyrgyzstan                                                                               .                                                                                        42  Management System and State Automatic System “Shailoo”, 3 May 2001;    • Kyrgyz Government Decree “About regulation of mutual use by state institutions of the   State Computer Network”, 23 July 2001   • Decree of the President of the Kyrgyz Republic on the National Strategy ‘Information    and Communication Technologies for Development in the Kyrgyz Republic’, 10 March  2002                                                                                               Country Readiness Assessment Report –  Kyrgyzstan                                           43     Conclusion    Strategically, Kyrgyzstan has few natural resources that can be used to spur overall economic  development. However, it has an educated work force (literacy rate of 97 %), including a sizeable  number of qualified computer specialists and programmers. The country has potential in some  industries, such as hydro-electricity, tourism and water management. These industries require  sophisticated information processing (management of electricity and water supply, promotion of  tourism services over Internet, i.e., B2C systems).      Kyrgyzstan is located on prospective intercontinental crossroads. The development of   TRACEKA and the SilkRoad transport projects will require all types of telecommunication  services to serve the day-to-day operations of transport corridors.        While most traditional industries require a high level of investment, currently difficult or  impossible for Kyrgyzstan, information technologies require relatively low initial investment.     For a developing country, the most effective way to develop national ICT capabilities is to  concentrate on initiatives that leverage the state’s limited resources to create the preconditions  and favorable environment for private business development in ICT. The goal of the National   ICT Strategy is to create appropriate conditions for the development of the IT sector of the  economy, and to provide a basis for fast growth of private services in IT.

(Roughly: Teledensity is  between two and eight  mainlines per 100 people.   Mobile wireless  penetration is between 0.5  % and 3 %. Cable  penetration is below 5 % of  all household in the  community)   . Rates for local telephone  calls are high enough to  discourage extensive  Internet use via local ISPs,  even among those, who  could afford Internet access.  Local access solutions exist,  but rates for ISP services are  high enough to discourage  extensive use. The lack of  competition in the provision  of commercial leased lines  is reflected in prohibitively  or very high leasing fees.   Stage 3  There are between 0.5 and  one million inhabitants per  local ISP. ISPs provide full  Internet access. Subscribers  may have some options  between various Internet  service packages. There are  some opportunities for public  Internet access. It is normally  possible for users to establish  a dial-up connection to a  local ISP, except during peak  hours. One or two private  providers lease lines to  businesses.

Basic hardware and  software is affordable for  some citizens and small and  medium-sized businesses.      Stage 3 70-90 % of domestic  telephone calls are  successful.  Connections are dropped  with noticeable frequency  and are somewhat disruptive.  Fewer than 50 faults are  reported per year for 100  mainlines. Users have access  to dial-up modem transfer  speeds of up to 28.8 Kbps.  Leased lines with transfer  speeds of up to 64 Kbps are  widely available for  businesses and ISPs.  Limited  higher-speed lines are  available in some areas.  Backbone facilities servicing  the community are usually  sufficient, although regular  peak demand periods result  in slower network response  times. Packets loss by the  network may occur but it is  not generally disruptive.    Mainlines take at least one  month to be installed.  It takes over a week for  reported mainline problem  to be resolved.  There is a  growing customer service  ethic among service and  support providers, although  it is not a priority for most.   Some ICT maintenance and  technical support services  are available. A nascent  software industry is present  in the community, and there  are a growing number of  hardware technicians, web  designers and network  administrators.

Access to the  computer(s) is limited to  computer teachers and/or  administrators. Computers  tend to be older generation  models, such as stand-alone  486 PCs or the equivalent.  Where there are multiple  computers installed, they are  not networked. Use of the  computer(s) is limited to  electronic documents that are  available on the hard drive or  diskettes. There may be  connectivity for store-and- forward e-mail.   Only a few teachers use  computers in a very limited  fashion. Teachers’ basic  computer literacy involves  skills such as use of the  keyboard and mouse, a  basic understanding of the  computer operating system,  manipulation of files, and  cutting and pasting.  Computers are mainly used  at the university level.      Stage 3   Technical classes and  programs on ICT-related  subjects are available from  a variety of public and  private centres. Some  limited online access to  training is available.  Some employers offer  training in the use of  information and  communication  technologies to their  employees.

Less than  0.5% of the  population has used  the Internet recently,  and few are regular  users. Some local  businesses and  institutions have  registered domain  names - fewer than  two per 1000  inhabitants. No  advertising in  traditional media for  online companies or  resources exists.

Websites carry  diverse types of  information for  different community  groups. Many  websites are  available in local  languages or a  dominant Web  language spoken  locally. There is  some use of online  bulletin-board  systems, Usenet  groups, newsletters,  and/or listservs.  Web-related training  opportunities exist  although can be  expensive and  accessible only in  certain areas.   Public telephones  may be found in  most parts of the  community and are  heavily used.  Some members of  the community have  Internet access at  home. Growing  numbers of  community members  use telecenters,  cyber-cafes and  other businesses that  offer computer use  and online services  to the public for a  fee.   Organisations  achieve efficiency  gains through some  degree of  deployment of ICT  systems in their  internal workings.  Many computers in  business offices are  internally networked  for data processing,  management  reporting, and other  enterprise  applications. Some  employees conduct  research and  business  transactions over the  Web, though most  often they use a  shared workstation  to do so.  Some employees  use e-mail for  internal  communications.

This  information is static  and infrequently  updated. Some  limited interaction  with the government  is possible by phone  or fax. The  government  distributes some  information about  services, procedures,  rights and  responsibilities in  hard copy.   Stage 3 Technical skills in  the community are  becoming a source  of competitive  advantage and are  beginning to attract  investment and  employment  opportunities by  companies from  outside the  community.   Many businesses  post key information  on websites.   Information is often  nor kept current and  relevant.  Websites provide  information on  goods and services  for sale.  Purchases  take place primarily  in person, or by fax  or phone, though  electronic mail may  expedite the  process. Some  businesses may have  introduced online  ordering.   The deployment of  electronic systems  has increased  efficiency and  transparency and  lowered transaction  costs in B2B  interactions. Some  B2B transactions are  supported by  electronic systems  (e.g. proprietary  systems and  databases), but some  paper-based  transactions (e.g. a  signature) is usually  required at some  point. Electronic  B2B transactions are  a small percentage  of overall B2B  commerce.

Stage 3 Plans for the liberalisation of the  telecommunications sector are in place  and are being implemented. Progress is  being made in achieving universal access,  but there are many hurdles in  implementation. Services such as data,  paging and mobile telephony are available  from competing private providers.  Alternative carriers compete for private  network services, leased lines and other  telecommunications services for  businesses. Incumbent provider networks  are being opened to competition through  interconnection and/or unbundling  obligations.

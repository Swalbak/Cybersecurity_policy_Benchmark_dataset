Through the implementation of this National Information and Communications Technology Strategy’s (National ICT Strategy) programs we will accelerate the creation of a more prosperous future for all Belizeans. ICTs have transformed the world, and the lives of millions in every faucet of life all around the world. The way we communicate, interact, learn, do business, take care of our health, socialize and care for each other are all influenced by ICT. In so many dimensions the transformation enabled by ICTs have been breathtaking. Belize deserves and demands nothing less. This National ICT Strategy outlines the path to accelerated development for all Belizeans though leveraging the power of ICTs. It places Information and Communication Technologies at the center of Belize’s social and economic development as a dynamic industry sector in itself, and in support of the development of other sectors of Belize. ICT can be of enormous benefit to the socio-economic development of a country in two ways. Firstly, it can be used as a productive sector in and of itself, mainly for the creation of jobs and the addition of knowledge-based exports. The sectoral approach focuses on developing a country’s economy by using ICT as a production sector; hence, in short term the human resources as inputs and markets to absorb the outputs are required for success. Both of these are addressed through numerous strategies for industry promotion, incentives for investors, training and development of human resources etc. The output of such efforts would be the creation of at least 5,000 new jobs via the development of cyberparks and research and technology centers that will also harness new technologies that could spin off into other productive sectors as well. Belize has already attracted more than 1,000 new jobs in this sector with very little proactive assistance and incentives to this industry. Secondly, ICT can also be of enormous benefit to the socio-economic development of a country as an enabler of such development. This approach focuses on the long term goals and objectives of the country which obviously should lead to an more economically prosperous Belize. Here the country needs to take up the challenge of raising, feeding, educating and providing economic opportunity for all of its population; thereby Belize ICT National Strategy 5 satisfying the 18 targets set out under the eight Millennium Development Goals. The targets set out by Horizon 2030 are also clearly in line with this Strategy. In order for this to be realized, many cross-cutting strategies across various sectors are devised keeping in view ICT as a means for improving the efficiency of planning, executing and monitoring of the projects for that sector. This enabling approach occurs when ICT is diffused into masses at all levels enabling maximization of benefits and welfare. In Belize’s case the sectoral approach should be combined with the diffusion or enabler approach to maximize benefits of economic growth in the short term without trading-off the sustainability of the same in longer run. The ICT vision and strategy should focus on people and not just on technology. For this to happen, it is important to develop both the ICT vision and strategy with people in mind and with the involvement of these very same people. Major outputs from utilizing both of the above approaches include the following: • Increasing access – particularly to rural areas though, for example, the use of stationary and mobile telecenters so that teachers in each village can enhance their educational qualifications on-line, rural women can have ready access to health and nutritional information and rural young people can access a high school education online; • Enhancing Education – by creating attractive multimedia based curricula and pedagogy and developing distance education modalities; • Enhancing efficient production and business processes – by developing e- commerce activities, particularly for Small and Medium Enterprises and for Micro- enterprises; • Modernizing the delivery of public services – by putting more public services online, increasing revenue collection, and increasing efficiency though the shared delivery of public services; • Reliability of data collected and disseminated in all sectors for better planning – by promoting the creation of a national statistical information management system promoting better sharing and validation of data being produced by governmental and civil society agencies according to internationally acceptable standards; • Job creation in the ICT sector – by the creating at least 5,000 new jobs in the ICT industry through the creation of cyberparks and technology centers. This strategy has been developed through wide consultation with and participation of the public and private sector, academia, civil Belize ICT National Strategy 6 society representatives, and NGO’s in Belize (see Appendix A for the list of participants). It builds on the successes from across Belize and other countries in leveraging ICTs for national development. Significant gains are currently being made by public and private sector organizations, academia and civil society in utilizing ICT for improved effectiveness and efficiencies. However the need to accelerate development in all areas has never been more urgent than now as Belize faces challenges and opportunities of increased global competition, the need for economic diversification, rapidly evolving citizens’ needs, ever increasing demands on health, education and security services and the threat of increasing competition at a blinding rate to our businesses. Driven by the overall national development outcomes identified in Horizon 2030, the National ICT Strategy identifies the National ICT Outcomes needed for accelerated development, the two major Goals that will be focused on, the six strategic Imperatives that must be addressed and the six major Programs and twenty eight Initiatives/Projects recommended for implementation that will be executed over the five year period of the Strategy. A snapshot of the interconnected components of the strategy is presented in Figure 1: Figure 1 – Interconnected Components of the Strategy Belize ICT National Strategy 7 The National ICT Strategy presents a Vision that focuses on Accelerated development and improved quality of life for all Belizeans through universal access and widespread usage of Information and Communication Technology. Accelerated development that is empowered by ICTs will become a reality by putting Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) at the center of Belize’s social and economic development as a dynamic industry sector in itself (as a sector), and in support of the development of other sectors of the economy (as an enabler) in order to foster, accelerate and sustain long-term social, cultural and economic development of the country. This is the Mission of the National ICT strategy. It will be executed through a collaborative and participative approach that involves the Government of Belize (GOB), along with the private sector, civil society and international development partners. Together, though a leadership driven governance approach, the national ICT strategy will be aggressively implemented. The National ICT Strategy envisions that accelerating national development will be empowered by pursuing two major goals. Firstly Universal Access to ICTs, ensuring ICT accessibility, acceptance and usability by anyone, anywhere, at anytime, and through any media and device, and secondly Widespread ICT usage in every aspect of national development including security & crime reduction, improving health care, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of Government, developing competitive businesses and building new industries. The achievement of these goals will come about by addressing six major Objectives over the next five years. These objectives are the heart of the strategy: • Open ICT – Creating a vibrant, competitive and open telecommunication industry that enables the availability and accessibility of quality and affordable telecommunication services to consumers and fostering social and economic benefits to the country; • ICT In Education - Infusing all aspects of the education systems with ICTs for improved delivery and learning, and improved access to education by all; • ICT in E-Commerce – Creating a well developed ICT services sector and driving the adoption and usage of ICT in all dimensions of business operations to create competitive advantage at the business and country levels; • eInclusion – Bringing the benefit of ICTs into all segments of the population, including people who are disadvantaged due to education, age, gender, income, Belize ICT National Strategy 8 disabilities,ethnicity, and/or those living in remote regions; • Job Creation through local ICT Industry Development – Creating at least 5,000 new jobs through the development of the local ICT Industry; • Acclerating eGovernment - Significantly improve the performance of government through the usage of ICTs, to meet the evolving needs of the people of Belize and create a safe society. Each major objective consists of key Programs and Projects (Initiatives) that will be implemented with relentless passion. The six key Programs are identified below with details of the Projects/Initiatives in the body of the strategy. OBJECTIVE PROGRAMS Open ICT Enhancing and Harmonizing the National Telecommunication Infrastructure ICT in Education Developing ICT in Education ICT for e-Commerce Developing ICT for e-Commerce e-Inclusion Connect Belize: Bridging the Digital Divide Job Creation Through Local ICT Industry Creating Jobs Through the Development of the Local ICT Industry Acclerating eGovernment Modernizing the Public Sector Using ICT Implementation of the National ICT Strategy is outlined as a planned and collaborative approach. Public/Private partnerships will be pursued as the modus operandi of strategy implementation. The role of the international development and funding communities will also be actively promoted, particularly in terms of the transfer of information, benchmarking and keeping abreast of developments in the sector. GOB will encourage the private sector, civil society and international development agencies working in Belize to partner with government in building out infrastructure, in developing Belize’s human resources, in providing jobs and in taking on development activities. Integral to the implementation process will be: • GOB’s leadership and (along with the private sector, foreign investors and its international partners) the commitment of resources; • Smart partnerships with key sectors from private sector, civil society, foreign investors and the international development agencies; Belize ICT National Strategy 9 • The involvement of all stakeholders in the execution and the continuing development of the action plan to accompany this National ICT Strategy; • Rigorous pursuit of outcomes outlined within the Strategy. The National ICT Strategy will also seek to attract local and foreign investors and development grants through various investment packages and incentives, sufficient workspace with supporting technology infrastructure, as well as a pool of trained workers and professional staff. Potential investors and development agencies will be aggressively targeted through a focused promotional strategy. A centralized GOB ICT Department will be created under the direction of a Chief Technology Officer. It will be charged with implementing the ICT Strategy under the direction of an ICT Cabinet Committee chaired by the Minister of the Public Service or his designee and comprised of GOB, private sector, civil society and international partners. The Department also expects to be able to finance the ICT Strategy through the creation of a Universal Access Fund financed through a levy on the telecommunications and cable company sectors to meet the goals of increased ICT access and usage, which in turn will increase revenues to these sectors. Today Belize makes a quantum leap. The future is within reach, and through strong leadership and the pursuit of the goals and objectives identified, the vision of accelerated development and the improved quality of life for all can become reality. Belize ICT National Strategy 10 AN INTRODUCTION TO BELIZE GEOGRAPHICAL AND POPULATION DISTRIBUTION Located on the Caribbean coast of Central America, Belize combines both Caribbean and Latin characteristics. The country is located at 17°15' north of the equator and 88°45' west of the Prime Meridian on the Yucatán Peninsula. It borders the Caribbean Sea to the east, with 386 km of coastline. It has a total of 516 km of land borders— Mexico to the north-northwest (250 km) and Guatemala to the south-southwest (266 km). Belize's total size is 22,960 km², of which 22,800 km² is land and 160 km² is water. This makes the country about twice the size of Jamaica, about half the size of Nova Scotia, slightly larger than Wales, and slightly smaller than the U.S. state of Massachusetts. The western border consists of lowland forest, highland plateau and the Maya mountains in the south. Most rivers rise in the west of the country and flow eastwards to the sea through low-lying, often swampy, coastal plains. About 60% of the country is covered by forest containing an abundance of fauna and flora. Larger scale agriculture, involving bananas, citrus and sugar cane, is concentrated in the low-lying areas. Elsewhere, most cultivation is small-scale and largely for subsistence. The Mayan population and rural Guatemalan migrants employ variations of slash-and-burn shifting forms of cultivation. Belize ICT National Strategy 11 Figure 2 – Political/Administrative Map of Belize Source: maps.html Administratively, Belize is split into six districts (see Figure 2), which, from north to south, are Corozal, Orange Walk, Belize, Cayo, Stann Creek and Toledo . The northernmost district, Corozal (with a population of 40,354 according to the 2010 census), has a common border with Mexico and is predominantly Mestizo and Spanish-speaking. The main economic activities are the cultivation of sugar cane and the Corozal Free Zone (CFZ) on the border with Mexico. Orange Walk (with a population of 45,419), immediately to the south is based around the town of the same name. Its economy is also dominated by sugar cane, although small scale agriculture prevails in the western areas and potatoes, onions and soy beans are grown for sale. Orange Walk contains several Mayan cultural sites, and like Corozal, it is predominantly Mestizo and Spanish- speaking. Belize district (with a total population of 89,247 according to the 2010 Census) is dominated by the city of Belize which contains around 17.1% (or about 53,352 inhabitants according to the 2010 Census) of the country’s population. Satellite settlements extend outward along the main roads but the district also contains several rural villages along the Belize River. The topography is almost entirely low-lying and often swampy. It has a major Mayan site at Altun Ha but the main tourist attractions are the Cayes. Ambergris Caye, the largest of the Cayes, has as its capital the town of San Pedro, which is developing rapidly as one of Belize’s largest urban centers (with a population of 11,510 according to the 2010 Census). Two thirds of the country’s Creole (Belizeans who are predominantly of African descent) population lives in this district. Belize ICT National Strategy 12 People of Belize Source: \"The Garífuna: Weaving a Future From a Tangled Past,\" September 2001, National Geographic magazine Photograph by Susie Post Rust Source: Cayo is the largest district in terms of land area and second largest in terms of population (72,899 according to the 2010 Census). It contains Belmopan, the administrative capital of the country, as well as the twin towns of San Ignacio/ Santa Elena, and the large Mennonite enclave at Spanish Lookout. It also hosts several eco-tourism establishments aimed at capitalizing on the largely unspoilt forest area populated by a wide range of plant, animal and bird species, and proximity to several important old Mayan sites, including Tikal across the border in Guatemala. The main road to Guatemala crosses this district at Benque Viejo del Carmen. Stann Creek District (with a population of 31,166 according to the 2010 Census), located further south along the coastline, includes the developing tourist settlement of Placencia, several Garifuna villages, notably Hopkins, as well as the larger town of Dangriga. The population is split approximately equally between the Creoles, Garifuna and Mestizo. It is the country’s major producer of bananas and citrus fruits, mostly cultivated in large plantations. Several shrimp processing enterprises have been established in the coastal parts of the district. Finally, Toledo, the southernmost district (with a population of 30,538 according to the 2010 Census), is the centre of Belize’s Mayan population as well as the most rural of the districts. Villages here tend to be smaller and more dispersed than in the rest of the country, where many are located along the major roads. There are small concentrations of Garifuna and East Indians with the former mostly found in coastal villages. It produces significant proportions of the country’s rice, corn and peas, almost entirely from small holdings. In the last few years, cacao production has increased substantially. Traditionally, Toledo has been the poorest and most rural district in the country, partly due to its peripheral location relative to the rest of the country’s administrative, commercial and tourist centers.

The general structure of the economy is illustrated in Figures 4 and 5.

The Net revolution has ushered in enormous possibilities for leveraging technology not only to enhance productivity and efficiency but also to develop innovative business models and strategies in every sector and to develop community participation and empowerment thereby increasing democratic governance. Countries all over the world are using ICT applications to increase efficiency, accountability, enhance transparency and increase revenue collection as well as to reduce poverty by enhancing their productive and e-commerce centers. A National ICT Strategy is a vision for a country where information and communication technology is not a mere information and communication tool but a primary vehicle for enhancing education and health care, improve service delivery, refine policy formulation and implementation, empower citizens, and increase business opportunities for the private sector. The catalyst for many countries that have been very successful at doing this, such as Singapore and South Korea, is the development of a national ICT strategy with this vision at its core. In South Korea, for example, a comprehensive ICT strategy has been a key driver in the miracle rebound of its economy from the financial crisis of the late 80s; the ICT industry’s contribution to GDP growth rose from a mere 4.5% in 1990 to an astounding 50.5% in 2000. Countries such as Singapore and South Korea, as well as Barbados and Costa Rica to a large extent in our region, have also realized Belize ICT National Strategy 17 that for the National ICT Strategy to be successful, it must be incorporated into the overall development strategy of the country. It should assess the prospects and options for promoting the ICT industry, for using ICT in key sectors of the economy, and for empowering and networking all stakeholders involved in national development and democratic governance initiatives. It should also systematically address how to use ICT as an enabling tool, in combination with other instruments, to address the two overarching goals of national development in developing countries such as Belize: (1) sustainable economic growth - driven by participating in a highly dynamic global industry and by diffusing ICT to enhance broad based, economy wide competitiveness; (2) poverty reduction - facilitated by broad-based economic and social growth, accelerated human development and nationwide empowerment. Sustainable Economic growth is achieved though enhancing competitiveness and growth across broad sectors of the economy. ICT can be used to achieve this in two ways: 1. Developing the local ICT industry - the local ICT industry, and particularly, the newly enabled services such as Business Processing Outsourcing (BPOs), presents major opportunities for job creation and participation in e-commerce by many developing countries. The decline in the cost of telecommunications and access to the Internet worldwide have given rise to the globalization of business- support services and the outsourcing of back- office work to developing countries like India and the Philippines. Over 50 nations currently export software and ICT-enabled services. In Kenya, for example, Naushad Trading Company which sells local wood carvings, baskets and pottery, grew from US$ 10, 000 to over US$ 2 million in the two years since it went online. 2. Using ICT across the board - A second major thrust for competitiveness and broad economic growth is to use ICT in the most critical industries and services of the country, promote ICT diffusion among micro, small and medium enterprises (typical of most industries in developing countries such as Belize) to make them more efficient and effective, and deploy ICT for modernizing government-to-business transactions. Although it is up to the private sector to take the lead in such use, governments can influence and accelerate this process through various means, including establishing the necessary laws and regulations for e-commerce, and providing incentives for investments that would alter managerial practices and strengthen supply chains. Perhaps most promising for Belize ICT National Strategy 18 competitiveness is the use of ICT in government in support of business-to- government transactions. By one estimate, business in developing countries spend about 20% of their revenues on transactions with governments, including accessing information and forms, applying for permits, and submitting taxes. An effective and transparent government is a critical ingredient in a competitive business climate and an attractive investment environment. A recent pilot to modernize tax administration in Russia (assisted with World Bank financing) has introduced ICT-enabled transformation in the administration’s interactions with businesses and citizens, eliminated the long lines for tax submissions, drastically cut all kinds of transaction costs, closed opportunities for corruption, and at the same time, raised the badly needed tax revenues. The second overarching national goal in many developing countries such as Belize is reducing poverty and accelerating human development. ICT could support poverty reduction strategies by informing policy making, delivering effective health and education services, facilitating citizen to government transactions and public sector reforms, and promoting participation and accountability. Recent emphases on poverty analysis and on mainstreaming results- oriented development programs have reinforced the need for relevant, reliable and timely information for policy formulation and program implementation and adaptation. As suggested earlier, ICT can also be deployed to extend access and improve quality of education, health and other social services. The promise of improving citizen to government transactions (C2G) has inspired many governments to innovate one-stop, single window services, such as Singapore’s eCitizen, and to integrate electronic government into their broader public sector reforms. Even less integrated and more modest bottom up initiatives such as land record computerization in Karnataka, India, have delivered land certificates in 15 minutes, instead of 20-30 days, and in the process, reduced transaction costs and corruption, created a viable land market, enhanced the creditworthiness of farmers, and improved the life of the common man. A major opportunity for using ICT in poverty reduction is to provide information and knowledge to rural populations and to empower local development agents to serve the poor. A variety of informational and connectivity advantages Belize ICT National Strategy 19 can accrue to the poor through improved operational capacities of the specialized local agencies. One example is Chile’s electronic rural information system which connected farmers’ organizations, rural municipalities, NGOs, and local government extension agencies to the Internet. It was estimated that transmitting information on prices, markets, inputs, weather, social services, and credit facilities cost 40% less than using traditional methods. Similar pilots and programs have been applied in Mexico. In Maharashtra, India, a cluster of 70 villages is covered by the “wired village” project, which is modernizing the local cooperatives, and aiming to provide agricultural, medical, and educational information to the facilitation telecenter booths in the villages. Perhaps the area of most promise is in the use of ICT to promote broad participation, grassroots innovation, and social learning, thereby increasing democratic governance. Telecenters or community information and communication centers can play several roles: provide affordable public access to ICT tools including the Internet; extend and customize public services, including those offered through e-government; provide access to information in support of local economic activities and learning opportunities; and connect and network people. The last function proved to be the highest priority for many communities who would otherwise have remained isolated. These centers have enabled them to carry out local dialogue, share practical and locally-relevant information, and support community problem solving. Given the limited relevance of the vast amount of global Internet content to these communities, the role of these centers in networking and creating local content becomes all the more important. Community centers could also provide women with a medium to participate as producers, consumers-providers-users, counselors- clients. In South Africa, women’s organizations are linked to various resource web sites which aim to mobilize women around common concerns. Digital literacy provide affordable public access to ICT tools including the Internet extend and customize public services including those offered through e- government provide access to information in support of local economic activities and learning opportunities connect and network people Belize ICT National Strategy 20 centers in Benin and Ghana have become an important instrument of empowerment of low- income communities, enhancing employability, increasing capabilities, and extending learning opportunities beyond those available in educational institutions. The world is in the midst of a revolution in which new and evolving digital ICTs are extending the horizon of what countries, companies, institutions and individuals might achieve if they work together to create rich collaborative networks from which new knowledge, ideas and innovations spring. By ensuring the development of a solid national ICT strategy, many countries can position their economies for competitive advantage in a global knowledge-driven technology. Those who understand the process can direct their efforts towards learning the new practices and may find a route to leaping forward and catching up. This will involve a great degree of learning and understanding the impacts of ICT on markets, organizations, competitive strategies, innovation as well as the implications for services, employment, education, regional and spatial development and poverty reduction. Furthermore, a successful ICT strategy requires a country’s substantial investment in human capital, active absorption of technology, ability to raise awareness, build coalitions, clarify roles and responsibilities, mobilize and complement market forces, as well as scale up and leverage ICT. The ultimate focus of a national ICT strategy should be to promote the diffusion of ICT across the board as a General Purpose Technology. Belize ICT National Strategy 21 ICT STRATEGY METHODOLOGY BELIZE’S APPROACH TO ICT STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT The goal of the e- Belize: Accelerating Development National ICT Strategy is to identify how ICT and participation in the digital economy can help the Government of Belize reach more expeditiously its objectives in terms of economic and social progress and growth. It was an initiative of the Ministry of the Public Service, Governance Improvement, Elections and Boundaries, and Sports (MPS) of Belize and was spearhead by its Minister John Salvidar and the Ministry’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Charles Gibson. The Ministry’s Governance Improvement Unit (GIU) headed by Mrs. Freya Parham August (with Mr. Dwight Gillette and Mr. Antonio Madrid) was assigned the task of identifying and working with a consulting team to develop Belize’s National ICT Strategy. The consulting team of Juan Carlos Namis and Dr. Geraldo Flowers of e-Data Ltd. of Belize and Mr. Adam Montserin of Odyssey Consulting of Trinidad was identified and contracted in early March 2011 to work with the GIU in developing the National Strategy. The consulting team: 1. Developed a planning process and initiated consultations with the MPS Steering Committee, the Government of Belize’s (GOB) Information and Communication (ICT) Task Force and the GOB’s CEO Caucus as part of the development of the National ICT Strategy; 2. Surveyed each GOB Ministry and relevant department via an e-Government questionnaire in order to assess the current state (Strengths and Weaknesses) of GOB’s ICT development and conducted phone interviews of all of the secondary schools and the University of Belize in order to assess the current state of ICT development in Belize’s education system. 3. Conducted 30 individual countrywide interviews with relevant GOB Ministries, Departments and Statutory Boards, private sector ICT companies, international funding agencies, and civil society executives in order to identify ICT related problems and opportunities (Opportunities and Threats) related to ICT development in Belize. Belize ICT National Strategy 22 A Visioning workshop was conducted by the Consulting Team in early April 2011 with key stakeholders from GOB, the private sector and civil society to develop the Vision, Mission and Strategic Outcomes for the Belize National ICT Strategy. The team also conducted a two day Strategy Development workshop in late April 2011 with the same key stakeholders to develop National Strategies designed to accomplish the Strategic Outcomes identified in the Visioning workshop held earlier. As well, the team shared a draft of the Belize e- Readiness Assessment and Benchmarking reports produced by the team for input and feedback from the key stakeholders and to enlighten the Strategy Development process. The first draft of the National ICT Strategy was presented to the MPS and GOB’s ICT Task Force in the middle of May 2011. A presentation of the findings and recommendations from the National ICT Strategy was also presented to GOB’s CEO Caucus in the third week of May 2011 for input and feedback. As well, a Cabinet Paper based on the findings and recommendations from the National ICT Strategy was prepared and presented by Minister John Saldivar to GOB’s Executive Cabinet and to the Prime Minister for endorsement and approval. An official Launch of the National Strategy was then conducted to kick off the implementation of the Strategy. Belize ICT National Strategy 23 THE CURRENT STATE – ICT IN BELIZE 2011 E-READINESS DEFINED e-Readiness is the degree to which a country is prepared to participate in the networked world. According to the “e- Readiness Guide: How to Develop and Implement a National e- readiness Action Plan” e-Readiness is generally defined as the degree to which a country is prepared to participate in the digital economy with the underlying concept that the digital economy can help to build a better society. Regardless of a country’s level of development, e-Readiness is assessed by determining the relative standing of its society and its economy in the areas that are most critical for its participation to the networked world.1 According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, e-Readiness is not simply a matter of the number of computer servers, websites and mobile phones in the country, but also things such as its citizen’s ability to utilize technology skillfully, the transparency of its business and legal systems, and the extent to which governments encourage the use of digital technologies. 2 When a country does more online—or, as is increasingly the case, wirelessly—the premise is that its economy can become a more transparent and efficient one. 1 GeoSINC International (April 2002). e-Readiness Guide: How to Develop and Implement a National e- readiness Action Plan. 2 Economist Intelligence Unit (2005). The 2005 e- readiness rankings: a white paper from the Economist Intelligence Unit. ( Belize ICT National Strategy 24 Before any country commences on a comprehensive connectivity program, it is important to understand its current level of e-Readiness. As stated above, e- Readiness is the degree to which a community is prepared to participate in the global information society, and is gauged by assessing areas that are most critical to the adoption of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Belize’s e-Readiness assessment provided a current snapshot of the country’s ICT capacity in several different areas including: • Industry and Finance • Government • Human Resources • Infrastructure • Legal and Regulatory The framework for this analysis was adapted from the “Readiness for the Networked World: A Guide for Developing Countries”, an internationally recognized methodology published by the Center for International Development at Harvard University. Additional data to support the findings and conclusions came from a variety of sources including: • The 2010 National Census of Belize; • An e-government survey of all of the Government of Belize’s (GOB) Ministries conducted by the consultants as part of the development of the strategy; • A survey of secondary schools also conducted by the consultants as part of the development of the strategy; • 30 interviews with key stakeholders conducted by the consultants as part of the development of the strategy; • Content analysis of all of GOB’s current websites; • Secondary data analysis of data provided by the Belize 2009 Scoping Exercise Report conducted under the auspices of the Ministry of the Public Service by David Gingell, a consultant from Malta. Belize ICT National Strategy 25 BELIZE’S TECHNOLOGY PENETRATION Figure 7 below presents the current state of technology penetration in Belize as provided by the 2010 National Household and Population Census of Belize. Figure 7- District Technology Penetration by Household Source: Belize 2010 Housing and Population Census The above data reveals that although Belize ranked 128 out of 184 countries according to the United Nations e-Government survey of 2010, the country is already an active member of the global information society. It has embraced cell phone and cable TV services to the extent that more than three fourths of households in Belize possess a cell phone and more half of the households in Belize have cable TV services. The reasons for this are two-fold: 1. Belize does possess the infrastructure for this to be possible; 2. These services are currently being provided competitively and at a cost that the majority of Belizeans can afford. 76.50% 26.40% 53% 21.60% 13.10% 0.00% 10.00% 20.00% 30.00% 40.00% 50.00% 60.00% 70.00% 80.00% 90.00% 100.00% Mobile Phone Computer Ownership Cable TV Fixed Lines Internet Access Corozal Orange Walk Belize Cayo Stann Creek Toledo Overall Penetration Belize ICT National Strategy 26 INTERNET AFFORDABILITY IN BELIZE On the other hand, computers and internet service, while readily available in most urban center and some rural ones as well in Belize, is just not affordable for the average Belizean as Figure 8 reveals. Figure 8 – Internet Affordability (Standard Home Internet Service Plan) High Speed Internet Service Monthly Charges BZE$ % GDP Per Capita 2008 Annual Figures (BZE$12,920) 256K $100 9% 512K $179 17% 1MB $300 28% 2MB $500 46% 4MB $850 79% Source: Belize Telecommunication Limited The above figure reveals that even for a 1MB of internet service, the average Belizean would have to spend more than ¼ of their annual income to afford it. A 4 MB household internet connection (very common in households in the Caribbean) would cost the average Belizean a mortgage payment (and a high one at that!) or more than ¾ of their annual income. This is perhaps the reason why only 13.1% of Belizeans have internet in their homes. It is a very similar story within the Belizean business community. Although most companies have PCs and Internet access, very few companies (with the exception of the major industries) have invested in dedicated data lines or extensive office automation. As there are only a small number of consumers currently on-line (and most of these are tourists), there is still little rationale for companies to use the Internet as a business medium (except for the tourism industry). Most are using it for e-mail and for a basic web presence, i.e., static web sites. However, if the internet rates were to decrease, many more Belizeans would go online which would spur the development of more e- business in Belize.

It indicates that Belizean high schools have about one computer for every 12 students. They also have an average of about one computer lab per high school as there are about 57 high school computer labs in the country. Most of the high schools in Belize are located in urban areas; therefore, most have access to the Internet. There is recognition that the rural population is “under-served” in terms of ICT in education in Belize. The Ministry of Education (MOE) has strongly underlined the importance of utilizing distributed and e-learning as an important means to overcome the current educational divide between the cities and municipalities, on the one hand, and the villages on the other (personal communication, Kevin Harris, 15th March 2011). Yet the application of an e- learning strategy to bridge the educational divide still demands the articulation of a policy and strategy on how villages in rural areas are to be technologically supported. The aggressive introduction of ICT for education requires not only a strong technological backbone but also a strong pedagogical one. ICT in education requires the appropriate skills 3 Most Belizeans still get their first formal computer class at a high school and not at a primary school. Data regarding computers in primary schools were not available at the time of the writing of this report; however, it is widely believed that most primary schools in Belize do not have internet service or computer labs. Belize ICT National Strategy 29 to develop educational content – whether for traditional classroom delivery or for e- and distributed learning. Ideally, this should be centrally based in order to maximize scarce skills, to ensure that content is of the appropriate quality and reflects curriculum requirements, as well as to secure the promulgation of such content at a national level. Moreover, the introduction of ICT Internet based facilities for schools requires a strong security framework that ensures that children are restricted from accessing high risk and pornographic content and that such blocking is maintained on a daily basis in order to ensure that it gives real rather than just perceived security. This is fundamental in order to provide the adequate level of protection to children as well as to secure parental trust and confidence in the provision of internet access to their children. It is pertinent to underline that, there does not seem to be an ICT in Schools strategy that seeks to define a cohesive and coordinated way forward. There is no national ICT curriculum. In essence what this means is that schools – which are both church and state schools - set their own curriculum for ICT.4 ICT IN THE BELIZEAN WORKFORCE According to the 2009 Scoping Exercise Report, The Belize Chamber of Commerce and Industry opines while many firms have some form of Internet access, relatively few employees have individual access. Employees that do have their own e-mail accounts typically work for large firms. The total number of corporate websites is unknown, but is thought to be quite high. However, these sites are typically modest in nature, with limited information that is not updated regularly. In terms of computer applications, some office automation software is in use. Larger firms have some enterprise application software. The Chamber of Commerce also opines that the use of ICTs in the workplace is also fairly limited. Although virtually all businesses have computers and access to the internet, a significant number of employees share computers and only a few have personal e-mail addresses for use in the work environment. 4 The Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC) does set a regional CXC Computer Science exam which many secondary schools in Belize prepare their students for. Belize ICT National Strategy 30 ICT IN GOVERNMENT OF BELIZE As part of the preparation of the e-Belize – Accelerating Development National ICT Strategy, the consulting team undertook a series of individual consultations with government ministries and departments. They also conducted a website content analysis of the portal of GOB ministries’ links. In addition, the consulting team conducted an e- government survey of all of GOB ministries requesting ICT related information. Analysis of the information indicates that, overall, GOB has made considerable investments in ICT to-date. Some Ministry offices feature modern computer and telephony equipment. They communicate with citizens, businesses, and other Government offices via telephone, e-mail, and the Internet, in addition to face-to- face. In addition, at least three Ministries (Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Health and Ministry of Police and Public Safety) have installed management information systems and several others (such as Immigration, Foreign Affairs and Trade, Labor and Natural Resources) are in the process of doing so. Computer technology now plays an increasingly significant role at the operational level of all GOB Ministries and Departments. All of the 19 Ministries and Departments who completed the survey have access to the internet and e-mail, most use the Microsoft Office Suite, and at least half of the Ministries have a functioning website. The introduction and use of ICT in the public service, however, has been limited by a lack of coordination and integration in the planning and implementation of these initiatives. This is due largely to the absence of a Policy and Strategic framework which would provide the requisite direction and guidelines for the adoption and utilization of ICT resources in the public sector. Given the present level of adoption and use of computer technology, the implementation of this National ICT Strategy (which addresses to a large extent ICT in Government) will bode well for the further advancement of the GOB’s public sector modernization agenda. Approximately half of all GOB Ministries (8 of the 17) have a Ministry website and thirteen of the seventeen feature a Web site from one of their departments. Additionally, those who do not have a web site do have a web link on the new government portal ( However, government Web sites (as well as the GOB Portal) typically feature static government centric information on the Ministry and its divisions, including mandate, services offered, organizational structure, contact information, and “frequently asked questions”. Based on the Belize ICT National Strategy 31 United Nations “web measure” index of the state of online services from a country’s government, the information gathered on GOB websites indicate that GOB is currently transitioning the “Emerging and Enhanced” stages of online service delivery (the first two Stages on the four Stage scale). 5 While it does not seem to be part of an overall e-Government strategy, certain GOB Ministries and Departments are expanding the scope of their electronic service delivery offerings. The Ministries of 5 EMERGING PRESENCE is Stage I representing information, which is limited and basic. The e-government online presence comprises a web page and /or an official website; links to ministries/departments of education, health, social welfare, labor and finance may/may not exist; links to regional/local government may/may not exist; some archived information such as the head of states' message or a document such as the constitution may be available on line, most information remains static with the fewest options for citizens. ENHANCED PRESENCE is Stage II in which the government provides greater public policy and governance sources of current and archived information, such as policies, laws and regulation, reports, newsletters, and downloadable databases. The user can search for a document and there is a help feature and a site map provided. A larger selection of public policy documents such as an e-government strategy, policy briefs on specific education or health issues. Though more sophisticated, the interaction is still primarily unidirectional with information flowing essentially from government to the citizen. the Attorney General, Economic Development, Education, Foreign Affairs, Natural Resources (Meteorology Office), Ministry of the Public Service, Ministry of Tourism (Belize Tourist Board) and Ministry of Transport and Communications (NEMO) are offering electronic downloadable and printable forms. The Belize National Library Service offers an electronic library service and the Belize Meteorology Department offers a “two way interaction service” for citizens requesting weather reports, which puts their sites between Stage Two and Stage Three of the UN’s “Web measure model: Stages of e-government evolution” scale. 6 There is still much to do to enable full e- Government in Belize. Currently, basic information is now accessible on-line. However, ministries do not yet offer highly valuable electronic transactions such as benefits registration, application for training 6 TRANSACTIONAL PRESENCE is Stage III that allows two-way interaction between the citizen and his/her government. It includes options for paying taxes; applying for ID cards, birth certificates/passports, license renewals and other similar C2G interactions by allowing him/her to submit these online 24/7. The citizens are able to pay for relevant public services, such as motor vehicle violation, taxes, fees for postal services through their credit, bank or debit card. Providers of goods and services are able to bid online for public contacts via secure links. Please refer to: ew/webmeasure.htm Belize ICT National Strategy 32 programs, job applications, and electronic payments. Information and communication technology, in the form of modern computers, telephones and network solutions, is pervasive throughout GOB. However, the usage of electronic systems and processes is still very minor compared with the usage of paper-based ones. Desktop computers may be used to produce documents and presentations, but it is very rare that they are used to access vital data. Database servers contain some client information, but more often than not it is used as a backup for paper files, not the central record itself. Much is still in paper. Although more sophisticated information systems are being introduced including document management solutions, their usage is still very limited. There is no central secure government network. However, there are many separate networks including Smart Stream, which is a secure network run by CITO on behalf of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) for applications relating to accounting, income tax, and service tax; a network created by the Ministry of Health to promulgate the Belize Information Health System (BIHS) to cities and municipalities; and a network created by the Belize Police Force to promulgate the Crime Reporting Information Management System (CRIMS) also to cities and police stations.7 There is no standard for office automation use although, from the e-government survey conducted, the software tool most prevalent is Microsoft Office 2007. It is, however, pertinent to note, that with the exception of users who have authorized access to Smart Stream the general consensus is that most installations of the Microsoft application software is unlicensed.8 There are no data centers in Belize. The building of a National ICT Centre by the Ministry of the Public Service, financed by the Government of Taiwan, whilst an excellent development, does not yet have this role as its mandate. There is no doubt that, if properly planned, the new National ICT Centre can act as a Central Data Centre with appropriate robust facilities to assure (i) consolidation of ad hoc hardware; (ii) streamlined utilization of hardware; (iii) 7 There is also a project underway to link the Police, Immigration and Prison together via a common database to provide more intelligence regarding crime. This is being sponsored by the United States government. 8 The Ministry of the Public Service through its Belize National Information and Communication Technology Center is in the process of discussions with Microsoft Corporation for the feasibility of purchasing a Microsoft Enterprise license for GOB, its statutory agencies and schools. Belize ICT National Strategy 33 greater levels of security; (iv) greater levels of resilience; (v) better utilization of technical resources and rationalization of such resources to the optimum level; (vi) reduction of the Total Cost of Ownership by ensuring that facilities are not replicated unnecessarily. Furthermore, the resources assigned to support ICT policy and operations within the Ministry of the Public Service, as well as the line Ministries, are limited at best. Even a large, important Department such as Immigration only has a staff of two IT individuals. With the possible exception of the Ministry of Health, most ICT Departments seem currently understaffed. There is no ad hoc financing for ICT within the Government of Belize. In essence, ICT financing is a line vote item that is assigned to each Ministry and Department as part of the budgetary process. This primarily means that ICT is not recognized as a corporate – horizontal – program that transcends the Government of Belize which thus requires dedicated financing in order to secure the promulgation of ICT. Belize ICT National Strategy 34 ICT IN BELIZEAN COMMERCE Figure 12 below shows the current licensed Business Processing Outsourcing organizations in Belize. In 2010, these organizations generated approximately US$18,736,164 and approximately 1,095 jobs. The genesis for this came about in 2000 when the Government encouraged the opening of a private e-commerce park, opened by Datapro International Inc in the Belize City Export Processing Zone (EPZ) thereby guaranteeing freedom from taxes to incoming dotcoms. The park has successfully stimulated Belize's e-business sector. Subsequently, EPZ were expanded to be able to operate anywhere in the country as long as they receive the requisite permits from the Ministry of Economic Development.

The development of an information or knowledge economy that services the US makes strategic sense given that Belize is in the same time zone as the US, is close to the US, has intelligent and knowledgeable people, and the cost of labor is far lower than would be found in the US. ICT IN BELIZEAN BUSINESSES The 2009 Scoping Exercise Report stated that the Belize Chamber of Commerce and Industry, whilst acknowledging that it has no hard data on the state of the information economy within Belize as it has yet to date to carry out a survey on this matter, is of the considered opinion that the use and penetration of ICT for businesses purposes is limited. In this regard the Chamber believes that use of ICT, where it has been availed of, is primarily of electronic communications and potential basic office applications. The set-up of industry and business within Belize, with the exception of a small number of large operators such as the banks, hotel operators, etc, are micro-enterprises. Given the GDP / capita and the fact that, with the exclusion of the service industry related to tourism, securing a web presence is not perceived to be a productive investment particularly given that achieving this is seen to be prohibitively expensive. Operations in the tourism industry are seen to make most use of ICT – both for the promotion of the enterprise’s service or product or for back offices purposes. The Chamber is of the considered opinion (the Belize Tourism Industry Association is a member of the Chamber) that ICT web presence by tourism service providers is primarily limited to a static web presence. The Chamber believes that there is no e- tourism infrastructure in Belize – a matter of concern given the actions being taken in this regard by competitors to Belize tourism. Belize ICT National Strategy 36 ICT LEGAL FRAMEWORK IN BELIZE The successful implementation of e- government policies and processes can be significantly enabled by a proper legal framework for their operation. A requirement for ICT related processes to be introduced and adopted is their formal legal equivalence and standing with the paper process. Many governments are now aware of the need for framework to provide for enforceable electronic transactions, both in the e-government sphere and for e-commerce, and have taken action. For example, the legal recognition of digital signatures is necessary if they are to be used in e- government for the submission of electronic forms containing sensitive personal or financial information.9 While the Government of Belize has enacted several key legislation: Computer Wagering and Licensing Act of 1995, The Belize Copyright Act revised 2003, the Electronic Transactions Act (2003), Electronic Evidence Act (2003), Freedom of Information Act (1994, amended in 2000), and the Archives and Records Service Act (2004), and the Interception of Communication Act 0f 2010, there are 9 The Electronic Transactions Act of 2003 does allow for the use of electronic signatures in Belize. other critical areas which must be addressed if any e-Government related Strategy is to have any meaningful impact, in particular: • Computer and Computer Related Crime/Computer Misuse: makes attempted or actual penetration or subversion of computer systems a criminal act and prohibits the unauthorized access, use of or interference to any program or data held in a computer and to a computer itself. • Privacy and Data Protection: sets requirements for the proper handling and protection of personal information held within information processing systems and to protect the privacy of individuals in relation to personal data, to regulate the collection, processing, keeping, use and disclosure of certain information relating to individuals and to provide for matters incidental thereto or connected therewith.10 10 The Belize Interception of Communications Act of 2010 does address some of these issues although not in their totality. Belize ICT National Strategy 37 ICT TRADE POLICY AND REGULATIONS IN BELIZE Belize is one of the few countries that have enacted legislation allowing for the establishment of online wagering. Its Computer Wagering Licensing Act, 1995, which came into force on May 28, 1996, provides for the proper conduct and regulation of gambling via the Internet. In addition, the Electronic Transactions Act of Belize was passed in 2003. The objectives of the Act are: a) to eliminate legal barriers to the effective use of electronic communications in transactions; b) to promote the harmonization of legal rules on electronic transactions across national boundaries; c) to facilitate the appropriate use of electronic transactions; d) to promote business and community confidence in electronic transactions; and e) to enable businesses and the community to use electronic communications in their transactions with government. Belize ICT National Strategy 38 TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY IN BELIZE The Government of Belize passed the Belize Telecommunications Act in 1987 which constituted Belize Telecommunications Ltd (BTL). BTL was granted a 15 years exclusive license to operate in Belize. In tandem, an Office of Telecommunications was constituted to regulate BTL as well as to administer spectrum management. The objects of the Belize Telecommunications Act (BTA) of 1987 were to: “provide for the regulation and control of telecommunications matters in the public interest, and for that purpose to (a) promote reliable and affordable telecommunication services of high quality accessible to Belizeans in both urban and rural areas in all regions of Belize; (b) foster increased reliance on market forces for the provision of telecommunications services and to ensure that regulation, where required, is efficient and effective; (c) promote the provision of telecommunication services that meet all the economic and social requirements of users, including disabled persons; (d) encourage investment and innovation in the telecommunications sector; (e) ensure and promote fair pricing and the use of cost-based pricing methods by providers in Belize; (f) ensure compliance with accepted technical standards in the provision and development of telecommunication services; (g) promote stability of the telecommunications sector; (h) protect the interests of telecommunications users, service providers and consumers; (i) preserve national security interests; (j) ensure the efficient use of the radio frequency spectrum; (k) ensure the safety of the public by maintaining access to emergency numbers at all times irrespective of non-payment by the consumer.” The powers of regulation are vested by BTA in the Public Utilities Commission (PUC). BTL was subsequently privatized and in December 2002 was granted an ‘Individual License’. In the same month, December 2002, a second ‘Individual License’ was issued to International Telecommunications Limited – which, however, went out of operation within a few years. In August 2003, an ‘Individual License’ was granted to Speednet Communications Limited. It is pertinent to note that in May 2007 the goodwill, properties, assets, obligations and Belize ICT National Strategy 39 rights of Belize Telecommunications Limited as well as its employees were transferred to Belize Telemedia Limited (BTL). This means that in essence there are two telecommunication providers in Belize. It is pertinent to note, however, that BTL is the only Telecommunications Provider – that is it owns the international connectivity gateway as well as the land installed dark fibre and the national telecommunications grid. Speednet Communications Limited operates primarily through BTL – and its core business appears to be wireless telephony. The 2009 Scoping Exercise Report opines that one fundamental effect arising from BTL’s sole telecommunications provider status is its power to block access to VoIP in order to protect its international line revenue. The use of VoIP either for domestic and international purposes is not possible in Belize unless access is granted by BTL. The inability of Government Ministries and departments to use VoIP technology to minimize telecommunications costs and for society and the economy at large to apply teleconferencing technology to overcome communications logistical issues arising due to the geo-disparity of cities, municipalities and villages strategically constrains the ability for Belize to adopt an aggressive pace in establishing an information society and an information economy that places e-government as its kernel. CONCLUSION It is pertinent to note that nothing was revealed in the e-Readiness assessment that would hinder Belize from becoming a world class ICT state in the course of the lifespan of this Strategy (five years) if the political and business “will” was there to turn the situation around. Even with the high cost of internet in Belize, many Belizeans (over 73,000) have embraced the internet. Over three fourths of Belizeans households own a cell phone and over half have cable TV service. Because Belize has a young population (with over half under the age of 24), it is even more likely that many more Belizeans will seek to become a part of the global information society. Belize currently has the infrastructure to meet their needs. It is not a question of hardware or software but “people-ware”. The “will” to do the right thing is what is needed. Belize ICT National Strategy 40 Goals Objectives BELIZE NATIONAL ICT STRATEGY 2011 - 2016 Stakeholders from across Belize have defined the Vision for Belize by utilizing and leveraging the power of ICTs. NATIONAL ICT VISION ACCELERATED DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL BELIZEANS THROUGH UNIVERSAL ACCESS AND WIDESPREAD USAGE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY. The National ICT Vision articulates the future that will be created through the implementation of this strategy. Creating this future will result in accelerated national socio-economic development of the country leading to “an improved quality of life for all Belizeans”. Connecting to the future as defined by the Vision and outcomes requires a strategic approach to implementing the necessary programs and initiatives; this will create a powerful focus where the investment of energy and resources will bring about a synergistic effect in achieving the outputs required. Accelerating national development will be empowered by pursuing major goals, objectives and implementing a series of programs that consist of critical projects. These are shown in Figure 13 and described on the next page: Figure 13 Belize ICT National Strategy 41 MAJOR GOALS Two major goals will be pursued over the five year period of the National ICT Strategy: • Firstly, Universal Access to ICTs, ensuring ICT accessibility, acceptance and usability by anyone, anywhere, at anytime, and through any media and device. • Secondly, Widespread ICT usage in every aspect of national development including security & crime reduction, improving health care, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of Government, developing competitive businesses and building new industries.

Belize ICT National Strategy 44 KEY PROGRAMS Each major objective consists of key programs and projects (initiatives) that will be implemented with relentless passion. The key programs are identified and described below. • ENHANCING AND HARMONIZING THE NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE • ICT IN EDUCATION • DEVELOPING THE E-COMMERCE INFRASTRUCTURE • BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE – CONNECT BELIZE • CREATING JOBS - DEVELOPING ICT INDUSTRY • MODERNIZING THE PUBLIC SECTOR USING ICT ENHANCING AND HARMONIZING THE NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE The country of Belize needs to take action to create a vibrant, competitive and open telecommunication industry that enables the availability and accessibility of quality and affordable telecommunication services to consumers and fostering social and economic benefits to the country. While the number of ICT users in Belize is growing, there are still significant segments of the population that do not have ready access to telecommunication; in particular, Internet services. The challenge for GOB, in collaboration with its private sector, civil society and international development partners, is to encourage the development of a vibrant, high-quality, low-cost telecommunications infrastructure which all citizens have the opportunity to access. GOB in collaboration with the private sector, civil society, and its international development partners will implement the following Projects/Initiatives to facilitate the enhancement and harmonization of the Belize national telecommunications infrastructure: • Develop a comprehensive and sound competitive framework for communications services matching international best practices by promoting competition, innovation, and investment in broadband services. • Promote and facilitate domestic and foreign investment in additional Internet backbone in an international competiveness mode in order to bring more telecommunication capacity and Belize ICT National Strategy 45 redundancy to the Belizean market. This will greatly aid in getting the country ready to become a major player on the international ICT industrial market stage in areas such as cyber-park development and the development of Business Processing Outsourcing (BPOs); • Maintain an independent, effective, fair and transparent Telecommunications Regulatory Authority. The Public Utilities Commission (PUC) is critical in setting the right tone for the telecommunications market, and for providing regulatory certainty, ensuring non-discriminatory treatment of telecom and ISP providers, and in preventing anti-competitive behavior. The GOB via the PUC will ensure that all telecom and ISP providers have non- discriminatory access to the International Internet Gateway (ARCOS fiber) and those prices and service level agreements for wholesale Internet bandwidth are calculated on a cost- based formula and a reasonable return of investment for the dominant operator. This healthy environment will provide the certainty necessary for attracting large investments required for infrastructure development and service provision, which will be a catalyst to improving Internet penetration and cost reduction to the general Belizean populace. • Allow for the competitive development of unfiltered Internet services in Belize by avoiding the imposition of regulations that might impede development and access to new technology such as Voice-Over the Internet (VOIP). This will spur the creation of new socio-economic opportunities and reduce the cost of international calls; thereby allowing Belize to be more competitive and innovative on par with the rest of the region and the world. • Maximize efforts to bring voice and data services to under-served populations, by coordinating efforts from all social sectors involved and by creating a universal access fund paid by telecom and ISP providers. • Promote the creation of a market which maximizes the use of national infrastructure and that has the capacity to provide the delivery of triple-play services (Voice, Data and Video) under one single platform. This will allow operators to enhance their service portfolio, reduce investment costs, and provide a cheaper service to the consumer. Belize ICT National Strategy 46 ENHANCING EDUCATION USING ICT Belize has long recognized the strategic importance of education and training as a principal instrument of economic and social development. Belize already has internet access and IT computer labs in most its secondary schools. This has enabled the significant growth of basic computer literacy and skills among those of school-age population who are still in school. GOB and its private sector, civil society and international development partners recognize the need to both widen and deepen this process, and therefore commits, to pursuing the following: • The ICT Curriculum for lifelong learning program will ensure that ICTs form an integral part of the education curriculum at all levels as a core subject area and also a learning and curriculum delivery tool. Initiatives including the development of a holistic ICT Plan for education, Primary and Secondary curriculum design, will be initiated to ensure that all areas of the education value chain benefits from the application of ICTs. • The ICT Facilities development program will provide the necessary equipment and facilities for the ICT empowered delivery of primary and secondary curriculum, and student access to information and learning materials. Several initiatives will be implemented including School Net providing broadband Internet connectivity to primary and secondary schools and libraries across Belize; Smart classrooms initiative equipping primary and secondary classrooms with ICTs for the delivery of learning materials, ICT learning Labs will equip all primary and secondary schools with computer labs for use by students. Additionally the secondary school system will benefit from two major initiatives targeting the management of education information and the provision of training material via eLearning. • The ICT capacity for teachers & librarians program addresses the capacity to deliver new curriculum, learning resources and information, in new and innovative ways utilizing ICTs in the education system. Primary and secondary teachers and librarians will be exposed to the ICT training initiative that continuously upgrade their skills to design and deliver learning material utilizing ICTs. Teachers are the front line troops in the development of Belize. They should be accorded the status, facilities and role of key change agents not only in delivering the skills of the next generation, but for their influence over the community, Belize ICT National Strategy 47 especially rural communities. The highest priority must be given to their engagement and support as a part of this National ICT Strategy. It is recommended that all teachers be trained in the use of ICT, and in its integration into the curriculum for teaching and learning. It is also recommended that all teachers be provided with a personal computer and access to the Internet at a reduced cost. The objective is to facilitate teachers having a PC in their homes to develop competencies which will enhance teaching and learning of students in the classroom. Accompanying this should be the development of on line and offline teacher training courses so that teachers can continually upgrade and certify themselves, thereby increasing the number of trained teachers in the country. DEVELOPING THE eCOMMERCE INFRASTRUCTURE The Internet and electronic commerce represent tremendous social and economic potential for countries such as Belize. The ecommerce development program seeks to create an enabling environment including the requisite legal and regulatory framework that will enhance consumer confidence and protection, electronic payment systems, digital certification and authentication and intellectual property protection. Initiatives will be implemented to address the requirements in all of these areas as follows. ELECTRONIC PAYMENT SYSTEMS The availability of effective electronic payment systems is a significant element of electronic commerce and electronic business, enabling government, and wholesale and retail businesses electronically using electronic payments. The electronic payment infrastructure for Belize’s banks is build in silos in which each financial institution develops its own electronic and online payment infrastructure without any kind of common national standards and interoperability framework. Belize should and must develop and legislate a Common Electronic Payment System that integrates all local banks into a common banking switch interbank network. Belize’s Common Electronic Payments System (BEPS) will include but not be limited to the following services in its network to all participating banks: • Shared Nationwide ATM and Point of Sale Network, provides the switch which enable bank customers to conveniently Belize ICT National Strategy 48 access their funds anywhere from any of the participating banks’ ATMs. • e-Debit, enables the purchase amount to be immediately deducted from the savings or current account direct into the retailer's or merchant's bank account. This provides consumers with better cash management and peace of mind as all transactions are PIN based. In addition, the new card is embedded with a sophisticated, tamper-resistant smart chip to protect consumers against the risk of fraud. • Mobile Prepaid Top-Up via ATM, offers more convenience for mobile phone subscribers to top-up through BEPS’ ATMs. • Interbank ATM Fund Transfer (IBFT), allows bank customers to transfer funds from one account to another account in another bank. The beneficiary will receive the funds immediately and instantaneously, as the transfer is online and in real-time. • Interbank Payments, makes interbank funds transfer more convenient to bank customers via an electronic channel. It enables payments to be made without the need to raise physical supporting vouchers or documents such as cheques, bank drafts, etc. It is an interbank fund transfer system that facilitates payments and collections via the exchange of digitized transactions between banks. For corporations, it is ideal for high volume interbank payments such as payroll payments. As for individuals, it is ideal for transactions such as credit card payments and loan repayments. It offers bank customers, be it an individual or corporation, a secure interbank fund transfer system/channel for all sorts of payments through direct debiting of the customers' account(s) and crediting into the beneficiaries account; with all participating banks. • Financial Processing Exchange (FPX), opens new doors for e-Commerce, in particular business to business (B2B) and business to commerce (B2C) payments. FPX is an alternative payment channel for customers to make payment at e-market places such as websites and online stores as well as for corporations to collect bulk payment from their customers. It leverages on the Internet banking services of participating banks and provides fast, secure, reliable, real-time online payment processing. FPX provides complete end-to-end business transactions, resourceful payment records, simplified reconciliation and reduced risks as fund movements are between established financial institutions. Belize ICT National Strategy 49 SINGLE WINDOW TRADING SYSTEM A single window trade system enables international (cross-border) traders to submit regulatory documents at a single location and/or single entity. Such documents are typically customs declarations, applications for import/export permits, and other supporting documents such as certificates of origin and trading invoices. Partners in such a system could include: • Beltraide • BAHA • Ministry of Finance • Ministry of Agriculture • The Port Authority • The Customs Brokers Association • Belize Ports Limited • The Customs Department • The Bureau of Standards • The Ministry of Health • The Police Department The main value proposition for having a Single Window for a country or economy is to increase the efficiency through time and cost savings for traders in their dealings with various government authorities for obtaining the relevant clearance and permit(s) for moving cargoes across national or economic borders. In a traditional pre-Single Window environment, traders may have had to contend with visits and dealings with multiple government agencies in multiple locations in order to obtain the necessary papers, permits and clearance in order to complete their import or export processes. There is no single definitive viewpoint of what a single window trade system should be. A common definition of the term \"Single Window\" is: \"A facility that allows parties involved in trade and transport to lodge standardized information and documents with a single entry point to fulfill all import, export, and transit-related regulatory requirements. If information is electronic then individual data elements should only be submitted once.\" The concept is recognized and promoted by several world organizations that are concerned with trade facilitation. Among these are the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and its Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT), World Customs Organisation (WCO), SITPRO Limited of the United Kingdom and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). It is recommended that Belize adopts such as system to promote and enhance e- Commerce including enhancing the revenue collection system for government. Belize ICT National Strategy 50 CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND PROTECTION This initiative will build consumer confidence in electronic commerce by providing protection from fraud and from misleading and unfair conduct and commercial practices, respect for consumer privacy, private sector initiatives, global cooperation, consumer and business education, and effective means of dispute resolution. DIGITAL CERTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION This initiative will enable greater security of the eCommerce environment by developing the legal and policy frameworks that emphasize standards in authentication technologies that help identify parties to electronic business transactions, and provide means by which they can reliably sign documents, assent to transactions, and verify documents' integrity. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION This initiative will provide Legal protection of intellectual property in the online environment for the creation of local content. Consumers will also have confidence that they can rely on trademarks as trusted indicators of the origin and quality of their on-line purchases. Belize ICT National Strategy 51 ANTIGUA & BARBUDA Mobile Computer classrooms give Antigua’s public school students access to computer technology and Wi-Fi. Source: 07_11_29.php CONNECT BELIZE – BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE The Connect Belize program will ensure that all Belizeans have equal access to ICTs by implementing initiatives that expand broadband connectivity to communities and homes in both urban and rural Belize and bridge the digital divide by ensuring that adequate facilities for access is within the reach of persons. This program will bring the benefit of ICTs into all segments of the population, especially to people who are disadvantaged due to education, age, gender, disabilities, ethnicity, and/or those living in remote regions. Good governance is high on many countries development agenda, including Belize, premised on the belief that it is a prerequisite for improved national socio-economic performance as well as national cohesion and state building. As a result, there is clearly a movement toward changes in the areas of public administration and governance systems and institutions in most of the world today. Increased emphasis on good governance has generated greater demands from citizens for effective and participatory governance structures and services. There are rising demands as well for access to public information, which has direct implications for ICT applications in the governance domain. Indeed, the role of ICTs in enhancing good governance is becoming an issue of critical importance as democratization gains ground around the world. Three major programs will be implemented over the period as follows: • The connect Rural Belize initiative, • The Community Access Center (Telecenters) initiative, • The ICT awareness, and promotion and ICT education for communities initiative Belize ICT National Strategy 52 A telecenter may be defined as a shared site that provides public access to information and communications technology whose main purpose is to increase public access to the Internet and to services available over the Internet. The basic telecenter that is common in Latin America and the Caribbean has fairly standard features. It consists of premises stocked with several computer terminals and simple furnishings consisting of chairs or classroom desks for users and regular desks or tables on which the terminals sit. The main service offered to the public is access to the Internet (chatting, e-mail and Web browsing) and often also to elementary software (word processing, spreadsheet). However, telecenters have also been used for education and training and for providing vital government services online. RURAL CONNECTIVITY –E- VILLAGE In the rural communities, commercial investment in telecommunications infrastructure has followed a typical pattern: slow and weak investment. As a result, rural communities suffer a “distance penalty” that increases communication costs and makes it more difficult to attract businesses and growing families. Rural communities can use advanced telecommunications services, particularly the Internet, to help them bridge the gap. It is recommended that the Government of Belize improve the connectivity of rural areas which will provide to residents access to information and training and digital opportunities leading to poverty reduction. Funding from an established Universal Access Fund and from international funding agencies through grants/loans can be used for the funding of this project. COMMUNITY ACCESS CENTERS – TELECENTERS DESIRED OUTCOMES 1. Universal Access to Information and Communication Technology (especially for poor urban and rural areas); 2. Poverty Alleviation And Crime Reduction through Distance Education and workforce training, particularly of low income women and youth in urban and rural areas; 3. Dissemination of Information for community development including the provision of health, agriculture, trade information and enhanced access to government services (birth registration, application for permits, job and land applications etc…) online using ICT. Belize ICT National Strategy 53 4. Enhancing democratic governance through increased community connectedness and participation. BENEFITS OF TELECENTERS • Rural Connectivity - Rapid developments in wireless technology have made it possible to overcome physical hurdles (distance, topography), at a reasonable cost, that for long have limited the development of telecommunications infrastructure in rural areas of Latin America and the Caribbean. The benefits of such investments in telecenters should be maximized by providing Internet services and not just rural telephony. Shared access to these services through telecenters can increase the impact of these interventions. • Training - ICT training interventions should be geared primarily towards young people. The young adapt most quickly and easily and is most skilled at using the new technologies. Since young people are a large group in Belize, with the longest productive horizon ahead of them, there is a high return on investments aimed at improving their productive capacity. The starting point should be the strengthening of the formal education system, so that it incorporates the effective use of the new technologies. Teacher training is often a critical determinant of impact on youngsters. Telecenters can be an important complement to formal education reform, providing support to students and teachers after school hours and increasing Internet access for teachers, parents, recent graduates and the community at large. In addition, telecenters can be used for online workforce training using programs such as the International Driver’s License ICT training program for low income urban youth, thereby enhancing their job prospects leading to poverty reduction and crime alleviation. • Dissemination of Information – Telecenters can be used to launch portals that offer public services online, aimed primarily at meeting the economic and social needs of the low- income population, including educational portals using simple language that broaden labor and self- employment opportunities. For example, it can be used to provide birth registration, application for permits, job and land applications etc… online using ICT. It can also be used to provide a database of jobs and people looking for jobs connecting citizens, government and the private sector. Belize ICT National Strategy 54 The ICT AWARENESS AND PROMOTION program will boost awareness, build interest and create a demand for ICTs in communities across Belize. Through the initiatives in this program Belizeans will become aware of the benefit that ICTs can have in every aspect of their lives and become familiar with the use of ICT tools. This program is in fact a change program designed to create the demand for ICTs as the Connect Belize program makes the access to ICTs within reach of all Belizeans. Major initiatives under this program include the Annual Belize ICT Roadshow, School Based ICT awareness competitions, Multimedia ICT promotions, National Awards for ICT innovation. This should also include education regarding the legal and regulatory frameworks that are already in place in Belize for fostering a competitive ICT environment. The ICT EDUCATION FOR COMMUNITIES PROGRAM will provide an enabling environment to facilitate ICT literacy for all citizens but especially children and youth. This will allow them to enter labor force with relevant ICT skills that will contribute to new revenue streams that are ICT enabled. Belize ICT National Strategy 55 CREATING JOBS – DEVELOPING THE LOCAL ICT INDUSTRY The local ICT industry programs is designed to create a well developed ICT services sector and driving the adoption and usage of ICT in all dimensions of business operations to create competitive advantage at the business and country levels. ICT will become the basis for new local business as well as a means to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of established sectors. Key aspects of the program include: • The provision of ICT incentives which focuses on creating the environment that promotes and rewards the use of ICTs in business and the growth of the ICT industry. Various incentives will be created toward this end including effective removal of taxes and import duties on ICT products and related accessories, implementing the Access to ICT Capital initiative that develops Public/Private partnerships to provide funding to jumpstart certain ICT industries, with private sector funding as the preferred source for capital. • Nurturing the growth of a competitive ICT sector through the implementation of the Competitive ICT Businesses initiative that will ensure that competitive local ICT companies have an opportunity to become key suppliers of GOB ICT needs and benefit from the knowledge transfer when international ICT providers participate in local business opportunities. Additionally one of the major ICT industry growth initiatives will focus on the establishment of Cyber-parks for the provision of ICT related jobs by attracting investors operating in a competitive environment. The Cyber-park initiative will train our youth for the industry and establish facilities including factory shells and office buildings that are equipped with advanced ICT infrastructure. The focus of the Cyber-parks will be to increase the wealth of its community by promoting the culture of innovation and the competitiveness of its associated businesses and knowledge- based institutions. The establishment of Cyberparks for the provision of ICT related jobs has become one of the kinds of incentives used to attract investors operating in a knife-edge competitive environment in many developing countries. It is recommended that GOB and its local and international partners seek investment to promote the availability of workspace for BPOs, including factory shells and office buildings, through the creation of Cyberparks. Private sector partners should also be encouraged to invest in developing Belize ICT National Strategy 56 these facilities. Government should consider positively joint approaches to such ventures. The objective should be to encourage the location of such facilities in areas of relevant and advantageous infrastructure, and where there is a catchment of trained and trainable human resource. Advantage will be taken of the existence of available unused structures that lend themselves to easy conversion. Government should also consider the provision of such facilities that would allow for economies of scale in the use of shared facilities, infrastructure, and transmission equipment. . Belize ICT National Strategy 57 INTRODUCTION A Cyber Park according to the International Association of Science and Technology Parks (IASP) is “ An organization managed by specialized professionals, whose main aim is to increase the wealth of its community by promoting the culture of innovation and the competitiveness of its associated businesses and knowledge- based institutions. Cyber parks play a significant role in stimulating national IT development and establishing logical links with the global market through forging partnerships for developing information and telecommunication technologies. A Cyber Park can act as a catalyst to develop the business infrastructure for such a mission. Developing countries have increasingly relied on cyber parks as a preferred tool for promotion of IT industry. These countries are often constrained by severe infrastructure limitations. Therefore, it is easier for them to provide world class infrastructure in select areas. Developing countries like India and China have concentrated on state-of-the art physical, communication and social infrastructure in cyber parks to enable IT companies from around the world to operate BPO (Business Processing Outsourcing) and ITES (International Technology Enabled Services). Unlike other industrial clusters, cyber parks are not constrained by factors such as the availability of natural resources, or raw materials. The key resource requirement is availability of quality manpower. One of the main reasons for the success of China and India in the IT sector can be attributed to their highly educated and skilled manpower. It has been observed that cyber parks generate spillover effects, leading to a virtuous cycle of local economic development. Cyber park development helps generate the impetus to local development of industries such as building construction, real estate, retail, lifestyle and recreation. CYBERPARKS DESIRED OUTCOMES 1. Poverty Alleviation though accelerating economic growth; 2. Job creation and career growth particularly for low-income women and youth and for technical and technology graduates; 3. Leveraging international knowledge resources to enhance a country’s economic and ICT base; Belize ICT National Strategy 58 BENEFITS OF CYBERPARKS • Employment Growth – the local BPO industry in Belize has already created over 1,000 jobs in the country. Beltraide asserts that with concerted GOB and other local support, that number could well be over 10,000 in five years. • Other Businesses Spread Effects – Cyber Parks can also create a boost for other local industries such as the local construction industry as one of the inputs that it needs most is large working spaces. As mentioned above, Cyber park development also helps to generate the impetus to local development of industries such as building construction, real estate, retail, and lifestyle and recreation. • Hiring of Technical and Technology Graduates – Cyberparks and the companies located in them are always looking for technical and technology graduates. This is why many of them locate near to a university or technical school. Beltraide intends to work with the ITVET and the sixth forms and University of Belize to develop the pool of skilled workers necessary for BPOs and ITES organizations to operate effectively in Belize. • Foreign Exchange Earned – Cyberparks are a great foreign exchange earner as they provide the infrastructure and human resources for international BPOs and ITES to operate in the country. For example, in 2010, BPOs in Belize generated over US$18,000,000 in Belize and employed over 1,000 people. Beltraide asserts that with concerted GOB and other local efforts, BPOs and ITES can generate nearly US$150 Million in the next five years. • Local Bandwith and Technology Enhancements – The development of cyber parks can also spur the development of other ICT related enhancements such as greater local bandwidth and other IT related technologies not currently available locally such as VOIP. Because ICT companies in the cyberparks will be requesting greater bandwith that what is currently available in Belize (4MB), they will spur the local Telecommunications Providers to provide more bandwith which can then be made available to the local market. The same can also be said of ICT related technologies not currently available to the local market. Belize ICT National Strategy 59 MODERNIZING THE PUBLIC SECTOR USING ICT eGovernment programs will significantly improve the performance of government through the usage of ICTs, to meet the evolving needs of the people of Belize and create a safe society. This will be achieved through the implementation of key programs & initiatives including: • The Connected government program focuses on implementing the Public Sector Network (GOBNet). GOBNet will be a single, holistic backbone infrastructure for the whole of the GOB public sector. It will connect the existing networks to enhance standardization, security, and data sharing as well as enhancing more effective communication and realize cost savings. It will also replace the existing approach where each GOB ministry or department designs, develops, installs and maintains its own network – an approach which has led to fragmented and more expensive service delivery. As well as reducing operating costs and complexity, GOBNet opens up new opportunities for information sharing and increasing local and national participation. • The GOB Information management program will enable effective and efficient management of government information and business continuity. The focus of this program will be the development of a national data center infrastructure for GOB. This approach will rationalize the various data storage/server rooms across government to provide more effective & efficient information management and the delivery of information based services to Belizeans. The building of a National ICT Centre by the Ministry of the Public Service and financed by the Government of Taiwan, whilst an excellent development for Belize, seems to be at this time an initiative in isolation. There is no doubt that, if properly planned, the new National ICT Centre can act as the Central Data Centre for GOB with appropriate robust facilities to assure (i) consolidation of ad hoc hardware; (ii) streamlined utilization of hardware; (iii) greater levels of security; (iv) greater levels of resilience; (v) better utilization of technical resources and rationalization of such resources to the optimum level; (vi) reduction of the Total Cost of Ownership by ensuring that facilities are not replicated unnecessarily. • The Government Software Warehouse (GOBApps) program will focus on the coordinated development and acquisition of computer applications to Belize ICT National Strategy 60 be used across GOB ministries, departments and agencies. These include (to cite a few): • An enterprise-level Human Resources system; • A unified electronic mail system, including collaborative tools such as calendar, documents sharing, and instant messaging; • Financial Information systems • The integrated development of a National Security system including the Judiciary, Prisons, Immigration, Police Department, Belize Defense Force, Coast Guard, and Customs Department; • The National Health Information system; • Geo-Spatial Data Management; • Data warehouse and analytical tools for easy access to economic indicator; • A comprehensive School Management system • A secure and effective Vital Registration System that has country-wide reach; • e- learning systems and distance education systems • The Government information & services online program will make available all appropriate government information through channels that are easy to access by citizens. Government information and services will be delivered electronically through multiple channels including the eGovernment Portal, Government information and services kiosks’ and the Government information & services hotline. Government information and services will also be delivered through the Community Access Center initiative and the Mobile ICT Classroom initiatives identified above. • The eGovernment Interoperability & open standards program will establish GOB’s e-Government Interoperability Framework (e-GIF) that sets out the government’s technical policies and specifications for achieving interoperability and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems coherence across the public sector. The e-GIF defines the essential prerequisites for joined-up and web- enabled government. It is a cornerstone policy in the overall e- Government strategy. The main thrust of the e-GIF is to adopt standardized specifications for all government systems, and establishing and implementing metadata across the public sector so that as the GOB becomes connected and government information and services become available online citizens can find government information and resources Belize ICT National Strategy 61 more easily. The e-GIF initiative focuses on developing the necessary policy and also providing the support, best practice guidance, toolkits and centrally agreed schemas to Ministries and government agencies to subscribe to the e-GIF and make the transition to the policy requirements. In addition, the program will outline the requisite ISO standards applicable to ICT in e- government. • The ICT Governance & Continuity program will establish the GOB Department of Information and Communication Technology that is led by a Chief Information Technology Officer/CEO whose function is to provide leadership on all GOB ICT related issues and to strengthen the governance mechanisms for coordination and decision-making. This will be discussed further in the governance model. The creation of a government information and communication department including the Chief Information Technology Officer (CITO/CEO) function, combined with the other eGovernment programs and initiatives, will make GOB a leader in government use of ICT, and will enable it to further drive substantial improvements in service delivery and transformational change for the nation as a whole. • The eProcurement program will enable efficient and effective procurement of ICT products and services to achieve more targeted ICT investment and maximizing the value that the GOB receives from expenditure on ICT products and services given the complexity of the ICT environment and the speed of technological change. The initiatives under this program will establish the necessary policy, financing mechanisms and technological infrastructure to Plan, organize, and coordinate a strategic and common ICT procurement function including supply arrangements.

In the past, monopoly operators had to assume the costs of meeting the country’s universal access objectives. These operators had to finance the delivery of essential telephone services to uneconomic regions mainly through cross subsidies, which flowed from profitable market segments (e.g. international, long- distance, business users, urban) to less profitable market segments (e.g. domestic, local, residential users, rural). While cross-subsidies served their purpose in monopoly environments, they create problems in newly competitive environments. In particular, cross- subsidies have been known to distort market signals and place an unfair burden on certain operators. To finance their access objectives in a competitively neutral and transparent manner, an increasing number of countries are now turning to universal access funds. UNIVERSAL ACCESS FUND FEATURES Universal access funds receive finance from various sources and provide targeted subsidies to encourage the provision of telecommunications services by private operators in otherwise uneconomic regions. These funds can be distinguished on the basis of three key features: 1. Sources for funding. Universal access funds can be distinguished by their sources for funding. Depending on the country and its particular situation, the sources for funding have included national budgets of governments, charges on interconnecting services, levies on subscribers (e.g. on access lines) and levies on operator revenues. Funding from international development agencies is also an option. Universal access funds today tend to collect their revenues from government sources or operator levies on a widely based range of telecommunications services (as opposed to only from specific “high margin services”, like international long- distance). Broad based revenue collection mechanisms are favored Belize ICT National Strategy 66 because they have less of a price distorting effect on the marketplace. 2. Fund management. Universal access funds can differ in their management. While some funds (e.g. Colombia) are administered by government ministries, other funds are administered by the regulators (e.g. Peru, Chile) or special agencies (e.g. South Africa). The common perception is that funds administered by independent regulators and agencies are less likely to be influenced by government or political interest. 3. Type of services. Thirdly, universal access funds can also be distinguished by the types of services they support. Developing country funds in the past have placed greater emphasis on ensuring basic public access (i.e. voice-grade fixed access to the public telecommunications network). With the growing importance of the Internet to national economies, however, many of today’s newer funds also support public access to value- added services, including Internet access. In Chile, the government has redefined its fund, which has been successful in extending basic telecommunications to rural and low- income areas, to support telecenter projects. The Fund is expected to soon launch a national telecenters program. The initial phase will be a pilot project involving the development of five self- sustaining community telecenters in various lower income urban and rural areas of Chile. An initial target is to install telecenters in each of about 90 municipal headquarters towns with over 8,000 rural inhabitants. The following table provides a brief summary of some of the telecommunications funds that are either planned or have been implemented in developing countries and emerging markets.

It is estimated that over $1.5 Million per year can be raised from this levy. As well, this figure will be used as counterpart funding to secure grants from international partners to assist in funding of special projects. Belize ICT National Strategy 68 NATIONAL ICT STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH Implementation of the National ICT Strategy is outlined as a planned and collaborative approach. Public/Private partnerships will be pursued as the modus operandi of strategy implementation. The role of the international development and funding communities will also be actively promoted, particularly in terms of the transfer of information, benchmarking and keeping abreast of developments in the sector. GOB will encourage the private sector, civil society and international development agencies working in Belize to partner with government in building out infrastructure, in developing Belize’s human resources, in providing jobs and in taking on development activities related to the ICT strategy for the socio-economic development of the country. Integral to the implementation process will be: • GOB’s leadership (along with the private sector, foreign investors and its international partners) and the commitment of resources; • Smart partnerships with key sectors from private sector, civil society, foreign investors and the international development agencies; • The involvement of all stakeholders in the execution and the continuing development of the action plan to accompany this National ICT Strategy; • Rigorous pursuit of outcomes outlined within the Strategy. The National ICT Strategy will also seek to attract local and foreign investors and development grants through various investment packages and incentives, sufficient workspace with supporting technology infrastructure, as well as a pool of trained workers and professional staff. Potential investors and development agencies will be aggressively targeted through a focused promotional strategy. Belize ICT National Strategy 69 PROPOSED ICT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE The Proposed ICT Governance Structure is presented in Figure 14 below. The guiding policy- making body for the governance structure would be the Cabinet acting though a Cabinet ICT Committee. This Committee would be chaired by the Minister of the Public Service and would be comprised of the following members: • The Minister of the Public Service – Chairperson • The CEO in the Prime Minister’s Office – Vice Chair • The CEO in the Ministry of Finance • The CEO in the Ministry of Economic Development • The CEO in the Ministry of the Public Service • The CEO in the Ministry of Labor • The CEO in the Ministry of Health • The CEO in the Ministry of Education • The Director of Beltraide • The ICT Chief Information Technology Officer • The Private Sector Advisors specializing in different areas of ICT, Strategic Planning and Business Transformation Figure 14 Proposed ICT Governance Structure Cabinet Minister of the Public Service with reponsibilities for ICT Chief Information Officer (CIO) CIO's Council GOB Senior ICT Private Sector International Partners Civil Society eProcurement & Resources Mobilization Unit Staff ManPower Development Unit Staff e-Government (GOVApps) Unit Staff Government Operation Center (GOVNet) Unit Staff National Programs Unit Staff Cabinet National ICT Committee Minister of Public Service, CEO Office of the Prime Minister, CEO Ministry of Finance, CEO Ministry of Economic Development, CEO Ministry of Education, CEO Ministry of Labor, CEO Ministry of Health, BELTRAIDE, ICT Advisors (Private Sector) Chair, Minister of the Public Service Belize ICT National Strategy 70 This Cabinet ICT Committee would be the chief policy-making body for implementing the ICT National Strategy. It will be tasked with the following: • Setting collaborative strategies and achieving cooperation across ministries and agencies in order to transform government processes and deliver more integrated services; • Facilitating a “big picture” approach to ICT issues with agencies responsible for individual ICT arrangements; • Encouraging a cooperative approach to decision on standards, investment, security, privacy, shared infrastructure, and reuse of intellectual property; and, • Ensuring that decisions reflect the impact and benefits across government, rather than on individual agencies alone. A centralized GOB ICT Department will be created under the direction of a Chief Information Technology Officer. The Chief Information Technology Officer’s function should include: • Authority for driving the change agenda – The CITO should be at the Chief Executive Officer level and should also be a full member of the CEO Caucus responsible for providing executive steerage of the national ICT agenda; • A mandate to provide independent and authoritative advice for major ICT investments – The CITO should provide expert input into all ICT-related bids and ensure all major ICT investments are consistent with agreed strategic priorities and architecture standards; • Strong mechanisms for GOB collaboration and decision-making – Management of the GOB ICT agenda should be directed through the Cabinet ICT Committee of which the Minister of the Public Service should chair. In addition, peer assessments between GOB CEOs and Ministry/Department ICT managers and administrators should be introduced to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of collaboration arrangements. The CITO will also work along with a CITO Council comprised of senior GOB ICT Directors, and key ICT private sector, academic institutions, civil society and international development partners who provide advice and guidance on the implementation of the national ICT Strategy; • The CITO should have an office equipped with individuals capable of focusing on ICT strategy, policy and architecture as well as an officer with grant writing/resource mobilization skills to secure funding for GOB ICT Belize ICT National Strategy 71 related initiatives. The CITO office should focus on GOB ICT management and provide the necessary strategy, policy and architecture capabilities to drive the standardization agenda. The ICT Department will be charged with implementing the National ICT Strategy under the direction of the ICT Cabinet Committee chaired by the Minister of the Public Service. It will also work in tandem with a Chief Information Officer’s Council comprised of GOB senior ICT officers, and private sector, civil society, academic institutions and international development partners. This Council will work with the Chief Information Technology Officer and his/her units to: • Co-develop an Action Plan designed to implement the National ICT Strategy including program ownership, resourcing and prioritization; • Advise on the progress of the implementation of the ICT Action Plan; • Discuss policies and standards proposed by the Department and advise on implementation of agreed upon policies and standards; • Raise and discuss ICT issues with cross government and national impact, as well as advising on the agenda for the ICT Department’s policy making; • Advising on resource mobilization efforts by the Department. The new GOB ICT Department’s core business activities consist of five units: • National Programs Unit • The Government ICT Service Center: Government Ops Center and Technology Unit • E-Government (GOV/Apps) Unit; • Manpower Development Unit; • e-Procurement and Financing Unit. THE NATIONAL PROGRAM UNIT The National Program Unit will coordinate national level projects with other implementing agencies such as the implementation of cyberparks and telecenters in Belize. This unit will work with agencies such as Beltrade, the private sector, civil society and international development partners to initiate national programs designed to increase jobs and internet access for enhanced democratic governance, particularly to rural areas of the country. THE GOVERNMENT OPS CENTER UNIT The Government Ops Center will consist of multiple facilities designed to provide services to government entities. These services can be divided into two main categories: Belize ICT National Strategy 72 Network Services - The Secure Government Network (SGN) is a government-wide network providing a controlled, secure and high-throughput service. All government entities will be connected to this service and SGN is the sole provider of connectivity between government departments. To manage the SGN, the ICT Department will operate a Network Government Ops Center (NOC) that closely monitors network performance and bandwidth utilization. Connectivity to the Internet is via the SGN. In order to meet the required security standards and achieve economy of scale benefits, connection via SGN is the sole source of Internet connectivity for government entities. Data Center Services - Data centers are constructed specifically for large-scale data storage and information technology processing needed to operate government IT applications, email services and Web sites. They are designed to minimize hazards from electrical power failure, fire, water damage, acts of nature, and unauthorized access. Data is backed up regularly and the data center is provided with a mirrored fail-over facility that is able to take control of the government systems in the event of a disaster. The secure data centers are provided with high speed, dual connectivity communications links to the SGN, Internet, and fail-over facility. The Objectives of the Government Ops Center are: • To reduce costs by leveraging a common infrastructure across multiple applications and data content. This will drive down the need for infrastructure to support individual applications. This will in turn drive down the cost to deliver these capabilities; • To increase quality of service. A single release-management infrastructure, with a common set of processes, procedures and tools, creates a more stable environment. • To consolidate resources and skill sets. Concentrating the required competencies in one team, will reduce the cost of hiring, training and keeping scarce qualified IT staff; • To enhance security. Using a shared infrastructure with common procedures across the applications and associated data will provide the ability to maintain a single government security policy; • To decrease time to market by enabling government entities to introduce their information and services to their users in a faster manner, making use of the already existing services offered by the Government Ops Center. Belize ICT National Strategy 73 • To increase compatibility. The use of common platforms, procedures and tools makes integration of new applications easier and also provides excellent scalability. THE E-GOVERNMENT UNIT The objectives of the e-Government Unit are summarized as follows • Reduce the costs of government and associated business transactions by streamlining government processes and procedures; • Increase the effectiveness of government in dealing with interactions with citizens and businesses. The main concept of e-Government is to view government as a supplier of services and citizens/businesses as customers wanting to use those services. This involves a fundamental change in the culture and operating practices of government and the perception of government by both citizens and businesses. In line with the above this department consists of two focus areas: 1. Services and processes 2. Infrastructure The key functions of the e-Government unit are: • Business processes redesign (BPR) of Government • Services development defining which services are to be offered through e- Government and developing and launching these services • Content Management including standards, forms, languages, look and feel, use of logos etc.; this also includes content management for the National Information System. • Infrastructure - The following infrastructure building blocks are defined for e-Government services: 1. Access layer (PC’s, mobile devices, internet kiosk) 2. Gateway layer (data conversion, messaging, transaction engine and workflow, authentication, Portal etc.) 3. Shared services layer: the Secure Government Network (SGN) THE MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT UNIT One of the most significant objectives the National ICT Strategy is to use ICT as a major contributor to the social and economic development of Belize. To accelerate the use of ICT the new ICT Department must act fast in implementing ICT development programs for its Belizeans and Belizean businesses. The ICT Belize ICT National Strategy 74 Department must be used as a catalyst and accelerator towards this end. The underlying objectives of the Manpower Development Unit are threefold: 1. Developing the skills of the nation (citizens and businesses) through programs using ICT and/ or teaching ICT; 2. Developing the ICT skills of government employees; 3. Developing and continuously improving the skills of the ICT Department staff The Manpower Development Unit will actively focus on the latter two objectives. In addition it will support the various National Programs in achieving the first objective. This department will not employ actual trainers but will set up training programs based on the various needs and job requirements within government; the actual training will be done by private sector companies. THE E-PROCUREMENT AND FINANCING UNIT The objectives of the e-Procurement and Financing Unit are fourfold: 1. Advise GOB on large ICT procurement contracts from a technical and financial perspective; 2. Develop and recommend e- Procurement policies and procedures to GOB; 3. Work with international development partners, investors and the local private sector to maximize resource mobilization for the implementation of the strategy; 4. Develop guidelines for and manage the Universal Access Fund. Finally, key elements of the GOB ICT governance model should be mirrored in ministries and departments. In particular, ministries, departments and external agencies should ensure their internal governance arrangements support the more coordinated GOB approach to ICT. They need to establish effective mechanisms to align business and ICT strategies and plans, and to establish ministries/department positions in relation to GOB wide ICT related issues. Belize ICT National Strategy 75 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS The following must be in place (critical success factors) for the National ICT Strategy to be successful: • Senior Government sponsorship at the CEO and Ministerial level; • Viewed and positioned as a National Development Initiative – not only as a Government IT Initiative; • Broad national engagement involving government, industry, academia, NGO’s and civil society; • Understanding that Education and HR Development (with a special focus on Youth) are as much the keys to sustainable ICT development and growth as ICT infrastructure; • Telecommunications affordability and maximum available bandwidth; • Identifying true breakthrough opportunities in the e-Marketplace in Belize; • e-Government as a catalyst – “early adopter, model user”; • A solid governance structure led by expert stakeholders from government, civil society and the private sector.

Through the implementation of this   National Information and Communications   Technology Strategy’s (National ICT   Strategy) programs we will accelerate the   creation of a more prosperous future for   all Belizeans.    ICTs have transformed the world, and the   lives of millions in every faucet of life all   around the world. The way we   communicate, interact, learn, do business,   take care of our health, socialize and care   for each other are all influenced by ICT. In   so many dimensions the transformation   enabled by ICTs have been breathtaking.   Belize deserves and demands nothing   less. This National ICT Strategy outlines   the path to accelerated development for   all Belizeans though leveraging the power   of ICTs. It places Information and   Communication Technologies at the   center of Belize’s social and economic   development as a dynamic industry sector   in itself, and in support of the   development of other sectors of Belize.   ICT can be of enormous benefit to the   socio-economic development of a country   in two ways. Firstly, it can be used as a   productive sector in and of itself, mainly for   the creation of jobs and the addition of   knowledge-based exports. The sectoral   approach focuses on developing a country’s   economy by using ICT as a production sector;   hence, in short term the human resources as   inputs and markets to absorb the outputs are   required for success. Both of these are   addressed through numerous strategies for   industry promotion, incentives for investors,   training and development of human   resources etc. The output of such efforts   would be the creation of at least 5,000 new   jobs via the development of cyberparks and   research and technology centers that will also   harness new technologies that could spin off   into other productive sectors as well. Belize   has already attracted more than 1,000 new   jobs in this sector with very little proactive   assistance and incentives to this industry.    Secondly, ICT can also be of enormous   benefit to the socio-economic development of   a country as an enabler of such development.    This approach focuses on the long term goals   and objectives of the country which obviously   should lead to an more economically   prosperous Belize. Here the country needs to   take up the challenge of raising, feeding,   educating and providing economic   opportunity for all of its population; thereby     Belize ICT National Strategy 5     satisfying the 18 targets set out under the   eight Millennium Development Goals. The   targets set out by Horizon 2030 are also   clearly in line with this Strategy. In order   for this to be realized, many cross-cutting   strategies across various sectors are   devised keeping in view ICT as a means   for improving the efficiency of planning,   executing and monitoring of the projects   for that sector. This enabling approach   occurs when ICT is diffused into masses at   all levels enabling maximization of   benefits and welfare. In Belize’s case the   sectoral approach should be combined   with the diffusion or enabler approach to   maximize benefits of economic growth in   the short term without trading-off the   sustainability of the same in longer run.    The ICT vision and strategy should focus   on people and not just on technology. For   this to happen, it is important to develop   both the ICT vision and strategy with   people in mind and with the involvement   of these very same people.    Major outputs from utilizing both of the   above approaches include the following:   • Increasing  access – particularly to   rural areas though, for example, the   use of stationary and mobile   telecenters so that teachers in each   village can enhance their educational   qualifications on-line, rural women can   have ready access to health and   nutritional information and rural young   people can access a high school   education online;   • Enhancing Education – by creating   attractive multimedia based curricula and   pedagogy and developing distance   education modalities;    • Enhancing efficient production and   business processes – by developing e-  commerce activities, particularly for Small   and Medium Enterprises and for Micro-  enterprises;   • Modernizing the delivery of public   services – by putting more public services   online, increasing revenue collection, and   increasing efficiency though the shared   delivery of public services;   • Reliability of data collected and   disseminated in all sectors for better   planning – by promoting the creation of a   national statistical information   management system promoting better   sharing and validation of data being   produced by governmental and civil   society agencies according to   internationally acceptable standards;   • Job creation in the ICT sector – by the   creating at least 5,000 new jobs in the   ICT industry through the creation of   cyberparks and technology centers.     This strategy has been developed through   wide consultation with and participation of   the public and private sector, academia, civil     Belize ICT National Strategy 6     society representatives, and NGO’s in   Belize (see Appendix A for the list of   participants). It builds on the successes   from across Belize and other countries in   leveraging ICTs for national development.   Significant gains are currently being made   by public and private sector organizations,   academia and civil society in utilizing ICT   for improved effectiveness and   efficiencies. However the need to   accelerate development in all areas has   never been more urgent than now as   Belize faces challenges and opportunities   of increased global competition, the need   for economic diversification, rapidly   evolving citizens’ needs, ever increasing   demands on health, education and   security services and the threat of increasing   competition at a blinding rate to our   businesses.   Driven by the overall national development   outcomes identified in Horizon 2030, the   National ICT Strategy identifies the National   ICT Outcomes needed for accelerated   development, the two major Goals that will be   focused on, the six strategic Imperatives that   must be addressed and the six major   Programs and twenty eight   Initiatives/Projects recommended for   implementation that will be executed over the   five year period of the Strategy. A snapshot of   the interconnected components of the   strategy is presented in Figure 1:      Figure 1 – Interconnected Components of the Strategy        Belize ICT National Strategy 7     The National ICT Strategy presents a   Vision that focuses on Accelerated   development and improved quality of life   for all Belizeans through universal access   and widespread usage of Information and   Communication Technology.   Accelerated development that is   empowered by ICTs will become a reality   by putting Information and   Communication Technologies (ICT) at the   center of Belize’s social and economic   development as a dynamic industry sector   in itself (as a sector), and in support of the   development of other sectors of the   economy (as an enabler) in order to   foster, accelerate and sustain long-term   social, cultural and economic   development of the country.    This is the Mission of the National ICT   strategy. It will be executed through a   collaborative and participative approach   that involves the Government of Belize   (GOB), along with the private sector, civil   society and international development   partners.  Together, though a leadership   driven governance approach, the national   ICT strategy will be aggressively   implemented.   The National ICT Strategy envisions that   accelerating national development will be   empowered by pursuing two major goals.   Firstly Universal Access to ICTs, ensuring   ICT accessibility, acceptance and usability   by anyone, anywhere, at anytime, and   through any media and device, and secondly   Widespread ICT usage in every aspect of   national development including security &   crime reduction, improving health care,   improving the effectiveness and efficiency of   Government, developing competitive   businesses and building new industries.    The achievement of these goals will come   about by addressing six major Objectives over   the next five years. These objectives are the   heart of the strategy:   • Open ICT – Creating a vibrant,   competitive and open telecommunication   industry that enables the availability and   accessibility of quality and affordable   telecommunication  services to   consumers and fostering social and   economic benefits to the country;   • ICT In Education -  Infusing all aspects of   the education systems with ICTs for   improved delivery and learning, and   improved access to education by all;   • ICT in E-Commerce – Creating a well   developed ICT services sector and driving   the adoption and usage of ICT in all   dimensions of business operations to   create competitive advantage at the   business and country levels;   • eInclusion – Bringing the benefit of ICTs   into all segments of the population,   including people who are disadvantaged   due to education, age, gender, income,     Belize ICT National Strategy 8     disabilities,ethnicity, and/or those   living in remote regions;   • Job Creation through local ICT Industry   Development – Creating at least   5,000 new jobs through the   development of the local ICT Industry;   • Acclerating eGovernment -   Significantly improve the performance   of government  through the usage of   ICTs, to meet the evolving needs of the   people of Belize and create a safe   society.    Each major objective consists of key   Programs and Projects (Initiatives) that will be   implemented with relentless passion.  The six   key Programs are identified below with   details of the Projects/Initiatives in the body   of the strategy.   OBJECTIVE PROGRAMS   Open ICT Enhancing and Harmonizing the National  Telecommunication Infrastructure   ICT in Education Developing ICT in Education   ICT for e-Commerce Developing ICT for e-Commerce   e-Inclusion Connect Belize: Bridging the Digital Divide    Job Creation Through Local ICT  Industry   Creating Jobs Through the Development of the Local  ICT Industry   Acclerating eGovernment Modernizing the Public Sector Using ICT      Implementation of the National ICT   Strategy is outlined as a planned and   collaborative approach. Public/Private   partnerships will be pursued as the modus   operandi of strategy implementation. The   role of the international development and   funding communities will also be actively   promoted, particularly in terms of the   transfer of information, benchmarking and   keeping abreast of developments in the   sector.    GOB will encourage the private sector, civil   society and international development   agencies working in Belize to partner with   government in building out infrastructure, in   developing Belize’s human resources, in   providing jobs and in taking on development   activities. Integral to the implementation   process will be:   • GOB’s leadership and (along with the   private sector, foreign investors and its   international partners) the commitment   of resources;   • Smart partnerships with key sectors from   private sector, civil society, foreign   investors and the international   development agencies;     Belize ICT National Strategy 9     • The involvement of all stakeholders in   the execution and the continuing   development of the action plan to   accompany this National ICT Strategy;   • Rigorous pursuit of outcomes outlined   within the Strategy.   The National ICT Strategy will also seek to   attract local and foreign investors and   development grants through various   investment packages and incentives,   sufficient workspace with supporting   technology infrastructure, as well as a   pool of trained workers and professional   staff. Potential investors and development   agencies will be aggressively targeted   through a focused promotional strategy.   A centralized GOB ICT Department will be   created under the direction of a Chief   Technology Officer.  It will be charged with   implementing the ICT Strategy under the   direction of an ICT Cabinet Committee   chaired by the Minister of the Public Service   or his designee and comprised of GOB,   private sector, civil society and international   partners. The Department also expects to be   able to finance the ICT Strategy through the   creation of a Universal Access Fund financed   through a levy on the telecommunications   and cable company sectors to meet the goals   of increased ICT access and usage, which in   turn will increase revenues to these sectors.    Today Belize makes a quantum leap.  The   future is within reach, and through strong   leadership and the pursuit of the goals and   objectives identified, the vision of accelerated   development and the improved quality of life   for all can become reality.                              Belize ICT National Strategy 10     AN INTRODUCTION TO BELIZE   GEOGRAPHICAL AND POPULATION DISTRIBUTION   Located on the Caribbean coast of Central   America, Belize combines both Caribbean   and Latin characteristics.  The country is   located at 17°15' north of the equator and   88°45' west of the Prime Meridian on the   Yucatán Peninsula. It borders the Caribbean   Sea to the east, with 386 km of coastline. It   has a total of 516 km of land borders—  Mexico to the north-northwest (250 km) and   Guatemala to the south-southwest   (266 km). Belize's total size is 22,960 km²,   of which 22,800 km² is land and 160 km²   is water.  This makes the country about   twice the size of Jamaica, about half the   size of Nova Scotia, slightly larger than   Wales, and slightly smaller than the U.S.   state of Massachusetts.    The western border consists of lowland   forest, highland plateau and the Maya   mountains in the south. Most rivers rise in   the west of the country and flow eastwards   to the sea through low-lying, often swampy,   coastal plains. About 60% of the country is   covered by forest containing an abundance   of fauna and flora. Larger scale agriculture,   involving bananas, citrus and sugar cane, is   concentrated in the low-lying areas.   Elsewhere, most cultivation is small-scale   and largely for subsistence. The Mayan   population and rural Guatemalan migrants   employ variations of slash-and-burn shifting   forms of cultivation.      Belize ICT National Strategy 11     Figure 2 – Political/Administrative Map of Belize      Source: http://www.ezilon.com/maps/north-america/belize- maps.html   Administratively, Belize is split into   six districts (see Figure 2), which,   from north to south, are Corozal,   Orange Walk, Belize, Cayo, Stann   Creek and Toledo . The northernmost   district, Corozal (with a population of   40,354 according to the 2010   census), has a common border with   Mexico and is predominantly Mestizo   and Spanish-speaking. The main   economic activities are the   cultivation of sugar cane and the   Corozal Free Zone (CFZ) on the   border with Mexico.    Orange Walk (with a population of   45,419), immediately to the south is   based around the town of the same   name. Its economy is also dominated   by sugar cane, although small scale   agriculture prevails in the western   areas and potatoes, onions and soy   beans are grown for sale. Orange   Walk contains several Mayan   cultural sites, and like Corozal, it is   predominantly Mestizo and Spanish-  speaking.   Belize district (with a total population   of 89,247 according to the 2010   Census) is dominated by the city of   Belize which contains around 17.1%   (or about 53,352 inhabitants   according to the 2010 Census) of   the country’s population. Satellite settlements   extend outward along the main roads but the district   also contains several rural villages along the Belize   River. The topography is almost entirely low-lying and   often swampy. It has a major Mayan site at Altun Ha   but the main tourist attractions are the Cayes.    Ambergris Caye, the largest of the Cayes, has as its   capital the town of San Pedro, which is developing   rapidly as one of Belize’s largest urban centers (with   a population of 11,510 according to the 2010   Census). Two thirds of the country’s Creole   (Belizeans who are predominantly of African   descent) population lives in this district.

It   contains Belmopan, the administrative capital   of the country, as well as the twin towns of San   Ignacio/ Santa Elena, and the large Mennonite   enclave at Spanish Lookout. It also hosts   several eco-tourism establishments aimed at   capitalizing on the largely unspoilt forest area   populated by a wide range of plant, animal and   bird species, and proximity to several important   old Mayan sites, including Tikal across the   border in Guatemala. The main road to   Guatemala crosses this district at Benque Viejo   del Carmen.   Stann Creek District (with a population of   31,166 according to the 2010 Census), located   further south along the coastline,   includes the developing tourist   settlement of Placencia, several Garifuna   villages, notably Hopkins, as well as the   larger town of Dangriga. The population is   split approximately equally between the   Creoles, Garifuna and Mestizo. It is the   country’s major producer of bananas and   citrus fruits, mostly cultivated in large   plantations. Several shrimp processing   enterprises have been established in the   coastal parts of the district.   Finally, Toledo, the southernmost district   (with a population of 30,538 according to   the 2010 Census), is the centre of   Belize’s Mayan population as well as the   most rural of the districts. Villages here   tend to be smaller and more dispersed   than in the rest of the country, where   many are located along the major roads.   There are small concentrations of   Garifuna and East Indians with the former   mostly found in coastal villages. It   produces significant proportions of the   country’s rice, corn and peas, almost   entirely from small holdings. In the last   few years, cacao production has   increased substantially. Traditionally,   Toledo has been the poorest and most   rural district in the country, partly due to   its peripheral location relative to the rest   of the country’s administrative,   commercial and tourist centers.

The Net revolution   has ushered in enormous possibilities for   leveraging technology not only to enhance   productivity and efficiency but also to develop   innovative business models and strategies in   every sector and to develop community   participation and empowerment thereby   increasing democratic governance. Countries   all over the world are using ICT applications to   increase efficiency, accountability, enhance   transparency and increase revenue collection   as well as to reduce poverty by enhancing   their productive and e-commerce centers.    A National ICT Strategy is a vision for a country   where information and communication   technology is not a mere information and   communication tool but a primary vehicle for   enhancing education and health care, improve   service delivery, refine policy formulation and   implementation, empower citizens, and   increase business opportunities for the private   sector.    The catalyst for many countries that have   been very successful at doing this, such as   Singapore and South Korea, is the   development of a national ICT strategy with   this vision at its core.  In South Korea, for   example, a comprehensive ICT strategy has   been a key driver in the miracle rebound of its   economy from the financial crisis of the late   80s; the ICT industry’s contribution to GDP   growth rose from a mere 4.5% in 1990 to an   astounding 50.5% in 2000.   Countries such as Singapore and South   Korea, as well as Barbados and Costa Rica to   a large extent in our region, have also realized     Belize ICT National Strategy 17     that for the National ICT Strategy to be   successful, it must be incorporated into the   overall development strategy of the country.  It   should assess the prospects and options for   promoting the ICT industry, for using ICT in key   sectors of the economy, and for empowering   and networking all stakeholders involved in   national development and democratic   governance initiatives.  It should also   systematically address how to use ICT as an   enabling tool, in combination with other   instruments, to address the two overarching   goals of national development in developing   countries such as Belize:   (1) sustainable economic growth - driven   by participating in a highly dynamic global   industry and by diffusing ICT to enhance   broad based, economy wide   competitiveness;   (2) poverty reduction - facilitated by   broad-based economic and social growth,   accelerated human development and   nationwide empowerment.     Sustainable Economic growth is achieved   though enhancing competitiveness and   growth across broad sectors of the economy.   ICT can be used to achieve this in two ways:    1. Developing the local ICT industry - the   local ICT industry, and particularly, the newly   enabled services such as Business Processing   Outsourcing (BPOs), presents major   opportunities for job creation and participation   in e-commerce by many developing countries.    The decline in the cost of telecommunications   and access to the Internet worldwide have   given rise to the globalization of business-  support services and the outsourcing of back-  office work to developing countries like India   and the Philippines. Over 50 nations currently   export software and ICT-enabled services.  In   Kenya, for example, Naushad Trading   Company which sells local wood carvings,   baskets and pottery, grew from US$ 10, 000   to over US$ 2 million in the two years since it   went online.    2. Using ICT across the board - A second   major thrust for competitiveness and broad   economic growth is to use ICT in the most   critical industries and services of the country,   promote ICT diffusion among micro, small   and medium enterprises (typical of most   industries in developing countries such as   Belize) to make them more efficient and   effective, and deploy ICT for modernizing   government-to-business transactions.    Although it is up to the private sector to   take the lead in such use, governments   can influence and accelerate this process   through various means, including   establishing the necessary laws and   regulations for e-commerce, and   providing incentives for   investments that would alter   managerial practices and   strengthen supply chains.    Perhaps most promising for     Belize ICT National Strategy 18     competitiveness is the use of ICT in   government in support of business-to-  government transactions.    By one estimate, business in developing   countries spend about 20% of their revenues   on transactions with governments, including   accessing information and forms, applying for   permits, and submitting taxes.  An effective   and transparent government is a critical   ingredient in a competitive business climate   and an attractive investment environment.  A   recent pilot to modernize tax administration in   Russia (assisted with World Bank financing)   has introduced ICT-enabled transformation in   the administration’s interactions with   businesses and citizens, eliminated the long   lines for tax submissions, drastically cut all   kinds of transaction costs, closed   opportunities for corruption, and at the same   time, raised the badly needed tax revenues.     The second overarching national goal in many   developing countries such as Belize is   reducing poverty and accelerating human   development.  ICT could support poverty   reduction strategies by informing policy   making, delivering effective health and   education services, facilitating citizen to   government transactions and public sector   reforms, and promoting participation and   accountability. Recent emphases on poverty   analysis and on mainstreaming results-  oriented development programs have   reinforced the need for relevant, reliable and   timely information for policy formulation and   program implementation and adaptation.  As   suggested earlier, ICT can also be deployed to   extend access and improve quality of   education, health and other social services.   The promise of improving citizen to   government transactions (C2G) has inspired   many governments to innovate one-stop,   single window services, such as Singapore’s   eCitizen, and to integrate electronic   government into their broader public sector   reforms.  Even less integrated and more   modest bottom up initiatives such as land   record computerization in Karnataka, India,   have delivered land certificates in 15 minutes,   instead of 20-30 days, and in the process,   reduced transaction costs and corruption,   created a viable land market, enhanced the   creditworthiness of farmers, and improved the   life of the common man.     A major opportunity for using ICT in poverty   reduction is to provide information and   knowledge to rural populations and to   empower local development agents to serve   the poor.  A variety of informational and   connectivity advantages     Belize ICT National Strategy 19     can accrue to the poor through improved   operational capacities of the specialized local   agencies.  One example is Chile’s electronic   rural information system which   connected farmers’ organizations,   rural municipalities, NGOs, and local   government extension agencies to the   Internet.  It was estimated that   transmitting information on prices,   markets, inputs, weather, social   services, and credit facilities cost 40%   less than using traditional methods.    Similar pilots and programs have   been applied in Mexico.  In   Maharashtra, India, a cluster of 70   villages is covered by the “wired   village” project, which is modernizing   the local cooperatives, and aiming to   provide agricultural, medical, and   educational information to the   facilitation telecenter booths in the villages.   Perhaps the area of most promise is in the   use of ICT to promote broad participation,   grassroots innovation, and social learning,   thereby increasing democratic governance.    Telecenters or community information and   communication centers can play several roles:   provide affordable public access to ICT tools   including the Internet; extend and customize   public services, including those offered   through e-government; provide access to   information in support of local economic   activities and learning opportunities; and   connect and network people.  The last   function proved to be the highest priority for   many communities who would otherwise have   remained isolated.  These centers have   enabled them to carry out local dialogue,   share practical and locally-relevant   information, and support community problem   solving.  Given the limited relevance of the   vast amount of global Internet content to   these communities, the role of these centers   in networking and creating local content   becomes all the more important.  Community   centers could also provide women with a   medium to participate as producers,   consumers-providers-users, counselors-  clients.  In South Africa, women’s   organizations are linked to various resource   web sites which aim to mobilize women   around common concerns.  Digital literacy   provide affordable public access to ICT  tools including the Internet  extend and customize public services  including those offered through e- government  provide access to information in  support of local economic activities and  learning opportunities  connect and network people    Belize ICT National Strategy 20     centers in Benin and Ghana have become an   important instrument of empowerment of low-  income communities, enhancing   employability, increasing capabilities, and   extending learning opportunities beyond those   available in educational institutions.     The world is in the midst of a revolution in   which new and evolving digital ICTs are   extending the horizon of what countries,   companies, institutions and individuals might   achieve if they work together to create rich   collaborative networks from which new   knowledge, ideas and innovations spring. By   ensuring the development of a solid national   ICT strategy, many countries can position their   economies for competitive advantage in a   global knowledge-driven technology.  Those   who understand the process can direct their   efforts towards learning the new practices and   may find a route to leaping forward and   catching up.  This will involve a great degree of   learning and understanding the impacts of ICT   on markets, organizations, competitive   strategies, innovation as well as the   implications for services, employment,   education, regional and spatial development   and poverty reduction.     Furthermore, a successful ICT strategy   requires a country’s substantial investment in   human capital, active absorption of   technology, ability to raise awareness, build   coalitions, clarify roles and responsibilities,   mobilize and complement market forces, as   well as scale up and leverage ICT.  The   ultimate focus of a national ICT strategy   should be to promote the diffusion of ICT   across the board as a General Purpose   Technology.            Belize ICT National Strategy 21     ICT STRATEGY METHODOLOGY  BELIZE’S APPROACH TO ICT STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT   The goal of the e- Belize: Accelerating   Development National ICT Strategy is to   identify how ICT and participation in the   digital economy can help the Government   of Belize reach more expeditiously its   objectives in terms of economic and social   progress and growth. It was an initiative of   the Ministry of the Public Service,   Governance Improvement, Elections and   Boundaries, and Sports (MPS) of Belize   and was spearhead by its Minister John   Salvidar and the Ministry’s Chief Executive   Officer (CEO) Charles Gibson. The   Ministry’s Governance Improvement Unit   (GIU) headed by Mrs. Freya Parham   August (with Mr. Dwight Gillette and Mr.   Antonio Madrid) was assigned the task of   identifying and working with a consulting   team to develop Belize’s National ICT   Strategy.    The consulting team of Juan Carlos Namis   and Dr. Geraldo Flowers of e-Data Ltd. of   Belize and Mr. Adam Montserin of   Odyssey Consulting of Trinidad   was identified and contracted in   early March 2011 to work   with the GIU in   developing the National Strategy. The   consulting team:   1. Developed a planning process and   initiated consultations with the MPS   Steering Committee, the Government of   Belize’s (GOB) Information and   Communication (ICT) Task Force and the   GOB’s CEO Caucus as part of the   development of the National ICT Strategy;     2. Surveyed each GOB Ministry and relevant   department via an e-Government   questionnaire in order to assess the   current state (Strengths and   Weaknesses) of GOB’s ICT development   and conducted phone interviews of all of   the secondary schools and the University   of Belize in order to assess the current   state of ICT development in Belize’s   education system.     3. Conducted 30 individual countrywide   interviews with relevant GOB Ministries,   Departments and Statutory Boards,   private sector ICT companies,   international funding agencies, and civil   society executives in order to identify ICT   related problems and opportunities   (Opportunities and Threats) related to ICT   development in Belize.      Belize ICT National Strategy 22     A Visioning workshop was conducted by   the Consulting Team in early April 2011   with key stakeholders from GOB, the   private sector and civil society to develop   the Vision, Mission and Strategic   Outcomes for the Belize National ICT   Strategy. The team also conducted a two   day Strategy Development workshop in   late April 2011 with the same key   stakeholders to develop National   Strategies designed to accomplish the   Strategic Outcomes identified in the   Visioning workshop held earlier. As well,   the team shared a draft of the Belize e-  Readiness Assessment and Benchmarking   reports produced by the team for input   and feedback from the key stakeholders   and to enlighten the Strategy   Development process.   The first draft of the National ICT Strategy   was presented to the MPS and GOB’s ICT   Task Force in the middle of May 2011. A   presentation of the findings and   recommendations from the National ICT   Strategy was also presented to GOB’s CEO   Caucus in the third week of May 2011 for   input and feedback. As well, a Cabinet Paper   based on the findings and recommendations   from the National ICT Strategy was prepared   and presented by Minister John Saldivar to   GOB’s Executive Cabinet and to the Prime   Minister for endorsement and approval.  An   official Launch of the National Strategy was   then conducted to kick off the   implementation of the Strategy.            Belize ICT National Strategy 23     THE CURRENT STATE – ICT IN  BELIZE 2011  E-READINESS DEFINED   e-Readiness is the degree to which a   country is prepared to participate in the   networked world. According to the “e-  Readiness Guide: How to Develop and   Implement a National e- readiness Action   Plan” e-Readiness is generally defined as   the degree to which a country is prepared   to participate in the digital economy with   the underlying concept that the digital   economy can help to build a better society.   Regardless of a country’s level of   development, e-Readiness is assessed by   determining the relative standing of its   society and its economy in the areas that are   most critical for its participation to the   networked world.1    According to the Economist Intelligence Unit,   e-Readiness is not simply a matter of the   number of computer servers, websites and   mobile phones in the country, but also things   such as its citizen’s ability to utilize   technology skillfully, the transparency of its   business and legal systems, and the extent to   which governments encourage the use of   digital technologies. 2  When a country does   more online—or, as is increasingly the case,   wirelessly—the premise is that its economy   can become a more transparent and efficient   one.                                                          1 GeoSINC International (April 2002).  e-Readiness  Guide: How to Develop and Implement a National  e- readiness Action Plan.   2 Economist Intelligence Unit (2005).

As stated above, e-  Readiness is the degree to which a   community is prepared to participate in   the global information society, and is   gauged by assessing areas that are most   critical to the adoption of Information and   Communication Technology (ICT).   Belize’s e-Readiness assessment provided   a current snapshot of the country’s ICT   capacity in several different areas   including:   • Industry and Finance   • Government   • Human Resources   • Infrastructure   • Legal and Regulatory   The framework for this analysis was   adapted from the “Readiness for the   Networked World: A Guide for Developing   Countries”, an internationally recognized   methodology published by the Center for   International Development at Harvard   University. Additional data to support the   findings and conclusions came from a   variety of sources including:   • The 2010 National Census of Belize;   • An e-government survey of all of the  Government of Belize’s (GOB)  Ministries conducted by the   consultants as part of the development of  the strategy;   • A survey of secondary schools also  conducted by the consultants as part of  the development of the strategy;   • 30 interviews with key stakeholders  conducted by the consultants as part of  the development of the strategy;    • Content analysis of all of GOB’s current  websites;   • Secondary data analysis of data provided   by the Belize 2009 Scoping Exercise   Report conducted under the auspices of   the Ministry of the Public Service by David   Gingell, a consultant from Malta.

Figure 7- District Technology Penetration by Household     Source: Belize 2010 Housing and Population Census      The above data reveals that although Belize   ranked 128 out of 184 countries according   to the United Nations e-Government survey   of 2010, the country is already an active   member of the global information society.  It   has embraced cell phone and cable TV   services to the extent that more than three   fourths of households in Belize possess a   cell phone and more half of the households   in Belize have cable TV services. The   reasons for this are two-fold:   1. Belize does possess the infrastructure   for this to be possible;   2. These services are currently being   provided competitively and at a cost   that the majority of Belizeans can   afford.         76.50%  26.40%  53%  21.60% 13.10%  0.00%  10.00%  20.00%  30.00%  40.00%  50.00%  60.00%  70.00%  80.00%  90.00%  100.00%  Mobile Phone Computer  Ownership  Cable TV Fixed Lines Internet Access  Corozal Orange Walk Belize Cayo Stann Creek Toledo Overall Penetration    Belize ICT National Strategy 26     INTERNET AFFORDABILITY IN BELIZE   On the other hand, computers and internet service, while readily available in most urban   center and some rural ones as well in Belize, is just not affordable for the average Belizean   as Figure 8 reveals.   Figure 8 – Internet Affordability (Standard Home Internet Service Plan)   High Speed Internet  Service   Monthly Charges  BZE$   % GDP Per Capita  2008 Annual Figures   (BZE$12,920)   256K $100 9%   512K $179 17%   1MB $300 28%   2MB $500 46%   4MB $850 79%   Source: Belize Telecommunication Limited      The above figure reveals that even for a   1MB of internet service, the average   Belizean would have to spend more than   ¼ of their annual income to afford it. A 4   MB household internet connection (very   common in households in the Caribbean)   would cost the average Belizean a   mortgage payment (and a high one at   that!) or more than ¾ of their annual   income. This is perhaps the reason why   only 13.1% of Belizeans have internet in   their homes.    It is a very similar story within the Belizean   business community. Although most   companies have PCs and Internet access,   very few companies (with the exception of   the major industries) have invested in   dedicated data lines or extensive office   automation. As there are only a small   number of consumers currently on-line   (and most of these are tourists), there is   still little rationale for companies to use   the Internet as a business medium (except   for the tourism industry). Most are using it   for e-mail and for a basic web presence,   i.e., static web sites. However, if the   internet rates were to decrease, many   more Belizeans would go online which   would spur the development of more e-  business in Belize.

It indicates that Belizean high schools have about one computer for every   12 students. They also have an average of about one computer lab per high school as there   are about 57 high school computer labs in the country.  Most of the high schools in Belize   are located in urban areas; therefore, most have access to the Internet.    There is recognition that the rural population is “under-served” in terms of ICT in education in   Belize.  The Ministry of Education (MOE) has strongly underlined the importance of utilizing   distributed and e-learning as an important means to overcome the current educational divide   between the cities and municipalities, on the one hand, and the villages on the other   (personal communication, Kevin Harris, 15th March 2011).  Yet the application of an e-  learning strategy to bridge the educational divide still demands the articulation of a policy   and strategy on how villages in rural areas are to be technologically supported.     The aggressive introduction of ICT for education requires not only a strong technological   backbone but also a strong pedagogical one.  ICT in education requires the appropriate skills                                                          3 Most Belizeans still get their first formal computer class at a high school and not at a primary school. Data  regarding computers in primary schools were not available at the time of the writing of this report;  however, it is widely believed that most primary schools in Belize do not have internet service or computer  labs.     Belize ICT National Strategy 29     to develop educational content – whether for traditional classroom delivery or for e- and   distributed learning.  Ideally, this should be centrally based in order to maximize scarce skills,   to ensure that content is of the appropriate quality and reflects curriculum requirements, as   well as to secure the promulgation of such content at a national level.     Moreover, the introduction of ICT Internet based facilities for schools requires a strong   security framework that ensures that children are restricted from accessing high risk and   pornographic content and that such blocking is maintained on a daily basis in order to   ensure that it gives real rather than just perceived security.  This is fundamental in order to   provide the adequate level of protection to children as well as to secure parental trust and   confidence in the provision of internet access to their children.     It is pertinent to underline that, there does not seem to be an ICT in Schools strategy that   seeks to define a cohesive and coordinated way forward.  There is no national ICT   curriculum.  In essence what this means is that schools – which are both church and state   schools - set their own curriculum for ICT.4     ICT IN THE BELIZEAN WORKFORCE   According to the 2009 Scoping Exercise Report, The   Belize Chamber of Commerce and Industry opines while   many firms have some form of Internet access, relatively   few employees have individual access. Employees that do   have their own e-mail accounts typically work for large   firms. The total number of corporate websites is unknown,   but is thought to be quite high. However, these sites are typically modest in nature, with   limited information that is not updated regularly. In terms of computer applications, some   office automation software is in use. Larger firms have some enterprise application software.   The Chamber of Commerce also opines that the use of ICTs in the workplace is also fairly   limited. Although virtually all businesses have computers and access to the internet, a   significant number of employees share computers and only a few have personal e-mail   addresses for use in the work environment.                                                            4 The Caribbean Examinations Council (CXC) does set a regional CXC Computer Science exam which  many secondary schools in Belize prepare their students for.      Belize ICT National Strategy 30     ICT IN GOVERNMENT OF BELIZE   As part of the preparation of the e-Belize –   Accelerating Development National ICT   Strategy, the consulting team undertook a   series of individual consultations with   government ministries and departments.   They also conducted a website content   analysis of the www.belize.gov.bz portal of   GOB ministries’ links. In addition, the   consulting team conducted an e-  government survey of all of GOB ministries   requesting ICT related information.    Analysis of the information indicates that,   overall, GOB has made considerable   investments in ICT to-date. Some Ministry   offices feature modern computer and   telephony equipment. They communicate   with citizens, businesses, and other   Government offices via telephone, e-mail,   and the Internet, in addition to face-to-  face. In addition, at least three Ministries   (Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Health   and Ministry of Police and Public Safety)   have installed management information   systems and several others (such as   Immigration, Foreign Affairs and Trade,   Labor and Natural Resources) are in the   process of doing so.    Computer technology now plays an   increasingly significant role at the   operational level of all GOB Ministries and   Departments.  All of the 19 Ministries and   Departments who completed the survey   have access to the internet and e-mail, most   use the Microsoft Office Suite, and at least   half of the Ministries have a functioning   website.    The introduction and use of ICT in the public   service, however, has been limited by a lack   of coordination and integration in the   planning and implementation of these   initiatives. This is due largely to the absence   of a Policy and Strategic framework which   would provide the requisite direction and   guidelines for the adoption and utilization of   ICT resources in the public sector. Given the   present level of adoption and use of   computer technology, the implementation of   this National ICT Strategy (which addresses to   a large extent ICT in Government) will bode   well for the further advancement of the   GOB’s public sector modernization agenda.    Approximately half of all GOB Ministries (8 of   the 17) have a Ministry website and thirteen   of the seventeen feature a Web site from one   of their departments.  Additionally, those who   do not have a web site do have a web link on   the new government portal   (www.belize.gov.bz).  However, government   Web sites (as well as the GOB Portal) typically   feature static government centric information   on the Ministry and its divisions, including   mandate, services offered, organizational   structure, contact information, and   “frequently asked questions”.  Based on the     Belize ICT National Strategy 31     United Nations “web measure” index of   the state of online services from a   country’s government, the information   gathered on GOB websites indicate that   GOB is currently transitioning the    “Emerging and Enhanced” stages of   online service delivery (the first two Stages   on the four Stage scale). 5   While it does not seem to be part of an   overall e-Government strategy, certain   GOB Ministries and Departments are   expanding the scope of their electronic   service delivery offerings. The Ministries of                                                          5 EMERGING PRESENCE is Stage I  representing information, which is limited and  basic. The e-government online presence  comprises a web page and /or an official website;  links to ministries/departments of education,  health, social welfare, labor and finance  may/may not exist; links to regional/local  government may/may not exist; some archived  information such as the head of states' message  or a document such as the constitution may be  available on line, most information remains  static with the fewest options for citizens.   ENHANCED PRESENCE is Stage II in which  the government provides greater public policy  and governance sources of current and archived  information, such as policies, laws and  regulation, reports, newsletters, and  downloadable databases. The user can search for  a document and there is a help feature and a site  map provided. A larger selection of public policy  documents such as an e-government strategy,  policy briefs on specific education or health  issues. Though more sophisticated, the  interaction is still primarily unidirectional with  information flowing essentially from government  to the citizen.   the Attorney General, Economic   Development, Education, Foreign Affairs,   Natural Resources (Meteorology Office),   Ministry of the Public Service, Ministry of   Tourism (Belize Tourist Board) and Ministry of   Transport and Communications (NEMO) are   offering electronic downloadable and   printable forms. The Belize National Library   Service offers an electronic library service   and the Belize Meteorology Department   offers a “two way interaction service” for   citizens requesting weather reports, which   puts their sites between Stage Two and Stage   Three  of the UN’s “Web measure model:   Stages of e-government evolution” scale. 6   There is still much to do to enable full e-  Government in Belize. Currently, basic   information is now accessible on-line.   However, ministries do not yet offer highly   valuable electronic transactions such as   benefits registration, application for training                                                          6 TRANSACTIONAL PRESENCE is Stage III that  allows two-way interaction between the citizen and  his/her government. It includes options for paying  taxes; applying for ID cards, birth  certificates/passports, license renewals and other  similar C2G interactions by allowing him/her to  submit these online 24/7. The citizens are able to  pay for relevant public services, such as motor  vehicle violation, taxes, fees for postal services  through their credit, bank or debit card. Providers of  goods and services are able to bid online for public  contacts via secure links.

Information and communication   technology, in the form of modern   computers, telephones and network   solutions, is pervasive throughout GOB.   However, the usage of electronic systems   and processes is still very minor compared   with the usage of paper-based ones.   Desktop computers may be used to   produce documents and presentations,   but it is very rare that they are used to   access vital data. Database servers   contain some client information, but more   often than not it is used as a backup for   paper files, not the central record itself.   Much is still in paper.  Although more   sophisticated information systems are   being introduced including document   management solutions, their usage is still   very limited.   There is no central secure government   network.  However, there are many   separate networks including Smart   Stream, which is a secure network run by   CITO on behalf of the Ministry of Finance   (MOF) for applications relating to   accounting, income tax, and service tax; a   network created by the Ministry of Health   to promulgate the Belize Information   Health System (BIHS) to cities and   municipalities; and a network created by   the Belize Police Force to promulgate the   Crime Reporting Information Management   System (CRIMS) also to cities and police   stations.7   There is no standard for office automation   use although, from the e-government survey   conducted, the software tool most prevalent   is Microsoft Office 2007.  It is, however,   pertinent to note, that with the exception of   users who have authorized access to Smart   Stream the general consensus is that most   installations of the Microsoft application   software is unlicensed.8   There are no data centers in Belize. The   building of a National ICT Centre by the   Ministry of the Public Service, financed by the   Government of Taiwan, whilst an excellent   development, does not yet have this role as   its mandate. There is no doubt that, if   properly planned, the new National ICT   Centre can act as a Central Data Centre with   appropriate robust facilities to assure (i)   consolidation of ad hoc hardware; (ii)   streamlined utilization of hardware; (iii)                                                          7 There is also a project underway to link the Police,  Immigration and Prison together via a common  database to provide more intelligence regarding  crime. This is being sponsored by the United States  government.    8 The Ministry of the Public Service through its  Belize National Information and Communication  Technology Center is in the process of discussions  with Microsoft Corporation for the feasibility of  purchasing a Microsoft Enterprise license for GOB,  its statutory agencies and schools.     Belize ICT National Strategy 33     greater levels of security; (iv) greater levels   of resilience; (v) better utilization of   technical resources and rationalization of   such resources to the optimum level; (vi)   reduction of the Total Cost of Ownership   by ensuring that facilities are not   replicated unnecessarily.   Furthermore, the resources assigned to   support ICT policy and operations within   the Ministry of the Public Service, as well   as the line Ministries, are limited at best.   Even a large, important Department such   as Immigration only has a staff of two IT   individuals. With the possible exception of the   Ministry of Health, most ICT Departments   seem currently understaffed.    There is no ad hoc financing for ICT within the   Government of Belize.  In essence, ICT   financing is a line vote item that is assigned   to each Ministry and Department as part of   the budgetary process.  This primarily means   that ICT is not recognized as a corporate –   horizontal – program that transcends the   Government of Belize which thus requires   dedicated financing in order to secure the   promulgation of ICT.           Belize ICT National Strategy 34     ICT IN BELIZEAN COMMERCE    Figure 12 below shows the current   licensed Business Processing Outsourcing   organizations in Belize. In 2010, these   organizations generated approximately   US$18,736,164 and approximately 1,095   jobs. The genesis for this came about in   2000 when the Government encouraged   the opening of a private e-commerce park,   opened by Datapro International Inc in the   Belize City Export Processing Zone (EPZ)   thereby guaranteeing freedom from taxes to   incoming dotcoms. The park has   successfully stimulated Belize's e-business   sector. Subsequently, EPZ were expanded   to be able to operate anywhere in the   country as long as they receive the requisite   permits from the Ministry of Economic   Development.

The   development of an information or   knowledge economy that services the US   makes strategic sense given that Belize is   in the same time zone as the US, is close   to the US, has intelligent and   knowledgeable people, and the cost of   labor is far lower than would be found in   the US.    ICT IN BELIZEAN BUSINESSES    The 2009 Scoping Exercise Report stated that   the Belize Chamber of Commerce and   Industry, whilst acknowledging that it has no   hard data on the state of the information   economy within Belize as it has yet to date to   carry out a survey on this matter, is of the   considered opinion that the use and   penetration of ICT for businesses purposes is   limited.  In this regard the Chamber believes   that use of ICT, where it has been availed of,   is primarily of electronic communications and   potential basic office applications.   The set-up of industry and business within   Belize, with the exception of a small number   of large operators such as the banks, hotel   operators, etc, are micro-enterprises.  Given   the GDP / capita and the fact that, with the   exclusion of the service industry related to   tourism, securing a web presence is not   perceived to be a productive investment   particularly given that achieving this is seen to   be prohibitively expensive.   Operations in the tourism industry are seen to   make most use of ICT – both for the   promotion of the enterprise’s service or   product or for back offices purposes.  The   Chamber is of the considered opinion (the   Belize Tourism Industry Association is a   member of the Chamber) that ICT web   presence by tourism service providers is   primarily limited to a static web presence.    The Chamber believes that there is no e-  tourism infrastructure in Belize – a matter   of concern given the actions being taken in   this regard by competitors to Belize   tourism.                 Belize ICT National Strategy 36     ICT LEGAL FRAMEWORK IN BELIZE   The successful implementation of e-  government policies and processes can be   significantly enabled by a proper legal   framework for their operation. A   requirement for ICT related processes to   be introduced and adopted is their formal   legal equivalence and standing with the   paper process. Many governments are   now aware of the need for framework to   provide for enforceable electronic   transactions, both in the e-government   sphere and for e-commerce, and have   taken action. For example, the legal   recognition of digital signatures is   necessary if they are to be used in e-  government for the submission of   electronic forms containing sensitive   personal or financial information.9   While the Government of Belize has   enacted several key legislation: Computer   Wagering and Licensing Act of 1995, The   Belize Copyright Act revised 2003, the   Electronic Transactions Act (2003),   Electronic Evidence Act (2003), Freedom   of Information Act (1994, amended in   2000), and the Archives and Records   Service Act (2004), and the Interception of   Communication Act 0f 2010, there are                                                          9 The Electronic Transactions Act of 2003 does  allow for the use of electronic signatures in  Belize.   other critical areas which must be addressed   if any e-Government related Strategy is to   have any meaningful impact, in particular:    • Computer and Computer Related   Crime/Computer Misuse: makes   attempted or actual penetration or   subversion of computer systems a   criminal act and prohibits the   unauthorized access, use of or   interference to any program or data held   in a computer and to a computer itself.    • Privacy and Data Protection: sets   requirements for the proper handling and   protection of personal information held   within information processing systems   and to protect the privacy of individuals in   relation to personal data, to regulate the   collection, processing, keeping, use and   disclosure of certain information relating   to individuals and to provide for matters   incidental thereto or connected   therewith.10                                                          10 The Belize Interception of Communications Act  of 2010 does address some of these issues although  not in their totality.      Belize ICT National Strategy 37     ICT TRADE POLICY AND REGULATIONS IN BELIZE  Belize is one of the few countries that have enacted legislation allowing for the   establishment of online wagering. Its Computer Wagering Licensing Act, 1995, which came   into force on May 28, 1996, provides for the proper conduct and regulation of gambling via   the Internet.   In addition, the Electronic Transactions Act of   Belize was passed in 2003. The objectives of   the Act are:   a) to eliminate legal barriers to the effective   use of electronic communications in   transactions;   b) to promote the harmonization of legal   rules on electronic transactions across   national boundaries;   c) to facilitate the appropriate use of   electronic transactions;   d) to promote business and community   confidence in electronic transactions;   and   e)  to enable businesses and the   community to use electronic   communications in their transactions   with government.            Belize ICT National Strategy 38     TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY IN BELIZE   The Government of Belize passed the   Belize Telecommunications Act in 1987   which constituted Belize   Telecommunications Ltd (BTL). BTL was   granted a 15 years exclusive license to   operate in Belize.  In tandem, an Office of   Telecommunications was constituted to   regulate BTL as well as to administer   spectrum management.     The objects of the Belize   Telecommunications Act (BTA) of 1987   were to:   “provide for the regulation and   control of telecommunications   matters in the public interest, and   for that purpose to (a) promote   reliable and affordable   telecommunication services of high   quality accessible to Belizeans in   both urban and rural areas in all   regions of Belize; (b) foster   increased reliance on market forces   for the provision of   telecommunications services and to   ensure that regulation, where   required, is efficient and effective;   (c) promote the provision of   telecommunication services that   meet all the economic and social   requirements of users, including   disabled persons; (d) encourage   investment and innovation in the   telecommunications sector; (e) ensure   and promote fair pricing and the use of   cost-based pricing methods by providers   in Belize; (f) ensure compliance with   accepted technical standards in the   provision and development of   telecommunication services; (g) promote   stability of the telecommunications   sector; (h) protect the interests of   telecommunications users, service   providers and consumers; (i) preserve   national security interests; (j) ensure the   efficient use of the radio frequency   spectrum; (k) ensure the safety of the   public by maintaining access to   emergency numbers at all times   irrespective of non-payment by the   consumer.”   The powers of regulation are vested by BTA in   the Public Utilities Commission (PUC).   BTL was subsequently privatized and in   December 2002 was granted an ‘Individual   License’.  In the same month, December 2002,   a second ‘Individual License’ was issued to   International Telecommunications Limited –   which, however, went out of operation within a   few years.  In August 2003, an ‘Individual   License’ was granted to Speednet   Communications Limited.   It is pertinent to note that in May 2007 the   goodwill, properties, assets, obligations and     Belize ICT National Strategy 39     rights of Belize Telecommunications   Limited as well as its employees were   transferred to Belize Telemedia Limited   (BTL).    This means that in essence there are two   telecommunication providers in Belize.  It   is pertinent to note, however, that BTL is   the only Telecommunications Provider –   that is it owns the international   connectivity gateway as well as the land   installed dark fibre and the national   telecommunications grid.  Speednet   Communications Limited operates   primarily through BTL – and its core   business appears to be wireless   telephony.   The 2009 Scoping Exercise Report opines   that one fundamental effect arising from   BTL’s sole telecommunications provider status   is its power to block access to VoIP in order to   protect its international line revenue.  The use   of VoIP either for domestic and international   purposes is not possible in Belize unless   access is granted by BTL.  The inability of   Government Ministries and departments to use   VoIP technology to minimize   telecommunications costs and for society and   the economy at large to apply teleconferencing   technology to overcome communications   logistical issues arising due to the geo-disparity   of cities, municipalities and villages   strategically constrains the ability for Belize to   adopt an aggressive pace in establishing an   information society and an information   economy that places e-government as its   kernel.       CONCLUSION   It is pertinent to note that nothing was   revealed in the e-Readiness assessment   that would hinder Belize from becoming a   world class ICT state in the course of the   lifespan of this Strategy (five years) if the   political and business “will” was there to   turn the situation around. Even with the   high cost of internet in Belize, many   Belizeans (over 73,000) have embraced   the internet. Over three fourths of   Belizeans households own a cell phone and   over half have cable TV service. Because Belize   has a young population (with over half under   the age of 24), it is even more likely that many   more Belizeans will seek to become a part of   the global information society. Belize currently   has the infrastructure to meet their needs. It is   not a question of hardware or software but   “people-ware”. The “will” to do the right thing is   what is needed.

NATIONAL ICT VISION   ACCELERATED DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL  BELIZEANS THROUGH UNIVERSAL ACCESS AND WIDESPREAD USAGE OF   INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY.   The National ICT Vision articulates the   future that will be created through the   implementation of this strategy. Creating   this future will result in accelerated national   socio-economic development of the country   leading to “an improved quality of life for all   Belizeans”. Connecting to the future as   defined by the Vision and outcomes   requires a strategic approach to   implementing the necessary programs and   initiatives; this will create a powerful focus   where the investment of energy and   resources will bring about a synergistic   effect in achieving the outputs required.   Accelerating national development will be   empowered by pursuing major goals,   objectives and implementing a series of   programs that consist of critical projects.    These are shown in Figure 13 and   described on the next page:   Figure 13           Belize ICT National Strategy 41     MAJOR GOALS   Two major goals will be pursued over the five   year period of the National ICT Strategy:   • Firstly, Universal Access to ICTs, ensuring ICT   accessibility, acceptance and usability by   anyone, anywhere, at anytime, and through   any media and device.   • Secondly, Widespread ICT usage in every   aspect of national development including   security & crime reduction, improving health   care, improving the effectiveness and   efficiency of Government, developing   competitive businesses and building new   industries.    These are the focus of the Belize   National ICT Strategy and are   driven by the Vision.  All of the   objectives, programs and projects   are aligned to these two goals in a   powerful and synergistic way that   will accelerate national   development.                  Belize ICT National Strategy 42     MAJOR OBJECTIVES   The achievement of these goals will come about by addressing seven major objectives over   the period.

Belize ICT National Strategy 44     KEY PROGRAMS   Each major objective consists of key programs and projects (initiatives) that will be   implemented with relentless passion.  The key programs are identified and described below.   • ENHANCING AND HARMONIZING THE NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATION   INFRASTRUCTURE   • ICT IN EDUCATION    • DEVELOPING THE E-COMMERCE INFRASTRUCTURE   • BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE – CONNECT BELIZE   • CREATING JOBS - DEVELOPING ICT INDUSTRY    • MODERNIZING THE PUBLIC SECTOR  USING ICT   ENHANCING AND HARMONIZING THE NATIONAL  TELECOMMUNICATION INFRASTRUCTURE   The country of Belize needs to take action   to create a vibrant, competitive and open   telecommunication industry that enables   the availability and accessibility of quality   and affordable telecommunication services   to consumers and fostering social and   economic benefits to the country.   While the number of ICT users in Belize is   growing, there are still significant segments   of the population that do not have ready   access to telecommunication; in particular,   Internet services. The challenge for GOB, in   collaboration with its private sector, civil   society and international development   partners, is to encourage the development   of a vibrant, high-quality, low-cost   telecommunications infrastructure which all   citizens have the opportunity to access.   GOB in collaboration with the private sector,   civil society, and its international   development partners will implement the   following Projects/Initiatives to facilitate the   enhancement and harmonization of the   Belize national telecommunications   infrastructure:   • Develop a comprehensive and sound   competitive framework for   communications services matching   international best practices by   promoting competition, innovation, and   investment in broadband services.   • Promote and facilitate domestic and   foreign investment in additional Internet   backbone in an international   competiveness mode in order to bring   more telecommunication capacity and     Belize ICT National Strategy 45     redundancy to the Belizean market. This   will greatly aid in getting the country   ready to become a major player on the   international ICT industrial market stage   in areas such as cyber-park   development and the development of   Business Processing Outsourcing   (BPOs);   • Maintain an independent, effective, fair   and transparent Telecommunications   Regulatory Authority. The Public Utilities   Commission (PUC) is critical in setting   the right tone for the   telecommunications market, and for   providing regulatory certainty, ensuring   non-discriminatory treatment of telecom   and ISP providers, and in preventing   anti-competitive behavior. The GOB via   the PUC will ensure that all telecom and   ISP providers have non- discriminatory   access to the International Internet   Gateway (ARCOS fiber) and those prices   and service level agreements for   wholesale Internet bandwidth are   calculated on a cost- based formula and   a reasonable return of investment for   the dominant operator. This healthy   environment will provide the certainty   necessary for attracting large   investments required for infrastructure   development and service provision,   which will be a catalyst to improving   Internet penetration and cost reduction   to the general Belizean populace.   • Allow for the competitive development   of unfiltered Internet services in Belize   by avoiding the imposition of regulations   that might impede development and   access to new technology such as   Voice-Over the Internet (VOIP). This will   spur the creation of new socio-economic   opportunities and reduce the cost of   international calls; thereby allowing   Belize to be more competitive and   innovative on par with the rest of the   region and the world.   • Maximize efforts to bring voice and data   services to under-served populations, by   coordinating efforts from all social   sectors involved and by creating a   universal access fund paid by telecom   and ISP providers.   • Promote the creation of a market which   maximizes the use of national   infrastructure and that has the capacity   to provide the delivery of triple-play   services (Voice, Data and Video) under   one single platform. This will allow   operators to enhance their service   portfolio, reduce investment costs, and   provide a cheaper service to the   consumer.         Belize ICT National Strategy 46     ENHANCING EDUCATION USING ICT   Belize has long recognized the strategic   importance of education and training as a   principal instrument of economic and social   development. Belize already has internet   access and IT computer labs in most its   secondary schools. This has enabled the   significant growth of basic computer literacy   and skills among those of school-age   population who are still in school. GOB and   its private sector, civil society and   international development partners   recognize the need to both widen and   deepen this process, and therefore commits,   to pursuing the following:   • The ICT Curriculum for lifelong learning   program will ensure that ICTs form an   integral part of the education curriculum   at all levels as a core subject area and   also a learning and curriculum delivery   tool.  Initiatives including the   development of a holistic ICT Plan for   education, Primary and Secondary   curriculum design, will be initiated to   ensure that all areas of the education   value chain benefits from the application   of ICTs.    • The ICT Facilities development program   will provide the necessary equipment   and facilities for the ICT empowered   delivery of primary and secondary   curriculum, and student access to   information and learning materials.    Several initiatives will be implemented   including School Net providing   broadband Internet connectivity to   primary and secondary schools and   libraries across Belize; Smart classrooms   initiative equipping primary and   secondary classrooms with ICTs for the   delivery of learning materials, ICT   learning Labs will equip all primary and   secondary schools with computer labs   for use by students.  Additionally the   secondary school system will benefit   from two major initiatives targeting the   management of education information   and the provision of training material via   eLearning.   • The ICT capacity for teachers & librarians   program addresses the capacity to   deliver new curriculum, learning   resources and information, in new and   innovative ways utilizing ICTs in the   education system. Primary and   secondary teachers and librarians will be   exposed to the ICT training initiative that   continuously upgrade their skills to   design and deliver learning material   utilizing ICTs.    Teachers are the front line troops in the   development of Belize. They should be   accorded the status, facilities and role of   key change agents not only in delivering   the skills of the next generation, but for   their influence over the community,     Belize ICT National Strategy 47     especially rural communities. The   highest priority must be given to their   engagement and support as a part of   this National ICT Strategy.   It is recommended that all teachers be   trained in the use of ICT, and in its   integration into the curriculum for   teaching and learning. It is also   recommended that all teachers be   provided with a personal computer and   access to the Internet at a reduced cost.   The objective is to facilitate teachers   having a PC in their homes to develop   competencies which will enhance   teaching and learning of students in the   classroom. Accompanying this should be   the development of on line and offline   teacher training courses so that teachers   can continually upgrade and certify   themselves, thereby increasing the   number of trained teachers in the   country.   DEVELOPING THE eCOMMERCE INFRASTRUCTURE   The Internet and electronic commerce   represent tremendous social and economic   potential for countries such as Belize.  The   ecommerce development program seeks to   create an enabling environment including   the requisite legal and regulatory framework   that will enhance consumer confidence and   protection, electronic payment systems,   digital certification and authentication and   intellectual property protection. Initiatives   will be implemented to address the   requirements in all of these areas as   follows.   ELECTRONIC PAYMENT SYSTEMS   The availability of effective electronic   payment systems is a significant element of   electronic commerce and electronic   business, enabling government, and   wholesale and retail businesses   electronically using electronic payments.     The electronic payment infrastructure for   Belize’s banks is build in silos in which each   financial institution develops its own   electronic and online payment   infrastructure without any kind of common   national standards and interoperability   framework. Belize should and must develop   and legislate a Common Electronic Payment   System that integrates all local banks into a   common banking switch interbank network.   Belize’s Common Electronic Payments   System (BEPS) will include but not be   limited to the following services in its   network to all participating banks:   • Shared Nationwide ATM and Point of   Sale Network, provides the switch which   enable bank customers to conveniently     Belize ICT National Strategy 48     access their funds anywhere from any   of the participating banks’ ATMs.   • e-Debit, enables the purchase amount   to be immediately deducted from the   savings or current account direct into   the retailer's or merchant's bank   account. This provides consumers with   better cash management and peace of   mind as all transactions are PIN based.   In addition, the new card is embedded   with a sophisticated, tamper-resistant   smart chip to protect consumers   against the risk of fraud.   • Mobile Prepaid Top-Up via ATM, offers   more convenience for mobile phone   subscribers to top-up through BEPS’   ATMs.   • Interbank ATM Fund Transfer (IBFT),   allows bank customers to transfer funds   from one account to another account in   another bank. The beneficiary will   receive the funds immediately and   instantaneously, as the transfer is   online and in real-time.   • Interbank Payments, makes interbank   funds transfer more convenient to bank   customers via an electronic channel. It   enables payments to be made without   the need to raise physical supporting   vouchers or documents such as   cheques, bank drafts, etc. It is an   interbank fund transfer system that   facilitates payments and collections via   the exchange of digitized transactions   between banks. For corporations, it is   ideal for high volume interbank   payments such as payroll payments. As   for individuals, it is ideal for   transactions such as credit card   payments and loan repayments. It   offers bank customers, be it an   individual or corporation, a secure   interbank fund transfer system/channel   for all sorts of payments through direct   debiting of the customers' account(s)   and crediting into the beneficiaries   account; with all participating banks.   • Financial Processing Exchange (FPX),   opens new doors for e-Commerce, in   particular business to business (B2B)   and business to commerce (B2C)   payments. FPX is an alternative   payment channel for customers to   make payment at e-market places such   as websites and online stores as well as   for corporations to collect bulk payment   from their customers. It leverages on   the Internet banking services of   participating banks and provides fast,   secure, reliable, real-time online   payment processing. FPX provides   complete end-to-end business   transactions, resourceful payment   records, simplified reconciliation and   reduced risks as fund movements are   between established financial   institutions.     Belize ICT National Strategy 49     SINGLE WINDOW TRADING  SYSTEM   A single window trade system enables   international (cross-border) traders to   submit regulatory documents at a single   location and/or single entity. Such   documents are typically customs   declarations, applications for import/export   permits, and other supporting documents   such as certificates of origin and trading   invoices. Partners in such a system could   include:   • Beltraide   • BAHA   • Ministry of Finance   • Ministry of Agriculture   • The Port Authority   • The Customs Brokers Association   • Belize Ports Limited   • The Customs Department   • The Bureau of Standards   • The Ministry of Health   • The Police Department   The main value proposition for having a   Single Window for a country or economy is   to increase the efficiency through time and   cost savings for traders in their dealings   with various government authorities for   obtaining the relevant clearance and   permit(s) for moving cargoes across   national or economic borders. In a   traditional pre-Single Window environment,   traders may have had to contend with visits   and dealings with multiple government   agencies in multiple locations in order to   obtain the necessary papers, permits and   clearance in order to complete their import   or export processes.   There is no single definitive viewpoint of   what a single window trade system should   be. A common definition of the term \"Single   Window\" is:   \"A facility that allows parties involved in   trade and transport to lodge standardized   information and documents with a single   entry point to fulfill all import, export, and   transit-related regulatory requirements. If   information is electronic then individual   data elements should only be submitted   once.\"   The concept is recognized and promoted by   several world organizations that are   concerned with trade facilitation. Among   these are the United Nations Economic   Commission for Europe (UNECE) and its   Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic   Business (UN/CEFACT), World Customs   Organisation (WCO), SITPRO Limited of the   United Kingdom and the Association of   Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).   It is recommended that Belize adopts such   as system to promote and enhance e-  Commerce including enhancing the revenue   collection system for government.      Belize ICT National Strategy 50     CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND  PROTECTION    This initiative will build consumer   confidence in electronic commerce by   providing protection from fraud and from   misleading and unfair conduct and   commercial practices, respect for consumer   privacy, private sector initiatives, global   cooperation, consumer and business   education, and effective means of dispute   resolution.    DIGITAL CERTIFICATION AND  AUTHENTICATION    This initiative will enable greater security of   the eCommerce environment by developing   the legal and policy frameworks that   emphasize standards in authentication   technologies that help identify parties to   electronic business transactions, and   provide means by which they can reliably   sign documents, assent to transactions,   and verify documents' integrity.    INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  PROTECTION    This initiative will provide Legal protection of   intellectual property in the online   environment for the creation of local   content. Consumers will also have   confidence that they can rely on trademarks   as trusted indicators of the origin and   quality of their on-line purchases.                                                Belize ICT National Strategy 51     ANTIGUA & BARBUDA                     Mobile Computer classrooms give  Antigua’s public school students access to   computer technology and Wi-Fi.   Source:  http://www.tropos.com/news/pressreleases/20  07_11_29.php   CONNECT BELIZE – BRIDGING THE  DIGITAL DIVIDE    The Connect Belize program will ensure that all   Belizeans have equal access to ICTs by implementing   initiatives that expand broadband connectivity to   communities and homes in both urban and rural   Belize and bridge the digital divide by ensuring that   adequate facilities for access is within the reach of   persons.   This program will bring the benefit of ICTs   into all segments of the population, especially to   people who are disadvantaged due to education,   age, gender, disabilities, ethnicity, and/or those living   in remote regions.    Good governance is high on many countries   development agenda, including Belize, premised on   the belief that it is a prerequisite for improved   national socio-economic performance as well as   national cohesion and state   building. As a result, there is   clearly a movement toward   changes in the areas of public   administration and governance   systems and institutions in most of   the world today. Increased   emphasis on good governance has   generated greater demands from   citizens for effective and   participatory governance   structures and services. There are   rising demands as well for access   to public information, which has   direct implications for ICT   applications in the governance   domain. Indeed, the role of ICTs in   enhancing good governance is   becoming an issue of critical   importance as democratization   gains ground around the world.   Three major programs will be   implemented over the period as   follows:   • The connect Rural Belize   initiative,    • The Community Access Center   (Telecenters) initiative,   • The ICT awareness, and   promotion and ICT education   for communities initiative        Belize ICT National Strategy 52     A telecenter may be defined as a   shared site that provides public   access to information and   communications technology whose   main purpose is to increase public   access to the Internet and to   services available over the Internet.   The basic telecenter that is   common in Latin America and the   Caribbean has fairly standard   features. It consists of premises   stocked with several computer   terminals and simple furnishings   consisting of chairs or classroom   desks for users and regular desks   or tables on which the terminals sit.   The main service offered to the   public is access to the Internet   (chatting, e-mail and Web browsing)   and often also to elementary   software (word processing,   spreadsheet). However, telecenters   have also been used for education   and training and for providing vital   government services online.   RURAL CONNECTIVITY –E- VILLAGE    In the rural communities, commercial   investment in telecommunications   infrastructure has followed a typical pattern:   slow and weak investment. As a result, rural   communities suffer a “distance penalty”   that increases communication costs and   makes it more difficult to attract businesses   and growing families. Rural communities   can use advanced telecommunications   services, particularly the Internet, to help   them bridge the gap. It is recommended that   the Government of Belize improve the   connectivity of rural areas which will provide   to residents access to information and   training and digital opportunities leading to   poverty reduction. Funding from an   established Universal Access Fund and from   international funding agencies through   grants/loans can be used for the funding of   this project.   COMMUNITY ACCESS CENTERS –  TELECENTERS   DESIRED OUTCOMES   1. Universal Access to Information and   Communication Technology (especially   for poor urban and rural areas);   2. Poverty Alleviation And Crime Reduction   through Distance Education and   workforce training, particularly of low   income women and youth in urban and   rural areas;   3. Dissemination of Information for   community development including the   provision of health, agriculture, trade   information and enhanced access to   government services (birth registration,   application for permits, job and land   applications etc…) online using ICT.     Belize ICT National Strategy 53     4. Enhancing democratic governance   through increased community   connectedness and participation.   BENEFITS OF TELECENTERS   • Rural Connectivity - Rapid developments   in wireless technology have made it   possible to overcome physical hurdles   (distance, topography), at a reasonable   cost, that for long have limited the   development of telecommunications   infrastructure in rural areas of Latin   America and the Caribbean. The   benefits of such investments in   telecenters should be maximized by   providing Internet services and not just   rural telephony. Shared access to these   services through telecenters can   increase the impact of these   interventions.    • Training - ICT training interventions   should be geared primarily towards   young people. The young adapt most   quickly and easily and is most skilled at   using the new technologies. Since young   people are a large group in Belize, with   the longest productive horizon ahead of   them, there is a high return on   investments aimed at improving their   productive capacity. The starting point   should be the strengthening of the   formal education system, so that it   incorporates the effective use of the   new technologies. Teacher training is   often a critical determinant of impact on   youngsters. Telecenters can be an   important complement to formal   education reform, providing support to   students and teachers after school   hours and increasing Internet access for   teachers, parents, recent graduates and   the community at large. In addition,   telecenters can be used for online   workforce training using programs such   as the International Driver’s License ICT   training program for low income urban   youth, thereby enhancing their job   prospects leading to poverty reduction   and crime alleviation.    • Dissemination of Information –   Telecenters can be used to launch   portals that offer public services online,   aimed primarily at meeting the   economic and social needs of the low-  income population, including   educational portals using simple   language that broaden labor and self-  employment opportunities. For example,   it can be used to provide birth   registration, application for permits, job   and land applications etc… online using   ICT. It can also be used to provide a   database of jobs and people looking for   jobs connecting citizens, government   and the private sector.         Belize ICT National Strategy 54     The ICT AWARENESS AND  PROMOTION program will boost   awareness, build interest and create a   demand for ICTs in communities across   Belize. Through the initiatives in this   program Belizeans will become aware of the   benefit that ICTs can have in every aspect of   their lives and become familiar with the use   of ICT tools. This program is in fact a change   program designed to create the demand for   ICTs as the Connect Belize program makes   the access to ICTs within reach of all   Belizeans.  Major initiatives under this   program include the Annual Belize ICT   Roadshow, School Based ICT awareness   competitions, Multimedia ICT promotions,   National Awards for ICT innovation.  This   should also include education regarding the   legal and regulatory frameworks that are   already in place in Belize for fostering a   competitive ICT environment.    The ICT EDUCATION FOR  COMMUNITIES PROGRAM will   provide an enabling environment to   facilitate ICT literacy for all citizens but   especially children and youth. This will allow   them to enter labor force with relevant ICT   skills that will contribute to new revenue   streams that are ICT enabled.                               Belize ICT National Strategy 55     CREATING JOBS – DEVELOPING THE LOCAL ICT INDUSTRY    The local ICT industry programs is designed   to create a well developed ICT services   sector and driving the adoption and usage   of ICT in all dimensions of business   operations to create competitive advantage   at the business and country levels.  ICT will   become the basis for new local business as   well as a means to increase the efficiency   and competitiveness of established sectors.    Key aspects of the program include:   • The provision of ICT incentives which   focuses on creating the environment   that promotes and rewards the use of   ICTs in business and the growth of the   ICT industry.  Various incentives will be   created toward this end including   effective removal of taxes and import   duties on ICT products and related   accessories, implementing the Access   to ICT Capital initiative that develops   Public/Private partnerships to provide   funding to jumpstart certain ICT   industries, with private sector funding   as the preferred source for capital.    • Nurturing the growth of a competitive   ICT sector through the implementation   of the Competitive ICT Businesses   initiative that will ensure that   competitive local ICT companies have   an opportunity to become key suppliers   of GOB ICT needs and benefit from the   knowledge transfer when international   ICT providers participate in local   business opportunities. Additionally one   of the major ICT industry growth   initiatives will focus on the   establishment of Cyber-parks for the   provision of ICT related jobs by   attracting investors operating in a   competitive environment.   The Cyber-park initiative will train our   youth for the industry and establish   facilities including factory shells and   office buildings that are equipped with   advanced ICT infrastructure.  The focus   of the Cyber-parks will be to increase   the wealth of its community by   promoting the culture of innovation and   the competitiveness of its associated   businesses and knowledge- based   institutions.   The establishment of Cyberparks for the   provision of ICT related jobs has become   one of the kinds of incentives used to   attract investors operating in a knife-edge   competitive environment in many   developing countries.   It is recommended that GOB and its local   and international partners seek investment   to promote the availability of workspace for   BPOs, including factory shells and office   buildings, through the creation of   Cyberparks. Private sector partners should   also be encouraged to invest in developing     Belize ICT National Strategy 56     these facilities. Government should   consider positively joint approaches to such   ventures. The objective should be to   encourage the location of such facilities in   areas of relevant and advantageous   infrastructure, and where there is a   catchment of trained and trainable human   resource. Advantage will be taken of the   existence of available unused structures   that lend themselves to easy conversion.   Government should also consider the   provision of such facilities that would allow   for economies of scale in the use of shared   facilities, infrastructure, and transmission   equipment.                                 .        Belize ICT National Strategy 57     INTRODUCTION   A Cyber Park according to the International Association of Science and Technology  Parks (IASP) is “ An organization managed by specialized professionals, whose  main aim is to increase the wealth of its community by promoting the culture of   innovation and the competitiveness of its associated businesses and knowledge- based institutions. Cyber parks play a significant role in stimulating national IT   development and establishing logical links with the global market through forging  partnerships for developing information and telecommunication technologies.  A   Cyber Park can act as a catalyst to develop the business infrastructure for such a  mission.   Developing countries have increasingly relied on cyber parks as a preferred tool for  promotion of IT industry. These countries are often constrained by severe   infrastructure limitations. Therefore, it is easier for them to provide world class  infrastructure in select areas. Developing countries like India and China have   concentrated on state-of-the art physical, communication and social infrastructure in  cyber parks to enable IT companies from around the world to operate BPO   (Business Processing Outsourcing) and ITES (International Technology Enabled  Services).   Unlike other industrial clusters, cyber parks are not constrained by factors such as  the availability of natural resources, or raw materials. The key resource requirement   is availability of quality manpower. One of the main reasons for the success of  China and India in the IT sector can be attributed to their highly educated and   skilled manpower. It has been observed that cyber parks generate spillover effects,  leading to a virtuous cycle of local economic development.  Cyber park   development helps generate the impetus to local development of industries such as  building construction, real estate, retail, lifestyle and recreation.   CYBERPARKS    DESIRED OUTCOMES   1. Poverty Alleviation though accelerating economic growth;   2. Job creation and career growth particularly for low-income women and youth and for   technical and technology graduates;   3. Leveraging international knowledge resources to enhance a country’s economic and ICT   base;      Belize ICT National Strategy 58     BENEFITS OF CYBERPARKS   • Employment Growth – the local BPO   industry in Belize has already created   over 1,000 jobs in the country.   Beltraide asserts that with concerted   GOB and other local support, that   number could well be over 10,000 in   five years.    • Other Businesses Spread Effects –   Cyber Parks can also create a boost   for other local industries such as the   local construction industry as one of   the inputs that it needs most is large   working spaces. As mentioned above,   Cyber park development also helps to   generate the impetus to local   development of industries such as   building construction, real estate,   retail, and lifestyle and recreation.   • Hiring of Technical and Technology   Graduates – Cyberparks and the   companies located in them are always   looking for technical and technology   graduates. This is why many of them   locate near to a university or technical   school. Beltraide intends to work with   the ITVET and the sixth forms and   University of Belize to develop the pool   of skilled workers necessary for BPOs   and ITES organizations to operate   effectively in Belize.    • Foreign Exchange Earned –   Cyberparks are a great foreign   exchange earner as they provide the   infrastructure and human resources   for international BPOs and ITES to   operate in the country. For example, in   2010, BPOs in Belize generated over   US$18,000,000 in Belize and   employed over 1,000 people.   Beltraide asserts that with concerted   GOB and other local efforts, BPOs and   ITES can generate nearly US$150   Million in the next five years.    • Local Bandwith and Technology   Enhancements – The development of   cyber parks can also spur the   development of other ICT related   enhancements such as greater local   bandwidth and other IT related   technologies not currently available   locally such as VOIP. Because ICT   companies in the cyberparks will be   requesting greater bandwith that what   is currently available in Belize (4MB),   they will spur the local   Telecommunications Providers to   provide more bandwith which can   then be made available to the local   market. The same can also be said of   ICT related technologies not currently   available to the local market.     Belize ICT National Strategy 59     MODERNIZING THE PUBLIC SECTOR USING ICT   eGovernment programs will significantly   improve the performance of government   through the usage of ICTs, to meet the   evolving needs of the people of Belize and   create a safe society.  This will be achieved   through the implementation of key   programs & initiatives including:   • The Connected government program   focuses on implementing the Public   Sector Network (GOBNet). GOBNet will   be a single, holistic backbone   infrastructure for the whole of the GOB   public sector. It will connect the   existing networks to enhance   standardization, security, and data   sharing as well as enhancing more   effective communication and realize   cost savings. It will also replace the   existing approach where each GOB   ministry or department designs,   develops, installs and maintains its   own network – an approach which has   led to fragmented and more expensive   service delivery. As well as reducing   operating costs and complexity,   GOBNet opens up new opportunities   for information sharing and increasing   local and national participation.   • The GOB Information management   program will enable effective and   efficient management of government   information and business continuity.   The focus of this program will be the   development of a national data center   infrastructure for GOB. This approach   will rationalize the various data   storage/server rooms across   government to provide more effective   & efficient information management   and the delivery of information based   services to Belizeans.  The building of a   National ICT Centre by the Ministry of   the Public Service and financed by the   Government of Taiwan, whilst an   excellent development for Belize,   seems to be at this time an initiative in   isolation. There is no doubt that, if   properly planned, the new National ICT   Centre can act as the Central Data   Centre for GOB with appropriate robust   facilities to assure (i) consolidation of   ad hoc hardware; (ii) streamlined   utilization of hardware; (iii) greater   levels of security; (iv) greater levels of   resilience; (v) better utilization of   technical resources and rationalization   of such resources to the optimum level;   (vi) reduction of the Total Cost of   Ownership by ensuring that facilities   are not replicated unnecessarily.   • The Government Software Warehouse   (GOBApps) program will focus on the   coordinated development and   acquisition of computer applications to     Belize ICT National Strategy 60     be used across GOB ministries,   departments and agencies. These   include (to cite a few):   • An enterprise-level Human   Resources system;   • A unified electronic mail system,   including collaborative tools such   as calendar, documents sharing,   and instant messaging;   • Financial Information systems    • The integrated development of a   National Security system including   the Judiciary, Prisons, Immigration,   Police Department, Belize Defense   Force, Coast Guard, and Customs   Department;   • The National Health Information   system;   • Geo-Spatial Data Management;   • Data warehouse and analytical   tools for easy access to economic   indicator;   • A comprehensive School   Management system    • A secure and effective Vital   Registration System that has   country-wide reach;   • e- learning systems and distance   education systems    • The Government information &   services online program will make   available all appropriate government   information through channels that are   easy to access by citizens. Government   information and services will be   delivered electronically through   multiple channels including the   eGovernment Portal, Government   information and services kiosks’ and   the Government information & services   hotline. Government information and   services will also be delivered through   the Community Access Center initiative   and the Mobile ICT Classroom   initiatives identified above.    • The eGovernment Interoperability &   open standards program will establish   GOB’s e-Government Interoperability   Framework (e-GIF) that sets out the   government’s technical policies and   specifications for achieving   interoperability and Information and   Communication Technology (ICT)   systems coherence across the public   sector. The e-GIF defines the essential   prerequisites for joined-up and web-  enabled government. It is a   cornerstone policy in the overall e-  Government strategy. The main thrust   of the e-GIF is to adopt standardized   specifications for all government   systems, and establishing and   implementing metadata across the   public sector so that as the GOB   becomes connected and government   information and services become   available online citizens can find   government information and resources     Belize ICT National Strategy 61     more easily. The e-GIF initiative focuses   on developing the necessary policy and   also providing the support, best   practice guidance, toolkits and   centrally agreed schemas to Ministries   and government agencies to subscribe   to the e-GIF and make the transition to   the policy requirements.  In addition,   the program will outline the requisite   ISO standards applicable to ICT in e-  government.   • The ICT Governance & Continuity   program will establish the GOB   Department of Information and   Communication Technology that is led   by a Chief Information Technology   Officer/CEO whose function is to   provide leadership on all GOB ICT   related issues and to strengthen the   governance mechanisms for   coordination and decision-making. This   will be discussed further in the   governance model. The creation of a   government information and   communication department including   the Chief Information Technology   Officer (CITO/CEO) function, combined   with the other eGovernment programs   and initiatives, will make GOB a leader   in government use of ICT, and will   enable it to further drive substantial   improvements in service delivery and   transformational change for the nation   as a whole.   • The eProcurement program will enable   efficient and effective procurement of   ICT products and services to achieve   more targeted ICT investment and   maximizing the value that the GOB   receives from expenditure on ICT   products and services given the   complexity of the ICT environment and   the speed of technological change. The   initiatives under this program will   establish the necessary policy,   financing mechanisms and   technological infrastructure to Plan,   organize, and coordinate a strategic   and common ICT procurement function   including supply arrangements.

In the   past, monopoly operators had to assume   the costs of meeting the country’s   universal access objectives. These   operators had to finance the delivery of   essential telephone services to   uneconomic regions mainly through cross   subsidies, which flowed from profitable   market segments (e.g. international, long-  distance, business users, urban) to less   profitable market segments (e.g.   domestic, local, residential users, rural).   While cross-subsidies served their   purpose in monopoly environments, they   create problems in newly competitive   environments. In particular, cross-  subsidies have been known to distort   market signals and place an unfair burden   on certain operators. To finance their   access objectives in a competitively   neutral and transparent manner, an   increasing number of countries are now   turning to universal access funds.       UNIVERSAL ACCESS FUND FEATURES   Universal access funds receive finance   from various sources and provide targeted   subsidies to encourage the provision of   telecommunications services by private   operators in otherwise uneconomic   regions. These funds can be distinguished   on the basis of three key features:   1. Sources for funding. Universal access   funds can be distinguished by their   sources for funding. Depending on the   country and its particular situation, the   sources for funding have included   national budgets of governments,   charges on interconnecting services,   levies on subscribers (e.g. on access   lines) and levies on operator revenues.   Funding from international   development agencies is also an   option. Universal access funds today   tend to collect their revenues from   government sources or operator levies   on a widely based range of   telecommunications services (as   opposed to only from specific “high   margin services”, like international   long- distance). Broad based revenue   collection mechanisms are favored     Belize ICT National Strategy 66     because they have less of a price   distorting effect on the marketplace.    2. Fund management. Universal access   funds can differ in their management.   While some funds (e.g. Colombia) are   administered by government   ministries, other funds are   administered by the regulators (e.g.   Peru, Chile) or special agencies (e.g.   South Africa). The common perception   is that funds administered by   independent regulators and agencies   are less likely to be influenced by   government or political interest.    3. Type of services. Thirdly, universal   access funds can also be   distinguished by the types of services   they support. Developing country   funds in the past have placed greater   emphasis on ensuring basic public   access (i.e. voice-grade fixed access to   the public telecommunications   network). With the growing importance   of the Internet to national economies,   however, many of today’s newer funds   also support public access to value-  added services, including Internet   access. In Chile, the government has   redefined its fund, which has been   successful in extending basic   telecommunications to rural and low-  income areas, to support telecenter   projects. The Fund is expected to soon   launch a national telecenters program.   The initial phase will be a pilot project   involving the development of five self-  sustaining community telecenters in   various lower income urban and rural   areas of Chile. An initial target is to   install telecenters in each of about 90   municipal headquarters towns with   over 8,000 rural inhabitants.   The following table provides a brief   summary of some of the   telecommunications funds that are either   planned or have been implemented in   developing countries and emerging   markets.

It is estimated that over $1.5 Million   per year can be raised from this levy. As well, this figure will be used as counterpart funding   to secure grants from international partners to assist in funding of special projects.         Belize ICT National Strategy 68     NATIONAL ICT STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH    Implementation of the National ICT   Strategy is outlined as a planned and   collaborative approach. Public/Private   partnerships will be pursued as the modus   operandi of strategy implementation. The   role of the international development and   funding communities will also be actively   promoted, particularly in terms of the   transfer of information, benchmarking and   keeping abreast of developments in the   sector.    GOB will encourage the private sector, civil   society and international development   agencies working in Belize to partner with   government in building out infrastructure,   in developing Belize’s human resources, in   providing jobs and in taking on   development activities related to the ICT   strategy for the socio-economic   development of the country.   Integral to the implementation   process will be:   • GOB’s leadership (along with   the private sector, foreign   investors and its international   partners) and the commitment   of resources;   • Smart partnerships with key   sectors from private sector,   civil society, foreign investors and the   international development agencies;   • The involvement of all stakeholders in   the execution and the continuing   development of the action plan to   accompany this National ICT Strategy;   • Rigorous pursuit of outcomes outlined   within the Strategy.   The National ICT Strategy will also seek to   attract local and foreign investors and   development grants through various   investment packages and incentives,   sufficient workspace with supporting   technology infrastructure, as well as a pool   of trained workers and professional staff.   Potential investors and development   agencies will be aggressively targeted   through a focused promotional strategy.            Belize ICT National Strategy 69     PROPOSED ICT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE   The Proposed ICT Governance Structure is presented in Figure 14 below. The guiding policy-  making body for the governance structure would be the Cabinet acting though a Cabinet ICT   Committee. This Committee would be chaired by the Minister of the Public Service and would   be comprised of the following members:   • The Minister of the Public Service – Chairperson    • The CEO in the Prime Minister’s Office – Vice Chair   • The CEO in the Ministry of Finance   • The CEO in the Ministry of Economic Development    • The CEO in the Ministry of the Public Service   • The CEO in the Ministry of Labor   • The CEO in the Ministry of Health   • The CEO in the Ministry of Education   • The Director of Beltraide   • The ICT Chief Information Technology Officer   • The Private Sector Advisors specializing in different areas of ICT, Strategic Planning and   Business Transformation   Figure 14   Proposed ICT Governance Structure      Cabinet  Minister of the Public  Service with reponsibilities   for ICT  Chief Information Officer  (CIO)  CIO's Council GOB Senior ICT Private Sector  International Partners Civil Society  eProcurement &  Resources   Mobilization Unit  Staff  ManPower  Development Unit  Staff  e-Government  (GOVApps) Unit  Staff  Government  Operation Center   (GOVNet) Unit  Staff  National Programs  Unit  Staff  Cabinet National ICT Committee Minister of Public Service, CEO Office  of the Prime Minister, CEO Ministry of  Finance, CEO Ministry of Economic   Development, CEO Ministry of  Education, CEO Ministry of Labor, CEO   Ministry of Health, BELTRAIDE, ICT  Advisors (Private Sector) Chair, Minister   of the Public Service    Belize ICT National Strategy 70        This Cabinet ICT Committee would be the   chief policy-making body for implementing   the ICT National Strategy. It will be tasked   with the following:   • Setting collaborative strategies and   achieving cooperation across ministries   and agencies  in order to transform   government processes and deliver more   integrated services;   • Facilitating a “big picture” approach to   ICT issues with agencies responsible for   individual ICT arrangements;   • Encouraging a cooperative approach to   decision on standards, investment,   security, privacy, shared infrastructure,   and reuse of intellectual property; and,    • Ensuring that decisions reflect the   impact and benefits across government,   rather than on individual agencies   alone.    A centralized GOB ICT Department will be   created under the direction of a Chief   Information Technology Officer. The Chief   Information Technology Officer’s function   should include:   • Authority for driving the change agenda   – The CITO should be at the Chief   Executive Officer level and should also   be a full member of the CEO Caucus   responsible for providing executive   steerage of the national ICT agenda;   • A mandate to provide independent and   authoritative advice for major ICT   investments – The CITO should provide   expert input into all ICT-related bids and   ensure all major ICT investments are   consistent with agreed strategic   priorities and architecture standards;   • Strong mechanisms for GOB   collaboration and decision-making –   Management of the GOB ICT agenda   should be directed through the Cabinet   ICT Committee of which the Minister of   the Public Service should chair. In   addition, peer assessments between   GOB CEOs and Ministry/Department ICT   managers and administrators should be   introduced to ensure the ongoing   effectiveness of collaboration   arrangements. The CITO will also work   along with a CITO Council comprised of   senior GOB ICT Directors, and key ICT   private sector, academic institutions,   civil society and international   development partners who provide   advice and guidance on the   implementation of the national ICT   Strategy;   • The CITO should have an office   equipped with individuals capable of   focusing on ICT strategy, policy and   architecture as well as an officer with   grant writing/resource mobilization   skills to secure funding for GOB ICT     Belize ICT National Strategy 71     related initiatives. The CITO office   should focus on GOB ICT management   and provide the necessary strategy,   policy and architecture capabilities to   drive the standardization agenda.    The ICT Department will be charged with   implementing the National ICT Strategy   under the direction of the ICT Cabinet   Committee chaired by the Minister of the   Public Service. It will also work in tandem   with a Chief Information Officer’s Council   comprised of GOB senior ICT officers, and   private sector, civil society, academic   institutions and international development   partners. This Council will work with the   Chief Information Technology Officer and   his/her units to:   • Co-develop an Action Plan designed to   implement the National ICT Strategy   including program ownership,   resourcing and prioritization;   •  Advise on the progress of the   implementation of the ICT Action Plan;   • Discuss policies and standards   proposed by the Department and advise   on implementation of agreed upon   policies and standards;   • Raise and discuss ICT issues with cross   government and national impact, as   well as advising on the agenda for the   ICT Department’s policy making;   • Advising on resource mobilization   efforts by the Department.   The new GOB ICT Department’s core   business activities consist of five units:   • National Programs Unit   • The Government ICT Service Center:   Government Ops Center and Technology   Unit   • E-Government (GOV/Apps) Unit;   • Manpower Development Unit;   • e-Procurement and Financing Unit.   THE NATIONAL PROGRAM  UNIT   The National Program Unit will coordinate   national level projects with other   implementing agencies such as the   implementation of cyberparks and   telecenters in Belize. This unit will work with   agencies such as Beltrade, the private   sector, civil society and international   development partners to initiate national   programs designed to increase jobs and   internet access for enhanced democratic   governance, particularly to rural areas of   the country.   THE GOVERNMENT OPS  CENTER UNIT   The Government Ops Center will consist of   multiple facilities designed to provide   services to government entities. These   services can be divided into two main   categories:      Belize ICT National Strategy 72     Network Services - The Secure Government   Network (SGN) is a government-wide   network providing a controlled, secure and   high-throughput service. All government   entities will be connected to this service   and SGN is the sole provider of connectivity   between government departments. To   manage the SGN, the ICT Department will   operate a Network Government Ops Center   (NOC) that closely monitors network   performance and bandwidth utilization.   Connectivity to the Internet is via the SGN.   In order to meet the required security   standards and achieve economy of scale   benefits, connection via SGN is the sole   source of Internet connectivity for   government entities.    Data Center Services - Data centers are   constructed specifically for large-scale data   storage and information technology   processing needed to operate government   IT applications, email services and Web   sites. They are designed to minimize   hazards from electrical power failure, fire,   water damage, acts of nature, and   unauthorized access. Data is backed up   regularly and the data center is provided   with a mirrored fail-over facility that is able   to take control of the government systems   in the event of a disaster. The secure data   centers are provided with high speed, dual   connectivity communications links to the   SGN, Internet, and fail-over facility.    The Objectives of the Government Ops   Center are:    • To reduce costs by leveraging a   common infrastructure across   multiple applications and data   content. This will drive down the need   for infrastructure to support individual   applications. This will in turn drive   down the cost to deliver these   capabilities;   • To increase quality of service. A single   release-management infrastructure,   with a common set of processes,   procedures and tools, creates a more   stable environment.   • To consolidate resources and skill   sets. Concentrating the required   competencies in one team, will reduce   the cost of hiring, training and   keeping scarce qualified IT staff;   • To enhance security. Using a shared   infrastructure with common   procedures across the applications   and associated data will provide the   ability to maintain a single   government security policy;   • To decrease time to market by   enabling government entities to   introduce their information and   services to their users in a faster   manner, making use of the already   existing services offered by the   Government Ops Center.      Belize ICT National Strategy 73     • To increase compatibility. The use of   common platforms, procedures and   tools makes integration of new   applications easier and also provides   excellent scalability.    THE E-GOVERNMENT UNIT   The objectives of the e-Government Unit are   summarized as follows    • Reduce the costs of government and   associated business transactions by   streamlining government processes and   procedures;    • Increase the effectiveness of   government in dealing with interactions   with citizens and businesses.    The main concept of e-Government is to   view government as a supplier of services   and citizens/businesses as customers   wanting to use those services. This involves   a fundamental change in the culture and   operating practices of government and the   perception of government by both citizens   and businesses.   In line with the above this department   consists of two focus areas:    1. Services and processes    2. Infrastructure    The key functions of the e-Government unit   are:    • Business processes redesign (BPR) of   Government    • Services development defining which   services are to be offered through e-  Government and developing and   launching these services    • Content Management including   standards, forms, languages, look and   feel, use of logos etc.; this also includes   content management for the National   Information System.    • Infrastructure - The following   infrastructure building blocks are   defined for e-Government services:   1. Access layer (PC’s, mobile devices,   internet kiosk)    2. Gateway layer (data conversion,   messaging, transaction engine and   workflow, authentication, Portal   etc.)    3. Shared services layer: the Secure   Government Network (SGN)    THE MANPOWER  DEVELOPMENT UNIT   One of the most significant objectives the   National ICT Strategy is to use ICT as a   major contributor to the social and   economic development of Belize. To   accelerate the use of ICT the new ICT   Department must act fast in implementing   ICT development programs for its Belizeans   and Belizean businesses. The ICT     Belize ICT National Strategy 74     Department must be used as a catalyst and   accelerator towards this end.    The underlying objectives of the Manpower   Development Unit are threefold:    1. Developing the skills of the nation   (citizens and businesses) through   programs using ICT and/ or teaching   ICT;   2. Developing the ICT skills of government   employees;    3. Developing and continuously improving   the skills of the ICT Department staff    The Manpower Development Unit will   actively focus on the latter two objectives. In   addition it will support the various National   Programs in achieving the first objective.    This department will not employ actual   trainers but will set up training programs   based on the various needs and job   requirements within government; the actual   training will be done by private sector   companies.   THE E-PROCUREMENT AND  FINANCING UNIT   The objectives of the e-Procurement and   Financing Unit are fourfold:   1. Advise GOB on large ICT procurement   contracts from a technical and financial   perspective;   2. Develop and recommend e-  Procurement policies and procedures to   GOB;   3. Work with international development   partners, investors and the local private   sector to maximize resource   mobilization for the implementation of   the strategy;   4. Develop guidelines for and manage the   Universal Access Fund.     Finally, key elements of the GOB ICT   governance model should be mirrored in   ministries and departments. In particular,   ministries, departments and external   agencies should ensure their internal   governance arrangements support the more   coordinated GOB approach to ICT. They   need to establish effective mechanisms to   align business and ICT strategies and plans,   and to establish ministries/department   positions in relation to GOB wide ICT related   issues.                                Belize ICT National Strategy 75     CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS   The following must be in place (critical success factors) for the National ICT Strategy to be   successful:   • Senior Government sponsorship at the CEO and Ministerial level;   • Viewed and positioned as a National Development Initiative – not only as a Government   IT Initiative;    • Broad national engagement involving government, industry, academia, NGO’s and civil   society;   • Understanding that Education and HR Development (with a special focus on Youth) are   as much the keys to sustainable ICT development and growth as ICT infrastructure;   • Telecommunications affordability and maximum available bandwidth;   • Identifying true breakthrough opportunities in the e-Marketplace in Belize;   • e-Government as a catalyst – “early adopter, model user”;    • A solid governance structure led by expert stakeholders from government, civil society   and the private sector.

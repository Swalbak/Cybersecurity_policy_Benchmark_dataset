Cyber resilience lies at the very heart of this. Few nations are better placed to navigate these challenges, but we must be willing and able to adapt to this new world emerging around us. Our National Cyber Strategy hits this head on - setting out how the UK will fi rmly establish itself as a democratic and responsible cyber power, able to protect and promote its interests as a sovereign nation in a world fundamentally shaped by technology. To realise this ambition however, government itself must lead by example. As well as ensuring that government organisations can protect the services and functions that maintain and promote our economy and society, government must be an exemplar to the private sector, to ensure that the UK continues to enhance its reputation as one of the most secure and attractive digital economies in which to live, do business and invest in. The challenge cannot be underestimated, but tackling it is imperative. That is why I am delighted to set out here the Government Cyber Security Strategy which sets out how we will ensure that all government organisations - across the whole public sector - are resilient to the cyber threats we face. 7 Building a cyber resilient public sector 7 Building a cyber resilient public sector Message from the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister for the Cabinet Offi ce Government organisations - and the functions and services they deliver - are the cornerstone of our society. It is their signifi cance, however, that makes them an attractive target for an ever-expanding army of adversaries, often with the kind of powerful cyber capabilities which, not so long ago, would have been the sole preserve of nation states. Whether in the pursuit of government data for strategic advantage or in seeking the disruption of public services for fi nancial or political gain, the threat faced by government is very real and present. Government organisations are routinely and relentlessly targeted: of the 777 incidents managed by the National Cyber Security Centre between September 2020 and August 2021, around 40% were aimed at the public sector. This upward trend shows no signs of abating. Building and maintaining our cyber defences is therefore vital if we are to protect the functions and services on which we all depend. As government, we have made a great deal of progress in recent years, but there is much more to do. To meet the threats we will face in the coming decade we must build on our successes and transform how we approach cyber security in government. The Government Cyber Security Strategy sets out how we will do this; by building greater cyber resilience across all government organisations, and working together to ‘defend as one’ - exerting a defensive force greater than the sum of our parts. Every part of government has a role in achieving this. Government organisations are rightly empowered to manage their cyber risks - as well as harnessing local knowledge and understanding, this allows for tremendous innovation and agility. Such knowledge and expertise must however be shared across government to enhance our collective response, with more and advanced shared capabilities and services making the task increasingly straightforward, effective and effi cient. This strategy provides the framework to drive this forward. Government’s resolve to achieve this is absolute. This commitment is refl ected in the 2021 Comprehensive Spending Review, with £2.6 billion being invested in cyber and legacy IT, of which government cyber security is a critical component. £37.8 million of additional funding is also being invested to tackle cyber security challenges facing local councils to protect vital services and data, alongside targeted investment in our most critical departments. This is an ambitious but necessary strategy that demands action across all of government. We must meet our responsibility to ensure that government’s functions and services are resilient to the cyber threats they face - creating a stronger, better-defended government that is the foundation of our status as a cyber power. Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 8 Context 1. The Integrated Review1 and the National Cyber Strategy2 set out the government’s ambition to firmly establish the UK as a democratic and responsible cyber power, able to protect and promote its interests as a sovereign nation in a world fundamentally shaped by technology. The UK’s legitimacy and authority as a cyber power is however dependent upon its domestic cyber resilience, the cornerstone of which is government and the public sector organisations that deliver the functions and services which maintain and promote the UK’s economy and society. 2. While government has made notable progress in recent years, there remains a significant gap between where government cyber resilience is now and where it needs to be. This gap is brought into sharp focus by the sheer volume of cyber attacks that the government sector experiences, and the evolving capabilities and techniques of the broad range of malicious actors conducting them. As well as the risk of disruption to government functions and public services, the targeting of essential services such as healthcare can pose a real risk to public safety. 1 HMG; Global Britain in a Competitive Age: the Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy; March 2021 2 HMG; ‘National Cyber Strategy’; December 2021 Vision and Aim 3. This strategy’s vision is therefore to ensure that core government functions - from the delivery of public services to the operation of National Security apparatus - are resilient to cyber attack, strengthening the UK as a sovereign nation and cementing its authority as a democratic and responsible cyber power. 4. Core government functions are delivered by many diverse public sector organisations, including government departments, arms- length bodies, agencies and local authorities. This strategy therefore considers all such public sector organisations. 5. To achieve its vision the strategy pursues a central aim - for government’s critical functions to be significantly hardened to cyber attack by 2025, with all government organisations across the whole public sector being resilient to known vulnerabilities and attack methods no later than 2030. 6. This is a bold and ambitious aim. To achieve the level of organised and objective visibility of cyber security risk across the whole of government will require extensive processes, mechanisms and partnerships to be established; a task complicated by the varying levels of cyber maturity, capability and capacity. Key to this will be enabling lead government departments to assess and articulate the macro-cyber security posture of the arms-length bodies and other public sector organisations within their purview. Executive Summary 9 Building a cyber resilient public sector 7. Achieving this aim will make government a significantly hardened target. As well as enabling government to protect its data and operate without undue disruption, it will ensure that government organisations are structured and organised to manage unknown and more sophisticated threats when they do arise. Strategic pillars and transformational proposals 8. Government’s approach to achieving this aim is centred around two complementary strategic pillars, each underpinned by a transformational proposal that will unlock and drive improvements across government. 9. The first is to build a strong foundation of organisational cyber security resilience; ensuring that government organisations have the right structures, mechanisms, tools and support in place to manage their cyber security risks. 10. This will be underpinned by the adoption of the National Cyber Security Centre’s (NCSC) Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF) as the assurance framework for government, with government specific CAF profiles that articulate the outcomes required by government organisations in order to proportionately respond to the varying threats to their most important functions. Objective verification by independent auditors will be a requirement for central government departments, although it will be for lead government departments to adapt and apply such an approach in a way that is most appropriate for the public sector organisations within their scope. As well as improving visibility of cyber security risks, adopting the CAF provides a common framework for government to more effectively understand and manage them. 11. The second is to ‘defend as one’. Recognising that the scale and pace of the threat demands a more comprehensive and joined up response, government will harness the value of sharing cyber security data, expertise and capabilities across its organisations to present a defensive force disproportionately more powerful than the sum of its parts. 12. This will be underpinned by the establishment of a Government Cyber Coordination Centre (GCCC). As a joint venture between the Government Security Group, the Central Digital and Data Office and the NCSC, the GCCC will work to better coordinate operational cyber security efforts, transforming how cyber security data and threat intelligence is shared, consumed and actioned across government. Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 10 Manage cyber security risk 14. In order to manage cyber security risk, government organisations will be able to identify, assess and understand them. The foundation of this lies in the visibility and understanding of assets, their vulnerabilities, and the threat to them - whether internal to an organisation or emanating from its supply chain. Clear accountability and robust assurance will ensure that risk owners are aware of the risks they have the responsibility to manage, and that they are doing so appropriately. 15. Information about vulnerabilities will be shared across government to provide a central view of critical vulnerabilities that will enable cross-government risks to be identifi ed and managed, facilitating rapid assessment, coordination and mitigation at scale. Protect against cyber attack 16. The protective stance of individual government organisations will be inextricably linked to their assessment and management of risk. While it will never be possible to protect against all attacks, those accountable will be able to demonstrate that they have appropriately considered those risks and responded accordingly. 17. Proportionate cyber security measures will be embedded in the technology government uses, and technology and digital services will be correctly designed, confi gured and managed. Crucially, government will develop its shared capabilities, tools and services to address common cyber security issues at scale, improving cyber security across the whole of government as well as driving effi ciency and value for money. 18. At the heart of this is government’s responsibility to protect the data it handles. As well as appropriately classifying information, government will handle and share it in a way that is commensurate with the risks it presents, using the appropriate IT systems. Objectives 13. These pillars are supported by fi ve objectives that set the dimensions of cyber resilience, providing a consistent framework and common language that can be applied across the whole of government. 11 Building a cyber resilient public sector Detect cyber security events 19. Building on the foundation of risk management and commensurate protective measures, government will develop its capability to detect cyber security events across every part of its estate to ensure that risks can be mitigated before they critically impact government functions and services. 20. This means having the capability to monitor systems, networks and services to detect cyber security events before they become incidents. Enhanced coordination will enable government to have the agility to use these data inputs to detect at pace and scale, facilitating coherent responses as well as providing the capabilities to detect more sophisticated attacks. Minimise the impact of cyber security incidents 21. While effective risk management, appropriate and proportionate protective measures and enhanced detection capability will make government a considerably hardened target, government organisations will still be impacted by cyber security incidents. 22. Government will therefore be fully prepared and able to respond to cyber incidents with the capability to restore affected systems and assets and resume the operation of its functions and services with minimal disruption. A critical component of this will be establishing the mechanisms to test and exercise incident response plans, both organisationally and across government, as well as the ability to learn lessons from incidents and ‘near misses’. Develop the right cyber security skills, knowledge and culture 23. Achieving this strategy’s vision and aim will not be possible without cultivating the required cyber security skills and knowledge, as well as fostering a cultural shift in cyber security across the whole of government. 24. Government will have a comprehensive understanding of its cyber security skills requirements and will incentivise and promote government cyber security careers. As well as formal career pathways that align with the UK Cyber Security Council, working towards the adoption of a single pay framework for the cyber profession will enable government to more effectively attract, develop and retain those skills, providing a sustainable government cyber security profession. 25. The need for suffi cient cyber security skills and knowledge extends beyond technical cyber security roles to the breadth of professional functions that must give adequate consideration to cyber security. From the Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) profession through to government’s commercial and legal functions, suffi cient cyber security knowledge and awareness will ensure that cyber security is actively considered wherever necessary. 26. Fundamentally, this strategy recognises the importance of cultivating a cyber security culture that empowers its people to learn, question and challenge to drive continuous improvement. This begins with improving cyber security awareness and knowledge across all public sector workers, building on these foundations to create a positive cyber security culture that promotes and empowers its people to proactively engage on organisational cyber security risks. Getting this right is the key to sustainable change. Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 12 Chapter 1: Context Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 12 13 Chapter 1: Context 1. The Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy3 (Integrated Review) brings national resilience to the fore of the UK’s approach to its future security and prosperity. As global dependency on digital services and connectivity grows, the need for strong cyber resilience will become increasingly critical to this national effort. 2. The National Cyber Strategy4 pursues this objective, seeking to fi rmly establish the UK as a democratic and responsible cyber power, able to protect and promote its interests as a sovereign nation in a world fundamentally shaped by technology. 3 HMG; ‘Global Britain in a Competitive Age: the Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy’; March 2021 4 HMG; ‘National Cyber Strategy’; December 2021 3. The UK’s legitimacy and authority as a cyber power is however dependent upon its domestic cyber resilience; the cornerstone of which is its public sector. Government has a fundamental duty to deliver functions that maintain and promote the UK’s economy and society, from the delivery of public services through to the operation of national security apparatus. These functions must be able to operate without undue disruption to maintain the trust and public confi dence needed to enable the UK to prosper and, in turn, exercise infl uence beyond its borders. The importance of government cyber security to national resilience Integrated Review brings national resilience to the fore of the UK’s approach to its future security and prosperity. National Cyber Strategy seeks to rmly establish the UK as a leading democratic and responsible cyber power. Government Cyber Security Strategy seeks to ensure that core government functions are resilient to cyber attack, strengthening the UK as a sovereign nation and cementing its authority as a democratic and responsible cyber power. Figure 1: Strategic context Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 14 Progress 4. Government has made significant progress in the last five years. As well as the establishment of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) as the UK’s national technical authority for cyber security, the creation of the Government Security Group and the Central Digital and Data Office in the Cabinet Office has provided central leadership of cyber security and digital transformation at the heart of government. 5. The introduction of the Minimum Cyber Security Standards for government in 2018,5 and the underpinning annual ‘Health Check’, signalled clear requirements for cyber security controls and behaviours, and improved government’s understanding of its cyber security posture. This understanding has been further enhanced by the introduction of the GBEST scheme for government which provides an advanced, intelligence-led simulated attack framework to assess an organisation’s cyber resilience. 5 Cabinet Office; ‘Minimum Cyber Security Standard’; June 2018 6. The need for cyber security is being taken increasingly seriously at the highest levels, with more regular reporting to boards and government audit and risk committees consistently highlighting it as a critical risk. This recognition has been reflected through continued and significant investment in government cyber security through the National Cyber Security Programme and investment in addressing legacy IT across the government IT estate. 7. The NCSC continues to scale and develop its Active Cyber Defence programme to tackle cyber attacks in a relatively automated and scalable way, as well as growing the number of shared services and capabilities offered to improve government’s cyber resilience. The introduction and expansion of government’s SECRET IT platform has also transformed how government manages more sensitive information and enhanced collaboration across classifications. The challenges and opportunities for government FOCUS ON: A holistic approach to government security Cyber security is a critical component of a broader suite of security disciplines and practices that are required to protect government’s assets and ensure that government’s functions can operate without undue disruption. These security practices intersect and must all be given appropriate consideration as part of an organisation’s holistic business risk management approach. In recognition of this, in September 2021 the government published the Government Functional Standard GovS 007: Security6 (Security Standard). Government Functional Standards are a suite of management standards to guide people working in and with the UK government. The Security Standard represents an up-to-date view of the security arrangements government organisations should have in place to ensure government is able to function effectively, efficiently and securely. The Security Standard brings together and clarifies what needs to be done, and why, with flexibility for organisations about how it is met in practice. It sets expectations for the governance, roles and accountabilities and practices needed, as well as providing a stable basis for assurance, risk management and capability building. 6 Cabinet Office; ‘Government Functional Standards GovS 007: Security’, September 2021 15 Chapter 1: Context 8. Steps have been taken to address the cyber security skills challenge in government with the creation of the government security profession. The development of a cyber career framework - that sets out standard skills and knowledge requirements across government, directly linking to a cyber learning curriculum and a cyber pay offer - is attracting, developing and retaining cyber security talent. The government’s early talent offer is also growing talent from within, through apprenticeships and fast stream schemes. 9. The criticality of cyber security is also being recognised beyond the UK government. Public sector organisations are making strides, with the health sector being a notable example. The devolved governments also have well established cyber resilience strategies and action plans driving significant cyber security improvements in the sectors for which they have devolved responsibility. 7 Ipsos MORI / DCMS; ‘Cyber Security Skills in the UK Labour Market 2021’; March 2021 The challenge 10. Yet, while government’s recognition and understanding of cyber security risk has evolved, it has also highlighted the gap between where government cyber resilience is now and where it needs to be. This gap is brought into sharp focus by the challenges departments have faced in achieving the Minimum Cyber Security Standards. 11. The level of maturity, capability, investment, and security understanding across government organisations remains inconsistent and the size and complexity of government’s digital estate, including the presence of legacy IT, makes the challenge significantly more complicated. The size and diversity of the government’s supply chains makes it difficult to manage risks, with long-term contracts stifling innovation. Further to this, complex governance structures, insufficient accountability, levers and incentives, as well as underdeveloped mechanisms to effectively share information and capabilities significantly impacts government’s visibility of cyber risk, as well as its ability to drive change at the scale and pace required. This is made more challenging by limited resources. 12. Meeting the scale of the challenge is also dependent on people. However, in the context of a national cyber security skills shortage7, government struggles to compete with the private sector to attract and retain the required cadre of diverse and skilled cyber security professionals, despite its positive efforts to date. This extends beyond technical cyber security skills, including the broad range of professional functions that require cyber security knowledge and awareness. Moreover, internal competition over cyber professionals in government too often comes at the expense of knowledge retention and sustained change. Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 16 13. The need for improved cyber resilience is becoming more acute given the increasingly digital world. While ubiquitous digital connectivity and mass data generation create significant opportunities for government to improve its services and functions for the benefit of the UK and its citizens, it also introduces significant cyber security risks. As government’s reliance on digital services grows - from the use of digital products and services to the migration of government data and services into the cloud - greater dependency is placed on those outside of government, often with footprints extending beyond the UK. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these risks as well as fundamentally changing how government works, with hybrid working becoming the norm. 14. Such interconnectivity and dependency significantly increase the risk of malicious attack, with the potential to jeopardise trust and public confidence in government. 8 NCSC; ‘NCSC Annual Review 2021’; November 2021 The threat 15. As cyber security risks evolve, so do the threats posed by malicious actors - from nation states to cyber criminals. While their capabilities and techniques continue to evolve and diversify, the commoditisation of offensive cyber tools and services increasingly lowers the capability threshold for anyone with the intent to disrupt or undermine the functioning of government. 16. At the same time government remains an attractive target for a broad range of malicious actors, with approximately 40% of the 777 incidents managed by NCSC between September 2020 and August 2021 affecting the public sector8. This is expected to continue to grow. FOCUS ON: The impact of ransomware In 2020, both Redcar & Cleveland and Hackney councils were hit by ransomware attacks. Despite the relatively small sizes of these organisations the impact on critical public services was disproportionate and acute. These attacks are not an anomaly but part of a significant upward trend. Ransomware does not rely on the exploitation of new or novel vulnerabilities. Indeed, the barrier to such exploitation has been significantly lowered with the rise of ransomware as a service (RaaS), allowing ‘customers’ to purchase capabilities that were once the preserve of more capable actors. While use of ransomware rises, the costs of remediating the impact of ransomware attacks remain significant. This only reinforces the need for strong cyber resilience and strengthens the case for appropriate cyber security prioritisation and investment, to mitigate the risks before they turn into serious incidents. 17 Chapter 1: Context 17. The threat from nation state actors is of considerable concern, with nearly half of nation state activity being targeted at governments across the world, with the UK being the third most targeted country behind the USA and Ukraine9. Equally the dramatic rise of ransomware attacks and recent high- impact incidents demonstrate both the scale of impact and the diversity of organisations affected, from government departments to wider public sector organisations. The targeting of healthcare, education and other essential services continues to demonstrate the severity of such cyber attacks, which not only cause signifi cant disruption to the delivery of essential public services, but can also pose a real risk to public safety. 9 Microsoft; ‘Digital Defence Report’; October 2021 The opportunity 18. Although government faces signifi cant challenges it also has many attributes and strengths. With such organisational diversity comes a wealth of capabilities, knowledge and data that must be developed and harnessed. Government must also take full advantage of the benefi ts that digital transformation brings, to drive innovation, analytical understanding and the scaling of capabilities. 19. Cyber resilience remains a cost effective and impactful lever against the cyber threat. Government organisations must therefore build from these foundations to improve their cyber resilience. Most crucially, government needs to harness its collective strength, bringing together and developing its capabilities to present a stronger defensive force which can match the ever-evolving cyber risk landscape. The government remains an attractive target for a broad range of malicious actors, with approximately 40% of the 777 incidents managed by NCSC between September 2020 and August 2021 affecting the public sector September 2020 August 2021 ! incidents recorded impacted the public sector 40% of all 777 Figure 2: Cyber incidents affecting the public sector Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 18 Chapter 2: Approach Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 18 19 Chapter 2: Approach 20. Government has a duty to deliver functions that maintain and promote the UK’s economy and society. These functions must be able to operate without undue disruption to maintain the trust and public confidence needed to enable the UK to prosper. It is therefore imperative that these functions are sufficiently resilient to continuously evolving cyber threats. 21. To realise this vision, government will have the mechanisms in place to identify and manage known risks in order to maintain a proportionate and effective level of cyber security across all government organisations. 22. This will mean that government’s OFFICIAL systems will be hardened against known vulnerabilities and improper security practices will no longer unduly expose government to easily preventable attack methods, with information above OFFICIAL being appropriately protected on higher- classification systems. Such a position, and the understanding that is derived from it, will mean that government is aware of attacks to its systems and can effectively maintain its cyber resilience. 23. Achieving this aim will make government a significantly hardened target - forcing adversaries to work harder while enabling government functions to operate without undue disruption, in turn cementing the UK’s authority as a democratic and responsible cyber power. Vision and Aim VISION: This strategy seeks to ensure that core government functions - from the delivery of public services to the operation of National Security apparatus - are resilient to cyber attack, strengthening the UK as a sovereign nation and cementing its authority as a democratic and responsible cyber power. FOCUS ON: Cyber Resilience Cyber resilience refers to the ability of an organisation to maintain the delivery of its key functions and services and ensure the protection of its data, despite adverse cyber security events. Given government’s fundamental duty to deliver functions and services that maintain and promote the UK’s economy and society, cyber resilience lies at the very heart of this strategy. AIM: Government’s critical functions to be significantly hardened to cyber attack by 2025, with all government organisations across the whole public sector being resilient to known vulnerabilities and attack methods no later than 2030. Unpacking the Aim: The aim of the strategy sets out a clear ambition for government. Progress towards it will be driven by an understanding of risk. This means identifying areas of particular risk and prioritising the most impactful interventions to ensure that government can rapidly improve its cyber resilience. The strategy’s aim focuses on the management of ‘known vulnerabilities and attack methods’. This focus refers to more than publicly disclosed security flaws, also accounting for the improper security practices and behaviours that unduly expose an organisation to cyber attack. Good cyber security practices are well established and their adoption will mitigate the vast majority of cyber attacks. As well as dramatically improving an organisation’s cyber resilience, adopting well-established cyber security practices will ensure that an organisation is structured and organised to manage unknown and more sophisticated threats when they do arise. Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 20 Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 20 Core government functions are delivered by many diverse public sector organisations, including government departments, arms-length bodies, agencies, local authorities, and other wider public sector organisations. This strategy therefore considers all such public sector organisations. In doing so it recognises the breadth, complexity and varying degrees of autonomy of these organisations, particularly those beyond central government. Lead government departments are best placed to understand the unique characteristics of the organisations within their purview, including their arms-length bodies and agencies, as well as other government bodies and wider public sector organisations. The focus is therefore placed on enabling lead government departments to assess and articulate the macro cyber security posture of those organisations, driving improvements as necessary. The devolved governments While cyber security - within the wider remit of national security - is a reserved matter, responsibility for public services within Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is devolved to the respective devolved governments. This includes the devolution of health and social care, education and transport, amongst others. Devolved governments therefore have the responsibility to ensure that those services are resilient to cyber risks. While these matters are devolved, the UK as a whole shares the vision set out in this strategy. The UK government will therefore continue to work collaboratively with the devolved governments to ensure that collective issues are addressed in partnership, with appropriate information and support being shared to maintain the resilience of the UK. The scope of this strategy 21 Chapter 2: Approach 21 Chapter 2: Approach • Manage own cyber security risk • Assess and articulate the macro cyber security posture of the public sector organisations in their purview Central government functions Devolved governments • Sets strategic direction and cross-government policies • Manages assurance for central government departments • Develops and maintains macro view of cross-government cyber security risk Work collaboratively to share information and ensure collective issues are addressed in partnership Central government departments / lead government departments Including: arms-length bodies; agencies; local authorities; and other wider public sector organisations Public sector organisations Public sector organisations Figure 3: Scope of the strategy Scope of the strategy Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 22 24. Achieving this vision and aim will require a step-change in how government approaches cyber security. As well as continuing to strengthen organisational cyber resilience, government will ‘defend as one’ to ensure that it can meet the scale of the challenges it faces. This strategy therefore centres around two core and complementary strategic pillars which define and drive the government’s approach to cyber resilience. Pillars Pillar 1: Build organsational cyber resilience Pillar 2: ‘Defend as one’ 25. As well as being responsible and accountable for managing their own cyber security risks, government organisations must increasingly recognise their collective responsibility for the cyber resilience of the whole of government. Given that failings of one organisation can have significant implications for many others, it is imperative that all individual organisations build and enhance their cyber security posture, accounting for the risks they face and the criticality of the function they have responsibility for. 26. Government organisations will therefore have the right structures, mechanisms, tools and support in place to ensure that they can manage their cyber security risks. This will be underpinned by genuine accountability, so government has confidence in its cyber resilience, both at an organisational and cross-government level. Figure 4: Strategic pillars Pillar 1: Build a strong foundation of organisational cyber security resilience 23 Chapter 2: Approach TRANSFORMATIONAL PROPOSAL - Enhanced cyber security assurance Government will adopt the Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF) as the assurance framework for government. The CAF has been developed by the NCSC - the UK’s technical authority on cyber security - and represents an industry standard that is used by operators of essential services under the Network and Information Systems regulations10 as well as more widely across the private sector, including critical national infrastructure (CNI) sectors. Adopting the CAF ensures that government is assessing its cyber resilience in a consistent and comparable way to other organisations that operate the UK’s essential services. Tiered government CAF profi les, underpinned by government-specifi c cyber threat profi les, will articulate the outcomes required by government organisations in order to proportionately respond to varying threats to their most important functions. Government organisations’ assessment of cyber resilience against the relevant CAF profi le will be verifi ed by independent auditors. As well as providing an objective assessment of government cyber resilience, independent auditing will highlight critical areas for improvement. This assurance process will be a requirement for government departments, however it will be for lead government departments to adapt and apply such an approach in a way that is most appropriate for the public sector organisations in their purview. Devolved governments will take a similar leadership role across their areas of responsibility. Crucially, however, lead government departments and devolved governments will be able to articulate the macro cyber security posture of the organisations within their purview with reference to the CAF’s objectives to ensure that government cyber resilience is assessed and understood in a consistent and comparable way. While the CAF will be used as the framework to provide consistent cyber security assurance of government departments, individual departments may continue to use whatever framework they feel is most appropriate to best enable them to manage their cyber security risks. Prominent cyber security frameworks, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cyber security framework and ISO 27001, are consistent with the CAF, ensuring that assurance reporting requirements do not disturb mature internal cyber security risk management structures and processes. 10 The Network and Information Systems Regulations 2018 Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 24 27. While developing a strong foundation of organisational cyber security is critical, the scale and pace of the threat demands a more comprehensive and joined up response. Government will therefore ‘defend as one’; harnessing the value of sharing cyber security data, expertise and capabilities across government to present a defensive force disproportionately more powerful than the sum of its parts. 28. This means ensuring that all government organisations have timely access to relevant and actionable cyber security data that enhances their ability to manage cyber risks, as well as working collaboratively to better coordinate and target shared government capabilities and services that address common cyber security issues at scale. 29. Doing so will have a disproportionate benefi t to the cyber security of government. It will also facilitate innovation by coordinating the identifi cation of common cyber security risks affecting government organisations and harnessing government expertise and resources to address those problems at scale. TRANSFORMATIONAL PROPOSAL - The Government Cyber Coordination Centre (GCCC) Government will establish a cyber coordination centre to better coordinate operational cyber security efforts across government organisations and truly enhance government’s ability to ‘defend as one’. Building on successful private sector models such as the Financial Sector Cyber Collaboration Centre (FSCCC), the GCCC will foster partnerships to rapidly identify, investigate and coordinate the response to incidents alongside threat and vulnerability reporting. Key to this will be transforming how cyber security data and threat intelligence is used across government. Ensuring that such data can be rapidly shared, consumed and actioned will dramatically improve government’s ability to ‘defend as one’ when managing incidents, vulnerabilities and threats at scale. As a joint venture between the Government Security Group, the Central Digital and Data Offi ce and the NCSC, the GCCC will form strong partnerships with government departments and the devolved governments. Pillar 2: ‘Defend as one’ FOCUS ON: Data-driven cyber security This strategy puts data at the heart of cyber security. The secure use of data - automated and machine readable wherever possible - will inform decision making and drive improvements where required. 25 Chapter 2: Approach 30. The strategy’s pillars are underpinned by five objectives. These set the dimensions of what needs to be considered with regard to cyber resilience, providing a consistent framework and common language that can be applied to the whole of government. 1) Manage cyber security risk: Effective cyber security risk management processes, governance and accountability enable the identification, assessment and management of cyber security risks - at both the organisational and cross-government level. 2) Protect against cyber attack: Understanding of cyber security risk informs the adoption of proportionate security measures with centrally developed capabilities enabling protection at scale. 3) Detect cyber security events: Comprehensive monitoring of systems, networks and services enable cyber security events to be managed before they become incidents. 4) Minimise the impact of cyber security incidents: Cyber security incidents are swiftly contained and assessed, enabling rapid response at scale. 5) Develop the right cyber security skills, knowledge and culture: Sufficient, skilled and knowledgeable professionals fulfil all required cyber security needs - extending beyond technical cyber security experts to the breadth of professional functions that must incorporate cyber security into the services they provide - all underpinned by a cyber security culture that promotes sustainable change. Objectives Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 26 Objective 3: Detect cyber security events Objective 1: Manage cyber security risk Objective 4: Minimise the impact of cyber security incidents VISION: Core government functions - from the delivery of public services to the operation of National Security apparatus - are resilient to cyber attack, strengthening the UK as a sovereign nation and cementing its authority as a democratic and responsible cyber power. AIM: Government’s critical functions to be signicantly hardened to cyber attack by 2025, with all government organisations across the whole public sector being resilient to known vulnerabilities and attack methods no later than 2030. Pillar 1: Build organsational cyber resilience Pillar 2: ‘Defend as one’ Objective 5: Develop the right cyber security skills, knowledge and culture Objective 2: Protect against cyber attack FOCUS ON: A perpetually reinforcing ecosystem The strategy’s objectives set out the core components of cyber resilience that will guide cyber security efforts across government. These objectives are perpetually reinforced - through the governance and oversight of the strategy, the development and implementation of central and shared interventions, and through government cyber security assurance. As well as providing a consistent framework and common language for cyber security across government, establishing such a reinforcing ecosystem will provide a coherent and comprehensive picture of government cyber resilience that will continually refi ne and drive improvements where they are most needed.

Management of risk lies at the heart of this strategy. It is only when risk is understood that mitigations can be applied and investment prioritised. Accurate risk information is therefore critical to enabling accountable individuals to make effective risk- based decisions. It also provides the system-wide view needed to address systemic risks and to drive scaled interventions. 32. In order to manage cyber security risks, government organisations will be able to identify, assess and understand them. The foundation of this lies in the visibility and understanding of assets held and operated - whether that be infrastructure, digital services and applications, or data - and the threat to them. This visibility is the foundation from which an accurate assessment of risk can be derived. Clear accountability and robust assurance will ensure that risk owners are aware of the risks they have the responsibility to manage, and that they are doing so appropriately. Objective 1: Government will manage cyber security risk Government organisations will have risk management processes, governance and accountability in place to enable the effective identifi cation, assessment and management of their cyber security risks, with suffi cient overarching visibility to effectively manage systemic risk. Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 30 Governance and accountability Outcome 1: Government has established governance arrangements with clear accountability enabling effective management of cyber risks at all levels of government 33. To drive government risk management to the appropriate level requires changes and enhancements to governance and accountability across government. Cyber risk will be seen as an integral component of business risk and resilience management, with effective organisational cyber security management structures that enable government organisations to fully understand and account for the risks they own. This includes having established roles and responsibilities for their systems and services and clear channels for communicating and escalating risks to ensure that decision makers have the visibility required to make effective decisions. Most crucially, it requires clear and transparent accountability up to Accounting Officers and the executive board, to ensure that decision makers are informed and empowered to express their organisation’s risk position, as well as be held accountable for their risk decisions. 34. Lead government departments are best placed to understand the unique characteristics of the organisations within their purview and will construct the mechanisms to assess and articulate the macro cyber posture of those organisations, putting in place the appropriate governance arrangements to drive required improvements. 35. While Accounting Officers are responsible for their organisation’s risk, transparent central governance structures will maintain oversight and responsibility for cross-government cyber security risk, ensuring that systemic risks are identified and managed. 31 Chapter 3: Manage cyber security risk Assets and vulnerabilities Outcome 2: Government has comprehensive visibility and understanding of its digital assets enabling it to identify and manage vulnerabilities and the cyber security risks they present 36. Without comprehensive visibility of government’s IT, digital and data assets, as well as users, cyber security risks go unrecognised and unmanaged. Not only does this limited visibility restrict an organisation’s ability to protect its estate, it reduces government’s ability to identify and act on aggregated and systemic risks that could have a devastating impact on the functioning of government. 37. All government organisations will therefore have an active and automated asset discovery and management method in place to continuously determine what systems, hardware and software they own and operate - including those provided by suppliers - so that the potential risks to them can be managed. As government organisations migrate to cloud services they should take advantage of the available asset management tools which make it significantly easier for an organisation to know what it owns and operates, how they are configured, and where they are vulnerable. 38. Vulnerabilities in technology and digital services are introduced or discovered almost constantly. Government’s approach to managing these will, therefore, reflect this evolving landscape. Government will have the mechanisms in place to enable vulnerabilities to be rapidly identified, assessed and managed. This involves providing a clear path for anyone - whether a public sector employee, a commercial entity or a private individual - to highlight potential vulnerabilities, and robust vulnerability management programmes to be in place across all government organisations to ensure identified vulnerabilities are effectively managed across their IT estate. 39. Information about critical vulnerabilities will be securely shared across government, to ensure that all government organisations can take appropriate action. Effective information sharing will also provide a central view of critical vulnerabilities which will develop government’s visibility of dependencies across its systems and services, enabling the identification and management of more systemic issues, as well as facilitating rapid assessment, coordination and mitigation at scale. FOCUS ON: Cross-government vulnerability reporting service Government will develop a coherent and joined up cross-government vulnerability reporting service. This will enable the mature handling of, and response to, vulnerabilities which have the potential to impact government. Security researchers and members of the public will be able to easily and securely report vulnerabilities they identify on the government digital estate. Reports will be triaged and the appropriate government organisation will be notified of valid vulnerabilities received. Through this service government organisations will be able to accelerate their ability to find and fix vulnerabilities before adversaries can exploit them. By providing this capability centrally, government will, for the first time, be able to holistically tackle cyber security vulnerabilities at scale and pace across the public sector. Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 32 Data assets Outcome 3: Government has comprehensive visibility of the data it handles and shares so that it can appropriately assess and respond to the risks it presents 40. As well as IT assets, government organisations will have comprehensive visibility over their data assets. From personal data to classified information, data underpins all government IT and services and will be protected proportionate to the risk and in compliance with data protection legislation. Government organisations will therefore have a mature understanding of what data assets they handle, how they are stored or hosted, and where they are shared, so they can adequately assess the risks they present and ensure that sufficient protections are put in place to manage them. Supply chain risk Outcome 4: Government understands and manages risks emanating from commercial suppliers 41. Commercially provided products and services play an integral part in delivering government’s functions and services. As government supply chains become increasingly expansive and interconnected, vulnerabilities in suppliers’ systems, and in the products and services they deliver, present increasingly attractive opportunities to adversaries seeking to gain access to government networks. Recognising this growing risk, government will take steps to better understand its dependencies on suppliers and ensure that their products and services are integrated into government systems in a way that takes full account of their impacts on security and resilience. In doing so, government will be an exemplar in the procurement and deployment of commercial products and services, becoming a stimulus to improve the broader ecosystem of such suppliers across the UK. 42. Central mapping of government’s critical and common suppliers will enable the identification and coordinated management of systemic and aggregate supply chain risks to government. Supply chain cyber security principles will establish clear requirements for these suppliers, with the expectation that they provide transparent statements of adherence. Government will also make full use of its established commercial relationships and aggregate spending power to ensure that its key suppliers deliver on these principles. As well as reinforcing appropriate and proportionate cyber security controls and behaviours, such central oversight will promote standard requirements and provide shared assurances that will reduce duplication and drive efficiencies for both government organisations and their suppliers. 33 Chapter 3: Manage cyber security risk 43. While such action will significantly raise the expectations placed on critical and cross- government suppliers, requirements should also be proportionate and robust for smaller and more bespoke suppliers, building from Cyber Essentials as a foundational tool to gain confidence that relevant suppliers have appropriate protections in place. Alignment between commercial and security functions will ensure that cyber security is part of every procurement process, enabling commercial teams to clearly articulate the cyber security requirements based on an understanding of risk. Cyber security requirements in government procurement frameworks and contracts will be strengthened, ensuring that commercial arrangements are risk based and consistent with robust clauses relating to the identification and management of subcontractors. This will make it easier to procure tools and services with appropriate security by default. 44. Improved understanding of suppliers and their dependencies will also enable government to better respond to cyber security incidents that emanate from the supply chain. Such understanding will provide oversight of cross-government impacts and enable more focused and efficient engagements with the suppliers, ensuring that any incident is managed swiftly and efficiently. The GCCC will play a critical role in facilitating this. FOCUS ON: Cyber security in government contracts Government is developing security schedules that can be easily applied to a variety of common procurement scenarios - from bespoke builds deployed on third party infrastructure to generic consultancy agreements. These schedules will support government organisations in requesting proportionate cyber security measures in government contracts, as well as conducting regular assurance against them. These security schedules will be made available across government so that government organisations have access to relevant and manageable security clauses. This will ensure that appropriate security measures - proportional to the risk - are included in all government contracts. Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 34 Threat information Outcome 5: Government understands the threat it faces relative to its functions in order to plan appropriate mitigations, at both an organisational and cross-government level 45. As well as government’s ability to understand what it has and how it is vulnerable, it will also understand the threat to it in order to arrive at an accurate assessment of risk. The seamless collation and dissemination of threat information is crucial as it provides those responsible for defending systems and networks with the strategic, tactical, technical and operational detail needed to predict and defend against attacks. 46. Government organisations will therefore have the ability to receive and utilise such threat information, as well as the capability to generate it from the monitoring of their system in a systematised manner - automated wherever possible. Threat information generated locally will be enhanced by the coherent use of government and private sector threat information. 47. Central mechanisms will be in place to facilitate more comprehensive, targeted and, where possible, automated, threat information sharing across government. This will enable government organisations to make effective prioritisation decisions based on up-to-date information. FOCUS ON: Countering Threats The National Cyber Strategy sets out the UK’s objective to detect, investigate and share information on state, criminal and other malicious cyber actors and activities in order to protect the UK, its interests and its citizens. This will involve: • maintaining a comprehensive understanding of the cyber capabilities of state, criminal and other malicious cyber actors and their strategic intent towards the UK; • ensuring that the most serious state, criminal and other threats are routinely and comprehensively investigated, drawing on all sources of information and bringing together expertise across government, law enforcement and the private sector; and • enabling information and data on the threat to be routinely shared at scale and pace. Government organisations will be both a customer and contributor to these efforts, taking full advantage of the knowledge that exists across the UK to provide a deeper understanding of the threat. 35 Chapter 3: Manage cyber security risk Cyber security data Outcome 6: Government organisations have timely access to relevant and actionable cyber security data that enhances their ability to make effective risk management decisions 48. Cyber security data is an invaluable commodity, including essential information about the threats and vulnerabilities that government needs to understand in order to effectively manage the risks it faces. The need for all government organisations to have access to relevant and actionable cyber security data is paramount, but while some parts of government are incredibly data rich, others do not have access to the cyber security data that they need to make effective risk-based decisions. 49. As well as making better use of existing cyber security data - from sources such as cross-government services, organisational systems and endpoint logging and monitoring - greater value will be extracted from analysis of aggregate data, with enhanced dissemination of critical insights to those who need to respond to them. The newly established GCCC will play a fundamental role in facilitating this, by ensuring that targeted cyber security data is shared across government - in a way that is appropriate to its classification and legal status - and supporting organisations to effectively consume it. Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 36 Government cyber security assurance Outcome 7: Government cyber security assurance provides government with the visibility it needs to make effective decisions and the confidence that it has appropriate cyber security measures in place to manage the risks to its functions 50. Cyber security assurance is needed to provide visibility of cyber security risk across government organisations as well as the confidence that those risks are being appropriately and proportionately managed. To achieve this, a government cyber security assurance process will provide consistent and independently verified assurance against government CAF profiles.11 Focusing on an organisation’s most important functions, including critical national infrastructure, it will provide an objective way of assessing whether an organisation’s cyber security assessment and management of cyber security risk is proportionate and within accepted risk tolerances. This assurance process will be further verified and augmented through real world testing and exercising, such as penetration testing and red teaming. Outcomes of assurance activities will be machine readable wherever possible, facilitating automated analysis of the impact on cyber security. 51. While these assurance processes will be mandated for central government departments, it will provide a model that lead government departments and devolved governments may adapt and apply across the public sector organisations in their purview. 52. The visibility over government’s cyber security posture provided by this assurance will give government the overarching confidence that cyber security risks to its functions are being managed sufficiently. It will also highlight common issues and challenges at scale, enabling cost effective and targeted intervention. 11 See ‘Transformational proposal: Enhanced cyber security assurance’ for more detail 37 Chapter 3: Manage cyber security risk Private sector and international partnerships Outcome 8: Strategic partnerships with the private sector and international partners are further embedded to enhance proactive defence at a global scale 53. Government relies on partnerships with the private sector and international allies to strengthen its cyber resilience. This influence spans from the third-party products and services that government procures and deploys through to the development of new technologies and the future governance of cyberspace. 54. Given the fundamental role that private sector partners have in the development, operation and delivery of government functions, it is crucial that critical cyber security challenges are tackled collaboratively. Government will therefore continue to develop its partnerships with private sector organisations and academia to enhance its resilience across all aspects of security; building trusted relationships and shared outcomes. 55. As highlighted in the National Cyber Strategy, the cyber domain transcends international boundaries. Sharing knowledge and expertise with international allies will increase collective ability to understand and defend against common adversaries, in turn strengthening collective and global cyber resilience. Government will continue to build partnerships with its allies to achieve shared objectives. Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 38 Chapter 4: Protecting against cyber attack Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 38 39 Chapter 4: Protect against cyber attack 56. Protecting government effectively from cyber attack is dependent on its understanding of risk. Directly responding to risks faced will ensure that government is an increasingly hardened target for any adversary. 57. The protective stance of individual government organisations will be inextricably linked to its assessment and management of risk. While it will never be possible to protect against all attacks, those accountable will be able to demonstrate that they have appropriately considered those risks and responded accordingly. Objective 2: Government will protect against cyber attack Government’s understanding of cyber security risk will inform the adoption of proportionate security measures across government organisations, with centrally developed capabilities enabling protection at scale. Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 40 Secure technology and digital services Outcome 9: Government adopts a common approach to ‘secure by design’ to ensure that appropriate and proportionate cyber security measures are embedded within the technology government uses, and that the security of digital services is continually assured throughout their lifecycle 58. Government relies on a range of technologies to operate its functions and deliver digital services. These include both commodity and bespoke components that present cyber security risks, which need to be managed through their lifecycle. To do this, government will adopt a ‘secure by design’ framework that will ensure all technology and digital services are planned, procured, designed, built, operated, modified and decommissioned securely, enabling them to be consistently and continuously assured against best practice and robust standards. 59. This ‘secure by design’ framework will further enable government to take advantage of industry innovation by enhancing its ability to test, pilot, and deploy commercial tools, services and capabilities that make a marked improvement of government’s security and efficiency. 60. The ability to protect against evolving vulnerabilities and threats is constrained by the presence of legacy and vulnerable IT across the government’s IT estate. Government will therefore continue its efforts to manage, upgrade or remove such IT and put the necessary safeguards and ongoing investment in place to ensure government IT is sufficiently secure throughout its entire lifecycle. 41 Chapter 4: Protect against cyber attack FOCUS ON: A ‘secure by design’ framework for government The government’s ‘secure by design’ framework will cement the discipline of embedding cyber security into digital systems and services at every step of their lifecycle - from the planning of a service, to the procurement and configuration of technology and its decommissioning at the end of its operational life. The framework will provide a continuous and iterative process for security, ensuring that there is a consistent, comprehensive and proportionate process to manage cyber security risk through the entire lifecycle, while providing a consistent framework for continuous security assurance. It will ensure that developers of digital services have security experts embedded within their teams to provide continuous security advice, rather than relying on ad-hoc security advice at the end of a project. This process will be incorporated within the Service Standard12 and Infrastructure and Projects Authority gated process13 to ensure cyber security is an integral part of creating public services. Secure by design blueprints, patterns, design principles and best practices will also be published to ensure that wider public sector organisations have a clear understanding of what is expected for securing the services they design, deliver and operate. A critical component of government’s ‘secure by design’ approach is ensuring that any technology procured by government has an appropriate level of cyber security. These ‘secure by design’ principles will therefore be baked into the Technology Code of Practice14 which, through the government spend controls processes15, will ensure that all technology used by government is appropriately securable. 12 HMG; ‘Service Standard’ 13 HMG; ‘Infrastructure and Projects Authority: assurance review toolkit’ 14 Central Digital and Data Office; ‘The Technology Code of Practice’ 15 Central Digital and Data Office; ‘Digital and technology spend controls’ Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 42 Cyber security controls Outcome 10: Government organisations deploy cyber security controls commensurate with their risk profi le to ensure that risks to their functions are managed proportionately 61. While secure technology provides the foundations of effective cyber security, appropriate and proportionate security controls will also be put in place. While many security controls will be common across all government organisations, such as appropriate access controls, the broader set of requirements will respond to threats faced. 62. The threats faced by an organisation’s important functions will therefore determine the appropriate CAF profi le as part of the government’s assurance process. That CAF profi le will defi ne the outcomes required to appropriately manage the risk posed by the threat. Achieving those proportionate outcomes will depend on the application of particular controls which will be clearly signposted to government organisations, alongside appropriate policies and guidance. While lead government departments will be able to apply such an approach in a way that is most appropriate, they will be able to draw from such processes, guidance and support. 63. Higher classifi cation systems provide the additional cyber security controls required to handle information classifi ed above OFFICIAL. These systems are centrally managed and assured to maintain the appropriate level of cyber security. Figure 7: Appropriate and proportionate access controls 43 Chapter 4: Protect against cyber attack 43 Chapter 4: Protect against cyber attack Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 44 Secure configuration Outcome 11: Government technology is appropriately configured, with standard profiles for common technology and architectures being developed and continuously updated Shared capabilities Outcome 12: Shared capabilities, tools and services tackle ‘common’ cyber security issues at scale 64. Technology and digital services are only as secure as their architecture and configuration allow. While adopting a comprehensive ‘secure by design’ approach will address some of this risk, a designer, administrator or user always has a responsibility to appropriately configure a system or service to meet security requirements. Doing so incorrectly can leave systems and data unprotected or easily open to compromise. This risk will become increasingly acute as government continues its digital transformation. 65. To reduce this risk, secure by design configuration patterns and capabilities for prominent products and services will be developed in partnership with suppliers and promoted across government to ensure that common products and services are configured correctly. These configurations will be easily auditable, enabling cross- government visibility to identify aggregate risks and respond to identified threats at pace and scale. 66. A core component of this strategy’s ‘defend as one’ pillar is the necessity of harnessing shared capabilities, tools and services to disproportionately improve government cyber security as well as provide value for money. Whether that be centralised work to protect gov.uk domains for the whole public sector, or the development and increased availability of Active Cyber Defence tools and services, such efforts either reduce the risk faced by government organisations or support them in managing it efficiently and effectively. 67. Government will therefore continue to develop and scale-up such capabilities. Coordination and collaboration are key to this, both to ensure that solutions are targeted where they are most needed and to enable government to foster innovation to drive improved cyber security at scale. FOCUS ON: Secure configuration of government’s productivity suites Government will work with its primary providers of productivity suites to further develop baseline security configurations for government organisations to follow and adapt. Doing so will ensure that all government organisations understand how to configure their productivity suites to provide a baseline level of cyber security, which will dramatically reduce common risks caused by misconfiguration. 45 Chapter 4: Protect against cyber attack FOCUS ON: Active Cyber Defence Active Cyber Defence is an NCSC programme that seeks to ‘protect the majority of people in the UK from the majority of the harm caused by the majority of the cyber attacks the majority of the time’. There is a specific intent to tackle, in a relatively automated way, a significant proportion of the cyber attacks that impact government systems. Active Cyber Defence is complementary to, and does not replace, system owners’ investment in good cyber security. It is made up of a growing number of capabilities, including: • Capabilities to detect and disrupt threats – by identifying malicious activity at scale and/or instigating an automated response to disrupt it. These include: • Takedown Service – finds malicious sites and notifies owners to get them removed • Protective DNS – blocks inadvertent access to domains or IPs that are known to contain malicious content, and malware already on a network attempting to call home • Host Based Capability – analyses technical metadata on hosts, such as laptops and servers, across government departments for malicious activity to make OFFICIAL systems a harder target [see ‘FOCUS ON: Host Based Capability’ for more detail) • Cyber Threat Intelligence Adaptor – enables authorised organisations to receive a high-quality, contextually rich, cyber threat intelligence feed from the NCSC • Capabilities to provide self-service checks and alerts – making it simpler for organisations to check and improve their security posture. These include: • Early Warning – helps organisations investigate cyber attacks on their network by notifying them of malicious activity detected in information feeds • Mail Check – helps organisations assess their email security compliance and adopt secure email standards • Web Check – helps owners of public sector websites to identify and fix common security issues, making sites a less attractive target to attackers • Exercise in a Box – provides a toolkit of realistic scenarios that helps organisations practise and refine their response to cyber security incidents in a safe environment This list is by no means exhaustive and the number of capabilities continues to evolve.16 Focused investment in selected Active Cyber Defence capabilities will be a key part of the success of this strategy. This includes targeted development and extended coverage for wider public sector organisation, and new capabilities responding to emerging developments in technology and adversary tradecraft. 16 NCSC; ‘Active Cyber Defence: the fourth year’; May 2021 Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 46 Information and data security Outcome 13: Government data is classified appropriately and handled and shared in a way commensurate to the risk it presents 68. Government has a responsibility to protect data, whether classified information or the personal data that it handles and shares to deliver its functions and services. Government will therefore handle, share, and store or host its data assets in a way that is proportionate to the risks they present. 69. At the heart of this is the effective classification of information based on agreed threat models and a comprehensive assessment of risks associated with the information being handled. Central classifications policy sets out the criteria and the required handling instructions for information classified at different tiers. FOCUS ON: Classifications policy Government will update the Security Classifications Policy to improve the handling of information at the OFFICIAL tier and ensure that the most sensitive information held at this tier is adequately and consistently protected. It will also provide departments and individual users with clearer guidance, especially on new capabilities and changes to ways of working, so they can better protect classified information. FOCUS ON: Security in data sharing The National Data Strategy17 sets out the government’s mission to transform its use of data to drive efficiency and improve public services. To achieve this, the government is undertaking an ambitious and radical transformation of its own approach, driving major improvements in the way information is efficiently managed, used and shared across government. As well as demanding robust data standards that drive consistency and interoperability, government will ensure that data protection and security is at the heart of its approach. 17 HMG; ‘National Data Strategy’; December 2020 47 Chapter 4: Protect against cyber attack 70. The majority of government information is classified as OFFICIAL and is dependent upon the technology and controls outlined above. However, there will be occasions where the threat model requires certain information to be protected at a higher classification, for which the commodity technology available for OFFICIAL information is not suitable. To account for this need, government will continue to develop a ‘full-stack’ solution that enables a suitably secure, collaborative and user- friendly way of working across government at the appropriate classification. 71. Where sensitive data has to be processed on OFFICIAL systems in order to perform a business function, protections will be put in place that are commensurate to the risks presented. FOCUS ON: Rosa Rosa is the cross-government SECRET IT service. Since its launch it has been adopted by an increasing number of users for an increasing number of use cases, reaching over 12,000 users and 74 departments in 2021. Government will build on this success by continuing to invest in Rosa to ensure that it continues to meet the growing needs of its users. As well as making it significantly easier to handle government information at the appropriate classification, the increasing provision of Rosa will mean it is less likely that information is under- classified, making it much more difficult for adversaries to access and exploit. Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 48 FOCUS ON: Harnessing emerging technologies The pace of technological change presents both challenges and opportunities for government cyber security. Government must be able to apply such technologies to enhance its cyber security capabilities across the government, while ensuring that its application is as secure as it needs to be. Artificial Intelligence (AI) AI is a form of software that can learn to solve problems at a scale and speed impossible for humans and is becoming an integral part of modern systems. In cybersecurity, AI has three distinct aspects: • Use of AI to secure systems. Many AI algorithms are complex and opaque, with the potential to introduce new classes of vulnerability. Understanding and mitigating these emerging threats is a priority. • Use of AI to improve cybersecurity threat detection and, in some cases, to enable automated response to threats. • Recognising and mitigating AI-based attacks from adversaries. The Office for Artificial Intelligence is a joint BEIS-DCMS unit responsible for overseeing implementation of the wider National AI Strategy.18 In addition, the Alan Turing Institute and similar bodies are researching how we might build and use AI in a more ethical, responsible manner. Government is committed to creating and using AI in a way that supports security, fairness, empowerment, transparency and accountability. Quantum Quantum computers use properties of quantum mechanics to compute in a fundamentally different way from today’s ‘classical’ computers. They are, theoretically, capable of performing certain computations that would not be feasible for classical computers. ‘Quantum-safe cryptography’ replaces the quantum-vulnerable mathematical problems with those believed to be intractable for both classical and quantum computers. ‘Quantum-safe cryptography’ using standards-compliant products will therefore provide the most effective mitigation for the serious threat that quantum computers pose to long- term cryptographic security, and will be deployed across government when required. Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 48 18 HMG; ‘National AI Strategy’; September 2021 49 Chapter 4: Protect against cyber attack FOCUS ON: Advanced protections The thrust of this strategy is about ensuring government reaches and maintains a level of resilience that is proportional to its risk. However, it is recognised that the most sophisticated actors may be able to overcome robust cyber security measures given enough investment and determination. Government will deploy its full spectrum of capabilities to respond to the most sophisticated threats. Such capabilities will include advanced protection and detection techniques, as well as targeted use of government’s offensive cyber capability and broader international and diplomatic efforts to disrupt and deter such threats. 49 Chapter 4: Protect against cyber attack Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 50 Chapter 5: Detecting cyber events Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 50 51 Chapter 5: Detect cyber security events 72. Despite robust protections being put in place, evolving adversary techniques and the discovery of unknown vulnerabilities means that cyber attacks will still occur. To respond to the changing threat landscape, government requires comprehensive detection capabilities to identify emerging risks so that they can be managed. 73. Building on the foundation of risk management and commensurate protective measures, government will develop its capability to detect cyber security events across every part of its estate to ensure that the risks can be mitigated before they critically impact government functions. Objective 3: Government will detect cyber security events Government has the capability to monitor its systems, networks and services to detect cyber security events before they become incidents. Enhanced coordination will enable government to have the agility to use these data inputs to detect at pace and scale, facilitating coherent responses as well as providing the capabilities to detect more sophisticated attacks. Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 52 Detection within government organisations Outcome 14: Government networks, systems, applications and end points are monitored to provide proportionate internal detection capability 74. To adequately fulfil their responsibilities to manage their risks, every government organisation will have proportionate monitoring capabilities as well as the ability to retain and interrogate logs to facilitate the detection of cyber threats. Monitoring should be as holistic as possible - from the monitoring of underpinning infrastructure, such as domains, through to host-based monitoring of end points and cloud-based services, and the monitoring of privileged accounts on an organisation’s network and in its supply chain. To achieve this, smaller organisations may form part of a larger conglomerate, particularly within sectors orchestrated by lead government departments. 75. Government will establish a common process and language for organisations to record and share information about cyber security incidents and ‘near misses’ - in a machine-readable format. This will ensure that there is consistency and comparability across government organisations as well as allowing for enhanced visibility that will improve government’s ability to learn, adapt and mitigate at scale. 76. The detection capabilities of government organisations will continue to evolve, particularly for those departments who have lower risk tolerances. In such circumstances, more advanced detection methods, such as behavioural monitoring, will be deployed to detect more sophisticated attacks. FOCUS ON: Host Based Capability (HBC) HBC is a service run by NCSC, designed to make OFFICIAL systems a harder target. Technical metadata on hosts, such as laptops and servers, across government departments is analysed using specialised knowledge and tradecraft at NCSC. HBC is provided as a three-part service: • Detect: HBC takes a sector-focused view of the threats departments face. It uses NCSC’s knowledge of indicators, adversary tactics, techniques and procedures to detect malicious activity. • Threat Surface: Reporting provides metrics to help departments understand and improve their IT cyber hygiene. • Forewarn: HBC seeks to warn departments about their exposure to major vulnerabilities. HBC’s use across government will continue to scale, with future developments including cloud-based capability, and responses to shifts in technology and attacker tradecraft. 53 Chapter 5: Detect cyber security events Detection at scale Outcome 15: Shared detection capability provides detection at scale across government 77. Effective detection capability requires the timely sharing of information across the whole of government, so that events identified in one organisation can be mitigated across all others. The mechanisms will be established to ensure that this information can be easily and securely shared, in an automated way, with an expectation placed on organisations to escalate alerts swiftly with clear and defined paths for doing so. Getting this right is critical to identifying, managing and mitigating emerging threats at the scale and pace required. 78. To enhance the detection and identification of more sophisticated actors on government networks and systems, a programme of strategic threat hunting will be established which will include the exploration of more advanced capabilities such as deception tactics and honeypots. Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 54 Chapter 6: Minimising the impact of cyber security incidents Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 54 55 Chapter 6: Minimise the impact of cyber security incidents 79. Even with robust protection and detection measures in place, government will be impacted by cyber security incidents. It is therefore essential that government is able to rapidly respond to cyber incidents when they do happen and minimise their impact as far as possible. 80. Effective risk management, appropriate and proportionate protective measures, and enhanced detection capability will make government a considerably hardened target. However, government will also improve its ability to respond and recover from incidents when they do happen to ensure the continuity of essential functions and services. Objective 4: Government will minimise the impact of cyber security incidents Cyber security incidents will be swiftly contained, assessed and managed, enabling rapid mitigation response across government. Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 56 Response preparation Outcome 16: Government is fully prepared to respond to cyber incidents Incident response Outcome 17: Government rapidly responds to cyber incidents, both organisationally and across government 81. Organisational and cross-government cyber security incident response plans will clearly set out how government will respond to an incident to minimise its impact. Organisational plans will be routinely exercised through table-top scenario planning and red, blue and purple term activities, being updated as required to ensure that they are fit for purpose and continue to reflect the current threat environment. 82. Cross-government exercising will also be routinely carried out to ensure that senior leadership teams across government - including wider public sector organisations that deliver critical services - are practised and prepared to lead the response to cyber incidents that may impact multiple organisations across the public sector. 83. Government organisations - either directly or through support of another government organisation - will have the structures and capabilities in place to triage cyber security incidents and rapidly assess their impact. Having clear escalation pathways is a crucial part of this, to ensure that the right people are made aware - both within the organisation and beyond - and the right expertise and resource is made available. 84. Central incident response functions will have the capacity and capability to manage serious and cross-government cyber security incidents with defined processes and mechanisms in place to ensure that all impacted parties are working collaboratively to minimise the impact. The GCCC will play a critical role. 57 Chapter 6: Minimise the impact of cyber security incidents Incident recovery Outcome 18: Government restores systems and assets affected by cyber security incidents and resumes the operation of its functions with minimal disruption Lessons learned Outcome 19: Lessons learned from cyber incidents drive improvements in government’s cyber security 85. As well as being prepared and able to respond to cyber security incidents, government will be able to recover from them as quickly as necessary so that any disruptions to its functions are minimised. 86. Enacted response plans will ensure that an organisation can assess the risk from an incident using appropriate expertise and taking the necessary steps to resume its functions to an acceptable level within tolerable periods of disruption. 87. Following the completion of incident response processes, central oversight of recovery from the most severe incidents will ensure that systemic risks are identified and mitigated. 88. To continue to drive improvements in cyber security, government will learn lessons from every cyber security incident and event - from serious incidents to ‘near misses’. 89. Government will be able to objectively learn from serious and cross-government cyber security incidents, with the most significant incidents being subject to an independent review to provide sufficient scrutiny. 90. Just as importantly, government will learn lessons from less serious events and ‘near misses’. At the heart of this is the creation of a culture where cyber security colleagues feel confident sharing such information across government, without fear of embarrassment or blame. Doing so will ensure that government understands the root causes of incidents and can diagnose and communicate solutions to the whole of government to enhance its collective cyber resilience. Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 58 Chapter 7: Developing the right cyber security skills, knowledge and culture Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 58 59 Chapter 7: Develop the right cyber security skills, knowledge and culture 91. Achieving this strategy’s vision and aim will not be possible without appropriately skilled people, including those working in technical, policy and strategy, risk management, and leadership roles. In line with the objectives set out in the National Cyber Strategy, government will lead by example in boosting the scale, diversity and quality of cyber security professionals across government organisations, while fostering a cyber security cultural shift that will facilitate sustainable change. 92. There is diversity in the breadth and depth of cyber security skills required across government. These include deep technical skills and the non-technical cyber security skills that are needed across other specialisms and professions, such as digital, policy, commercial and assurance. Guided by the standards and pathways established by the UK Cyber Security Council, government will develop its understanding of the range of cyber security skills and knowledge required across government and will respond accordingly, ensuring that its workforce is inclusive and diverse. 93. This aspiration is, however, set within the context of a national cyber security skills gap19. The focus is therefore placed on investing in and building those skills from a multitude of entry points with a consistent career offer across government to aid recruitment and retention while reducing reliance on contractors. The continued creation of leading learning opportunities will further develop the profession, strengthening government’s employment offer and its ability to compete. 94. While the government security profession is focused on improving the cyber security profession across government departments, it mutually supports cyber security skills initiatives across the public sector, as well as providing a framework for wider public sector organisations to understand and manage their cyber security skills requirements. 19 Ipsos MORI / DCMS; ‘Cyber Security Skills in the UK Labour Market 2021’; March 2021 Objective 5: Government will develop the right cyber security skills, knowledge and culture Government has suffi cient, skilled and knowledgeable professionals to fulfi l all required cyber security needs. This extends beyond technical cyber security experts to the breadth of professional functions that must incorporate cyber security into the services they provide - underpinned by a cyber security culture that promotes sustainable change. Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 60 95. Achieving sustainable change also demands a shift in cyber security culture, to one that encourages and empowers people to challenge, question, learn and drive continuous improvement. Central to this is the creation of inclusive environments and the attraction and development of a diverse security workforce that reflects the wider UK population. Skills requirements Outcome 20: All government cyber security skills requirements are understood 96. Government will have a comprehensive understanding of the volume and range of cyber security skills and knowledge - both technical and non-technical - required to enable it to function with the required resilience. As well as informing the development of government workforce and resourcing strategies, this understanding will support and align with the work of the UK Cyber Security Council to ensure that consistent taxonomies, standards and pathways are developed and adopted for the cyber security profession across the UK. FOCUS ON: Cyber security skills as part of the UK ‘cyber ecosystem’ Strengthening the UK cyber ecosystem by investing in people and skills and deepening the partnership between government, academia and industry is one of the central pillars of the National Cyber Strategy. Cyber security skills are a fundamental component of that ecosystem and the National Cyber Strategy sets out the clear objective to enhance and expand the nation’s cyber skills at every level. This includes: • A significant increase in the number of people who have the skills they need to enter the cyber workforce; • A higher quality and more established, recognised and structured cyber security profession; • A more diverse cyber workforce; and • A steady and diverse flow of highly skilled people coming through our education system. Government is a key part of this ecosystem and its efforts to develop the right cyber security skills and knowledge will align with broader national efforts to enhance the UK’s cyber ecosystem. 61 Chapter 7: Develop the right cyber security skills, knowledge and culture Attracting and retaining talent Outcome 21: Government attracts and retains the diverse cyber security workforce it needs to be resilient 97. As well as the gap in cyber security skills in the UK20, the cyber security workforce continues to lack the diversity it needs.21 Attracting and retaining a government workforce that truly represents different genders and ages, social, cultural and ethnic backgrounds, as well neurodiversity, is essential to providing the spectrum of perspectives and the creativity needed to tackle the increasing diversity of threats faced. 98. Government will use its developing understanding of its workforce, in the context of the wider UK cyber security workforce, to develop its approach to attracting and retaining talent. The development of apprenticeship and graduate programmes, combined with an extensive outreach programme to target underrepresented groups, will continue to attract cyber security talent into entry level roles. However, the majority of skills shortages across in the UK, including government, are found among more senior positions.22 The adoption of a single cyber capability pay framework across government, linked to accreditation, will ensure that pay is directly linked to skill level. This will enable government to better compete with the private sector and attract talent into all required positions, as well as providing commonality across government departments. Cyber security careers will be further incentivised through a range of initiatives, with a drive towards strengthening a culture of inclusion and improving representation. 99. Government also recognises that cyber security talent can be found in every corner of the UK, with particular hotspots of cyber security firms found in the South East, the North West, the South West and Scotland.23 To boost regional growth in the sector, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) is working closely with regional cyber security clusters, supporting their development and improving reach and insight into local and regional cyber security sector ecosystems. There are now over twenty established and emerging cyber security cluster organisations in the UK that are promoting and investing in cyber security. To support these efforts, and to tap into these regional talent pools, government has already begun to establish its own centres of cyber security expertise across different regions of the UK and will continue to invest in more regional security centres. 20 Ipsos MORI / DCMS; ‘Cyber Security Skills in the UK Labour Market 2021’; March 2021 21 NCSC / KPMG; ‘Decrypting Diversity: Diversity and inclusion in cyber security’; 2020 22 IPSOS MORI/DCMS; ‘Cyber Security Skills in the UK Labour Market 2021’; March 2021 23 IPSOS MORI/DCMS; ‘UK Cyber Security Sectoral Analysis 2021’; February 2021 FOCUS ON: Cyber workforce and resourcing hub service Government will move to an in-house cyber workforce and resourcing hub service to improve recruitment outcomes and reduce the use of contractors. This includes working closely with external partners to build a strong brand as well as targeted recruitment and marketing of opportunities to improve diversity outcomes. Central oversight of the cyber workforce will enable a more flexible model and greater movement across government. Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 62 Develop talent Outcome 22: Government continuously develops its cyber security workforce to ensure that it has and retains the skills it needs 100. Working with the UK Cyber Security Council, government will continue to develop comprehensive career pathways for its cyber security professionals. These pathways will provide diverse and fulfilling cyber security careers with a full development and learning offer. 101. Key to this will be the introduction of a skills assessment tool that will allow government to map the cyber security skills gap against key roles with a view to developing centrally funded learning programmes. Through the creation of such comprehensive learning curricula, government will drive the professionalisation of cyber security roles. This will be supported by partnerships with recognised learning academies and security institutions, ensuring that learning is consistent and accessible to those public sector organisations with less resources to invest in training. 102. A strong focus will be placed on developing an approach to accreditation that is linked to recruitment and promotion. This will ensure the status of the profession is recognised both inside and outside of the public sector, and that skills are developed in-line with national standards as defined by the UK Cyber Security Council. 103. As well as more formal career pathways, a focus will be placed on strengthening government’s leadership community to ensure they have the skills required. This will be part of our approach to build the cyber security community across government, to facilitate and encourage the sharing of ideas and approaches, as well as lessons learned when things go wrong. Creating the right communities will break down barriers and enable cyber security colleagues from across government to develop individual talent as well as collective expertise. FOCUS ON: Establishing a government security learning academy Government will establish a learning academy aimed at upskilling government security professionals and the wider civil service. Among other security disciplines, it will develop both technical and non-technical skills, providing masterclasses and access to qualifications, linking up with professional bodies and academia to assure in-house skills through skills assessment and accreditation. 63 Chapter 7: Develop the right cyber security skills, knowledge and culture Cyber security knowledge across other government functions Outcome 23: Sufficient cyber security knowledge and awareness across government’s professional functions ensures that cyber security is actively taken into consideration Cyber security culture Outcome 24: Government has a cyber security culture that empowers its people to learn, question and challenge, enabling continuous improvements in behaviours and resulting in sustainable change 104. The need for cyber security applies to all domains and needs to be given appropriate consideration across all professional functions, from the Digital, Data and Technology (DDaT) profession through to government’s commercial and legal functions. While the degree of expertise required will vary depending on the function in question, having an appropriate knowledge of cyber security is essential. 105. Government will develop its understanding of these requirements and will work across other professions to improve cyber security knowledge and awareness, with a particular focus on senior leaders. 106. People and organisational culture are at the heart of reducing risk. To truly make a difference, it is essential to focus on people as well as technology. This effort begins with improving cyber security awareness and knowledge across all public sector workers, reinforcing the expectations of public servants and embedding cyber security awareness into public service values. Government will provide tailored advice and implement a broad range of awareness-raising initiatives to ensure that all public sector workers can better protect themselves and the government organisations they work for. 107. Government will build on these foundations to create a positive cyber security culture that promotes and empowers its people to proactively engage on the organisational cyber security risk. Leadership, communication and consistency are key to this, both departmentally and across government. Transparent reporting structures will make it easy to report and all reporting will be handled confidentially and sensitively. Mistakes will not be stigmatised and incidents will be objectively understood with findings used as development and learning opportunities. People will be kept informed of progress and benefits to the organisation will be highlighted and celebrated. Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 64 Chapter 8: Measuring success Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 64 65 Chapter 8: Measuring success 108. This strategy sets out how government will build and maintain its resilience in the face of continuously evolving cyber risks. At its heart is the aim for government’s critical functions to be significantly hardened to cyber attack by 2025, with all government organisations across the whole public sector being resilient to known vulnerabilities and attack methods no later than 2030. Achieving this aim will mean that government as a whole will present a hardened target, enabling government functions to operate without undue disruption and cementing the UK’s authority as a leading democratic and responsible cyber power. 109. This is an ambitious aim. To achieve the level of organised and objective visibility of cyber security risk across the whole of government will require extensive processes, mechanisms and partnerships to be established. The task is complicated by the varying levels of maturity, capability and capacity that exist across government organisations. This is particularly pertinent for lead government departments, who, as well as considering their own cyber security posture, must also consider the cyber security posture of the public sector organisations in their purview. 110. Given the dynamic and complex nature of cyber security vulnerabilities and the continuous evolution of cyber attack tactics, techniques and procedures, accounting for known vulnerabilities is challenging. Further to this, ‘known’ vulnerabilities cannot simply refer to publicly disclosed security flaws, but must also account for improper security practices that unduly expose an organisation to cyber attack. While measuring cyber security is challenging, establishing a coherent government cyber security assurance framework, with tiered government CAF profiles underpinned by government-specific cyber threat profiles, will provide a robust and consistent means of assessing cyber resilience in a way that is proportional to threats faced. 111. The strategy’s aim will therefore be achieved when all government organisations meet the outcomes set out in the appropriate CAF profile under the government’s cyber security assurance framework in the following timeframes: • Government organisations that are determined to be responsible for critical functions will meet the outcomes set out in an ‘Enhanced’ CAF profile by 2025. • All central government departments will meet outcomes set out in their designated CAF profiles by 2026. • All other government organisations will meet outcomes set out in a ‘Basic’ CAF profile by 2030. 112. Progress towards this aim will be clearly monitored, both to demonstrate the successful impact of the strategy and to highlight areas where particular focus is required. The following indicators will be used to measure progress towards the aim: • The proportion of government organisations in scope that have identified their critical functions. • The proportion of government organisations in scope whose critical functions have been assessed against the government assurance framework. • The proportion of government organisations in scope whose assurance outcomes are assessed as achieved. Achieving the aim Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 66 114. It is recognised, however, that these measures and indicators alone are not sufficient to provide a complete picture of government resilience. These broad measures will therefore be underpinned by a number of more granular KPIs that draw from the strategy’s objectives and will guide the delivery of this strategy. 115. A number of key principles will be applied to guide the use of KPIs, ensuring that they are consistent, appropriate, and provide the oversight and transparency needed to demonstrate genuine success, as well as hold government to account. 116. The required outcomes will also be underpinned by cross-government policies. The impact of such policies will be monitored and measured, with regular and robust evaluation. Taken together, these measures will provide a comprehensive picture of government’s cyber resilience. 113. As the cyber threat and risk environment continues to evolve, it is essential to ensure that the outcomes demanded of government organisations remain appropriate. All CAF profiles, and the government specific threat profiles that underpin them, will therefore be periodically reviewed to ensure the required outcomes are sufficient to maintain cyber resilience in face of evolving risks. Doing so will maintain the integrity of the aim of this strategy and make sure that achievement of required outcomes remains a strong indicator of government resilience. Maintaining an appropriate measure of resilience Underpinning key performance indicators (KPIs) FOCUS ON: Principles of performance measurement • KPIs will place a minimum burden on government organisations. • Data generation will be automated or based on preplanned and agreed timelines wherever possible. • KPIs will be achievable. • KPIs will not be pursued at the expense of genuine cyber security outcomes. • KPIs will demonstrate genuine impacts and benefits (recognising the limited quantifiable data that directly demonstrates cyber security outcomes). 67 Chapter 8: Measuring success 67 Chapter 8: Measuring success Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 68 Chapter 9: Implementing the strategy Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 68 69 Chapter 9: Implementing the strategy 117. Initiatives set out in this strategy can be grouped as follows: • Transformational initiatives that will be undertaken immediately to unlock disproportionate benefits across the strategy’s outcomes. • Short to medium term initiatives that will be established during the first spending review period. • Medium to longer term initiatives that are currently unfunded and will be delivered during the next spending review period. 118. Longer term unfunded initiatives are at varying stages of development. These will be regularly reviewed to ensure alignment with policy priorities, value for money and deliverability. A critical review will be tied to the next spending review to ensure that funding is directed appropriately towards achieving the aim of this strategy. FOCUS ON: The Government Security Centre for Cyber (Cyber GSeC) The Cyber GSeC delivers a broad range of capabilities and services that support government organisations to improve their cyber security posture and achieve an appropriate level of cyber resilience. It therefore plays a critical role in delivering the outcomes of this strategy. In its pilot year, the GSeC worked with departments to assist in rolling out Active Cyber Defence products produced by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and provided trusted, specialist services, such as the Cyber Gap Analysis assessments and reports, as well as access to expert cyber consultancy. Building from its success, the Cyber GSeC will be scaled up to play an increasingly critical role in supporting government to address weaknesses in cyber security. As well as providing bespoke support to individual organisations, it acts as a critical delivery capability for the roll out of centrally driven initiatives, reaching across all government organisations with a particular focus on those that carry the greatest risk. The Cyber GSeC is part of a broader suite of Government Security Centres which look at the range of government security disciplines, from cyber security to physical and personnel security. All Government Security Centres work closely together on cross- cutting issues, ensuring that government continues to improve its security posture across all security disciplines.

Shared detection capability provides detection at scale across government Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030 76 Annex: Cyber Assessment Framework The Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF) was developed by the NCSC - in its role as national technical authority for cyber security - to provide a systematic and comprehensive approach to assessing the extent to which cyber risks to essential functions are being managed by the organisation responsible.  The CAF is comprised of four objectives: managing security risk; protecting against cyber attack; detecting cyber security events; and minimising the impact of cyber security incidents.  These objectives are underpinned by 14 principles that are supported by 39 contributing outcomes, which specify what needs to be achieved - rather than a checklist of what needs to be done. Each contributing outcome is associated with a set of indicators of good practice (IGPs). IGPs are used to develop sector-specific CAF profiles, which provide a view of appropriate and proportionate cyber security for those organisations.

Glossary 79 Glossary Cyber Essentials: A Government-backed, industry-supported scheme to help organisations protect themselves against common online threats. Cyber incident: An occurrence that actually or potentially poses a threat to a computer, internet- connected device, or network – or data processed, stored, or transmitted on those systems – which may require a response action to mitigate the consequences. Cyber power: Cyber power is the ability to protect and promote national interests in and through cyberspace. Cyber resilience: The ability of an organisation to maintain the delivery of its key functions and services and ensure the protection of its data, despite cyber security events. Cyber security: The protection of internet-connected systems (to include hardware, software and associated infrastructure), the data on them, and the services they provide, from unauthorised access, harm or misuse. This includes harm caused intentionally by the operator of the system, or accidentally, as a result of failing to follow security procedures or being manipulated into doing so. Cyber security assurance: The verification that systems and processes meet the specified security requirements and that processes to verify ongoing compliance are in place. Cyber security controls: The processes and tools an organisation have in place to detect, prevent, reduce or counteract security risks. Cyber security data: Any data that is relevant to cyber security, including data on cyber threats and vulnerabilities. Cyber risk: The potential that a given cyber threat will exploit the vulnerabilities of an information system and cause harm. Cyber threat: Anything capable of compromising the security of, or causing harm to, information systems and internet connected devices (to include hardware, software and associated infrastructure), the data on them and the services they provide, primarily by cyber means.

Cyber resilience lies  at the very heart of this. Few nations are better placed to navigate these  challenges, but we must be willing and able to adapt to this new world  emerging around us. Our National Cyber Strategy hits this head on - setting  out how the UK will fi rmly establish itself as a democratic and responsible  cyber power, able to protect and promote its interests as a sovereign nation  in a world fundamentally shaped by technology.  To realise this ambition however, government itself must lead by example.  As well as ensuring that government organisations can protect the services  and functions that maintain and promote our economy and society,  government must be an exemplar to the private sector, to ensure that the  UK continues to enhance its reputation as one of the most secure and  attractive digital economies in which to live, do business and invest in.  The challenge cannot be underestimated, but tackling it is imperative.  That is why I am delighted to set out here the Government Cyber  Security Strategy which sets out how we will ensure that all government  organisations - across the whole public sector - are resilient to the  cyber threats we face.    7  Building a cyber resilient public sector  7  Building a cyber resilient public sector  Message from the   Chancellor of the Duchy  of Lancaster and Minister  for the Cabinet Offi ce Government organisations - and the functions and services they deliver  - are the cornerstone of our society. It is their signifi cance, however, that  makes them an attractive target for an ever-expanding army of adversaries,  often with the kind of powerful cyber capabilities which, not so long ago,  would have been the sole preserve of nation states. Whether in the pursuit  of government data for strategic advantage or in seeking the disruption of  public services for fi nancial or political gain, the threat faced by government  is very real and present.  Government organisations are routinely and relentlessly targeted: of the  777 incidents managed by the National Cyber Security Centre between  September 2020 and August 2021, around 40% were aimed at the public  sector. This upward trend shows no signs of abating.   Building and maintaining our cyber defences is therefore vital if we are to  protect the functions and services on which we all depend. As government,  we have made a great deal of progress in recent years, but there is much more  to do. To meet the threats we will face in the coming decade we must build on  our successes and transform how we approach cyber security in government.   The Government Cyber Security Strategy sets out how we will do this; by  building greater cyber resilience across all government organisations, and  working together to ‘defend as one’ - exerting a defensive force greater  than the sum of our parts.   Every part of government has a role in achieving this. Government  organisations are rightly empowered to manage their cyber risks - as  well as harnessing local knowledge and understanding, this allows for  tremendous innovation and agility. Such knowledge and expertise must  however be shared across government to enhance our collective response,  with more and advanced shared capabilities and services making the task  increasingly straightforward, effective and effi cient. This strategy provides  the framework to drive this forward.   Government’s resolve to achieve this is absolute. This commitment is  refl ected in the 2021 Comprehensive Spending Review, with £2.6 billion  being invested in cyber and legacy IT, of which government cyber security is a  critical component. £37.8 million of additional funding is also being invested to  tackle cyber security challenges facing local councils to protect vital services  and data, alongside targeted investment in our most critical departments.   This is an ambitious but necessary strategy that demands action across  all of government. We must meet our responsibility to ensure that  government’s functions and services are resilient to the cyber threats  they face - creating a stronger, better-defended government that is the  foundation of our status as a cyber power.    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  8  Context 1. The Integrated Review1 and the National   Cyber Strategy2 set out the government’s  ambition to firmly establish the UK as a  democratic and responsible cyber power,  able to protect and promote its interests as  a sovereign nation in a world fundamentally  shaped by technology. The UK’s legitimacy  and authority as a cyber power is however  dependent upon its domestic cyber resilience,  the cornerstone of which is government and  the public sector organisations that deliver the  functions and services which maintain and  promote the UK’s economy and society.  2. While government has made notable progress  in recent years, there remains a significant gap  between where government cyber resilience  is now and where it needs to be. This gap is  brought into sharp focus by the sheer volume  of cyber attacks that the government sector  experiences, and the evolving capabilities and  techniques of the broad range of malicious  actors conducting them. As well as the risk of  disruption to government functions and public  services, the targeting of essential services  such as healthcare can pose a real risk to  public safety.  1 HMG; Global Britain in a Competitive Age: the Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy; March 2021 2 HMG; ‘National Cyber Strategy’; December 2021  Vision and Aim 3. This strategy’s vision is therefore to ensure   that core government functions - from the  delivery of public services to the operation  of National Security apparatus - are  resilient to cyber attack, strengthening the  UK as a sovereign nation and cementing  its authority as a democratic and  responsible cyber power.  4. Core government functions are delivered by  many diverse public sector organisations,  including government departments, arms- length bodies, agencies and local authorities.  This strategy therefore considers all such  public sector organisations.  5. To achieve its vision the strategy pursues  a central aim - for government’s critical  functions to be significantly hardened to  cyber attack by 2025, with all government  organisations across the whole  public sector being resilient to known  vulnerabilities and attack methods no later  than 2030.  6. This is a bold and ambitious aim. To  achieve the level of organised and objective  visibility of cyber security risk across the  whole of government will require extensive  processes, mechanisms and partnerships  to be established; a task complicated by the  varying levels of cyber maturity, capability  and capacity. Key to this will be enabling  lead government departments to assess and  articulate the macro-cyber security posture  of the arms-length bodies and other public  sector organisations within their purview.  Executive Summary    9  Building a cyber resilient public sector  7. Achieving this aim will make government  a significantly hardened target. As well as  enabling government to protect its data  and operate without undue disruption, it  will ensure that government organisations  are structured and organised to manage  unknown and more sophisticated threats  when they do arise.  Strategic pillars and   transformational  proposals 8. Government’s approach to achieving this   aim is centred around two complementary  strategic pillars, each underpinned by a  transformational proposal that will unlock  and drive improvements across government.  9. The first is to build a strong foundation of  organisational cyber security resilience;  ensuring that government organisations  have the right structures, mechanisms, tools  and support in place to manage their cyber  security risks.   10. This will be underpinned by the adoption  of the National Cyber Security Centre’s  (NCSC) Cyber Assessment Framework  (CAF) as the assurance framework for  government, with government specific CAF  profiles that articulate the outcomes required  by government organisations in order to  proportionately respond to the varying  threats to their most important functions.  Objective verification by independent  auditors will be a requirement for central  government departments, although it will   be for lead government departments to  adapt and apply such an approach in a  way that is most appropriate for the public  sector organisations within their scope.  As well as improving visibility of cyber   security risks, adopting the CAF provides a  common framework for government to more  effectively understand and manage them.    11. The second is to ‘defend as one’.  Recognising that the scale and pace of the  threat demands a more comprehensive  and joined up response, government will  harness the value of sharing cyber security  data, expertise and capabilities across its  organisations to present a defensive force  disproportionately more powerful than the  sum of its parts.    12. This will be underpinned by the  establishment of a Government Cyber  Coordination Centre (GCCC). As a joint  venture between the Government Security  Group, the Central Digital and Data Office  and the NCSC, the GCCC will work to better  coordinate operational cyber security efforts,  transforming how cyber security data and  threat intelligence is shared, consumed and  actioned across government.    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  10  Manage cyber  security risk  14. In order to manage cyber  security risk, government  organisations will be able  to identify, assess and understand them.  The foundation of this lies in the visibility and  understanding of assets, their vulnerabilities,  and the threat to them - whether internal  to an organisation or emanating from its  supply chain. Clear accountability and  robust assurance will ensure that risk  owners are aware of the risks they have the  responsibility to manage, and that they are  doing so appropriately.   15. Information about vulnerabilities will be  shared across government to provide a  central view of critical vulnerabilities that  will enable cross-government risks to be  identifi ed and managed, facilitating rapid  assessment, coordination and mitigation  at scale.  Protect against  cyber attack  16. The protective stance of  individual government  organisations will be  inextricably linked to their assessment and  management of risk. While it will never be  possible to protect against all attacks, those  accountable will be able to demonstrate that  they have appropriately considered those  risks and responded accordingly.  17. Proportionate cyber security measures will  be embedded in the technology government  uses, and technology and digital services  will be correctly designed, confi gured and  managed. Crucially, government will develop  its shared capabilities, tools and services  to address common cyber security issues  at scale, improving cyber security across  the whole of government as well as driving  effi ciency and value for money.  18. At the heart of this is government’s  responsibility to protect the data it handles.  As well as appropriately classifying  information, government will handle and  share it in a way that is commensurate with  the risks it presents, using the appropriate  IT systems.  Objectives 13. These pillars are supported by fi ve   objectives that set the dimensions  of cyber resilience, providing a  consistent framework and common  language that can be applied  across the whole of government.     11  Building a cyber resilient public sector  Detect cyber  security events  19. Building on the foundation  of risk management and  commensurate protective  measures, government will develop its  capability to detect cyber security events  across every part of its estate to ensure that  risks can be mitigated before they critically  impact government functions and services.  20. This means having the capability to monitor  systems, networks and services to detect  cyber security events before they become  incidents. Enhanced coordination will enable  government to have the agility to use these  data inputs to detect at pace and scale,  facilitating coherent responses as well as  providing the capabilities to detect more  sophisticated attacks.  Minimise the impact of  cyber security incidents  21. While effective risk  management, appropriate  and proportionate  protective measures and  enhanced detection capability will make  government a considerably hardened  target, government organisations will still be  impacted by cyber security incidents.   22. Government will therefore be fully prepared  and able to respond to cyber incidents with  the capability to restore affected systems  and assets and resume the operation of  its functions and services with minimal  disruption. A critical component of this will  be establishing the mechanisms to test  and exercise incident response plans, both  organisationally and across government,  as well as the ability to learn lessons from  incidents and ‘near misses’.  Develop the right cyber  security skills, knowledge  and culture  23. Achieving this strategy’s  vision and aim will not be  possible without cultivating  the required cyber security skills and  knowledge, as well as fostering a cultural  shift in cyber security across the whole  of government.   24. Government will have a comprehensive  understanding of its cyber security skills  requirements and will incentivise and promote  government cyber security careers. As well  as formal career pathways that align with the  UK Cyber Security Council, working towards  the adoption of a single pay framework for  the cyber profession will enable government  to more effectively attract, develop and  retain those skills, providing a sustainable  government cyber security profession.  25. The need for suffi cient cyber security skills  and knowledge extends beyond technical  cyber security roles to the breadth of  professional functions that must give  adequate consideration to cyber security.  From the Digital, Data and Technology  (DDaT) profession through to government’s  commercial and legal functions, suffi cient  cyber security knowledge and awareness  will ensure that cyber security is actively  considered wherever necessary.  26. Fundamentally, this strategy recognises the  importance of cultivating a cyber security  culture that empowers its people to learn,  question and challenge to drive continuous  improvement. This begins with improving  cyber security awareness and knowledge  across all public sector workers, building  on these foundations to create a positive  cyber security culture that promotes and  empowers its people to proactively engage  on organisational cyber security risks. Getting  this right is the key to sustainable change.    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  12  Chapter 1:    Context  Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  12    13  Chapter 1: Context  1. The Integrated Review of Security, Defence,  Development and Foreign Policy3 (Integrated  Review) brings national resilience to the fore  of the UK’s approach to its future security  and prosperity. As global dependency on  digital services and connectivity grows, the  need for strong cyber resilience will become  increasingly critical to this national effort.   2. The National Cyber Strategy4 pursues this  objective, seeking to fi rmly establish the  UK as a democratic and responsible cyber  power, able to protect and promote its  interests as a sovereign nation in a world  fundamentally shaped by technology.   3 HMG; ‘Global Britain in a Competitive Age: the Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy’; March 2021 4 HMG; ‘National Cyber Strategy’; December 2021  3. The UK’s legitimacy and authority as a  cyber power is however dependent upon its  domestic cyber resilience; the cornerstone  of which is its public sector. Government has  a fundamental duty to deliver functions that  maintain and promote the UK’s economy and  society, from the delivery of public services  through to the operation of national security  apparatus. These functions must be able to  operate without undue disruption to maintain  the trust and public confi dence needed  to enable the UK to prosper and, in turn,  exercise infl uence beyond its borders.  The importance of government  cyber security to national resilience  Integrated Review... brings national resilience to the fore of the UK’s  approach to its future security and prosperity.

Government Cyber Security Strategy... seeks to ensure that core government functions are resilient to   cyber attack, strengthening the UK as a sovereign nation and cementing  its authority as a democratic and responsible cyber power.  Figure 1: Strategic context    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  14  Progress  4. Government has made significant progress  in the last five years. As well as the  establishment of the National Cyber Security  Centre (NCSC) as the UK’s national technical  authority for cyber security, the creation of  the Government Security Group and the  Central Digital and Data Office in the Cabinet  Office has provided central leadership of  cyber security and digital transformation at  the heart of government.   5. The introduction of the Minimum Cyber  Security Standards for government in  2018,5 and the underpinning annual ‘Health  Check’, signalled clear requirements for  cyber security controls and behaviours, and  improved government’s understanding of its  cyber security posture. This understanding  has been further enhanced by the  introduction of the GBEST scheme for  government which provides an advanced,  intelligence-led simulated attack framework  to assess an organisation’s cyber resilience.  5 Cabinet Office; ‘Minimum Cyber Security Standard’; June 2018  6. The need for cyber security is being taken  increasingly seriously at the highest levels,  with more regular reporting to boards and  government audit and risk committees  consistently highlighting it as a critical risk.  This recognition has been reflected through  continued and significant investment in  government cyber security through the  National Cyber Security Programme and  investment in addressing legacy IT across  the government IT estate.       7. The NCSC continues to scale and develop  its Active Cyber Defence programme to  tackle cyber attacks in a relatively automated  and scalable way, as well as growing the  number of shared services and capabilities  offered to improve government’s cyber  resilience. The introduction and expansion  of government’s SECRET IT platform has  also transformed how government manages  more sensitive information and enhanced  collaboration across classifications.  The challenges and opportunities   for government  FOCUS ON: A holistic approach to government security     Cyber security is a critical component of a broader suite of security disciplines  and practices that are required to protect government’s assets and ensure that  government’s functions can operate without undue disruption. These security practices  intersect and must all be given appropriate consideration as part of an organisation’s  holistic business risk management approach.   In recognition of this, in September 2021 the government published the Government  Functional Standard GovS 007: Security6 (Security Standard). Government Functional  Standards are a suite of management standards to guide people working in and  with the UK government. The Security Standard represents an up-to-date view of  the security arrangements government organisations should have in place to ensure  government is able to function effectively, efficiently and securely.  The Security Standard brings together and clarifies what needs to be done, and why,  with flexibility for organisations about how it is met in practice. It sets expectations for  the governance, roles and accountabilities and practices needed, as well as providing   a stable basis for assurance, risk management and capability building.  6 Cabinet Office; ‘Government Functional Standards GovS 007: Security’, September 2021    15  Chapter 1: Context  8. Steps have been taken to address the cyber  security skills challenge in government with  the creation of the government security  profession. The development of a cyber  career framework - that sets out standard  skills and knowledge requirements across  government, directly linking to a cyber  learning curriculum and a cyber pay offer -   is attracting, developing and retaining cyber  security talent. The government’s early  talent offer is also growing talent from within,  through apprenticeships and fast stream  schemes.    9. The criticality of cyber security is also being  recognised beyond the UK government.  Public sector organisations are making  strides, with the health sector being a  notable example. The devolved governments  also have well established cyber resilience  strategies and action plans driving significant  cyber security improvements in the sectors  for which they have devolved responsibility.  7 Ipsos MORI / DCMS; ‘Cyber Security Skills in the UK Labour Market 2021’; March 2021  The challenge  10. Yet, while government’s recognition and  understanding of cyber security risk has  evolved, it has also highlighted the gap  between where government cyber resilience  is now and where it needs to be. This gap is  brought into sharp focus by the challenges  departments have faced in achieving the  Minimum Cyber Security Standards.   11. The level of maturity, capability, investment,  and security understanding across  government organisations remains  inconsistent and the size and complexity of  government’s digital estate, including the  presence of legacy IT, makes the challenge  significantly more complicated. The size  and diversity of the government’s supply  chains makes it difficult to manage risks,  with long-term contracts stifling innovation.  Further to this, complex governance  structures, insufficient accountability, levers  and incentives, as well as underdeveloped  mechanisms to effectively share information  and capabilities significantly impacts  government’s visibility of cyber risk, as well  as its ability to drive change at the scale  and pace required. This is made more  challenging by limited resources.   12. Meeting the scale of the challenge is also  dependent on people. However, in the  context of a national cyber security skills  shortage7, government struggles to compete  with the private sector to attract and retain  the required cadre of diverse and skilled  cyber security professionals, despite its  positive efforts to date. This extends beyond  technical cyber security skills, including  the broad range of professional functions  that require cyber security knowledge and  awareness. Moreover, internal competition  over cyber professionals in government too  often comes at the expense of knowledge  retention and sustained change.     Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  16  13. The need for improved cyber resilience is  becoming more acute given the increasingly  digital world. While ubiquitous digital  connectivity and mass data generation create  significant opportunities for government to  improve its services and functions for the  benefit of the UK and its citizens, it also  introduces significant cyber security risks. As  government’s reliance on digital services grows  - from the use of digital products and services  to the migration of government data and  services into the cloud - greater dependency  is placed on those outside of government,  often with footprints extending beyond the  UK. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated  these risks as well as fundamentally changing  how government works, with hybrid working  becoming the norm.  14. Such interconnectivity and dependency  significantly increase the risk of malicious  attack, with the potential to jeopardise trust  and public confidence in government.  8 NCSC; ‘NCSC Annual Review 2021’; November 2021  The threat  15. As cyber security risks evolve, so do the  threats posed by malicious actors - from  nation states to cyber criminals. While their  capabilities and techniques continue to  evolve and diversify, the commoditisation  of offensive cyber tools and services  increasingly lowers the capability threshold  for anyone with the intent to disrupt or  undermine the functioning of government.   16. At the same time government remains  an attractive target for a broad range of  malicious actors, with approximately 40%  of the 777 incidents managed by NCSC  between September 2020 and August 2021  affecting the public sector8. This is expected  to continue to grow.   FOCUS ON: The impact of ransomware  In 2020, both Redcar & Cleveland and Hackney councils were hit by ransomware  attacks. Despite the relatively small sizes of these organisations the impact on critical  public services was disproportionate and acute. These attacks are not an anomaly but  part of a significant upward trend.   Ransomware does not rely on the exploitation of new or novel vulnerabilities.  Indeed, the barrier to such exploitation has been significantly lowered with the rise of  ransomware as a service (RaaS), allowing ‘customers’ to purchase capabilities that  were once the preserve of more capable actors.   While use of ransomware rises, the costs of remediating the impact of ransomware  attacks remain significant. This only reinforces the need for strong cyber resilience and  strengthens the case for appropriate cyber security prioritisation and investment, to  mitigate the risks before they turn into serious incidents.    17  Chapter 1: Context  17. The threat from nation state actors is of  considerable concern, with nearly half  of nation state activity being targeted at  governments across the world, with the UK  being the third most targeted country behind  the USA and Ukraine9. Equally the dramatic  rise of ransomware attacks and recent high- impact incidents demonstrate both the scale  of impact and the diversity of organisations  affected, from government departments  to wider public sector organisations. The  targeting of healthcare, education and other  essential services continues to demonstrate  the severity of such cyber attacks, which  not only cause signifi cant disruption to the  delivery of essential public services, but can  also pose a real risk to public safety.  9 Microsoft; ‘Digital Defence Report’; October 2021  The opportunity  18. Although government faces signifi cant  challenges it also has many attributes and  strengths. With such organisational diversity  comes a wealth of capabilities, knowledge and  data that must be developed and harnessed.  Government must also take full advantage of  the benefi ts that digital transformation brings,  to drive innovation, analytical understanding  and the scaling of capabilities.  19. Cyber resilience remains a cost effective  and impactful lever against the cyber threat.  Government organisations must therefore  build from these foundations to improve their  cyber resilience. Most crucially, government  needs to harness its collective strength,  bringing together and developing its  capabilities to present a stronger defensive  force which can match the ever-evolving  cyber risk landscape.  The government remains an attractive target for a broad range of malicious  actors, with approximately 40% of the 777 incidents managed by NCSC  between September 2020 and August 2021 affecting the public sector  September 2020 August 2021  !  incidents recorded  impacted the  public sector  40% of all  777  Figure 2: Cyber incidents affecting the public sector    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  18  Chapter 2:    Approach  Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  18    19  Chapter 2: Approach  20. Government has a duty to deliver functions  that maintain and promote the UK’s  economy and society. These functions must  be able to operate without undue disruption  to maintain the trust and public confidence  needed to enable the UK to prosper. It is  therefore imperative that these functions are  sufficiently resilient to continuously evolving  cyber threats.  21. To realise this vision, government will have  the mechanisms in place to identify and  manage known risks in order to maintain  a proportionate and effective level of cyber  security across all government organisations.  22. This will mean that government’s OFFICIAL  systems will be hardened against known  vulnerabilities and improper security  practices will no longer unduly expose  government to easily preventable attack  methods, with information above OFFICIAL  being appropriately protected on higher- classification systems. Such a position, and  the understanding that is derived from it, will  mean that government is aware of attacks to  its systems and can effectively maintain its  cyber resilience.  23. Achieving this aim will make government  a significantly hardened target - forcing  adversaries to work harder while enabling  government functions to operate without  undue disruption, in turn cementing the UK’s  authority as a democratic and responsible  cyber power.  Vision and Aim VISION: This strategy seeks to ensure that core  government functions - from the delivery of  public services to the operation of National  Security apparatus - are resilient to cyber  attack, strengthening the UK as a sovereign  nation and cementing its authority as a  democratic and responsible cyber power.  FOCUS ON: Cyber Resilience  Cyber resilience refers to the ability of an organisation to maintain the delivery of its key functions  and services and ensure the protection of its data, despite adverse cyber security events. Given  government’s fundamental duty to deliver functions and services that maintain and promote the  UK’s economy and society, cyber resilience lies at the very heart of this strategy.  AIM:  Government’s critical functions to be  significantly hardened to cyber attack by  2025, with all government organisations  across the whole public sector being  resilient to known vulnerabilities and   attack methods no later than 2030.   Unpacking the Aim:   The aim of the strategy sets out a clear   ambition for government. Progress towards  it will be driven by an understanding of risk.  This means identifying areas of particular  risk and prioritising the most impactful  interventions to ensure that government can  rapidly improve its cyber resilience.   The strategy’s aim focuses on the management  of ‘known vulnerabilities and attack methods’.  This focus refers to more than publicly  disclosed security flaws, also accounting for the  improper security practices and behaviours that  unduly expose an organisation to cyber attack.   Good cyber security practices are well  established and their adoption will mitigate  the vast majority of cyber attacks. As well  as dramatically improving an organisation’s  cyber resilience, adopting well-established  cyber security practices will ensure that an  organisation is structured and organised to  manage unknown and more sophisticated  threats when they do arise.    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  20  Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  20  Core government functions are delivered by many  diverse public sector organisations, including  government departments, arms-length bodies,  agencies, local authorities, and other wider public  sector organisations. This strategy therefore  considers all such public sector organisations.  In doing so it recognises the breadth, complexity  and varying degrees of autonomy of these  organisations, particularly those beyond central  government.       Lead government departments are best placed  to understand the unique characteristics of the  organisations within their purview, including their  arms-length bodies and agencies, as well as  other government bodies and wider public sector  organisations. The focus is therefore placed on  enabling lead government departments to assess  and articulate the macro cyber security posture  of those organisations, driving improvements as  necessary.  The devolved governments  While cyber security - within the wider remit  of national security - is a reserved matter,  responsibility for public services within Scotland,  Wales and Northern Ireland is devolved to  the respective devolved governments. This  includes the devolution of health and social  care, education and transport, amongst others.  Devolved governments therefore have the  responsibility to ensure that those services are  resilient to cyber risks.  While these matters are devolved, the UK as a  whole shares the vision set out in this strategy.  The UK government will therefore continue to work  collaboratively with the devolved governments  to ensure that collective issues are addressed  in partnership, with appropriate information and  support being shared to maintain the resilience  of the UK.  The scope of this strategy    21  Chapter 2: Approach  21  Chapter 2: Approach  •   Manage own cyber  security risk  •   Assess and articulate the  macro cyber security  posture of the public sector  organisations in their  purview  Central  government   functions  Devolved  governments  •   Sets strategic direction and  cross-government policies  •   Manages assurance for central  government departments  •   Develops and maintains macro  view of cross-government  cyber security risk  Work collaboratively  to share information  and ensure collective  issues are addressed   in partnership  Central government departments /   lead government  departments  Including:  arms-length bodies; agencies;  local authorities; and other wider  public sector organisations  Public sector  organisations  Public sector  organisations  Figure 3: Scope of the strategy  Scope of the strategy    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  22  24. Achieving this vision and aim will require a  step-change in how government approaches  cyber security. As well as continuing to  strengthen organisational cyber resilience,  government will ‘defend as one’ to ensure   that it can meet the scale of the challenges it  faces. This strategy therefore centres around  two core and complementary strategic pillars  which define and drive the government’s  approach to cyber resilience.  Pillars  Pillar 1: Build organsational   cyber resilience  Pillar 2: ‘Defend as one’  25. As well as being responsible and  accountable for managing their own cyber  security risks, government organisations  must increasingly recognise their collective  responsibility for the cyber resilience of the  whole of government. Given that failings  of one organisation can have significant  implications for many others, it is imperative  that all individual organisations build and  enhance their cyber security posture,  accounting for the risks they face and  the criticality of the function they have  responsibility for.  26. Government organisations will therefore have  the right structures, mechanisms, tools and  support in place to ensure that they can  manage their cyber security risks. This will  be underpinned by genuine accountability,  so government has confidence in its cyber  resilience, both at an organisational and  cross-government level.  Figure 4: Strategic pillars  Pillar 1: Build a strong foundation of   organisational cyber security resilience    23  Chapter 2: Approach  TRANSFORMATIONAL PROPOSAL -  Enhanced cyber security assurance  Government will adopt the Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF) as the assurance  framework for government. The CAF has been developed by the NCSC - the UK’s  technical authority on cyber security - and represents an industry standard that is  used by operators of essential services under the Network and Information Systems  regulations10 as well as more widely across the private sector, including critical  national infrastructure (CNI) sectors. Adopting the CAF ensures that government  is assessing its cyber resilience in a consistent and comparable way to other  organisations that operate the UK’s essential services.   Tiered government CAF profi les, underpinned by government-specifi c cyber threat  profi les, will articulate the outcomes required by government organisations in order  to proportionately respond to varying threats to their most important functions.  Government organisations’ assessment of cyber resilience against the relevant CAF  profi le will be verifi ed by independent auditors. As well as providing an objective  assessment of government cyber resilience, independent auditing will highlight  critical areas for improvement.  This assurance process will be a requirement for government departments, however  it will be for lead government departments to adapt and apply such an approach in  a way that is most appropriate for the public sector organisations in their purview.  Devolved governments will take a similar leadership role across their areas of  responsibility. Crucially, however, lead government departments and devolved  governments will be able to articulate the macro cyber security posture of the  organisations within their purview with reference to the CAF’s objectives to ensure  that government cyber resilience is assessed and understood in a consistent and  comparable way.  While the CAF will be used as the framework to provide consistent cyber security  assurance of government departments, individual departments may continue to use  whatever framework they feel is most appropriate to best enable them to manage  their cyber security risks. Prominent cyber security frameworks, such as the National  Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) cyber security framework and ISO  27001, are consistent with the CAF, ensuring that assurance reporting requirements  do not disturb mature internal cyber security risk management structures  and processes.  10 The Network and Information Systems Regulations 2018    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  24  27. While developing a strong foundation of  organisational cyber security is critical,  the scale and pace of the threat demands  a more comprehensive and joined up  response. Government will therefore  ‘defend as one’; harnessing the value of  sharing cyber security data, expertise and  capabilities across government to present  a defensive force disproportionately more  powerful than the sum of its parts.   28. This means ensuring that all government  organisations have timely access to relevant  and actionable cyber security data that   enhances their ability to manage cyber risks,  as well as working collaboratively to better  coordinate and target shared government  capabilities and services that address  common cyber security issues at scale.   29. Doing so will have a disproportionate benefi t  to the cyber security of government. It will  also facilitate innovation by coordinating  the identifi cation of common cyber security  risks affecting government organisations  and harnessing government expertise and  resources to address those problems at scale.   TRANSFORMATIONAL PROPOSAL -  The Government Cyber Coordination Centre (GCCC)  Government will establish a cyber coordination centre to better coordinate operational  cyber security efforts across government organisations and truly enhance government’s  ability to ‘defend as one’. Building on successful private sector models such as  the Financial Sector Cyber Collaboration Centre (FSCCC), the GCCC will foster  partnerships to rapidly identify, investigate and coordinate the response to incidents  alongside threat and vulnerability reporting. Key to this will be transforming how cyber  security data and threat intelligence is used across government.    Ensuring that such data can be rapidly shared, consumed and actioned will  dramatically improve government’s ability to ‘defend as one’ when managing incidents,  vulnerabilities and threats at scale.  As a joint venture between the Government Security Group, the Central Digital and  Data Offi ce and the NCSC, the GCCC will form strong partnerships with government  departments and the devolved governments.   Pillar 2:  ‘Defend as one’  FOCUS ON: Data-driven cyber security  This strategy puts data at the heart of cyber security. The secure use of data -  automated and machine readable wherever possible - will inform decision making  and drive improvements where required.    25  Chapter 2: Approach  30. The strategy’s pillars are underpinned by five  objectives. These set the dimensions of what  needs to be considered with regard to cyber  resilience, providing a consistent framework  and common language that can be applied  to the whole of government.   1) Manage cyber security risk:   Effective cyber security risk management  processes, governance and  accountability enable the identification,  assessment and management of cyber  security risks - at both the organisational  and cross-government level.  2) Protect against cyber attack:  Understanding of cyber security risk  informs the adoption of proportionate  security measures with centrally developed  capabilities enabling protection at scale.     3) Detect cyber security events:  Comprehensive monitoring of systems,  networks and services enable cyber  security events to be managed before  they become incidents.  4) Minimise the impact of cyber   security incidents:   Cyber security incidents are swiftly  contained and assessed, enabling   rapid response at scale.  5) Develop the right cyber security  skills, knowledge and culture:  Sufficient, skilled and knowledgeable  professionals fulfil all required cyber  security needs - extending beyond  technical cyber security experts to the  breadth of professional functions that  must incorporate cyber security into the  services they provide - all underpinned  by a cyber security culture that promotes  sustainable change.  Objectives    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  26  Objective 3: Detect cyber   security events  Objective 1: Manage cyber  security risk  Objective 4: Minimise the impact   of cyber security  incidents  VISION: Core government functions - from the delivery of public services to  the operation of National Security apparatus - are resilient to cyber  attack, strengthening the UK as a sovereign nation and cementing  its authority as a democratic and responsible cyber power.

Pillar 1: Build organsational   cyber resilience  Pillar 2: ‘Defend as one’  Objective 5: Develop the right   cyber security skills,  knowledge and   culture  Objective 2: Protect against   cyber attack  FOCUS ON: A perpetually reinforcing ecosystem  The strategy’s objectives set out the core components of cyber resilience that will  guide cyber security efforts across government. These objectives are perpetually  reinforced - through the governance and oversight of the strategy, the development  and implementation of central and shared interventions, and through government  cyber security assurance.  As well as providing a consistent framework and common language for cyber security  across government, establishing such a reinforcing ecosystem will provide a coherent  and comprehensive picture of government cyber resilience that will continually refi ne  and drive improvements where they are most needed.

Pillar 1: Build organsational   cyber resilience  Pillar 2: ‘Defend as one’  Objective 5: Develop the right   cyber security skills,  knowledge and   culture  Objective 2: Protect against   cyber attack  Figure 6: The Government Cyber Security Strategy  27  Chapter 2: Approach  The Government Cyber Security Strategy    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  28  Chapter 3:    Managing cyber   security risk  Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  28    29  Chapter 3: Manage cyber security risk  31. Management of risk lies at the heart of this strategy. It is only  when risk is understood that mitigations can be applied and  investment prioritised. Accurate risk information is therefore  critical to enabling accountable individuals to make effective risk- based decisions. It also provides the system-wide view needed  to address systemic risks and to drive scaled interventions.  32. In order to manage cyber security risks, government  organisations will be able to identify, assess and understand  them. The foundation of this lies in the visibility and  understanding of assets held and operated - whether that be  infrastructure, digital services and applications, or data - and  the threat to them. This visibility is the foundation from which an  accurate assessment of risk can be derived. Clear accountability  and robust assurance will ensure that risk owners are aware of  the risks they have the responsibility to manage, and that they  are doing so appropriately.  Objective 1:  Government will manage  cyber security risk  Government organisations will have risk  management processes, governance and  accountability in place to enable the effective  identifi cation, assessment and management of  their cyber security risks, with suffi cient overarching  visibility to effectively manage systemic risk.    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  30  Governance and accountability Outcome 1:   Government has established governance arrangements with clear accountability  enabling effective management of cyber risks at all levels of government  33. To drive government risk management  to the appropriate level requires changes  and enhancements to governance and  accountability across government. Cyber  risk will be seen as an integral component  of business risk and resilience management,  with effective organisational cyber security  management structures that enable  government organisations to fully understand  and account for the risks they own. This  includes having established roles and  responsibilities for their systems and services  and clear channels for communicating and  escalating risks to ensure that decision  makers have the visibility required to make  effective decisions. Most crucially, it requires  clear and transparent accountability up  to Accounting Officers and the executive  board, to ensure that decision makers are  informed and empowered to express their  organisation’s risk position, as well as be  held accountable for their risk decisions.  34. Lead government departments are  best placed to understand the unique  characteristics of the organisations  within their purview and will construct the  mechanisms to assess and articulate the  macro cyber posture of those organisations,  putting in place the appropriate governance  arrangements to drive required  improvements.  35. While Accounting Officers are responsible for  their organisation’s risk, transparent central  governance structures will maintain oversight  and responsibility for cross-government  cyber security risk, ensuring that systemic  risks are identified and managed.    31  Chapter 3: Manage cyber security risk  Assets and vulnerabilities Outcome 2:   Government has comprehensive visibility and understanding of its digital assets enabling  it to identify and manage vulnerabilities and the cyber security risks they present  36. Without comprehensive visibility of  government’s IT, digital and data assets,  as well as users, cyber security risks go  unrecognised and unmanaged. Not only does  this limited visibility restrict an organisation’s  ability to protect its estate, it reduces  government’s ability to identify and act on  aggregated and systemic risks that could  have a devastating impact on the functioning  of government.  37. All government organisations will therefore  have an active and automated asset  discovery and management method in place  to continuously determine what systems,  hardware and software they own and operate  - including those provided by suppliers -  so that the potential risks to them can be  managed. As government organisations  migrate to cloud services they should take  advantage of the available asset management  tools which make it significantly easier for  an organisation to know what it owns and  operates, how they are configured, and  where they are vulnerable.  38. Vulnerabilities in technology and digital  services are introduced or discovered almost  constantly. Government’s approach to  managing these will, therefore, reflect this  evolving landscape. Government will have the  mechanisms in place to enable vulnerabilities  to be rapidly identified, assessed and  managed. This involves providing a clear path  for anyone - whether a public sector employee,  a commercial entity or a private individual - to  highlight potential vulnerabilities, and robust  vulnerability management programmes to be  in place across all government organisations  to ensure identified vulnerabilities are effectively  managed across their IT estate.  39. Information about critical vulnerabilities will  be securely shared across government, to  ensure that all government organisations can  take appropriate action. Effective information  sharing will also provide a central view of critical  vulnerabilities which will develop government’s  visibility of dependencies across its systems  and services, enabling the identification and  management of more systemic issues, as well  as facilitating rapid assessment, coordination  and mitigation at scale.  FOCUS ON: Cross-government vulnerability reporting service  Government will develop a coherent and joined up cross-government vulnerability  reporting service. This will enable the mature handling of, and response to, vulnerabilities  which have the potential to impact government.  Security researchers and members of the public will be able to easily and securely report  vulnerabilities they identify on the government digital estate. Reports will be triaged and  the appropriate government organisation will be notified of valid vulnerabilities received.  Through this service government organisations will be able to accelerate their ability to  find and fix vulnerabilities before adversaries can exploit them.  By providing this capability centrally, government will, for the first time, be able to holistically  tackle cyber security vulnerabilities at scale and pace across the public sector.     Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  32  Data assets Outcome 3:   Government has comprehensive visibility of the data it handles and shares so that it  can appropriately assess and respond to the risks it presents  40. As well as IT assets, government  organisations will have comprehensive  visibility over their data assets. From  personal data to classified information, data  underpins all government IT and services  and will be protected proportionate to the  risk and in compliance with data protection  legislation. Government organisations will   therefore have a mature understanding of  what data assets they handle, how they  are stored or hosted, and where they are  shared, so they can adequately assess the  risks they present and ensure that sufficient  protections are put in place to manage  them.  Supply chain risk Outcome 4:   Government understands and manages risks emanating from commercial suppliers  41. Commercially provided products and  services play an integral part in delivering  government’s functions and services.  As government supply chains become  increasingly expansive and interconnected,  vulnerabilities in suppliers’ systems, and  in the products and services they deliver,  present increasingly attractive opportunities  to adversaries seeking to gain access to  government networks. Recognising this  growing risk, government will take steps  to better understand its dependencies on  suppliers and ensure that their products  and services are integrated into government  systems in a way that takes full account of  their impacts on security and resilience. In  doing so, government will be an exemplar  in the procurement and deployment  of commercial products and services,  becoming a stimulus to improve the broader  ecosystem of such suppliers across the UK.   42. Central mapping of government’s critical  and common suppliers will enable the  identification and coordinated management  of systemic and aggregate supply chain risks  to government. Supply chain cyber security  principles will establish clear requirements  for these suppliers, with the expectation  that they provide transparent statements  of adherence. Government will also make  full use of its established commercial  relationships and aggregate spending power  to ensure that its key suppliers deliver on  these principles. As well as reinforcing  appropriate and proportionate cyber security  controls and behaviours, such central  oversight will promote standard requirements  and provide shared assurances that will  reduce duplication and drive efficiencies for  both government organisations and their  suppliers.    33  Chapter 3: Manage cyber security risk  43. While such action will significantly raise the  expectations placed on critical and cross- government suppliers, requirements should  also be proportionate and robust for smaller  and more bespoke suppliers, building from  Cyber Essentials as a foundational tool to  gain confidence that relevant suppliers have  appropriate protections in place. Alignment  between commercial and security functions  will ensure that cyber security is part of every  procurement process, enabling commercial  teams to clearly articulate the cyber security  requirements based on an understanding  of risk. Cyber security requirements in  government procurement frameworks and  contracts will be strengthened, ensuring that  commercial arrangements are risk based   and consistent with robust clauses relating  to the identification and management of  subcontractors. This will make it easier to  procure tools and services with appropriate  security by default.  44. Improved understanding of suppliers  and their dependencies will also enable  government to better respond to cyber  security incidents that emanate from the  supply chain. Such understanding will  provide oversight of cross-government  impacts and enable more focused and  efficient engagements with the suppliers,  ensuring that any incident is managed swiftly  and efficiently. The GCCC will play a critical  role in facilitating this.  FOCUS ON: Cyber security in government contracts  Government is developing security schedules that can be easily applied to a variety  of common procurement scenarios - from bespoke builds deployed on third party  infrastructure to generic consultancy agreements. These schedules will support  government organisations in requesting proportionate cyber security measures in  government contracts, as well as conducting regular assurance against them.   These security schedules will be made available across government so that government  organisations have access to relevant and manageable security clauses. This will  ensure that appropriate security measures - proportional to the risk - are included   in all government contracts.    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  34  Threat information Outcome 5:   Government understands the threat it faces relative to its functions in order to plan  appropriate mitigations, at both an organisational and cross-government level  45. As well as government’s ability to understand  what it has and how it is vulnerable, it will  also understand the threat to it in order to  arrive at an accurate assessment of risk.  The seamless collation and dissemination  of threat information is crucial as it provides  those responsible for defending systems  and networks with the strategic, tactical,  technical and operational detail needed to  predict and defend against attacks.   46. Government organisations will therefore  have the ability to receive and utilise  such threat information, as well as  the capability to generate it from the   monitoring of their system in a systematised  manner - automated wherever possible.  Threat information generated locally will  be enhanced by the coherent use of  government and private sector threat  information.   47. Central mechanisms will be in place to  facilitate more comprehensive, targeted  and, where possible, automated, threat  information sharing across government.  This will enable government organisations to  make effective prioritisation decisions based  on up-to-date information.   FOCUS ON: Countering Threats  The National Cyber Strategy sets out the UK’s objective to detect, investigate and share  information on state, criminal and other malicious cyber actors and activities in order to  protect the UK, its interests and its citizens.  This will involve:  •  maintaining a comprehensive understanding of the cyber capabilities of state,  criminal and other malicious cyber actors and their strategic intent towards the UK;  •  ensuring that the most serious state, criminal and other threats are routinely and  comprehensively investigated, drawing on all sources of information and bringing  together expertise across government, law enforcement and the private sector; and  •  enabling information and data on the threat to be routinely shared at scale   and pace.   Government organisations will be both a customer and contributor to these efforts,  taking full advantage of the knowledge that exists across the UK to provide a deeper  understanding of the threat.    35  Chapter 3: Manage cyber security risk  Cyber security data Outcome 6:   Government organisations have timely access to relevant and actionable cyber  security data that enhances their ability to make effective risk management decisions   48. Cyber security data is an invaluable  commodity, including essential information  about the threats and vulnerabilities that  government needs to understand in order  to effectively manage the risks it faces.  The need for all government organisations  to have access to relevant and actionable  cyber security data is paramount, but while  some parts of government are incredibly  data rich, others do not have access to the  cyber security data that they need to make  effective risk-based decisions.   49. As well as making better use of existing  cyber security data - from sources such as  cross-government services, organisational  systems and endpoint logging and  monitoring - greater value will be extracted  from analysis of aggregate data, with  enhanced dissemination of critical insights  to those who need to respond to them.  The newly established GCCC will play  a fundamental role in facilitating this, by  ensuring that targeted cyber security data  is shared across government - in a way that  is appropriate to its classification and legal  status - and supporting organisations to  effectively consume it.    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  36  Government cyber security assurance Outcome 7:   Government cyber security assurance provides government with the visibility it needs  to make effective decisions and the confidence that it has appropriate cyber security  measures in place to manage the risks to its functions  50. Cyber security assurance is needed to  provide visibility of cyber security risk  across government organisations as well  as the confidence that those risks are being  appropriately and proportionately managed.  To achieve this, a government cyber security  assurance process will provide consistent  and independently verified assurance against  government CAF profiles.11 Focusing on an  organisation’s most important functions,  including critical national infrastructure, it  will provide an objective way of assessing  whether an organisation’s cyber security  assessment and management of cyber  security risk is proportionate and within  accepted risk tolerances. This assurance  process will be further verified and  augmented through real world testing and  exercising, such as penetration testing  and red teaming. Outcomes of assurance  activities will be machine readable wherever  possible, facilitating automated analysis of  the impact on cyber security.  51. While these assurance processes will  be mandated for central government  departments, it will provide a model that  lead government departments and devolved  governments may adapt and apply across  the public sector organisations in their  purview.  52. The visibility over government’s cyber  security posture provided by this assurance  will give government the overarching  confidence that cyber security risks to its  functions are being managed sufficiently.  It will also highlight common issues and  challenges at scale, enabling cost effective  and targeted intervention.   11 See ‘Transformational proposal: Enhanced cyber security assurance’ for more detail    37  Chapter 3: Manage cyber security risk  Private sector and international partnerships Outcome 8:   Strategic partnerships with the private sector and international partners are further  embedded to enhance proactive defence at a global scale  53. Government relies on partnerships with  the private sector and international allies to  strengthen its cyber resilience. This influence  spans from the third-party products and  services that government procures and  deploys through to the development of new  technologies and the future governance of  cyberspace.  54. Given the fundamental role that private  sector partners have in the development,  operation and delivery of government  functions, it is crucial that critical  cyber security challenges are tackled  collaboratively. Government will therefore  continue to develop its partnerships with   private sector organisations and academia  to enhance its resilience across all aspects  of security; building trusted relationships and  shared outcomes.  55. As highlighted in the National Cyber  Strategy, the cyber domain transcends  international boundaries. Sharing knowledge  and expertise with international allies will  increase collective ability to understand and  defend against common adversaries, in turn  strengthening collective and global cyber  resilience. Government will continue to build  partnerships with its allies to achieve shared  objectives.    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  38  Chapter 4:    Protecting against   cyber attack  Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  38    39  Chapter 4: Protect against cyber attack  56. Protecting government effectively from cyber attack is  dependent on its understanding of risk. Directly responding  to risks faced will ensure that government is an increasingly  hardened target for any adversary.  57. The protective stance of individual government organisations  will be inextricably linked to its assessment and management of  risk. While it will never be possible to protect against all attacks,  those accountable will be able to demonstrate that they have  appropriately considered those risks and responded accordingly.  Objective 2:  Government will protect  against cyber attack  Government’s understanding of cyber  security risk will inform the adoption of  proportionate security measures across  government organisations, with centrally  developed capabilities enabling protection at scale.    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  40  Secure technology and digital services Outcome 9:   Government adopts a common approach to ‘secure by design’ to ensure that   appropriate and proportionate cyber security measures are embedded within the  technology government uses, and that the security of digital services is continually  assured throughout their lifecycle   58. Government relies on a range of technologies  to operate its functions and deliver digital  services. These include both commodity  and bespoke components that present  cyber security risks, which need to be  managed through their lifecycle. To do this,  government will adopt a ‘secure by design’  framework that will ensure all technology  and digital services are planned, procured,  designed, built, operated, modified and  decommissioned securely, enabling them  to be consistently and continuously assured  against best practice and robust standards.   59. This ‘secure by design’ framework will  further enable government to take advantage   of industry innovation by enhancing its ability  to test, pilot, and deploy commercial tools,  services and capabilities that make a   marked improvement of government’s  security and efficiency.  60. The ability to protect against evolving  vulnerabilities and threats is constrained  by the presence of legacy and vulnerable  IT across the government’s IT estate.  Government will therefore continue its  efforts to manage, upgrade or remove   such IT and put the necessary safeguards  and ongoing investment in place to   ensure government IT is sufficiently   secure throughout its entire lifecycle.     41  Chapter 4: Protect against cyber attack  FOCUS ON: A ‘secure by design’ framework for government  The government’s ‘secure by design’ framework will cement the discipline of  embedding cyber security into digital systems and services at every step of their  lifecycle - from the planning of a service, to the procurement and configuration of  technology and its decommissioning at the end of its operational life.   The framework will provide a continuous and iterative process for security, ensuring  that there is a consistent, comprehensive and proportionate process to manage cyber  security risk through the entire lifecycle, while providing a consistent framework for  continuous security assurance. It will ensure that developers of digital services have  security experts embedded within their teams to provide continuous security advice,  rather than relying on ad-hoc security advice at the end of a project.  This process will be incorporated within the Service Standard12 and Infrastructure  and Projects Authority gated process13 to ensure cyber security is an integral part of  creating public services. Secure by design blueprints, patterns, design principles and  best practices will also be published to ensure that wider public sector organisations  have a clear understanding of what is expected for securing the services they design,  deliver and operate.   A critical component of government’s ‘secure by design’ approach is ensuring that   any technology procured by government has an appropriate level of cyber security.  These ‘secure by design’ principles will therefore be baked into the Technology Code   of Practice14 which, through the government spend controls processes15, will ensure  that all technology used by government is appropriately securable.   12 HMG; ‘Service Standard’ 13 HMG; ‘Infrastructure and Projects Authority: assurance review toolkit’ 14 Central Digital and Data Office; ‘The Technology Code of Practice’ 15 Central Digital and Data Office; ‘Digital and technology spend controls’    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  42  Cyber security controls Outcome 10:  Government organisations deploy cyber security controls commensurate with their  risk profi le to ensure that risks to their functions are managed proportionately  61. While secure technology provides the  foundations of effective cyber security,  appropriate and proportionate security  controls will also be put in place. While many  security controls will be common across  all government organisations, such as  appropriate access controls, the broader set  of requirements will respond to threats faced.   62. The threats faced by an organisation’s  important functions will therefore determine  the appropriate CAF profi le as part of the  government’s assurance process. That CAF  profi le will defi ne the outcomes required to  appropriately manage the risk posed by  the threat. Achieving those proportionate   outcomes will depend on the application  of particular controls which will be clearly  signposted to government organisations,  alongside appropriate policies and guidance.  While lead government departments will be  able to apply such an approach in a way that  is most appropriate, they will be able to draw  from such processes, guidance and support.  63. Higher classifi cation systems provide the  additional cyber security controls required to  handle information classifi ed above OFFICIAL.  These systems are centrally managed and  assured to maintain the appropriate level of  cyber security.  Figure 7: Appropriate and proportionate access controls    43  Chapter 4: Protect against cyber attack  43  Chapter 4: Protect against cyber attack    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  44  Secure configuration Outcome 11:   Government technology is appropriately configured, with standard profiles for   common technology and architectures being developed and continuously updated  Shared capabilities Outcome 12:   Shared capabilities, tools and services tackle ‘common’ cyber security issues at scale  64. Technology and digital services are only as  secure as their architecture and configuration  allow. While adopting a comprehensive  ‘secure by design’ approach will address  some of this risk, a designer, administrator  or user always has a responsibility to  appropriately configure a system or service  to meet security requirements. Doing so  incorrectly can leave systems and data  unprotected or easily open to compromise.  This risk will become increasingly acute  as government continues its digital  transformation.   65. To reduce this risk, secure by design  configuration patterns and capabilities for  prominent products and services will be  developed in partnership with suppliers and  promoted across government to ensure  that common products and services are  configured correctly. These configurations  will be easily auditable, enabling cross- government visibility to identify aggregate  risks and respond to identified threats at  pace and scale.  66. A core component of this strategy’s ‘defend  as one’ pillar is the necessity of harnessing  shared capabilities, tools and services to  disproportionately improve government cyber  security as well as provide value for money.  Whether that be centralised work to protect  gov.uk domains for the whole public sector, or  the development and increased availability of  Active Cyber Defence tools and services,   such efforts either reduce the risk faced by        government organisations or support them in  managing it efficiently and effectively.  67. Government will therefore continue to  develop and scale-up such capabilities.  Coordination and collaboration are key  to this, both to ensure that solutions are  targeted where they are most needed and  to enable government to foster innovation to  drive improved cyber security at scale.  FOCUS ON: Secure configuration of government’s productivity suites  Government will work with its primary providers of productivity suites to further develop  baseline security configurations for government organisations to follow and adapt. Doing so  will ensure that all government organisations understand how to configure their productivity  suites to provide a baseline level of cyber security, which will dramatically reduce common  risks caused by misconfiguration.    45  Chapter 4: Protect against cyber attack  FOCUS ON: Active Cyber Defence  Active Cyber Defence is an NCSC programme that seeks to ‘protect the majority of people  in the UK from the majority of the harm caused by the majority of the cyber attacks the  majority of the time’. There is a specific intent to tackle, in a relatively automated way, a  significant proportion of the cyber attacks that impact government systems.  Active Cyber Defence is complementary to, and does not replace, system owners’  investment in good cyber security. It is made up of a growing number of capabilities,  including:   •  Capabilities to detect and disrupt threats – by identifying malicious activity at  scale and/or instigating an automated response to disrupt it. These include:  •  Takedown Service – finds malicious sites and notifies owners to get them  removed  •  Protective DNS – blocks inadvertent access to domains or IPs that are known  to contain malicious content, and malware already on a network attempting to  call home  •  Host Based Capability – analyses technical metadata on hosts, such as  laptops and servers, across government departments for malicious activity  to make OFFICIAL systems a harder target [see ‘FOCUS ON: Host Based  Capability’ for more detail)   •  Cyber Threat Intelligence Adaptor – enables authorised organisations to  receive a high-quality, contextually rich, cyber threat intelligence feed from the  NCSC  •  Capabilities to provide self-service checks and alerts – making it simpler for  organisations to check and improve their security posture. These include:  •  Early Warning – helps organisations investigate cyber attacks on their  network by notifying them of malicious activity detected in information feeds  •  Mail Check – helps organisations assess their email security compliance and  adopt secure email standards  •  Web Check – helps owners of public sector websites to identify and fix  common security issues, making sites a less attractive target to attackers  •  Exercise in a Box – provides a toolkit of realistic scenarios that helps  organisations practise and refine their response to cyber security incidents in  a safe environment                 This list is by no means exhaustive and the number of capabilities continues to evolve.16  Focused investment in selected Active Cyber Defence capabilities will be a key part  of the success of this strategy. This includes targeted development and extended  coverage for wider public sector organisation, and new capabilities responding to  emerging developments in technology and adversary tradecraft.  16 NCSC; ‘Active Cyber Defence: the fourth year’; May 2021    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  46  Information and data security Outcome 13:   Government data is classified appropriately and handled and shared in a way  commensurate to the risk it presents  68. Government has a responsibility to protect  data, whether classified information or the  personal data that it handles and shares  to deliver its functions and services.  Government will therefore handle, share, and  store or host its data assets in a way that is  proportionate to the risks they present.  69. At the heart of this is the effective  classification of information based on  agreed threat models and a comprehensive  assessment of risks associated with  the information being handled. Central  classifications policy sets out the criteria  and the required handling instructions for  information classified at different tiers.   FOCUS ON: Classifications policy  Government will update the Security Classifications Policy to improve the handling of  information at the OFFICIAL tier and ensure that the most sensitive information held at  this tier is adequately and consistently protected. It will also provide departments and  individual users with clearer guidance, especially on new capabilities and changes to  ways of working, so they can better protect classified information.   FOCUS ON: Security in data sharing  The National Data Strategy17 sets out the government’s mission to transform its use of  data to drive efficiency and improve public services. To achieve this, the government is  undertaking an ambitious and radical transformation of its own approach, driving major  improvements in the way information is efficiently managed, used and shared across  government. As well as demanding robust data standards that drive consistency and  interoperability, government will ensure that data protection and security is at the heart  of its approach.  17 HMG; ‘National Data Strategy’; December 2020    47  Chapter 4: Protect against cyber attack  70. The majority of government information is  classified as OFFICIAL and is dependent  upon the technology and controls outlined  above. However, there will be occasions  where the threat model requires certain  information to be protected at a higher  classification, for which the commodity  technology available for OFFICIAL  information is not suitable. To account for  this need, government will continue to  develop a ‘full-stack’ solution that enables  a suitably secure, collaborative and user- friendly way of working across government  at the appropriate classification.  71. Where sensitive data has to be processed  on OFFICIAL systems in order to perform  a business function, protections will be put  in place that are commensurate to the risks  presented.  FOCUS ON: Rosa  Rosa is the cross-government  SECRET IT service. Since its launch  it has been adopted by an increasing  number of users for an increasing  number of use cases, reaching over  12,000 users and 74 departments in  2021. Government will build on this  success by continuing to invest in  Rosa to ensure that it continues to  meet the growing needs of its users.   As well as making it significantly  easier to handle government  information at the appropriate  classification, the increasing  provision of Rosa will mean it is  less likely that information is under- classified, making it much more  difficult for adversaries to access   and exploit.    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  48  FOCUS ON: Harnessing emerging technologies  The pace of technological change presents both challenges and opportunities for  government cyber security. Government must be able to apply such technologies to  enhance its cyber security capabilities across the government, while ensuring that its  application is as secure as it needs to be.  Artificial Intelligence (AI)   AI is a form of software that can learn to solve problems at a scale and speed  impossible for humans and is becoming an integral part of modern systems.   In cybersecurity, AI has three distinct aspects:   •  Use of AI to secure systems. Many AI algorithms are complex and opaque,   with the potential to introduce new classes of vulnerability. Understanding and  mitigating these emerging threats is a priority.   •  Use of AI to improve cybersecurity threat detection and, in some cases,   to enable automated response to threats.    •  Recognising and mitigating AI-based attacks from adversaries.   The Office for Artificial Intelligence is a joint BEIS-DCMS unit responsible for overseeing  implementation of the wider National AI Strategy.18 In addition, the Alan Turing Institute  and similar bodies are researching how we might build and use AI in a more ethical,  responsible manner. Government is committed to creating and using AI in a way that  supports security, fairness, empowerment, transparency and accountability.   Quantum  Quantum computers use properties of quantum mechanics to compute in a  fundamentally different way from today’s ‘classical’ computers. They are, theoretically,  capable of performing certain computations that would not be feasible for classical  computers.   ‘Quantum-safe cryptography’ replaces the quantum-vulnerable mathematical problems  with those believed to be intractable for both classical and quantum computers.  ‘Quantum-safe cryptography’ using standards-compliant products will therefore provide  the most effective mitigation for the serious threat that quantum computers pose to long- term cryptographic security, and will be deployed across government when required.  Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  48  18 HMG; ‘National AI Strategy’; September 2021    49  Chapter 4: Protect against cyber attack  FOCUS ON: Advanced protections  The thrust of this strategy is about ensuring government reaches and maintains a  level of resilience that is proportional to its risk. However, it is recognised that the most  sophisticated actors may be able to overcome robust cyber security measures given  enough investment and determination.  Government will deploy its full spectrum of capabilities to respond to the most  sophisticated threats. Such capabilities will include advanced protection and detection  techniques, as well as targeted use of government’s offensive cyber capability and  broader international and diplomatic efforts to disrupt and deter such threats.  49  Chapter 4: Protect against cyber attack    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  50  Chapter 5:    Detecting cyber   events  Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  50    51  Chapter 5: Detect cyber security events  72. Despite robust protections being put in place, evolving  adversary techniques and the discovery of unknown  vulnerabilities means that cyber attacks will still occur.  To respond to the changing threat landscape, government  requires comprehensive detection capabilities to identify  emerging risks so that they can be managed.  73. Building on the foundation of risk management and  commensurate protective measures, government will develop  its capability to detect cyber security events across every part  of its estate to ensure that the risks can be mitigated before  they critically impact government functions.  Objective 3:  Government will detect  cyber security events  Government has the capability to monitor  its systems, networks and services to detect  cyber security events before they become incidents.  Enhanced coordination will enable government to  have the agility to use these data inputs to detect  at pace and scale, facilitating coherent responses  as well as providing the capabilities to detect more  sophisticated attacks.    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  52  Detection within government organisations Outcome 14:   Government networks, systems, applications and end points are monitored to provide  proportionate internal detection capability  74. To adequately fulfil their responsibilities  to manage their risks, every government  organisation will have proportionate  monitoring capabilities as well as the ability  to retain and interrogate logs to facilitate  the detection of cyber threats. Monitoring  should be as holistic as possible - from the  monitoring of underpinning infrastructure,  such as domains, through to host-based  monitoring of end points and cloud-based  services, and the monitoring of privileged  accounts on an organisation’s network  and in its supply chain. To achieve this,  smaller organisations may form part of a  larger conglomerate, particularly within  sectors orchestrated by lead government  departments.  75. Government will establish a common  process and language for organisations to  record and share information about cyber  security incidents and ‘near misses’ - in a  machine-readable format. This will ensure  that there is consistency and comparability  across government organisations as well  as allowing for enhanced visibility that will  improve government’s ability to learn, adapt  and mitigate at scale.  76. The detection capabilities of government  organisations will continue to evolve,  particularly for those departments who have  lower risk tolerances. In such circumstances,  more advanced detection methods, such as  behavioural monitoring, will be deployed to  detect more sophisticated attacks.  FOCUS ON: Host Based Capability (HBC)  HBC is a service run by NCSC, designed to make OFFICIAL systems a harder target.  Technical metadata on hosts, such as laptops and servers, across government  departments is analysed using specialised knowledge and tradecraft at NCSC.    HBC is provided as a three-part service:  • Detect: HBC takes a sector-focused view of the threats departments face. It uses  NCSC’s knowledge of indicators, adversary tactics, techniques and procedures to  detect malicious activity.   •  Threat Surface: Reporting provides metrics to help departments understand and  improve their IT cyber hygiene.    • Forewarn: HBC seeks to warn departments about their exposure to major  vulnerabilities.   HBC’s use across government will continue to scale, with future developments including  cloud-based capability, and responses to shifts in technology and attacker tradecraft.    53  Chapter 5: Detect cyber security events  Detection at scale Outcome 15:   Shared detection capability provides detection at scale across government  77. Effective detection capability requires  the timely sharing of information across  the whole of government, so that events  identified in one organisation can be  mitigated across all others. The mechanisms  will be established to ensure that this  information can be easily and securely  shared, in an automated way, with an  expectation placed on organisations  to escalate alerts swiftly with clear and  defined paths for doing so. Getting this  right is critical to identifying, managing and  mitigating emerging threats at the scale and  pace required.   78. To enhance the detection and identification  of more sophisticated actors on government  networks and systems, a programme of  strategic threat hunting will be established  which will include the exploration of more  advanced capabilities such as deception  tactics and honeypots.     Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  54  Chapter 6:    Minimising the  impact of cyber  security incidents  Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  54    55  Chapter 6: Minimise the impact of cyber security incidents  79. Even with robust protection and detection measures in place,  government will be impacted by cyber security incidents. It is  therefore essential that government is able to rapidly respond  to cyber incidents when they do happen and minimise their  impact as far as possible.   80. Effective risk management, appropriate and proportionate  protective measures, and enhanced detection capability will  make government a considerably hardened target. However,  government will also improve its ability to respond and recover  from incidents when they do happen to ensure the continuity  of essential functions and services.   Objective 4: Government will minimise  the impact of cyber  security incidents  Cyber security incidents will be swiftly contained,  assessed and managed, enabling rapid mitigation  response across government.     Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  56  Response preparation Outcome 16:   Government is fully prepared to respond to cyber incidents  Incident response Outcome 17:   Government rapidly responds to cyber incidents, both organisationally   and across government  81. Organisational and cross-government  cyber security incident response plans  will clearly set out how government will  respond to an incident to minimise its  impact. Organisational plans will be routinely  exercised through table-top scenario  planning and red, blue and purple term  activities, being updated as required to  ensure that they are fit for purpose and  continue to reflect the current threat  environment.   82. Cross-government exercising will also be  routinely carried out to ensure that senior  leadership teams across government -  including wider public sector organisations  that deliver critical services - are practised  and prepared to lead the response to  cyber incidents that may impact multiple  organisations across the public sector.  83. Government organisations - either directly  or through support of another government  organisation - will have the structures and  capabilities in place to triage cyber security  incidents and rapidly assess their impact.  Having clear escalation pathways is a  crucial part of this, to ensure that the right  people are made aware - both within the  organisation and beyond - and the right  expertise and resource is made available.  84. Central incident response functions will  have the capacity and capability to manage  serious and cross-government cyber  security incidents with defined processes  and mechanisms in place to ensure that all  impacted parties are working collaboratively  to minimise the impact. The GCCC will play  a critical role.    57  Chapter 6: Minimise the impact of cyber security incidents  Incident recovery Outcome 18:   Government restores systems and assets affected by cyber security incidents   and resumes the operation of its functions with minimal disruption  Lessons learned Outcome 19:   Lessons learned from cyber incidents drive improvements in government’s   cyber security  85. As well as being prepared and able to  respond to cyber security incidents,  government will be able to recover from  them as quickly as necessary so that any  disruptions to its functions are minimised.  86. Enacted response plans will ensure that  an organisation can assess the risk from  an incident using appropriate expertise  and taking the necessary steps to resume  its functions to an acceptable level within  tolerable periods of disruption.  87. Following the completion of incident  response processes, central oversight of  recovery from the most severe incidents will  ensure that systemic risks are identified and  mitigated.  88. To continue to drive improvements in cyber  security, government will learn lessons from  every cyber security incident and event -  from serious incidents to ‘near misses’.  89. Government will be able to objectively learn  from serious and cross-government cyber  security incidents, with the most significant  incidents being subject to an independent  review to provide sufficient scrutiny.  90. Just as importantly, government will learn  lessons from less serious events and  ‘near misses’. At the heart of this is the  creation of a culture where cyber security  colleagues feel confident sharing such  information across government, without fear  of embarrassment or blame. Doing so will  ensure that government understands the  root causes of incidents and can diagnose  and communicate solutions to the whole of  government to enhance its collective cyber  resilience.    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  58  Chapter 7:    Developing the right  cyber security skills,  knowledge and culture  Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  58    59  Chapter 7: Develop the right cyber security skills, knowledge and culture  91. Achieving this strategy’s vision and aim will not be possible  without appropriately skilled people, including those working in  technical, policy and strategy, risk management, and leadership  roles. In line with the objectives set out in the National Cyber  Strategy, government will lead by example in boosting the scale,  diversity and quality of cyber security professionals across  government organisations, while fostering a cyber security  cultural shift that will facilitate sustainable change.  92. There is diversity in the breadth and depth of cyber security  skills required across government. These include deep technical  skills and the non-technical cyber security skills that are needed  across other specialisms and professions, such as digital, policy,  commercial and assurance. Guided by the standards and pathways  established by the UK Cyber Security Council, government will  develop its understanding of the range of cyber security skills  and knowledge required across government and will respond  accordingly, ensuring that its workforce is inclusive and diverse.  93. This aspiration is, however, set within the context of a national  cyber security skills gap19. The focus is therefore placed on  investing in and building those skills from a multitude of entry  points with a consistent career offer across government to aid  recruitment and retention while reducing reliance on contractors.  The continued creation of leading learning opportunities will further  develop the profession, strengthening government’s employment  offer and its ability to compete.  94. While the government security profession is focused on  improving the cyber security profession across government  departments, it mutually supports cyber security skills initiatives  across the public sector, as well as providing a framework for  wider public sector organisations to understand and manage  their cyber security skills requirements.  19 Ipsos MORI / DCMS; ‘Cyber Security Skills in the UK Labour Market 2021’; March 2021  Objective 5:  Government will develop the right  cyber security skills, knowledge  and culture  Government has suffi cient, skilled and knowledgeable  professionals to fulfi l all required cyber security needs. This  extends beyond technical cyber security experts to the  breadth of professional functions that must incorporate cyber  security into the services they provide - underpinned by a  cyber security culture that promotes sustainable change.    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  60  95. Achieving sustainable change also demands  a shift in cyber security culture, to one  that encourages and empowers people  to challenge, question, learn and drive  continuous improvement. Central to this is   the creation of inclusive environments and  the attraction and development of a diverse  security workforce that reflects the wider   UK population.  Skills requirements Outcome 20:   All government cyber security skills requirements are understood  96. Government will have a comprehensive  understanding of the volume and range of  cyber security skills and knowledge - both  technical and non-technical - required  to enable it to function with the required  resilience. As well as informing the  development of government workforce and   resourcing strategies, this understanding  will support and align with the work of the  UK Cyber Security Council to ensure that  consistent taxonomies, standards and  pathways are developed and adopted for  the cyber security profession across the UK.  FOCUS ON: Cyber security skills as part of the UK ‘cyber ecosystem’  Strengthening the UK cyber ecosystem by investing in people and skills and deepening  the partnership between government, academia and industry is one of the central pillars  of the National Cyber Strategy.   Cyber security skills are a fundamental component of that ecosystem and the National  Cyber Strategy sets out the clear objective to enhance and expand the nation’s cyber  skills at every level. This includes:  •  A significant increase in the number of people who have the skills they need to enter  the cyber workforce;   •  A higher quality and more established, recognised and structured cyber security  profession;   •  A more diverse cyber workforce; and  •  A steady and diverse flow of highly skilled people coming through our education  system.  Government is a key part of this ecosystem and its efforts to develop the right cyber  security skills and knowledge will align with broader national efforts to enhance the UK’s  cyber ecosystem.    61  Chapter 7: Develop the right cyber security skills, knowledge and culture  Attracting and retaining talent Outcome 21:   Government attracts and retains the diverse cyber security workforce it needs to be resilient  97. As well as the gap in cyber security skills  in the UK20, the cyber security workforce  continues to lack the diversity it needs.21  Attracting and retaining a government  workforce that truly represents different  genders and ages, social, cultural and  ethnic backgrounds, as well neurodiversity,  is essential to providing the spectrum of  perspectives and the creativity needed to  tackle the increasing diversity of threats faced.  98. Government will use its developing  understanding of its workforce, in the  context of the wider UK cyber security  workforce, to develop its approach  to attracting and retaining talent. The  development of apprenticeship and  graduate programmes, combined with an  extensive outreach programme to target  underrepresented groups, will continue  to attract cyber security talent into entry  level roles. However, the majority of skills  shortages across in the UK, including  government, are found among more  senior positions.22 The adoption of a single  cyber capability pay framework across  government, linked to accreditation, will  ensure that pay is directly linked to skill  level. This will enable government to better  compete with the private sector and attract   talent into all required positions, as well as  providing commonality across government  departments. Cyber security careers will  be further incentivised through a range of  initiatives, with a drive towards strengthening  a culture of inclusion and improving  representation.    99. Government also recognises that cyber  security talent can be found in every corner  of the UK, with particular hotspots of cyber  security firms found in the South East, the  North West, the South West and Scotland.23  To boost regional growth in the sector,  the Department for Digital, Culture, Media  and Sport (DCMS) is working closely with  regional cyber security clusters, supporting  their development and improving reach and  insight into local and regional cyber security  sector ecosystems. There are now over  twenty established and emerging cyber  security cluster organisations in the UK  that are promoting and investing in cyber  security. To support these efforts, and to tap  into these regional talent pools, government  has already begun to establish its own  centres of cyber security expertise across  different regions of the UK and will continue  to invest in more regional security centres.  20   Ipsos MORI / DCMS; ‘Cyber Security Skills in the UK Labour Market 2021’; March 2021  21   NCSC / KPMG; ‘Decrypting Diversity: Diversity and inclusion in cyber security’; 2020  22   IPSOS MORI/DCMS; ‘Cyber Security Skills in the UK Labour Market 2021’; March 2021  23   IPSOS MORI/DCMS; ‘UK Cyber Security Sectoral Analysis 2021’; February 2021  FOCUS ON: Cyber workforce and resourcing hub service  Government will move to an in-house cyber workforce and resourcing hub service to  improve recruitment outcomes and reduce the use of contractors. This includes working  closely with external partners to build a strong brand as well as targeted recruitment and  marketing of opportunities to improve diversity outcomes. Central oversight of the cyber  workforce will enable a more flexible model and greater movement across government.    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  62  Develop talent Outcome 22:   Government continuously develops its cyber security workforce to ensure that it has  and retains the skills it needs  100. Working with the UK Cyber Security  Council, government will continue to  develop comprehensive career pathways  for its cyber security professionals.  These pathways will provide diverse and  fulfilling cyber security careers with a full  development and learning offer.   101. Key to this will be the introduction of a skills  assessment tool that will allow government  to map the cyber security skills gap against   key roles with a view to developing centrally  funded learning programmes. Through  the creation of such comprehensive  learning curricula, government will drive the  professionalisation of cyber security roles.  This will be supported by partnerships  with recognised learning academies and  security institutions, ensuring that learning  is consistent and accessible to those public  sector organisations with less resources to  invest in training.   102. A strong focus will be placed on developing  an approach to accreditation that is linked to  recruitment and promotion. This will ensure  the status of the profession is recognised  both inside and outside of the public sector,  and that skills are developed in-line with  national standards as defined by the UK  Cyber Security Council.   103. As well as more formal career pathways,  a focus will be placed on strengthening  government’s leadership community to   ensure they have the skills required. This will  be part of our approach to build the cyber  security community across government, to  facilitate and encourage the sharing of ideas  and approaches, as well as lessons learned  when things go wrong. Creating the right  communities will break down barriers and  enable cyber security colleagues from across  government to develop individual talent as  well as collective expertise.  FOCUS ON: Establishing a government security learning academy  Government will establish a learning academy aimed at upskilling government security  professionals and the wider civil service. Among other security disciplines, it will  develop both technical and non-technical skills, providing masterclasses and access  to qualifications, linking up with professional bodies and academia to assure in-house  skills through skills assessment and accreditation.     63  Chapter 7: Develop the right cyber security skills, knowledge and culture  Cyber security knowledge across   other government functions Outcome 23:   Sufficient cyber security knowledge and awareness across government’s professional  functions ensures that cyber security is actively taken into consideration   Cyber security culture Outcome 24:   Government has a cyber security culture that empowers its people to learn,   question and challenge, enabling continuous improvements in behaviours and  resulting in sustainable change  104. The need for cyber security applies to all  domains and needs to be given appropriate  consideration across all professional  functions, from the Digital, Data and  Technology (DDaT) profession through  to government’s commercial and legal  functions. While the degree of expertise  required will vary depending on the  function in question, having an appropriate  knowledge of cyber security is essential.    105. Government will develop its understanding  of these requirements and will work across  other professions to improve cyber security  knowledge and awareness, with a particular  focus on senior leaders.   106. People and organisational culture are at  the heart of reducing risk. To truly make a  difference, it is essential to focus on people  as well as technology. This effort begins  with improving cyber security awareness  and knowledge across all public sector  workers, reinforcing the expectations of  public servants and embedding cyber  security awareness into public service  values. Government will provide tailored  advice and implement a broad range of  awareness-raising initiatives to ensure  that all public sector workers can better  protect themselves and the government  organisations they work for.  107. Government will build on these foundations  to create a positive cyber security  culture that promotes and empowers  its people to proactively engage on  the organisational cyber security risk.  Leadership, communication and consistency  are key to this, both departmentally and  across government. Transparent reporting  structures will make it easy to report and all  reporting will be handled confidentially and  sensitively. Mistakes will not be stigmatised  and incidents will be objectively understood  with findings used as development and  learning opportunities. People will be  kept informed of progress and benefits to  the organisation will be highlighted and  celebrated.     Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  64  Chapter 8:    Measuring success  Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  64    65  Chapter 8: Measuring success  108. This strategy sets out how government will  build and maintain its resilience in the face of  continuously evolving cyber risks. At its heart  is the aim for government’s critical functions  to be significantly hardened to cyber attack  by 2025, with all government organisations  across the whole public sector being  resilient to known vulnerabilities and attack  methods no later than 2030. Achieving this  aim will mean that government as a whole  will present a hardened target,  enabling  government functions to operate without  undue disruption and cementing the UK’s  authority as a leading democratic and  responsible cyber power.   109. This is an ambitious aim. To achieve the  level of organised and objective visibility  of cyber security risk across the whole  of government will require extensive  processes, mechanisms and partnerships  to be established. The task is complicated  by the varying levels of maturity, capability  and capacity that exist across government  organisations. This is particularly pertinent  for lead government departments, who,  as well as considering their own cyber  security posture, must also consider the  cyber security posture of the public sector  organisations in their purview.  110. Given the dynamic and complex nature  of cyber security vulnerabilities and the  continuous evolution of cyber attack tactics,  techniques and procedures, accounting  for known vulnerabilities is challenging.  Further to this, ‘known’ vulnerabilities cannot  simply refer to publicly disclosed security  flaws, but must also account for improper  security practices that unduly expose  an organisation to cyber attack. While  measuring cyber security is challenging,  establishing a coherent government cyber  security assurance framework, with tiered   government CAF profiles underpinned by  government-specific cyber threat profiles,  will provide a robust and consistent means  of assessing cyber resilience in a way that is  proportional to threats faced.   111. The strategy’s aim will therefore be achieved  when all government organisations meet the  outcomes set out in the appropriate CAF  profile under the government’s cyber security  assurance framework in the following  timeframes:  •  Government organisations that are  determined to be responsible for critical  functions will meet the outcomes set out  in an ‘Enhanced’ CAF profile by 2025.  •  All central government departments  will meet outcomes set out in their  designated CAF profiles by 2026.  •  All other government organisations will  meet outcomes set out in a ‘Basic’ CAF  profile by 2030.  112. Progress towards this aim will be clearly  monitored, both to demonstrate the  successful impact of the strategy and to  highlight areas where particular focus is  required. The following indicators will be  used to measure progress towards the aim:  •  The proportion of government  organisations in scope that have identified  their critical functions.  •  The proportion of government  organisations in scope whose critical  functions have been assessed against the  government assurance framework.  •  The proportion of government  organisations in scope whose assurance  outcomes are assessed as achieved.  Achieving the aim    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  66  114. It is recognised, however, that these  measures and indicators alone are not  sufficient to provide a complete picture  of government resilience. These broad  measures will therefore be underpinned by  a number of more granular KPIs that draw  from the strategy’s objectives and will guide  the delivery of this strategy.   115. A number of key principles will be applied  to guide the use of KPIs, ensuring that they  are consistent, appropriate, and provide  the oversight and transparency needed to  demonstrate genuine success, as well as  hold government to account.  116. The required outcomes will also be  underpinned by cross-government policies.  The impact of such policies will be monitored  and measured, with regular and robust  evaluation. Taken together, these measures  will provide a comprehensive picture of  government’s cyber resilience.  113. As the cyber threat and risk environment  continues to evolve, it is essential to ensure  that the outcomes demanded of government  organisations remain appropriate. All CAF  profiles, and the government specific threat  profiles that underpin them, will therefore be  periodically reviewed to ensure the required   outcomes are sufficient to maintain cyber  resilience in face of evolving risks. Doing so  will maintain the integrity of the aim of this  strategy and make sure that achievement  of required outcomes remains a strong  indicator of government resilience.  Maintaining an appropriate measure   of resilience  Underpinning key performance  indicators (KPIs)  FOCUS ON: Principles   of performance measurement  •  KPIs will place a minimum burden  on government organisations.  • Data generation will be automated  or based on preplanned and  agreed timelines wherever  possible.  •  KPIs will be achievable.  •  KPIs will not be pursued at the  expense of genuine cyber security  outcomes.  •  KPIs will demonstrate genuine  impacts and benefits (recognising  the limited quantifiable data that  directly demonstrates cyber  security outcomes).     67  Chapter 8: Measuring success  67  Chapter 8: Measuring success    Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  68  Chapter 9:    Implementing   the strategy  Government Cyber Security Strategy 2022–2030  68    69  Chapter 9: Implementing the strategy  117. Initiatives set out in this strategy can   be grouped as follows:  • Transformational initiatives that will  be undertaken immediately to unlock  disproportionate benefits across the  strategy’s outcomes.  •  Short to medium term initiatives that will  be established during the first spending  review period.  • Medium to longer term initiatives that are  currently unfunded and will be delivered  during the next spending review period.  118. Longer term unfunded initiatives are at  varying stages of development. These will  be regularly reviewed to ensure alignment  with policy priorities, value for money and  deliverability. A critical review will be tied  to the next spending review to ensure that  funding is directed appropriately towards  achieving the aim of this strategy.  FOCUS ON: The Government Security Centre for Cyber (Cyber GSeC)  The Cyber GSeC delivers a broad range of capabilities and services that support  government organisations to improve their cyber security posture and achieve an  appropriate level of cyber resilience. It therefore plays a critical role in delivering the  outcomes of this strategy.  In its pilot year, the GSeC worked with departments to assist in rolling out Active  Cyber Defence products produced by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and  provided trusted, specialist services, such as the Cyber Gap Analysis assessments  and reports, as well as access to expert cyber consultancy. Building from its success,  the Cyber GSeC will be scaled up to play an increasingly critical role in supporting  government to address weaknesses in cyber security. As well as providing bespoke  support to individual organisations, it acts as a critical delivery capability for the roll  out of centrally driven initiatives, reaching across all government organisations with a  particular focus on those that carry the greatest risk.  The Cyber GSeC is part of a broader suite of Government Security Centres which look  at the range of government security disciplines, from cyber security to physical and  personnel security. All Government Security Centres work closely together on cross- cutting issues, ensuring that government continues to improve its security posture  across all security disciplines.

Each  contributing outcome is associated with a set of indicators of good practice (IGPs). IGPs are used   to develop sector-specific CAF profiles, which provide a view of appropriate and proportionate   cyber security for those organisations.

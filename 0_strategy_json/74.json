Our country is the product of the convergence of knowledge and identities that support the Costa Rican way of living, the pura vida. Understanding and managing the balance between sustainability, growth and equity are our daily drivers. This keeps us open to the world, to new ideas, to new technologies. In other words, it opens us to transformations in favor of the common good. Therefore, the presentation of the Digital Transformation Strategy: The Bicentennial of Costa Rica 4.0 is an invitation to all institu- tions and sectors of Costa Rican society to come together in an effort to make the most of the opportunities of Industry 4.0, and take a historic leap to meet our destiny. We have set a goal to position the country as a leader in the use of digital technologies in the Concert of Nations.Techologies have become a keystone of public policies, by means of which social Carlos Alvarado Quesada President of the Republic of Costa Rica organizations, academia and the productive fabric of our nation develop innovative solutions to meet the challenges of a sustain- able future. That is why we see disruptive technologies as a toolbox to build a more cohesive society, and to redesign the State as a more efficient and transparent one. Digital transformation is called upon to be a force that will enhance the exercising of rights and responsibilities of citizens. Hence, this Strategy is one of the priorities in our development agenda, and in the daily work of public institutions. Most impor- tantly, it must operate as a concrete experience for the innovation of social dynamics upon which communities, companies, families and individuals build, amongst themselves, the develop- ment path and life projects they so choose. Thinking and delimiting the Bicentennial Costa Rica is a task that cannot be delegated, and neither can the challenges of facing economic growth and unemployment, strengthening the environ- mental sustainability and resilience to climate change, or driving social equity and inclusion. Hence, the Digital Transformation Strategy: The Bicentennial of Costa Rica 4.0 is called upon to be a turning point in the conflu- ence of human development and technology, of which the final impact depends on all of us. Take this as my most sincere invitation to join us in the execution of this Strategy, and to make our work the greatest evidence of our hope. Remarks by the President of the Republic 01 Digital Transformation Strategy: The Bicentennial of Costa Rica 2018-2022 The Government of the Bicentennial has undertaken the challenge of changing Costa Rica’s course to one that enhances the oppor- tunities and reaps the benefits of Industry 4.0 and the knowled- ge society. Today, more than ever, digital technologies have become catalysts in the transformation of nations, and the Minis- try of Science, Technology and Telecommunications, under the guidance and leadership of the President of the Republic, Mr. Carlos Alvarado Quesada, has undertaken the task of presenting the Digital Transformation Strategy: The Bicentennial of Costa Rica 4.0. Luis Adrián Salazar Solís Minister of Science, Technology and Telecommunica- 02 Remarks by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Telecommunications This document is the product of a consultation and co-creation exercise that involved multiple stakeholders of Costa Rican society. It includes the short, medium and long term visions, strategic focal points and lines of action that are to be developed in the coming years to achieve the transformation of Costa Rica into a digitally inclusive, more technologically connected, and more productively innovative state. Our country has a wide margin to grow in terms of digitalization and innovation; hence, inter-institutional and political coordina- tion and technical standardization require the highest level of political support. Hence, the Alvarado Quesada Administration has entrusted the MICITT [Ministry of Science, Technology and Telecommunications, in Spanish] with the consolidation of a digital transformation strategy that will help identify initiatives and proposals of disruptive technologies that will enable the creation of a national digital ecosystem which fosters greater equity and benefits for citizens, companies and the Costa Rican state. I am deeply grateful to the President of the Republic for his vision and leadership, the Inter-American Development Bank, for the support during this process, Mrs. Paola Vega Castillo, Vice-Min- ister of Science and Technology, and Mr. Edwin Estrada Hernán- dez, Vice-Minister of Telecommunications, as well as with the staff of MICITT and those who have contributed to this strategy with conviction and dedication. Background 03 1. Digital Transformation Strategy: The Bicentennial of Costa Rica 2018-2022 The President of the Republic of Costa Rica, Carlos Alvarado Quesa- da, is strongly committed to accelerating the nation’s development and creating the digital Costa Rica of the bicentennial. Therefore, acknowledging the opportunities posed by the widespread use of information and communication technologies (ICT) and worldwide interconnection, the Government seeks to bring about significant digital transformations in the institutions of the public sector and the society, with the aim of driving the socioeconomic development of the country, and guaranteeing a better quality of life for all inhabi- tants, in a more inclusive manner. Guaranteeing the development and wellbeing of the population through the opportunities brought by Industry 4.0 and the knowl- edge society are two of the main objectives of the Government of the Bicentennial. As evidence of such commitment, and in order to foster the condi- tions for the development of the Digital Transformation Strategy: The Bicentennial of Costa Rica, the Government issued Executive Decree N°41248. This Decree establishes the creation of a High Level Com- mission of the Digital Government of the Bicentennial that will act as an advisory body for the development of the national strategy aimed at the implementation of the digital government public policy. In addition, the Government issued Directive N°019, which sets out guidelines for institutions of the public sector for the development of the Digital Government of the Bicentennial. In addition to the instruments promoting progress in areas such as government digitalization, the National Science and Technology Plan raises the need to include a Digital Agenda that identifies a strategy to use ICTs to develop tools that promote a rapprochement between public institutions and their respective users, thereby facilitating communication and interactions, as well as the processing of services. This Digital Transformation Strategy: The Bicentennial of Costa Rica is a response to the demands of the National Science and Technology Plan, the National Development of Telecommunications Plan, and defines the actions to achieve the provisions and objec- tives of the National Development Plan. As a member of the international community, and as a regional model in Latin America, Costa Rica is pursuing the strategic use of technologies to accomplish the comprehensive transformation of its 04 people and country, guided by the basic principles of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Furthermore, it adheres to the commitments of the Digital Agenda for Latin America and the Carib- bean (eLAC 2020), including the development of digital infrastruc- ture, the promotion of digital transformation and of digital economy, the regional digital market, the digital government, culture, inclusion and development of digital abilities, and the use of emerging technologies for sustainable development. In addition, the Govern- ment’s efforts are aligned with the Ibero-American Charter of Electronic Government, which promotes the use of ICTs to improve the information and services offered to citizens, to guide the effectiveness and efficiency of public administration, and to stop the repeated submission by citizens and companies of documents with information already on file in the public administration. As a result of the mentioned efforts, important milestones have been achieved in terms of digital government. For example, digital signa- tures are available and digital documents are legally recognized; the Sole Digital Health Record [EDUS, in Spanish] was implemented; and a one-stop foreign trade solution is used, among other relevant solutions. These efforts have given Costa Rica a high e-government development rating (0.7004), as well as a high public services provi- sion online rating (0.6736), placing Costa Rica among the 10 most advanced countries in terms of digital government in America, according to the results of the United Nations E-Government Survey 2018. All actions taken in relation to the use of digital technologies and all efforts executed in terms of Digital Government have laid a solid foundation to develop the next stage, one that deepens and scales the use of digital services. Accordingly, new challenges arise in ensuring that the majority of the Costa Rican people and companies benefit from the consumption and provision of digital services and products, as well as in ensuring that they enhance national develop- ment and improve the quality of life of the inhabitants. Therefore, to define actions aimed at improving the efficiency of the government, to better serve the population, and to reach economic and social development it is necessary to build the required capabil- ities in the State, society and companies by leveraging the tools provided by Industry 4.0 and the knowledge society. This Strategy defines the actions to achieve these objectives. 1. Background Digital Transformation Strategy: The Bicentennial of Costa Rica 2018-2022 Methodology 05 2. Digital Transformation Strategy: The Bicentennial of Costa Rica 2018-2022 Analysis of the regulatory and legal framework: Documents on public policies, regulations and laws underpinning the develop- ment and adoption of the ICTs in the country were assessed. The foundations provided by the current National Science and Technology Plan, the National Telecommunications Develop- ment Plan, the National Knowledge Society and Economy Plan, and National Development Plan, were analyzed, among other documents. This analysis is explained partially in the Back- ground section. Studying international good practices: Countries at the forefront of digital transformation were identified, and their agendas as well as their implementation approaches were studied. Some of the agendas considered were those of Uruguay, Estonia, Korea, and Denmark, as well as Industry 4.0 and knowledge societies approaches (see Section 3). Assessment of the current state of affairs: MICITT director and officers, in consultation with different areas of the state, identi- fied existing solutions and conducted a SWOT analysis. This assessment is detailed partially in Section 4. Establishing a governance model: According to the fundamen- tal regulation of the Executive Branch and current regulations, the governance model and responsibilities of the Digital Trans- formation Strategy were defined, as well as its design and action guiding principles (see Section 5). Strategic alignment: With the purpose of guaranteeing strategic consistency with the national and sector planning instruments, the Transformation Strategy was aligned with each of the current instruments (see Section 6). Guiding principles summarized: based on the analysis, the MICITT team defined four guiding principles for defining and implementing the Strategy. They are explained in Section 7. Defining the vision: From the political guidelines and leader- ship of President Carlos Alvarado Quesada, as well as the ideas proposed by the Minister of Science, Technology and Telecom- munications, Luis Adrián Salazar Solís, and his team, a construction process was conducted to define the Strategy vision (see Section 8). Co-creating the lines of action: A participative workshop was held for the co-creation of lines of action. Several government officers contributed. Validating the lines of action: Focus groups, interviews and meetings were held with directors from government areas in charge of implementing the Strategy, as well as with relevant actors and allies. This process served to validate and socialize the defined lines contained in Section 9. Preparing the Digital Transformation Strategy: the Bicentennial of Costa Rica 4.0 involved the following activities: Legal analysis of the regulatory and legal framework Assessment of the current state of affairsStudying international good practices Establishing a governance model Guiding principles summarized Defining the vision 06 Co-creating the lines of action Validating the lines of action 2. Methodology Digital Transformation Strategy: The Bicentennial of Costa Rica 2018-2022 07 Industry 4.0 and knowledge societies 3. Digital Transformation Strategy: The Bicentennial of Costa Rica 2018-2022 Industry 1.0 Based on the incorpo- ration of mechanical production equipment Drivers: Steam machine Origin: England, 18th century Industry 2.0 Based on mass production Drivers: Electric power and division of labor Origin: United States, 19th century Industry 3.0 Based on the use of information technology and electronics for automated production Drivers: computers used for industrial automation Origin: Several countries, 20th century Industry 4.0 Based on cyber-physical systems for customized production Drivers: Nanotechnology, robotics, artificial intelligence and other disruptive technologies Origin: Germany, 21st century 08 This Strategy intends that Costa Rica build and benefit from two major developments shaping productive processes and the quality of life of persons: the fourth industrial revolution and knowledge societies. 3.1 Fourth Industrial Revolution The fourth industrial revolution refers to profound changes driven by advances in technology, such as robotics, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology and biotechnology, among other changes that industries and society will experience by 2020. These are disruptive changes in the creation, production and distribution of products, especially in the way companies create, distribute and appropriate value. It focuses on the growing smart digitalization and cooperative coordination across all productive units of the economy, which are leading to new economic and production models. Industry 4.0 is based on customized production, tailored to the client's preferences and on horizontal and digital integration of systems, processes and stakeholders involved in supply chains. 3. Industry 4.0 and knowledge societies Industry 4.0 is a new approach for organizing production processes. It involves transforming these processes to be performed by cyberphysical systems in a set of smart factories. These systems are based on integrated activities coordinating the production of products that are thought of, designed and built in line with each customer’s needs and preferences. This new approach to production is based on a massive and efficient digitalization of production activities, interinstitutional coordination of business processes, and the co-existence and collaborative work between people and robots. The collabora- tive work between people and robots is known as “co-botiza- tion” and is one of the core elements of smart factories. Conse- quently, the finished product is more than just a tangible object, as it is also linked to data, sensors, and intelligence that allows it to connect to other products through the internet of things, which provides better functions and changes the users’ everyday lives significantly. Reflecting on the monumental changes generated throughout the history of production processes shows that the world is currently at the dawn of a new era. It is thus necessary to equip society and Costa Rican companies to be lead actors in these new stages. Digital Transformation Strategy: The Bicentennial of Costa Rica 2018-2022 3.2 Knowledge societies UNESCO defines knowledge societies as those based on the creation, dissemination and use of information and knowledge. Furthermore, they are defined as organiza- tions structured by persons, based on contemporary knowledge, and representing new systems of quality of life. In these societies, the conditions to generate and process information and knowledge have been modified and enhanced by a technological revolution that is centered in the processing of and access to information and in applying new information and communication technologies to generate knowledge. In their economies, knowledge is acquired, disseminated and applied to improve the economic and social development. For its part, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) talks about “knowledge-driven economies” when it addresses the complex, global change that leads to the rise of Knowledge Societies and Economies. 3. Industry 4.0 and knowledge societies In these societies, the driving force that moves people and their activities forward is knowledge, which is created, shared and used to better their quality of life and thrive. For this purpose, the ICTs play a major role in the produc- tion and management of data, information and knowledge. In ecosystems where these elements are combined, namely production of data, information, technology and knowledge, innovations generally arise. These innova- tions are not limited only to the production sector, but rather must be understood as social processes developed in collaboration with different actors, including the government, academy, corporations and citizens. Both knowledge and innovation are requirements necessary and indispensable for promoting growth and driving the economies of countries around the world. 09 Digital Transformation Strategy: The Bicentennial of Costa Rica 2018-2022 As stated by UNESCO, no single model exists for knowl- edge societies, as each has its own unique advantages, strengths, and culture. Therefore, Costa Ricans ought to find ways to connect and strengthen the communities’ different kinds of knowledge, including traditional knowl- edge, and the new ways to develop, acquire and dissemi- nate knowledge, evaluated by the knowledge society and economy models and supported by the use and appropriation of ICTs. Technology Knowled ge In no va tio n Data Information Strengths and opportunities 4. 10 Digital Transformation Strategy: The Bicentennial of Costa Rica 2018-2022 Costa Rica has great strengths for the use and adoption of digital products and services, such as the strengths of citizens, companies, or the State, and the access to technology that these actors have. These strengths, in turn, provide the country with unbeatable opportunities that must be taken advantage of by the country. 11 Citizens OpportunitiesStrengths Companies State Technology Appropriate level of literacy Well-developed social benefits Provision of digital technologies for continuing educa- tion Availability of digital channels for interaction with the government and other actors. Strong and sustained economic growth since 2010 Expansion of products and services exports in recent years Competitive advantage in the region Access to technologies that improve the efficiency of the government and of governance Development of Industry 4.0 Growing market for digital services Political will for digital transformation Being a leader and benchmark in Latin America Broad penetration of mobile telephony Competitive connectivity prices Development of 5G Availability of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, data analytics, large data volumes, for the development of innovative services. 4. Strengths and opportunities Digital Transformation Strategy: The Bicentennial of Costa Rica 2018-2022 Digital transformation strategy governance 5. 12 Digital Transformation Strategy: The Bicentennial of Costa Rica 2018-2022 5.1 Governance The Digital Transformation Strategy: the Bicentennial of Costa Rica 4.0 is underpinned by the vision of the country’s authori- ties, guided by the President of the Republic and with the commitment to articulate, coordinate and follow up by the Ministry of MICITT as the authority in science, technology, telecommunications and digital governance. Aware of the need to reach consensus and receive support from institutions, government authorities prepared an instrument containing the country’s vision and the efforts needed to drive Costa Rican society’s digital transformation towards Industry 4.0 and the new challenges of knowledge economies, to make a better use of digital technologies at the service of citizens, companies and public administration. 5. Digital transformation strategy governance This involves, among other efforts, the need to improve how services are planned, requested by and provided to citizens and companies digitally; the acquisition and development of technological tools in the state; development of training programs and leveraging of the new digital skills of different sectors in society; and citizen transparency, accountability and participation in state proceedings and services. As a result, in addition to catalyzing efforts from national institutions, it is necessary to coordinate with the Ministry of the Presidency, as head of the State’s political course, and with the Ministry of Communication as head of the development of the Open Government. 5.2 Strategy Principles The Digital Transformation Strategy: the Bicentennial of Costa Rica 4.0 is guided by the following principles, in its design and actions: Digital Transformation Strategy: The Bicentennial of Costa Rica 2018-2022 Underpinned by transparency Socially inclusive Guided by the principle of purposeful value co-creation Aimed at economic development with environmental sustainability 13 Dynamic and flexible to adapt to the country’s needs and technological advances 6.

Digital Transformation Strategy: The Bicentennial of Costa Rica 2018-2022 Industry 4.0 and the Knowledge Society Technologies The new advancements and penetration of artificial intelligence techniques, data science, nanotechnology, biotechnology and bioengineering, and developments such as the Internet of Things, blockchain, 5G, geographic information systems and large volumes of data, among others, are driving major transformations in produc- tive processes and in the way people access information and services. This Strategy deems the appropriation of these technolo- gies by companies, citizens and public institutions as central and essential for the development of the country. Inclusive, integrated and safe digital services In order to promote inclusive growth, public institutions are expect- ed to provide digital services that are accessible and affordable for the entire population. At the same time, services must be integrat- ed, provided that the different government organizations work jointly exchanging information, to avoid, when starting a new process, requesting information from citizens and companies that they already possess. In addition, digital services, and all informa- tion on citizens and companies held by the government must be safely stored and protected under strict security standards. Digitally smart government In an effort to promote efficiency and the use of the tools available in the market, the Government will adopt the latest technological advances that will allow it to use data intelligently in making decisions and defining public policies. With these tools, the govern- ment will promote the development of personalized digital services that better satisfy the needs of citizens and companies, as well as citizen participation, and will install in public institutions a culture of accountability in meeting defined goals. The implementation of the Strategy, as well as the correct appropriation of solutions developed and driven by it, will require human talent. Talent is required in all scopes: public, private, and civil society. Human resources that possess knowledge, skills and expertise to develop new digital products and services are needed, as well as citizens that can consume and benefit from the use thereof. The development of human, organizational and institutional capacities requires financial resources. The Government will seek mechanisms to allocate the resources necessary to implement the Strategy. 17 7. Guiding principles Digital Transformation Strategy: The Bicentennial of Costa Rica 2018-2022 18 Vision 8. Digital Transformation Strategy: The Bicentennial of Costa Rica 2018-2022 With the objective of serving citizens and companies in complying with their priorities, the vision of the Strategy is to accelerate the productivity and competitiveness of com- panies, seeking inclusive and sustainable socioeconomic development from the momentum provided by digital transformation in citizens, companies and public entities. The final objective of these transformations is to improve the quality of life of inhabitants, to guarantee the corporate restructuring required by Industry 4.0 and to improve the government citizen relationship. The transformations driven are possible due to the availability of new tools, such as 5G connectivity, Internet of Things, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, data mining, blockchain, large volumes of data, 3D printing, data analytics, machine learn- ing, sensors and actuators, and geographic information systems, among others. These transformations focus on strategic areas such as education, health, social develop- ment, security, economics and commerce, innovation, transportation, digital government, the environment and cities and territories. A digitally transformed Costa Rica that accelerates its productivity, competitiveness, and socioeconomic development, taking advantage of Industry 4.0 and knowledge societies to attain the wellbeing of all its inhabitants in an inclusive manner and to drive the country’s sustainable development. 19 Public EntitiesCompanies Citizens Digital Transfor- mation Strategy: The Bicentennial of Costa Rica (2018-2022) Data Mining Data analytics Cloud Computing 3D Printing Internet of Things Sensors and actuators G.I.S.

Our country is the product of the convergence of knowledge and  identities that support the Costa Rican way of living, the pura vida.  Understanding and managing the balance between sustainability,  growth and equity are our daily drivers. This keeps us open to the  world, to new ideas, to new technologies. In other words, it opens  us to transformations in favor of the common good.  Therefore, the presentation of the Digital Transformation Strategy:  The Bicentennial of Costa Rica 4.0 is an invitation to all institu- tions and sectors of Costa Rican society to come together in an  effort to make the most of the opportunities of Industry 4.0, and  take a historic leap to meet our destiny.  We have set a goal to position the country as a leader in the use  of digital technologies in the Concert of Nations.Techologies have  become a keystone of public policies, by means of which social   Carlos Alvarado Quesada President of the Republic of Costa Rica  organizations, academia and the productive fabric of our nation  develop innovative solutions to meet the challenges of a sustain- able future. That is why we see disruptive technologies as a  toolbox to build a more cohesive society, and to redesign the  State as a more efficient and transparent one.  Digital transformation is called upon to be a force that will  enhance the exercising of  rights and responsibilities of citizens.  Hence, this Strategy is one of the priorities in our development  agenda, and in the daily work of public institutions. Most impor- tantly, it must operate as a concrete experience for the innovation  of social dynamics upon which communities, companies,  families and individuals build, amongst themselves, the develop- ment path and life projects they so choose.  Thinking and delimiting the Bicentennial Costa Rica is a task that  cannot be delegated, and neither can the challenges of facing  economic growth and unemployment, strengthening the environ- mental sustainability and resilience to climate change, or driving  social equity and inclusion.  Hence, the Digital Transformation Strategy: The Bicentennial of  Costa Rica 4.0 is called upon to be a turning point in the conflu- ence of human development and technology, of which the final  impact depends on all of us.  Take this as my most sincere invitation to join us in the execution  of this Strategy, and to make our work the greatest evidence of our  hope.     Remarks by the President of the Republic  01    Digital Transformation Strategy:                                        The Bicentennial of Costa Rica 2018-2022  The Government of the Bicentennial has undertaken the challenge  of changing Costa Rica’s course to one that enhances the oppor- tunities and reaps the benefits of Industry 4.0 and the knowled- ge society. Today, more than ever, digital technologies have  become catalysts in the transformation of nations, and the Minis- try of Science, Technology and Telecommunications, under the  guidance and leadership of the President of the Republic, Mr.  Carlos Alvarado Quesada, has undertaken the task of presenting  the Digital Transformation Strategy: The Bicentennial of Costa  Rica 4.0.  Luis Adrián Salazar Solís Minister of Science, Technology and Telecommunica-  02  Remarks by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Telecommunications  This document is the product of a consultation and co-creation  exercise that involved multiple stakeholders of Costa Rican  society. It includes the short, medium and long term visions,  strategic focal points and lines of action that are to be developed  in the coming years to achieve the transformation of Costa Rica  into a digitally inclusive, more technologically connected, and  more productively innovative state.   Our country has a wide margin to grow in terms of digitalization  and innovation; hence, inter-institutional and political coordina- tion and technical standardization require the highest level of  political support. Hence, the Alvarado Quesada Administration  has entrusted the MICITT [Ministry of Science, Technology and  Telecommunications, in Spanish] with the consolidation of a  digital transformation strategy that will help identify initiatives  and proposals of disruptive technologies that will enable the  creation of a national digital ecosystem which fosters  greater equity and benefits for citizens, companies and the Costa  Rican state.  I am deeply grateful to the President of the Republic for his vision  and leadership, the Inter-American Development Bank, for the  support during this process, Mrs. Paola Vega Castillo, Vice-Min- ister of Science and Technology, and Mr. Edwin Estrada Hernán- dez, Vice-Minister of Telecommunications, as well as with the  staff of MICITT and those who have contributed to this strategy  with conviction and dedication.    Background  03  1.  Digital Transformation Strategy:                                        The Bicentennial of Costa Rica  2018-2022    The President of the Republic of Costa Rica, Carlos Alvarado Quesa- da, is strongly committed to accelerating the nation’s development  and creating the digital Costa Rica of the bicentennial. Therefore,  acknowledging the opportunities posed by the widespread use of  information and communication technologies (ICT) and worldwide  interconnection, the Government seeks to bring about significant  digital transformations in the institutions of the public sector and  the society, with the aim of driving the socioeconomic development  of the country, and guaranteeing a better quality of life for all inhabi- tants, in a more inclusive manner.   Guaranteeing the development and wellbeing of the population  through the opportunities brought by Industry 4.0 and the knowl- edge society are two of the main objectives of the Government of the  Bicentennial.   As evidence of such commitment, and in order to foster the condi- tions for the development of the Digital Transformation Strategy: The  Bicentennial of Costa Rica, the Government issued Executive Decree  N°41248. This Decree establishes the creation of a High Level Com- mission of the Digital Government of the Bicentennial that will act as  an advisory body for the development of the national strategy aimed  at the implementation of the digital government public policy. In  addition, the Government issued Directive N°019, which sets out  guidelines for institutions of the public sector for the development of  the Digital Government of the Bicentennial.   In addition to the instruments promoting progress in areas such as  government digitalization, the National Science and Technology Plan  raises the need to include a Digital Agenda that identifies a strategy  to use ICTs to develop tools that promote a rapprochement between  public institutions and their respective users, thereby facilitating  communication and interactions, as well as the processing of  services.  This Digital Transformation Strategy: The Bicentennial of  Costa Rica is a response to the demands of the National Science and  Technology Plan, the National Development of Telecommunications  Plan, and defines the actions to achieve the provisions and objec- tives of the National Development Plan.  As a member of the international community, and as a regional  model in Latin America, Costa Rica is pursuing the strategic use of  technologies to accomplish the comprehensive transformation of its   04  people and country, guided by the basic principles of the 2030  Agenda for Sustainable Development.  Furthermore, it adheres to the  commitments of the Digital Agenda for Latin America and the Carib- bean (eLAC 2020), including the development of digital infrastruc- ture, the promotion of digital transformation and of digital economy,  the regional digital market, the digital government, culture, inclusion  and development of digital abilities, and the use of emerging  technologies for sustainable development. In addition, the Govern- ment’s efforts are aligned with the Ibero-American Charter of  Electronic Government, which promotes the use of ICTs to improve  the information and services offered to citizens, to guide the  effectiveness and efficiency of public administration, and to stop the  repeated submission by citizens and companies of documents with  information already on file in the public administration.     As a result of the mentioned efforts, important milestones have been  achieved in terms of digital government. For example, digital signa- tures are available and digital documents are legally recognized; the  Sole Digital Health Record [EDUS, in Spanish] was implemented;  and a one-stop foreign trade solution is used, among other relevant  solutions.  These efforts have given Costa Rica a high e-government  development rating (0.7004), as well as a high public services provi- sion online rating (0.6736), placing Costa Rica among the 10 most  advanced countries in terms of digital government in America,  according to the results of the United Nations E-Government Survey  2018.  All actions taken in relation to the use of digital technologies and all  efforts executed in terms of Digital Government have laid a solid  foundation to develop the next stage, one that deepens and scales  the use of digital services. Accordingly, new challenges arise in  ensuring that the majority of the Costa Rican people and companies  benefit from the consumption and provision of digital services and  products, as well as in ensuring that they enhance national develop- ment and improve the quality of life of the inhabitants.  Therefore, to define actions aimed at improving the efficiency of the  government, to better serve the population, and to reach economic  and social development it is necessary to build the required capabil- ities in the State, society and companies by leveraging the tools  provided by Industry 4.0 and the knowledge society. This Strategy  defines the actions to achieve these objectives.  1. Background  Digital Transformation Strategy:                                        The Bicentennial of Costa Rica 2018-2022    Methodology  05  2.  Digital Transformation Strategy:                                        The Bicentennial of Costa Rica  2018-2022    Analysis of the regulatory and legal framework: Documents on  public policies, regulations and laws underpinning the develop- ment and adoption of the ICTs in the country were assessed.   The foundations provided by the current National Science and  Technology Plan, the National Telecommunications Develop- ment Plan, the National Knowledge Society and Economy Plan,  and National Development Plan, were analyzed, among other  documents. This analysis is explained partially in the Back- ground section.  Studying international good practices: Countries at the  forefront of digital transformation were identified, and their  agendas as well as their implementation approaches were  studied. Some of the agendas considered were those of  Uruguay, Estonia, Korea, and Denmark, as well as Industry 4.0  and knowledge societies approaches (see Section 3).  Assessment of the current state of affairs: MICITT director and  officers, in consultation with different areas of the state, identi- fied existing solutions and conducted a SWOT analysis. This  assessment is detailed partially in Section 4.  Establishing a governance model: According to the fundamen- tal regulation of the Executive Branch and current regulations,  the governance model and responsibilities of the Digital Trans- formation Strategy were defined, as well as its design and  action guiding principles (see Section 5).  Strategic alignment: With the purpose of guaranteeing strategic  consistency with the national and sector planning instruments,  the Transformation Strategy was aligned with each of the  current instruments (see Section 6).  Guiding principles summarized: based on the analysis, the  MICITT team defined four guiding principles for defining and  implementing the Strategy. They are explained in Section 7.  Defining the vision: From the political guidelines and leader- ship of President Carlos Alvarado Quesada, as well as the ideas  proposed by the Minister of Science, Technology and Telecom- munications, Luis Adrián Salazar Solís, and his team, a  construction process was conducted to define the Strategy  vision (see Section 8).  Co-creating the lines of action: A participative workshop was  held for the co-creation of lines of action. Several government  officers contributed.  Validating the lines of action: Focus groups, interviews and  meetings were held with directors from government areas in  charge of implementing the Strategy, as well as with relevant  actors and allies. This process served to validate and socialize  the defined lines contained in Section 9.

These are disruptive changes in the creation, production and  distribution of products, especially in the way companies  create, distribute and appropriate value. It focuses on the  growing smart digitalization and cooperative coordination  across all productive units of the economy, which are leading  to new economic and production models. Industry 4.0 is based  on customized production, tailored to the client's  preferences and on horizontal and digital integration of  systems, processes and stakeholders involved in supply  chains.  3. Industry 4.0 and knowledge societies  Industry 4.0 is a new approach for organizing production  processes. It involves transforming these processes to be  performed by cyberphysical systems in a set of smart factories.  These systems are based on integrated activities coordinating  the production of products that are thought of, designed and  built in line with each customer’s needs and preferences. This  new approach to production is based on a massive and  efficient digitalization of production activities, interinstitutional  coordination of business processes, and the co-existence and  collaborative work between people and robots. The collabora- tive work between people and robots is known as “co-botiza- tion” and is one of the core elements of smart factories. Conse- quently, the finished product is more than just a tangible  object, as it is also linked to data, sensors, and intelligence that  allows it to connect to other products through the internet of  things, which provides better functions and changes the users’  everyday lives significantly. Reflecting on the monumental  changes generated throughout the history of production  processes shows that the world is currently at the dawn of a  new era. It is thus necessary to equip society and Costa Rican  companies to be lead actors in these new stages.  Digital Transformation Strategy:                                        The Bicentennial of Costa Rica 2018-2022    3.2 Knowledge societies   UNESCO defines knowledge societies as those based on  the creation, dissemination and use of information and  knowledge. Furthermore, they are defined as organiza- tions structured by persons, based on contemporary  knowledge, and representing new systems of quality of  life. In these societies, the conditions to generate and  process information and knowledge have been modified  and enhanced by a technological revolution that is  centered in the processing of and access to information  and in applying new information and communication  technologies to generate knowledge. In their economies,  knowledge is acquired, disseminated and applied to  improve the economic and social development. For its  part, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD) talks about “knowledge-driven  economies” when it addresses the complex, global  change that leads to the rise of Knowledge Societies and  Economies.   3. Industry 4.0 and knowledge societies  In these societies, the driving force that moves people and  their activities forward is knowledge, which is created,  shared and used to better their quality of life and thrive.  For this purpose, the ICTs play a major role in the produc- tion and management of data, information and knowledge.  In ecosystems where these elements are combined,  namely production of data, information, technology and  knowledge, innovations generally arise. These innova- tions are not limited only to the production sector, but  rather must be understood as social processes developed  in collaboration with different actors, including the  government, academy, corporations and citizens. Both  knowledge and innovation are requirements necessary  and indispensable for promoting growth and driving the  economies of countries around the world.  09  Digital Transformation Strategy:                                        The Bicentennial of Costa Rica 2018-2022  As stated by UNESCO, no single model exists for knowl- edge societies, as each has its own unique advantages,  strengths, and culture. Therefore, Costa Ricans ought to  find ways to connect and strengthen the communities’  different kinds of knowledge, including traditional knowl- edge, and the new ways to develop, acquire and dissemi- nate knowledge, evaluated by the knowledge society  and economy models and supported by the use and  appropriation of ICTs.

Aware of the need  to reach consensus and receive support from institutions,  government authorities prepared an instrument containing the  country’s vision and the efforts needed to drive Costa Rican  society’s digital transformation towards Industry 4.0 and the  new challenges of knowledge economies, to make a better use  of digital technologies at the service of citizens, companies  and public administration.  5. Digital transformation strategy governance  This involves, among other efforts, the need to improve how  services are planned, requested by and provided to citizens  and companies digitally; the acquisition and development of  technological tools in the state; development of training  programs and leveraging of the new digital skills of different  sectors in society; and citizen transparency, accountability and  participation in state proceedings and services. As a result, in  addition to catalyzing efforts from national institutions, it is  necessary to coordinate with the Ministry of the Presidency, as  head of the State’s political course, and with the Ministry of  Communication as head of the development of the Open  Government.  5.2 Strategy Principles  The Digital Transformation Strategy: the Bicentennial of Costa Rica  4.0 is guided by the following principles, in its design and actions:  Digital Transformation Strategy:                                        The Bicentennial of Costa Rica 2018-2022  Underpinned by transparency  Socially inclusive  Guided by the principle of purposeful  value co-creation  Aimed at economic development with  environmental sustainability  13  Dynamic and flexible to adapt to the  country’s needs and technological  advances    6.

Digital Transformation Strategy:                                        The Bicentennial of Costa Rica  2018-2022    Industry 4.0 and the Knowledge Society      Technologies   The new advancements and penetration of artificial intelligence  techniques, data science, nanotechnology, biotechnology and  bioengineering, and developments such as the Internet of Things,  blockchain, 5G, geographic information systems and large volumes  of data, among others, are driving major transformations in produc- tive processes and in the way people access information and  services. This Strategy deems the appropriation of these technolo- gies by companies, citizens and public institutions as central and  essential for the development of the country.      Inclusive, integrated and safe     digital services  In order to promote inclusive growth, public institutions are expect- ed to provide digital services that are accessible and affordable for  the entire population. At the same time, services must be integrat- ed, provided that the different government organizations work  jointly exchanging information, to avoid, when starting a new  process, requesting information from citizens and companies that  they already possess.  In addition, digital services, and all informa- tion on citizens and companies held by the government must be  safely stored and protected under strict security standards.     Digitally smart government  In an effort to promote efficiency and the use of the tools available  in the market, the Government will adopt the latest technological  advances that will allow it to use data intelligently in making  decisions and defining public policies. With these tools, the govern- ment will promote the development of personalized digital services  that better satisfy the needs of citizens and companies, as well as  citizen participation, and will install in public institutions a culture of  accountability in meeting defined goals.        The implementation of the Strategy, as well as the correct  appropriation of solutions developed and driven by it, will require  human talent. Talent is required in all scopes: public, private, and  civil society. Human resources that possess knowledge, skills and  expertise to develop new digital products and services are needed,  as well as citizens that can consume and benefit from the use  thereof. The development of human, organizational and institutional  capacities requires financial resources. The Government will seek  mechanisms to allocate the resources necessary to implement the  Strategy.   17  7.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Summary of the Basic Elements and Provisions of the Ghana Integrated ICT for Accelerated Development (ICT4AD) Policy Preamble Nations worldwide have recognized the developmental opportunities and the challenges of the emerging information age characterized by information and communication technologies (ICTs). These technologies are driving national development efforts worldwide and a number of countries in both the developed and developing world are exploring ways of facilitating their development process through the development, deployment and the exploitation of ICTs within their economies and societies. The Ghana ICT for Accelerated Development (ICT4AD) Policy represents the Vision for Ghana in the information age. It is based on the Policy Framework Document: “AAnn IInntteeggrraatteedd IICCTT-- lleedd SSoocciioo--eeccoonnoommiicc DDeevveellooppmmeenntt PPoolliiccyy aanndd PPllaann DDeevveellooppmmeenntt FFrraammeewwoorrkk ffoorr GGhhaannaa”” released in March 2003. The development of this policy framework document was based on a nation-wide consultative process involving all key stakeholders in the public sector, private sector and civil society. The Ghana ICT for Accelerated Development (ICT4AD) Policy Statement fully takes into account the aspirations and the provisions of key socio-economic development framework documents including: the Vision 2020 –The First Steps; the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS) (2002 -2004) and the Co-ordinated Programme for Economic and Social Development of Ghana (2003- 2012) The Policy Statement sets out the road map for the development of Ghana’s information society and economy and provides a basis for facilitating the socio-economic development of the country in the emerging information, knowledge and technological age to be dominated by information and knowledge-based economies. The Policy is aimed at addressing a number of developmental challenges facing the country as a basis for achieving a number of policy goals and objectives. The key elements of the Policy Statement are summarized as follows: The Policy Challenges The Ghana ICT4AD Policy is designed to aid Ghana’s development process by contributing to addressing the nation’s key developmental challenges. These include: • The social and economic pressures of a youthful population and the challenges of turning the youthful population into an asset for development • The poor performance of the economy --- coupled with rapid population growth and declining per capita income 7 • An economy with low job creation capacity and dominated by an under-performing agricultural sector with weak under-developed industrial and services sector • The heavy national debt burden characterized by high debt per capita, and high debt- servicing ratio --- factors acting as major constrains on the nation’s development efforts • An under-developed and under-performing private sector with a disproportionate informal sector • Limited human resource capacity characterized by low professional, technical and managerial manpower base • Weak scientific research base and under-developed research and development (R&D) capacity • Relatively high proportion of the population with no educational attainment; a high school drop-out rate and limited access to higher education by the vast majority of the population especially girls and women. • Narrow export base dominated by traditional exports • Under-developed physical infrastructure and • Poor and limited communications and telecommunications infrastructure The Case for the ICT4AD Policy The emergence of the information age has brought to the fore, the important role that information, knowledge and technology can play in facilitating socio-economic development. The effective use of information and knowledge is becoming the most critical factor for rapid economic growth and wealth creation, and for improving socio-economic well-being. There is no doubt that information; knowledge and technology are increasingly becoming the key drivers for socio-economic development world-wide. A nation’s capability to accelerate its socio-economic development process and gain global competitiveness and improve the well- being of its people depends very much on the extent to which it can develop, use, exploit and sell, ---- information, knowledge and technology in one form or another. It has been acknowledged that for Ghana to move her industrially weak, subsistence agriculture based economy towards an information and knowledge economy she will need to develop and implement comprehensive integrated ICT-led socio-economic development policies, strategies and plans. With the right sets of policies and action plans it will be possible for Ghana to facilitate its socio-economic development process through the development, deployment and exploitation of ICTs within the economy and society without first going through an extensive industrialization process. It is however recognized that for the policy to make an appreciable desirable impact on the socio-economic development process of Ghana, it will need to be integrated into the overall 8 developmental objectives, priorities and programmes of the country. Such an all-inclusive comprehensive ‘ICT for development’ policy and strategies must be aimed at the implementation of initiatives that could contribute to addressing the key developmental challenges facing the country The Basic Question Addressed by the Policy Statement How to address Ghana’s developmental challenges and accelerate the nation’s socio-economic development process to improve the socio-economic well-being of its people through the development, deployment and exploitation of ICTs within the society and economy The Basic Premise of the Policy Ghana’s development process can be accelerated through the development, deployment and exploitation of ICTs within the economy and society The Basic Motivation of the Policy Ghana’s accelerated development within the emerging information and digital age will not be possible without an ICT-driven development agenda The Overall Objectives of the Policy To engineer an ICT-led socio-economic development process with the potential to transform Ghana into a middle income, information-rich, knowledge-based and technology driven economy and society The Specific Objectives of the Policy • To create the necessary enabling environment to facilitate the deployment, utilization and exploitation of ICTs within the economy and society • To support the development of a viable knowledge-based ICT industry to facilitate the production, manufacturing, development, delivering, and distribution of ICT products and services • To facilitate the modernization of the agricultural sector through the deployment and exploitation of ICTs to improve on its efficiency and productivity. • To support the development of a competitive high value-added services sector, to serve as an engine for accelerated development and economic growth with the potential to develop into a regional business-services and ICT hub. • To aid the process of the development of national human resource capacity and the nation’s R&D capabilities to meet the changing needs and demands of the economy • To promote an improved educational system within which ICTs are widely deployed to facilitate the delivery of educational services at all levels of the educational system 9 • To facilitate a wide-spread deployment and exploitation of ICTs within the society to support the delivery of health and social services • To support the modernization of the civil and public service through institutional reforms, renewal and the deployment and exploitation of ICTs to facilitate improvements in operational effectiveness, efficiency and service delivery • To facilitate the development, expansion, rehabilitation and the continuous modernization of the national information and communications infrastructure • To guide the development and implementation of electronic government and governance, as well as electronic commerce and business strategies and action plans • To accelerate the development of women and eliminate gender inequalities in education, employment, decision making through the deployment and exploitation of ICTs by building capacities and providing opportunities for girls and women • To facilitate the development and implementation of the necessary legal, institutional and regulatory framework and structures required for supporting the deployment, utilization and the development of ICTs; • To facilitate the development and promotion of the necessary standards, good practices and guidelines to support the deployment and exploitation of ICTs within the society and economy The Strategic Focus of the Policy To simultaneously target the development of the ICT sector and industry as well as use ICTs as a broad-based enabler of developmental goals, with emphasis on the development, deployment and exploitation of ICTs to aid the development of all other sectors of the economy The Priority Focus Areas of Policy --- The 14 ICT4AD Pillars • Accelerated Human Resource Development • Promoting ICTs in Education – The Deployment and Exploitation of ICTs in Education • Facilitating Government Administration and Service Delivery – Promoting Electronic Government and Governance • Facilitating the Development of the Private Sector • Developing an Export-Oriented ICT Products and Services Industry • Modernization of Agriculture and the Development of an Agro-Business Industry • Developing a Globally Competitive Value-Added Services Sector --- A Regional Business Service and ICT Hub • Deployment and Spread of ICTs in the Community • Promotion of National Health • Rapid ICT and Enabling Physical Infrastructure Development • Legal, Regulatory, and Institutional Framework Provisions • R&D, Scientific and Industrial Research Capacity Development • Promoting Foreign and Local Direct Investment Drive in ICTs 10 • Facilitating National Security and Law and Order Key Drivers of the Policy • ICTs as a Social-Enabler (Education, Health, Poverty-Reduction, Income-Distribution) • ICTs as an Enabler of rapid Socio-Economic development • ICTs as an Enabler of Government Administration and Service Delivery • ICTs as a Facilitator of Electronic Government and Electronic Commerce Initiatives • ICTs as an Engine of the Service Sector • ICTs as an Enabler of Knowledge-driven Industrial development • ICTs as an Enabler of the Agriculture Sector • ICTs as a Driver of Private Sector Development • ICTs as an Agent for Wealth Creation • ICTs as a Tool for Bridging the Gender inequality Gap in Social, Economic and Political development The Principal Questions Addressed by the Policy • Where we are as a nation? • Where do we want to get to as a nation? • When do we want to get there? • What do we need to do in order to get there? Concluding The Policy Statement reflects the nation’s total commitment to transform Ghana into an information-rich knowledge-based society and economy to ensure that Ghana and its people fully participate in the information age and enjoy the social, cultural and economic benefits of the emerging information revolution. The Government and the People of Ghana are wholeheartedly committed to the implementation of the provisions of the Policy to facilitate the process of establishing a prosperous society, with an economy that is globally competitive, dynamic, robust and resilient with respect to the rapid changes and advances that are taking place in the global economy to be dominated by technology-driven information and knowledge economies. To implement the Policy a number of 4-year rolling plans shall be developed and implemented within the life-span of the Policy – It is envisaged that the Policy will have an operational life of between fifteen to twenty years. --- And as a working and living document, it is anticipated that, necessary periodic revisions will be made in relation to its key elements to meet changing developmental objectives and priorities as well as changes in the global economy and advances in the technological environment. 11 PART ONE The Vision to Transform Ghana in the Information and Technology Age 12 Page Deliberately Left Blank 13 CHAPTER ONE TTHHEE PPOOLLIICCYY BBAACCKKGGRROOUUNNDD SSTTAATTEEMMEENNTT Ghana in the Information and Knowledge-based Age The emerging information and knowledge age and the new technological revolution are heralding a new economic and social order characterized by the development, and exploitation of ICTs within all spheres of human endeavor. This era is giving rise to the emergence of information and knowledge-based economies with traditional economic, industrial and commercial activities moving towards acknowledge- driven processes with most of the advanced economies progressively being transformed into knowledge- based technology-driven services dominated economies. These economies are increasingly laying emphasis on economic activities with intellectual content and knowledge. A number of countries are recognizing the need to rapidly develop their knowledge base through massive investments in human resource development laying emphasis on improving, and broadening universal access to higher and quality education and training avenues including on-the-job and in-service skill updates and life-long learning. Also the need to massively invest in research and development (R&D) efforts to create new products, and services as a way of gaining competitive advantage in an increasingly competitive global economic environment has been given a priority by most nations as part of their effort to develop their information economy and society. The use of these emerging technologies to transform government machineries to facilitate efficiency in operations and service delivery has also been a priority area of Governments worldwide. There is therefore no doubt that Governments world-wide have recognized the crucial role that ICTs can play in facilitating and accelerating socio-economic development. A number of countries in both the developed and developing world have in place relevant policies and strategic plans that will enable them transform their economies into information and knowledge-based economies. Ghana like other developing countries is equally placed to take advantage of these technologies to facilitate her socio- economic development to aid the process of transforming the nation’s economy and society into an information-rich and knowledge-based economy and society. The emerging information and knowledge economy is no doubt generating opportunities across all sectors in both developed and developing countries. --- It is a new source for the creation of quality jobs, wealth generation and redistribution, rapid economic development and prosperity as well as a means for facilitating global competitiveness. With the emerging information age, ICTs are seen by a number of countries as a key factor for achieving progress in economic and social development. These technologies are offering developing countries like Ghana a window of opportunity to leap-frog the key stages of industrialization and transform their subsistence agriculture dominated economies into a service-sector 14 driven, high value-added information and knowledge economy that can successfully compete on the global market. It is acknowledged that in the new information age, although the mere use of information, knowledge and technology can improve the socio-economic development fortunes of a given nation. Evidence shows that those nations who in addition are involved in the development as well as the sale of information (and information products), knowledge (and knowledge products) and technology (and its products), are moving faster on the socio-economic development scale compared to others. There is no doubt that in the new emerging economic order, the fundamental basis for wealth creation and national prosperity are information and knowledge and that Ghana cannot afford to be without either of these. The Challenges, and the Opportunities It is recognized that if Ghana is to move her industrially weak, subsistence agriculture-based economy towards an information and knowledge economy she will need to develop and implement comprehensive integrated ICT-led socio-economic development policies, strategies and plans set within the wider context of the socio-economic development objectives of the country. There is no doubt that for Ghana to compete and prosper in the new emerging global economy to be dominated by information and knowledge-based economies, she will need to embrace and harness ICTs to facilitate her development process. Ghana’s success in the emerging knowledge revolution and technological age will depend on the extent to which it manages to address the resultant developmental challenges and take advantage of rapidly evolving technologies. It is acknowledged that, although these new technologies present considerable challenges to developing countries like Ghana, they also provide considerable opportunities for sustainable development and for improving competitiveness of key sectors of the economy like: agriculture, industry, and services. This Policy Statement defines Ghana’s ICT-driven development agenda in the information age. The Statement sets out Ghana’s road map in terms of the vision, missions, strategies and policy priorities for developing Ghana’s information society and economy --- The ultimate objective is to: accelerate Ghana’s socio-economic development process towards the realization of the vision to transform Ghana into a high income economy and society that is predominately information-rich and knowledge-based within the next two to three decades or less. Acknowledging Ghana’s Developmental Challenges in terms of Key Socio-Economic Development Indicators The ICT4AD Policy acknowledges that for it to make a desirable and appreciable impact on the country’s developmental process it must in addition to being related to the wider social and economic development objectives and priorities of the nation, be aimed at addressing the developmental challenges facing Ghana defined in terms of key socio-economic indicators; ---- with specific reference to the fact that: • Ghana has a relatively high population growth rate. And that the nation’s population based on the current population growth rate of 2.5%, will reach 38 million --- double the 2000 figure by 2028. • Ghana has a relatively youthful population with close to 60% of the population under the age of 25 years and only 5% of the population over 65 years old 15 • Ghana’s high illiteracy rate with close to 40% of the population above the age of 6 years without any form of educational attainment with only about 3% of the population with tertiary level education has serious implications for the nation’s development. • The country has a high primary school drop-out rate and very low secondary school enrolment rate. --- With close to 50% of junior secondary school leavers failing to progress to senior secondary school and a high proportion of senior secondary school leavers failing to continue their education. • Close to 40% of Ghanaians currently live below the poverty line of less than $1 per day and five of the 10 regions of the country currently have more than 40% of their people living in poverty. The ICT4AD Policy has also taken into account the fact that: • Ghana has a predominantly agricultural economy ---- most of which is based on subsistence farming with very little mechanization or application of modern agricultural production methods or practices. The agriculture labour force has a high percentage of women and about 70% of these are illiterate • The Ghanaian economy has not experienced a major structural transformation since independence. --- And that the majority of the working population (60%) are still actively involved in agriculture with only 13% working in the industrial sector and 28% in the service sector of the economy • Ghana's industrial base is narrow and its services sector, the second largest contributor to GDP after the agriculture sector, is under-developed • The informal private sector is by far the largest employment sector of the Ghanaian economy. ---- This sector alone accounts for about 81% of the employed work force, with the formal private sector accounting for only 8% of the employment of the economically active population. Majority of women operate in the informal sector with very little support The Policy Statement also acknowledges that: • The job creation capacity of the Ghanaian economy is extremely low. ---- And that most of the employed population are involved in set-ups that do not have the potential to generate additional jobs or employment opportunities. • Only about 15% of the working population are employees of public and private sector organizations; and that close to 68% of the employed population are self-employed with no employees compared to 5.2% of self-employed with one or more employees. • Ghana is currently facing a human resource problem in technical and managerial skills and more so in the area of ICT skills. • Ghana’s R&D capacity and capabilities are limited, with the nation’s universities and research institutions lacking the necessary capacity to conduct and engage in advanced and cutting-edge R&D work. 16 The Policy additionally takes into account the fact that: • Ghana's national debt is a major impediment to economic development; and that, the nation’s average national debt per capita (in 2000) exceeded its annual average gross national income per capita. And that Ghana’s debt burden measured in terms of its annual debt servicing payments do present the country with a major developmental challenge • Ghana’s current gross national income per capita of $340 is lower than the average for Sub- Saharan African countries estimated at $480 and also lower than that of low-income countries estimated at $420. • Ghana’s aspiration to accelerate its socio-economic development process and achieve a middle income status will require achieving a considerably high growth rate well above its current growth rate. And that Ghana growing at its current economic growth rate will for many years continue to register a gross national income per capita below the current Sub-Sahara Africa average. • Ghana will require a double figure growth rate of between 10% - 12% per annum sustainable over the next fifteen to twenty years to be able to attain a middle income per capita level of between $1000 and $2000 in the next 15 years and over • Historically, Ghana has never achieved a double figure growth rate. And that the highest GDP growth rate the nation has ever achieved was 8.8% in 1984. • A lot of efforts will be required to transform the economy from its current low single digit growth rate to a double digit growth rate. And that anything short of a growth rate between 10% and 12% sustained over a number of years will make it extremely difficult for Ghana to move into the middle income zone in the foreseeable future. Crystallizing the Developmental Challenges Facing the Country Further to taking into account the current status of key socio-economic indicators in guiding the development of the ICT4AD Policy, the Government also recognizes the need to target the Policy at addressing the key developmental challenges facing Ghana –and these include: • The social and economic pressures of a youthful population –-- Ghana’s relatively young population of close to 60% of the population under the age of 25 years do present the country with a number of development challenges. Some of the developmental challenges that Ghana is facing as a result of having a relatively young population include those relating to heavy social expenditure budget in areas like: education, training and provision of health and other social services. • The challenges of turning the youthful population into an asset for development –-- The lack of policies and initiatives targeted at turning the youthful population into a skilled human resource asset to aid the development of the country may translate into a high unemployable population in the years to come. Turning of the youthful population into an asset for development and the 17 taking of steps to improve the economy to provide opportunities to a growing population of young people presents Ghana with a key developmental challenge. • Rapid population growth and declining per capita income --- At the current growth rate of 2.5%, Ghana’s population will increase by 50% within the next 12 years; reach the 30 million mark by 2020 and will be double the 2000 figure by 2028. This rapid growth in the population could present Ghana with a number of developmental challenges especially if economic growth continues to lag behind population growth. • An under-performing agricultural sector --- Ghana’s agricultural sector despite experiencing some improvements in some areas, is seriously underperforming in a number of critical areas. Given that the agricultural sector currently employs 70% of the labour force, contributes close 35% to the GDP and accounts for 57% of foreign exchange earnings, the lack of development in the sector has a number of social and economic implications which could further compound Ghana’s socio-economic problems and retard its developmental efforts • An economy dominated by the agricultural sector with weak under-developed industrial and service sector --- The Ghanaian economy is still predominately agriculture-base without a substantial shift towards the services sector and industrial sector as should be expected if the economy were on a rapid growth path and modernizing. The structure of the Ghanaian economy measured in terms of sectorial contribution to GDP indicates that the structure of the economy changed very little over the last 20 years. Putting in place policies and strategies that modernize the agriculture sector while at the same time target the development of the industrial and services sectors to increase their contribution to the GDP constitute a major developmental challenge facing the country. • The heavy debt burden --- Ghana’s development is being handicapped by the nation’s heavy debt burden measured in terms of: the high national debt per capita, the high national debt as percentage of GDP, the debt service ratio and the debt service to export earnings ratio. The nation’s debt per capita in 2000 was $350 compared to its income per capita of $340; the national debt as percentage of GDP increased to about 129% by 2000. Ghana’s heavy debt burden is compounding its other economic development problems and this is constraining the nation’s developmental efforts in a number of areas. • The disproportionate informal private sector ---- Statistics shows that the private sector, is dominated by its informal sub-sector. In other words, the formal private sector forms a very small fraction of the private sector. The informal private sector is also by far the largest employment sector of the Ghanaian economy – accounting for close to 81% of the economically active population, while the formal private sector accounts for only about 8%. The development of the private sector in general and in particular the formal private sector is one of the major developmental challenges facing the nation. • The low professional, technical and managerial manpower base ---- The occupational profile of the economically active population reveals that: only 8.6% are professional and technical people with a lower percentage of 0.3% who are managers and administrators. It is estimated that Ghana has about 174 registered engineers, 53 legal practitioners, 60 certified accountants, 50 architects and surveyors and 145 medical and detail practitioners (including doctors) per million of persons. The low percentage of key technical and professional manpower highlights the relatively low professional and technically skilled human resource capacity of the economy. The development 18 of a skilled human resource capacity can be singled out as one of the key developmental challenges facing the country. • Relatively high proportion of population with no educational attainment --- Close to 40% of Ghanaians over 6 years of age have never been to school, in other words they have no educational attainment. This figure coupled with the fact that only about 3% of the population had tertiary level education also present Ghana with a major developmental challenge. • Low job creation capacity of the economy --- Close to 68% of employed population are self- employed with no employees. In other words, the majority of the working population work in their own small enterprises and has no other employees apart from themselves. With the economy dominated by the self-employed, who do not have the capacity to employ others, the prospects for generating additional jobs or employment opportunities for a growing young population are very low. The transformation of the economy to improve on its employment generation capacity is a key developmental challenge facing the country. • Narrow export base dominated by traditional exports ---- Ghana’s trade with the outside world has for many years registered huge balance of payment (BoP) deficits. The country’s small domestic market cannot support the development of the key sectors of the economy. A key developmental challenge facing Ghana therefore relates to the development of a diversified export-led economy targeting key sectors of the economy including the agriculture, services and industrial sectors • Under-developed physical infrastructure. --- Ghana currently suffers from a number of physical infrastructure deficits which is putting a strain on the nation’s developmental efforts. The developmental implications of the nation’s poor physical infrastructure in the area of: roads, power, water and sanitation is a major developmental challenge facing the country. • Poor and limited communications infrastructure --- The development, expansion and the modernization of the nation’s communications infrastructure is a key developmental challenge. A key developmental challenge facing the nation entails the development, expansion and the modernization of the nation’s communications infrastructure to achieve universal service and access to basic and value added telecommunications services, support the development of the local ICT industry and aid the country’s socio-economic development process. It is recognized that the socio-economic problems and challenges facing Ghana are likely to be compounded by the new challenges posed by globalization and the information age. And that for Ghana, to make progress in its developmental process, the nation in addition to taking steps to address these developmental challenges will also need to put in place efforts to address the additional challenges posed by globalization and the information revolution. The ICT4AD Policy Statement sets out Ghana’s vision in the information age. It defines the nation’s broad vision, and the corresponding missions and strategies to serve as a road map for guiding the country’s developmental efforts to aid the process of transforming it into an information and knowledge- based society and economy. The Policy Statement in a nutshell defines the vision and the agenda for developing Ghana’s information society and economy. 19 Summary of the Socio-Economic Development Objectives and Priorities of Ghana Ghana through the formulation of a number of socio-economic development policy frameworks over the years has identified a number of key developmental objectives to address the developmental problems facing the country. Of these policy frameworks, the key ones are Vision 2020 Socio-Economic Development Framework, the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy (2000-2004), the Ghana Science and Technology Policy and the Co-ordinated Programme for Economic and Social Development of Ghana (2003-2012).

As part of these efforts, the Government is committed to implementing within the provisions of the broad strategies identified for achieving this mission ---- to within the next two to three decades or less transform Ghana’s predominately agricultural economy and society into: A high income economy dominated by trading in ICT products and services An economy characterized by a large commercial services sector with a reasonably large and vibrant, ICT services sub- sector and industry An economy characterized by a technology-based knowledge-driven industrial sector An economy with a globally competitive industrial and services sector which are to a large extent driven by cutting-edge R&D encompassing basic and applied industrial and product development. An economy based on a rich pool of highly skilled human resources in critical skill areas relevant for developing and maintaining a competitive edge on the global market An economy in which the majority of the working population are either directly or indirectly involved in information and communications related activities An economy with a modern, efficient and competitive agricultural sector 26 An economy characterized by a wide-spread deployment and exploitation of ICTs within the society to support the delivery of health, education, government and social services An economy characterized by a modern educational system within which ICTs are widely deployed to facilitate the delivery of educational services at all levels of the educational system An economy in which a reasonable large proportion of the population have access to information and communications technology products and services An economy in which the provision and delivery of goods and services of the key sectors of the economy are to a large extent facilitated by information and communications technologies An economy in which the provision and delivery of services by government and its administrative machinery are to a large extent facilitated by information and communications technologies An economy based on an advanced and reliable national information and communications infrastructure An economy based on a literate society with a high proportion of computer literates. Achieving a Multi-Sectorial ICT-led Socio Economic Development Policy Goals In line with the goal to pursue a multi-sectorial development policy targeting key sectors of the economy as stated in a number of Ghana’s socio-economic development policy frameworks including the Vision 2020, the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and the Co-ordinated Programme for Economic and Social Development of Ghana (2003-2012) The Government is committed to, the establishment of a globally competitive, diversified and balanced economy that is driven by information, knowledge and skills --- an economy with an ICT-intensive modern industrial sector; a modern, efficient and competitive agricultural sector; and a vibrant ICT- driven, valued added services sector capable of serving as the engine for accelerated economic growth and development. As part of this commitment, the Government will be implementing a multi-sectorial socio-economic development policy with the following sectorial goals: • Agricultural Sector Development Goal To modernize the agricultural sector to improve its efficiency and productivity to ensure food security, generate rural employment; contribute to economic growth and to improve the foreign exchange generation capacity of the sector. To aggressively promote and facilitate the development of a globally competitive agro-business industry to support the development of a vibrant agricultural value-added industry capable of supporting the development and modernization of the agricultural sector and its allied sub-sectors and industries. To promote basic and cutting-edge agriculture-based research and related R&D work to improve agriculture yield of main crops and products, improve on agricultural processes and productivity and to 27 support the development of marketable value-added agricultural products capable of competing on the domestic, regional and the global market. • Service Sector Development Goal To develop a competitive high value-added services sector, to generate employment and serve as an engine for accelerated development and economic growth with the potential to develop into a regional business-services and ICT hub for the ECOWAS sub-region and beyond. The Government is fully aware that Ghana’s domestic market is far too small and that for Ghana to grow and accelerate its development process, it must export. The goal is to develop the services sector as a business hub to produce and export its services into the sub-region and beyond is a key priority area of the country’s socio-economic development programme • Industrial Sector Development Goal To develop a viable knowledge-based ICT production and development industry, a vibrant cottage industry and a mass-consumer products light industry, capable of generating economic growth and employment and producing goods for the domestic market and for export into the sub-regions and beyond. To increase the efficiency of the operations of the industrial sector to improve on the range of products produced to enable the sector make an increasing contribution to export earnings and supply the domestic market at competitive prices. To encourage the conversion of agricultural commodities (especially perishable food items) into easily storable products (existing and new products) as manufacturing sector’s contribution to stable food prices, enhanced farm prices and farm revenues, and to national food security The Goal to Develop Ghana’s ICT Sector and Use ICTs as a Broad-Based Enabler of Development Goals The Government as part of this Policy Statement is guided by the principle that if Ghana is to take full advantage of the opportunities of the information age and develop a vibrant multi-sectorial information and knowledge economy, it should not as a nation be just a consumer of ICT goods and services but also a producer and developer of the technology. The Government believes that development of a local ICT production industry and service sector is as equally important as the deployment, exploitation and utilization of the technology to support the activities of various sectors of the economy and society. Ghana, as part of its ICT4AD programmes shall be pursuing a policy that lays emphasis on both ICT Exploitation and Production involving: the utilization and exploitation of ICTs to support the delivery of government services and the activities of various sectors of the economy as well as the production, development and delivery of ICT products and services ---- i.e. towards the development and promotion of an ICT industry and services sector. These policy provisions will be implemented within five 4-year rolling plans over the next 20 years --- with the 1st, 2nd and 3rd plans laying emphasis on the exploitation and utilization of ICT products and 28 services to support the activities of various sectors of the economy and the 4th and the 5th plans laying emphasis on the production, development and delivery of ICT products and services. The Policy is also strategically focused on both the development of the local ICT industry targeted at the export market as well as on using ICTs as an enabler of Ghana’s broad developmental goals. The Government believes that: Ghana being an under-developed nation, will need to use ICTs as a broad enabler of its socio-economic development process as well as implementing polices and programmes targeted at the development of the ICT sector and industry. The policy recognizes that the spill-over or catalytic effect of developing the ICT sector on the economy as a whole will not be enough to accelerate Ghana’s socio-economic development process. The Policy goal is to simultaneously focus on developing the ICT industry while at the same time using ICTs to drive other sectors of the economy. This strategy it is hoped will accelerate Ghana’s development and spread the social and economic impact of the development, deployment and exploitation of ICTs much faster than a singular focus of the development of the ICT sector. 29 PART TWO The 14 Pillars of the ICT4AD Policy 30 Page Deliberately Left Blank 31 CHAPTER FOUR TTHHEE 1144 PPIILLLLAARRSS OOFF TTHHEE IICCTT44AADD PPOOLLIICCYY ---- DDEEFFIINNIINNGG TTHHEE PPOOLLIICCYY PPRRIIOORRIITTYY AARREEAASS AANNDD FFOOCCUUSS Policy Commitments and Measures to Facilitate the Process of Transforming Ghana into a Predominately Information-rich and Knowledge- based Society and Economy To facilitate the process of transforming Ghana into a predominantly information-rich and knowledge- based society and economy, the following priority areas constituting the 14 pillars of the ICT4AD Policy shall be targeted: • Accelerated Human Resource Development • Promoting ICTs in Education – The Deployment and Exploitation of ICTs in Education • Facilitating Government Administration and Service Delivery – Promoting Electronic Government and Governance • Facilitating the Development of the Private Sector • Developing an Export-Oriented ICT Products and Services Industry • Modernization of Agriculture and the Development of an Agro-Business Industry • Developing a Globally Competitive Value-Added Services Sector --- A Regional Business Service and ICT Hub • Deployment and Spread of ICTs in the Community • Promotion of National Health • Rapid ICT and Enabling Physical Infrastructure Development • Legal, Regulatory, and Institutional Framework Provisions • R&D, Scientific and Industrial Research Capacity Development • Promoting Foreign and Local Direct Investment Drive in ICTs • Facilitating National Security and Law and Order 32 ACCELERATED HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT Policy Context It is recognized that human resource is the key to developing and transforming Ghana from a predominately subsistence agriculture base economy into a predominantly information and knowledge based economy and society. Ghana is however currently facing a human resource problem in technical and managerial skill areas and more so in ICT skills. With only 8.6% of the economically active population which are professional and technical people, with a lower percentage of 0.3% working as managers and administrators it is apparent that, considerable resources and efforts will need to be invested into accelerating the country’s human resource capacity if Ghana is to make any appreciable progress towards the realization of the aspiration of the ICT4AD Vision. Also given that the vast majority of qualified applicants do not have access to higher education, the country is also facing an acute shortage of university and college places --- with less than 30% of qualified applicants gaining admission to the nation’s universities and that this is having an adverse impact on the development of the required critical human resources for facilitating the development of the economy. It is acknowledged that the extent to which Ghana will benefit from the advances and the opportunities of the emerging information age will depend on how the country is capable of developing and harnessing its human resources to initiate, support and maintain its socio-economic development towards an information and knowledge economy. The availability of a diverse pool of technical and managerial skills and professionals in critical skills to design, implement, manage, and use ICT applications and services is most crucial for supporting the development, deployment, exploitation and the application of ICTs for economic and social development. Specifically on ICT related skills, Ghana like most developing countries suffers from a huge shortfall in critical ICT skills and expertise required for the development and support of ICT applications and systems within the public and private sector. The ICT skill shortage has in fact been identified in a recent survey as one of the factors inhibiting the growth of the ICT sector. Furthermore it is acknowledged that without a sustained effort to train workers in key ICT skills, the limited availability of skilled ICT personnel may place an upper limit on development and deployment of ICT within the economy and society. For example, many user-organizations in Ghana have not been able to keep up with the rapid technological developments. In some, there is a lack of expertise to digest new information about these technologies and to integrate them into the existing operations of the organization with minimal disruption. Most organizations in the public and private sector face problems in relation to providing continuous training to the user-staff in the rapidly changing aspects of these technologies. This no doubt makes it difficult for them to take full advantage of these technological advances. Most ICT managers in both public and private sector organizations and establishments cannot keep up with the rapid technological advances. Particular areas include integration of diverse technologies, use of system-development tools, networking, telecommunications and standards. The economy therefore requires a pool of this expertise to support the deployment and exploitation of the technologies and systems within organizational set-ups and as well as support the development of the nation’s information and communications economy and society. 33 On the whole, Ghana’s human resource base in key skill areas required for developing the nation’s information economy and society need to be improved if the country is to achieve its goal of transforming its agricultural based economy into an information-rich and knowledge-based economy. Policy Statement The Government acknowledges that the young population of Ghana of close to 60% under the age of 25 years can be transformed into an asset by adding value to human resources and providing the environment for utilizing these resources for socio-economic development process ---- and that ICTs could play a major role in this area. The development of people to support the process of moving Ghana into an information society and economy is therefore top priority of the Government and the crucial role that ICTs can play in this area is fully recognized and shall be promoted by the Government. As part of the mission aimed at producing the right types of skills and human resources required for developing and driving Ghana’s information and knowledge-based economy and society, the Government is fully committed to putting in place and facilitating the implementation of a comprehensive human resource development programme targeting critical skill areas across key sectors of the economy for supporting the development of the Ghana information society and economy. This policy commitment will in addition contribute to addressing some of the other identified developmental challenges facing Ghana, including: the challenges of the low professional, technical and managerial manpower base of the country; the challenges of the social and economic pressures of a youthful population; the challenges of turning the youthful population into an asset for development, as well as the challenges of the relatively high proportion of population with no educational attainment. Policy Objectives and Strategies The Objectives The broad objectives are: • To improve the human resource development capacity and the research and development (R&D) capacity of Ghana to meet the demands and requirements for developing Ghana’s information and knowledge-based economy and society • To develop the nation’s human resource needs in critical skill areas in all key sectors of the economy • To promote and facilitate skill improvement and update within the public and private sector • To harness and fully utilize the nation’s human resources • To target the development of technical and managerial skills development as a priority area • To develop a pool of knowledgeable ICT workforce in critical skill areas and professions that will be able to contribute to the process of the development of Ghana’s information and knowledge economy • To improve the human resource development capacity of the nation’s universities and colleges 34 The Strategies • Transform Ghana into an information and knowledge-driven ICT literate nation • Modernize Ghana’s educational system using ICTs to: improve and expand access to educational, training and research resources and facilities; improve the quality of education and training and make the educational system responsive to the needs and requirements of the economy and society with specific reference to the development of the information and knowledge-based economy and society. • Create the conditions for Government Ministries, Public Sector Organizations (PSO) and private sector establishments to train and up-date the skills of their personnel through in-house training, provision of regular refreshal courses, study and training leaves • Promote basic training in ICTs skills in all schools and tertiary institutions • Ensure the development of a large pool of ICT professionals with wide range of state of-the-art ICT skills to meet the manpower needs of the country. • Encourage the private sector, particularly key industries, to establish comprehensive training programmes for their own workforces, especially in new technologies • Support and facilitate the training of women in key skills required by the information and knowledge economy • Encourage life-long learning within the working population to promote on the job training, skills update, further and continuing education and learning within the public and private sector • Ensure that all citizens who qualify to enter tertiary education in Ghana will benefit from such education, irrespective of their socio-economic background • Ensure the provision of support to increase access to technical, vocational education and training to all categories of persons with disabilities and other vulnerable groups • Encourage links between the education and training systems and the industry • Ensure that traditional apprenticeship system is reformed and strengthened to improve productivity in the informal sector • Encourage internships, co-opts and work-study programmes in all levels within various institutions. • Enact laws that provide equal access to physically challenged and vulnerable groups to ICT training and education. 35 • Ensure that training systems and mechanisms are developed to facilitate coordination and linkage between different sectors of the economy including research institutions and industries • Promote and enforce high standards in education, vocational training and life-long learning to facilitate the development of a globally competitive quality and professional manpower to support the development of Ghana’s information and knowledge-based economy and economy • Promote world-class standards, to support nation-wide professional ICT skills accreditation • Promote initiatives targeted at re-training and re-skilling of workers within the civil and public services as well as workers in the private sector to provide them with requisite professional skills and expertise to enable them fully and effectively participate in the development of the information and knowledge economy. Policy Measures, Instruments and Initiatives Policy initiatives and measures shall be targeted at: • developing the critical skill human resource base of key sectors of the economy • building, upgrading and improving the capacity and facilities and of the nation’s universities polytechnics and research institutions to increase their annual intake of students and the output of graduates in key professional skill areas such as engineering, computer science, physical and social science, business, finance and accountancy • facilitating and supporting the development of the requisite pool of highly skilled human resources; knowledge workers and expertise capable of facilitating the process of developing and supporting a technology-based knowledge-driven industrial sector • the development of comprehensive human resource base in critical skill areas required for facilitating the development of a vibrant value-added services sector and ICT services industry • facilitating an investment climate for the mobilization of financial and technological resources; as well as promoting FDI specifically targeting attracting investments that have knowledge and expertise transfer components • facilitating and promoting the implementation of community-based ICT initiatives as well as national ICT applications with human resource development components; including multipurpose community telecenter projects; teleducation and SchoolNet projects; electronic government and governance initiatives, telemedicine projects; and e-commerce projects among others; • initiatives to improve and upgrade computer skills and of civil and public servants through in- service training and skill update programmes; • programmes and initiatives aimed at professional skill development in work places in public and private sector institutions, through, in-service training, distance education and training and life- long learning. 36 The Key Implementation Agencies, Players and Stakeholders • The Universities, Polytechnics, Colleges and Research Institutions • The Secondary, Vocational, Technical and Training Schools and Institutions • All Government Ministries and Public Sector Organizations • Private Sector Businesses and Establishments • Local and Foreign Educational and Training Provision Organizations • The Civil Society and the Labour Union • Professional Bodies 37 PROMOTING ICTs IN EDUCATION ---The Deployment and Exploitation of ICTs in Education Policy Context Ghana has a high illiteracy rate of close to 40% of the population above the age of 6 years who have never been to school with only about 3% of the population with tertiary level education. Based on the current population growth rate of 2.5%, Ghana’s population will be about 38 million --- double the 2000 figure by 2028. The projected rate of growth of Ghana’s population is likely to give rise to a number of socio-economic development challenges including those relating to: pressure on social expenditure in areas like education. In fact, Ghana’s, relatively young population of close to 60% of the population under the age of 25 years, do have the potential to further increase demand for educational places, which is currently limited at all levels of the educational system. Currently the country is experiencing a high primary school drop-out rate and very low secondary school enrolment rate. --- With close to 50% of junior secondary school leavers failing to progress to senior secondary school; and a high proportion of senior secondary school leavers failing to continue their education. A recent survey also shows that the level of computer literacy and awareness in the country is very low and this has been identified as one of the key factors limiting the development of the ICT industry and sector. It is acknowledged that for Ghana to make any appreciable progress in its socio-economic development efforts, substantial resources will need to be directed at reducing the percentage of the population without any educational attainment, widening access to education to the vast majority of the population and increasing the percentage of the population with tertiary level education. The key role that ICTs can play in widening access to education to a wider section of the population; and in literacy education and for facilitating educational delivery and training at all levels has been recognized. The Government has acknowledged the need for ICT training and education in the schools, colleges and universities, and to improve the educational system as a whole. The Policy Statement As part of the mission to: transform the educational system to provide the requisite educational, and training services and environment capable of producing the right types of skills and human resources required for developing and driving Ghana’s information and knowledge-based economy and society, the Government is committed to a comprehensive programme of rapid deployment, utilization and exploitation of ICTs within the educational system from primary school upwards. Policy efforts shall be directed at using ICTs to facilitate education and learning within the educational system and to promote e-learning and education as well as life-long learning within the population at large. As part of this policy commitment the Government shall put in place policy measures to strengthen science education at all levels of the educational system and as well as promote technical and vocational training with emphasis on the use of ICTs to facilitate the training and learning process. 38 This policy commitment shall in addition contribute to addressing some of the other identified developmental challenges facing Ghana, including: the challenges of the social and economic pressures of a youthful population; the challenges of turning the youthful population into an asset for development as well as the challenges limited human resource capacity characterized by low professional, technical and managerial manpower base of the country Policy Objectives and Strategies The

Research Institutions • Local and Foreign Educational and Training Provision Organizations 41 FACILITATING GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICE DELIVERY --- Promoting Electronic Government and Governance Policy Context The civil and public services play a key role in the socio-economic development process of Ghana. And the crucial role that ICTs can play in improving the efficiency of delivery of government services; in reducing (in the long run) the operational cost of these institutions and in bringing government closer to the people has been acknowledged. The deployment, exploitation of ICTs to support the operations and activities of the civil and public services has been recognized as key to the institutional renewal, re-engineering and the modernization of the civil and public service. It is however acknowledged that: the mere deployment of ICTs within public and private sector organizations and institutions does not necessary translates into improvements in productivity, efficiency and service delivery which collectively could impact on the overall developmental process of the country. In other words, the deployment of ICTs within public institutions and business organizations and entities will have little or no impact on the nation’s development process if not accompanied by a number of organizational and procedural changes as well as changes in attitude to work and work ethics. It is acknowledged that for ICTs to have a real appreciable impact on Ghana’s development there is a need to address a number of critical success factors and conditions at the institutional and organizational levels. ---Some of these include making changes in unproductive organizational systems, structures, procedures and processes, as well as addressing poor attitudes to work and unproductive and inefficient work ethics which could hinder the effective exploitation of these technologies to improve organizational efficiency service/produce delivery, productivity and reduction in operational cost. The Policy Statement Acknowledging the crucial role that ICTs can play in the delivery of Government services; bringing government closer to the people; and in facilitating the implementing of the Government’s decentralization policy to support the activities regional and district administrative units, the Government is committed to the deployment, exploitation of ICTs to support the operations and activities of the Civil and Public Services as part its commitment to the modernization of the civil and public service to facilitate administrative cost reduction and the promotion of effectiveness and efficiency in the delivery of government services to the people of Ghana. The Government also recognizing that electronic government and governance initiatives have been demonstrated in a number of countries as crucial for improving government service delivery to the public and bringing government closer to the people is committed to putting in place and implementing a comprehensive e-government and governance strategy for Ghana. In this connection the Government shall be putting in place the necessary mechanisms to facilitate the development of this strategy soon after the release of the Policy Document. This policy commitment shall in addition contribute to addressing some of the other identified developmental challenges facing Ghana, including: the challenges limited human resource capacity 42 characterized by low professional, technical and managerial manpower base of the country as well as the challenges of the poor performance of the economy and those related to the low job creation capacity of the economy.

The Key Implementation Agencies, Players and Stakeholders • All Government Ministries and Public Sector Organizations (PSOs) • The Public Enterprise Commission • The Labour Union 44 FACILITATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR Policy Context Ghana’s private sector is under-developed and dominated by the informal sector which is by far the largest employment sector of the Ghanaian economy. – accounting for about 80% of the employed work force, with the formal private sector accounting for only 7.8% of the employment of the economically active population. Given that close to 68% of employed population are self-employed with no employees and only 5.2% of the employed population are self-employed with one or more employees, the job creating potential and capacity of the Ghanaian economy is extremely low. Also given that new vacancies in the Government sector are declining on a yearly basis, and the fact that, the majority of the self-employed, do not have the capacity to employ others --- prospects for job opportunities for what is a relatively young population are very low. The need to develop the private sector as a whole and the formal sector in particular to serve as an engine for growth is imperative if Ghana is to make headway in addressing a number of its key developmental challenges. The development of the private sector as one of the strategies to improve the economy’s job creation capability is therefore a priority area of Government’s overall socio-economic development programme The Policy Statement The Government recognizing the critical role that the private sector can play as a key partner in the process of moving Ghana into an information and knowledge economy is committed to promoting and facilitating the role of the private sector in the development and participation in the Ghana information society and economy. As part of this commitment, the Government will create the necessary enabling environment and put in place the necessary policy programmes, and incentive packages to facilitate the role of the private sector in the nation’s development. The Government is further committed to the creation of a stable economic and investment climate that will assist both domestic and foreign private sector organizations in the development of: the physical telecommunication and communications infrastructure and other ICT infrastructure; the provision of information resources and systems to support the activities of various sectors of the economy; the development of human resources in ICT and other skill areas required by the information economy; as well as in the mobilization of financial resources and other technological resources to aid the process of developing and exploiting the opportunities of the information economy. These policy commitments shall in addition contribute to addressing some of the other identified developmental challenges facing Ghana, including: the challenges of the disproportionate informal private sector; the challenges of the low job creation capacity of the economy as well as the challenges of the narrow export base dominated by traditional exports, the under-developed physical infrastructure and the poor and limited communications and telecommunications infrastructure 45 Policy Objectives and Strategies The Objectives • To facilitate the development of the private sector by promoting an enabling environment, including a conducive legal and social framework, for private sector investments in industry • To transform Ghana’s economy from being dominated by the public sector to one that benefits the enterprise and dynamic of the private sector, supported by a efficient system of system administration • To promote and encourage the expansion and the contribution of the formal private sector to the economy • To maintain a fair and competitive private enterprise system which prevents the exercise of monopoly power • To strengthen the private sector in an active way to ensure that it is capable of acting effectively as the engine of growth and poverty reduction • To encourage productivity growth in all key sub-sectors of the private sector • To support the development of a capital and knowledge-intensive industries • To develop fiscal mechanisms that can quickly respond to the fast changing needs of an ICT based economy. • To implement reforms to position the economy to secure capital inflow, retain capital and encourage local and foreign direct investment in the area of ICT services and related products. • To encourage the development of favourable fiscal policies to ensure that Ghanaian ICT products and services are globally competitive. • To fuel the development of economic sub-sectors, asset accumulation, and fiscal activities that arise from ICT use • To promote investment, innovation, R&D and diffusion of ICTs within the economy The Strategies • Promote policy initiatives aimed at facilitating the active participation of small and medium enterprise (SMEs) in the local ICT industry and services sector • Promote and facilitate the development of the private sector to serve as a key driver for the development of the economy • Promote the development of a globally competitive local ICT industry for the development, production and the sale of information, knowledge, and technology products and services 46 • Stimulate investment and growth in the ICT sector through the creation of a favourable fiscal and investment climate for the development of a globally competitive ICT-enabled economy. • Create an enabling environment that empowers stakeholders in trade and commerce with the underlying infrastructure to improve productivity and positively position the nation for global competition and business. • Promote public private partnership (PPP) to accelerate the development and implementation of policies as well as the necessary legal and technical standards to support widespread implementation of electronic commerce. • Facilitate the establishment of Free-Zone ICT Parks and incubator facilities that will be equipped with the necessary infrastructure to promote and support ICT-related business. • Establish a National ICT Development Fund, which amongst its other activities, will provide venture capital finance to start -up ICT-related small and medium enterprises (SMEs) • Work with both the domestic and foreign private sector as an effective development partner • Equip technology development institutions and private sector establishments with modern technology tools to enable them produce useful capital equipment and machinery • Create a diversified, innovative and fully integrated industrial sector with active participation of the private sector • Reduce the economic and non-economic cost of doing business to enable the private sector to flourish The Key Implementation Agencies, Players and Stakeholders • Ministry of Private Sector Development • Ministry of Trade and Industry • Ministry of Economic Planning and Finance • The Private Enterprise Foundation • Private Sector Businesses and Establishments 47 DEVELOPING A GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE VALUE-ADDED SERVICES SECTOR – A Regional Business Service and ICT Hub Policy Context The need for Ghana to develop a regional competitive advantage in the area of ICT exploitation and production through the development of a competitive ICT industry and services sector has been recognized. The development of the services sector into a highly competitive value-added sector has been identified as key to transforming Ghana’s economy into a high income economy with the potential to create wealth and quality jobs. It has been established that the inability of the local ICT sector to attract adequate capital through domestic and foreign direct investment has been one of the main obstacles to the development of a globally competitive local ICT industry and a valued-added services sector. The Policy Statement The Government acknowledges that ICTs can serve as the engine for developing the services sector of the economy into a competitive regional business services and ICT hub to provide a world class ICT services targeted ranges of off-shore, banking and financial services to business communities in the region and beyond. The Government is committed to putting in place the necessary policy measures and provides to facilitate this process. This policy commitment shall in addition contribute to addressing some of the other identified developmental challenges facing Ghana, including: the challenges of the disproportionate informal private sector; the challenges of the low job creation capacity of the economy as well as the challenges of the narrow export base dominated by traditional exports Policy Objectives and Strategies The Objectives • To transform Ghana into an attractive destination for ICT-related FDI with the potential to become a competitive regional ICT and business hub. • To develop a highly competitive ICT-led value-added and export-orientated services sector driven by a dynamic ICT services sub-sector and industry • To aggressively promote Ghana as an ideal destination for ICT related FDI within the sub-region. • To promote international competitiveness and a secure a place for Ghana in the international economic system • To harness and fully utilize Ghana’s human, cultural and natural resources and effectively exploit her favourable geographical position for the sustainable development of the economy 48 The Strategies • Promote and facilitate the development of the private sector to serve as a key driver for the development of the economy • Take steps to address the constraints that inhibit productivity and growth in the services sector and to ensure favourable conditions for innovation and ICT diffusion in this sector removing obstacles to productivity and employment growth, including barriers to entry particularly for SMEs • Promote improvements in the quality of services and products within the services and industrial sector • Encourage technological innovations to support product development and service provision and delivery • Modernize the banking system and promote the use of financial market instruments in business transactions and de-emphasize cash transactions. • Promote and support electronic banking and financial services provision • Promote the development of a globally competitive local ICT industry for the development, production and the sale of information, knowledge, and technology products and services • Encourage and facilitate the use of, open electronic marketplaces, secure e-business solutions, electronic signatures, electronic public procurement and electronic payment systems to support the development of electronic commerce in the country Policy Measures, Instruments and Initiatives To achieve the policy objective of developing a globally competitive value-added services sector, specific policy initiatives and measures shall be targeted at: • promoting the development of the services sector targeting in particular the development of the ICT services sub-sector and industry; • promoting the development of and the use of international standards, and best practices to guide the production and the provisions of services within the economy; • promoting and encouraging both domestic and foreign direct investment targeting the services sector including the ICT service sub-sector; The Key Implementation Agencies, Players and Stakeholders • Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning • Ministry of Private Sector Development • Ministry of Trade and Industry • Small and Medium Scale Development Agencies • Chamber of Commerce and Industry • Private Sector Businesses and Establishments 49 DEVELOPING AN EXPORT-ORIENTED ICT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INDUSTRY Policy Context The Ghana ICT sector is under-developed, a recent study shows that the majority of the companies in this sector are small-to-medium scale ICT companies and most of these are mainly involved in distributive activities like retailing and the distribution of computer products and services, mainly computers and their peripherals and standard application software and packages. On the whole there is very little activity in the area of the production and development of ICT products for example assembly of computer hardware systems like personal computers. Apart from a handful of companies, most of which are small-scale set-ups involve in local assembly on a limited scale, the majority of companies retailing computer hardware import them as complete systems which they retail to the public. The majority of the applications software (mostly standard of-the-shelf products) on the Ghanaian market are not developed locally. The Ghanaian software development industry is still under-developed with only a couple of establishments involved in limited software development work; the majority of these are into customizing applications for clients with very little done in the area of developing systems from the scratch. In exception of a number of accounting, banking and database applications where there is some local software development efforts, the vast majority of Ghanaian companies involved in implementing ICT systems used imported software as turnkey ‘off-the-shelf’ software or slightly customized systems. On the whole, the majority of the ICT-related companies and service providers, trade in products and services with very little local context. In otherwise the vast majority of the companies locally trade in ICT products and services that have far less than 100% local context. A number of factors have been identified as inhibiting the growth of the local ICT industry. For example, given that the majority of ICT products on the Ghanaian market are imported, with very little local component; import duties and taxes on computer products and services are seen as having negative impact on the expansion of the ICT sector, a major part of which is involve in retailing of ICTs products and services. In fact, de-incentives like taxation and in particular import duties on computer products and services have been identified as a major factor inhibiting the growth of the Ghana ICT sector. The growth of the ICT sector is also being inhibited by lack of infrastructure development in areas like transport, telecommunications, and electricity. For example the lack of the electricity infrastructure in some sections of the country has been identified as a bottleneck to the expansion of ICT-related services. Also it is acknowledged that the development of Ghana’s information and knowledge economy will require a vibrant ICT industry that focuses on export oriented ICT products development and the provision of world-class services 50 The Policy Statement As part of the mission aimed at: developing a highly competitive ICT-led value-added and export- orientated services sector driven by a dynamic ICT services sub-sector and industry and to develop a knowledge-based, technology-driven light modern industrial sector with a dynamic export-led and globally competitive ICT sub-industry, the Government shall be promoting a number of ICT production initiatives targeted at developing the local ICT industry in areas like assembling of computers for the local market and export; the development of a local industry for the repair and maintenance of ICT equipment; the development of software for the domestic and export market; the provision of ICT services to support other sectors of the economy This policy commitment shall in addition contribute to addressing some of the other identified developmental challenges facing Ghana, including: the challenges of the disproportionate informal private sector; the challenges of the low job creation capacity of the economy, the challenges of the weak scientific research base and under-developed research and development (R&D) capacity, as well as the challenges of the narrow export base dominated by traditional exports Policy Objectives and Strategies The Objectives • To promote and support the development of a local industry for the manufacture, assembly repair and maintenance of computer and communication equipments and products • To promote and facilitate the development of a world-class software development industry targeting both the domestic and the export market • To stimulate, promote and encourage innovation within the ICT industry and sector as a basis for promoting growth within the industry, provision of quality of services and the development of advance and reliable communications infrastructure • To transform the economy through rapid industrialization • To maintain a favourable investment climate for investment in manufacturing and provide the necessary economic infrastructure for industry • To restructure the production base with a view to changing the sectoral composition of the economy • To increase the efficiency of production and productivity in all sectors of the economy The Strategies • Promote and facilitate the development of the private sector to serve as a key driver for the development of the economy • Promote the development of a globally competitive local ICT industry for the development, production and the sale of information, knowledge, and technology products and services 51 • Encourage the development of a secure broadband information and communications infrastructure to support the development and provision of world-class off-shore ICT services in the areas like software development, financial services and other ICT services targeted at the export market • Promote, stimulate and support the development of innovative local content and applications in the area of information and communications technologies to meet the needs and requirements of the nation • Stimulate growth of the local ICT industry through Government patronage of local ICT industry products and services. • Improve the environment in which enterprises, especially SMEs develop and grow, in particular by increasing their access to information, support services and investment capital and resources, in particular those targeted at the ICT industry and services sector • Promote the development of a broad engineering base, especially in the maintenance, repair and fabrication of machinery and equipment • Promote the development, adoption and enforcement of international standards within the ICT industry to facilitate the development of a world-class and globally competitive local ICT industry and services sector. • Aggressively develop, promote and enhance Ghana’s image as a competitive regional destination for ICT foreign direct investment (FDI) Policy Measures, Instruments and Initiatives Specific policy initiatives and measures shall be targeted at: • putting in place and implementing special tax packages, instruments, and incentive programmes and mechanisms to promote the development of the local ICT production industry • promoting the development of a globally competitive local ICT industry • creating the necessary enabling regulatory framework for facilitating the deployment, exploitation and the development of ICT products, services and systems within the economy and society • promoting the development of a globally competitive local ICT industry for the development, production and the sale of information, knowledge, and technology products and services • enacting the various legislations and laws that could promote the development of a vibrant and modern industrial sector The Key Implementation Agencies, Players and Stakeholders • Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning 52 • Ministry of Private Sector Development • Ministry of Trade and Industry • Small and Medium Scale Development Agencies • The Ghana Investment Promotion Center • The Ghana Free Zones Board • The Private Sector Foundation • Chamber of Commerce and Industry • Private Sector Businesses and Establishments 53 MODERNIZATION OF AGRICULTURE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN AGRO-BUSINESS INDUSTRY Policy Context Ghana’s agricultural sector the bedrock of the economy has been under-performing for a number of years. The sector is predominantly subsistence agricultural based with very little mechanization or the application of modern agricultural production methods or practices. Ghana which currently depend on cocoa for most of its export earnings lost its position as the World leading producer of cocoa to Cote d’Ivoire and now competes with Indonesia for the second position, producing on average 390 metric tons per year compared to Cote d’Ivoire annual average output of 1200 metric tons. The country’s annual agricultural yield in cocoa --- its major agricultural output is low in comparison with its neighbours. --- Ghana annual average agricultural yield in cocoa based on Year 2000 figures is only 2.5 (‘000 of hectogram per hectare) compared that of Cote d’Ivoire estimated at 5.6 and that of Nigeria at 4.2; Cameroon at 3.1 and Sierra Leone at 3.5. Also a recent study shows that the Ghanaian economy has not experience a major structural transformation since independence. ---The majority of the working population (60%) are still actively involve in agriculture with only 13% working in the industrial sector and 28% in the service sector of the economy The Policy Statement As part of the mission to: modernize the agricultural sector to substantially improve agricultural value- added and yield and develop a dynamic and vibrant export-oriented agro-business industry, the Government is committed to putting in place the necessary policy measures and mechanism to facilitate this process. This policy commitment shall in addition contribute to addressing some of the other identified developmental challenges facing Ghana, including: the challenges of the poor performance of the economy and the disproportionate informal private sector; the challenges of the low job creation capacity of the economy as well as the challenges of the narrow export base dominated by traditional exports.

It is acknowledged that the development of Ghana’s information society will depend on the level and the spread of access to these technologies, and their resources, services and applications. Also it is recognized that although ICTs could advance Ghana’s socio-economic development, the benefits of that development may not necessarily spread to all sections of the society. -- There is therefore a need for specific efforts to be made in terms of policies and special initiatives aimed at ensuring and enhancing the possible distributive effects of the developmental impacts of these technologies to the community at large. Steps will need to be taken to put in place special ICT initiatives to directly address poverty reduction within targeted communities and sections within the society and taking corrective measures to mitigate and address specific income distributive issues arising from the developmental impacts of the deployment and exploitation of ICTs within the economy and society. It is further acknowledged that although rural ICT deployment and exploitation initiatives can be successful and can have impact of the social and economic outcomes of rural people, most of these initiatives cannot have an appreciable impact on accelerating the socio-economic development process of rural communities and beyond if their success are not replicable and/or scalable. The Policy Statement The Government acknowledging that Ghana’s entry into the information age will require rapid extension of access to ICTs to all sections of the community. --- To reach out to, and benefit, the majority of the population in for instance health, education and e-commerce, and as such is committed to taking special policy measures to extend ICT applications, services and access to the wider community including those in the rural areas where many of the most disadvantaged and remote communities are. As part of this commitment the Government will: • Implement a number of community-based initiatives within the rolling (NICI) plans that will be developed to implement the provisions of the ICT4AD Policy. • Put in place measures to develop and implement village information and communications infrastructure (VICI) initiatives targeting the implementing of NICI programmes at the local government and district administration levels. • Commit to putting in place specific ICT policy measures and initiatives targeted at the disadvantaged sections of the Ghanaian population including the visually, mentally and physically impaired and disadvantaged. • Put in place a mechanism to ensure the participation of women in developing the information society and to ensure that information and communication policies at all levels are engendered, and geared toward meeting specific developmental needs of women. 58 • Commit to building the capacity of the national machinery responsible for women and children, to encourage more participation of women and children in ICT initiatives and industry by addressing gender based inequalities and instituting gender-sensitive policies. This policy commitment shall in addition contribute to addressing some of the other identified developmental challenges facing Ghana, including: the challenges of the social and economic pressures of a youthful population; the challenges of turning the youthful population into an asset for development, the challenges of the poor performance of the economy as well as the challenges of the relatively high proportion of the population with no educational attainment, the high school drop-out rate and limited access to higher education by the vast majority of the population especially girls and women. Policy Objectives and Strategies The Objectives • To speed-up the process of the deployment and exploitation of ICTs within all communities • To promote equal and universal access to information and communications technologies services and resources to all communities, and within this context, policy directives shall be put in place to ensure and facilitate equal access for women, the disadvantaged, the disabled, and rural and under-served communities • To improve public access to information and services to facilitate business and administrative processes to increase productivity and facilitate economic growth. • To encourage and speed up the process of the diffusion of information and communication technologies within the society and economy • To diversify and improve the quality of information; increasing accessibility to ranges of information resources within and outside the country and creating a supportive environment for the development of the mass media and the private press through the deployment and exploitation of ICTs. • To assist in achieving the targets of the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy The Strategies • Encourage and promote the widespread access to information and communications technologies services and applications within the economy and society • Speed up the process of the provision of e-government, e-health, e-learning, e-commerce services within the country • Promote initiatives targeted at facilitating the process diffusion of ICTs within the communities in the rural and under-served and under-resourced areas • Ensure and enhance the possible distributive effects of the developmental impacts of the deployment and exploitation of ICTs within the society. 59 • Encourage public and private partnerships (PPPs) to facilitate the roll-out of community-based ICT initiatives • Support the strategic use of ICTs to strengthen women’s networking initiatives and community – based activities that defend and protect the rights of women to participate equally in civil and public life • Include ICTs in the drive to reduce illiteracy both as a tool and a part of the curriculum for functional literacy programmes • Deploy ICTs to support activities and programmes aimed at improving the quality of health of the citizenry Policy Measures, Instruments and Initiatives To achieve the policy objective to promote the deployment and exploitation of ICTs within the community, special policy initiatives and measures shall be targeted at: • implementing community-based national ICT programmes and initiatives including telemedicine, multi-purpose community telecenters, teleducation and schoolnets initiatives • promoting the implementation of e-government initiatives including: government to government (G2G), government to business (G2B) and government to citizens (G2C) types of e-government initiatives • promoting initiatives aimed at the strengthening of Ghana’s democratic institutions and good governance through ICTs • community-based village information and communications infrastructure (VICI) initiatives reflecting NICI programmes and initiatives at the local community-level. • special ICT initiatives targeted at the disadvantaged communities and sections of the Ghanaian society, including the underserved communities and the physically and mentally challenged The Key Implementation Agencies, Players and Stakeholders • All Government Ministries and Public Sector Organizations • Private Sector Businesses and Establishments • International and Donor Agencies • Local and International NGOs • The Civil Society and the Labour Union 60 PROMOTION OF NATIONAL HEALTH Policy Context Information and communications technologies are increasingly been deployed to facilitate the delivery of health services in a number of countries. These technologies are providing a number of opportunities to facilitate the modernization of the operations of the health delivery system in Ghana to improve access to the nation’s limited health facilities and resources and to provide access to health information and other services to a wider section of the community. Key areas of possible applications include: the implementation of telemedicine systems; the development of health information and management systems; the deployment of ICTs to facilitate the spread of health and medical services to rural and under-served areas; the use of ICTs to support medical education and training among others. Specifically in the area of public health information, it is acknowledged that ICTs can be used to facilitate the collection, analysis and the dissemination of information to support health education and awareness creation as well as for supporting decision making related to health and population-wide issues. Policy Statement The Government is committed to implementing a number of initiatives aimed at facilitating the widespread deployment and utilization of ICTs to support the activities and the operations of the health delivery system throughout the country. Specific initiatives will include implementing a national telemedicine programme to support nation-wide health service delivery including rural and community- based health services as well as to support community-based continuing medical education of health professionals. The Government as part of this commitment shall invest in ICT based healthcare systems to ensure that Ghanaians have access to appropriate healthcare delivery. This will include networking healthcare institutions to collate information, share data and communicate online, establishing internet connectivity and access to healthcare professionals, and making ICT skills acquisition mandatory for all healthcare professional.

In fact evidence points to the fact that telecommunications and communications infrastructure deployment and usage is a necessary precondition for sustained economic growth in Ghana. There is no doubt that development of a nation’s communication infrastructure will be essential for speeding up the process of the deployment and exploitation of ICTs within the society and economy. On the whole, Ghana’s physical, telecommunications and communications infrastructure is currently under-underdeveloped and limited in coverage. It is acknowledged that special policy measures and initiatives will need to be aimed at developing the communications infrastructure to improve universal access and service ---- And that this policy measures will need to be directed at creating the necessary legal, regulatory and institutional enabling environment to facilitate the development of the telecommunications and communications infrastructure to improve the coverage of the network and its services.

And as part of this policy commitment, specific policy measures shall be put in place to facilitate the creation of the necessary legal, regulatory and institutional enabling environment to support the development of the nation’s physical and communications infrastructure. The Government is also committed to improving communication facilities and to diversifying the means of access through the utilization of appropriate telecommunications systems. And as part of this strategy shall be facilitating increasing access to telecommunication facilities; and the rehabilitation and strengthening of telecommunication and communication facilities as well as the necessary physical infrastructure This policy commitment shall in addition contribute to addressing some of the other identified developmental challenges facing Ghana, including: the challenges of the under-developed and under- performing private sector; the challenges of the limited human resource capacity characterized by low professional, technical and managerial manpower base; as well as the challenges of the weak scientific research base and under-developed R&D capacity of the country. 63 Policy Objectives and Strategies The Objectives • To promote and facilitate initiatives targeted at the development of a reliable, fast adaptive and robust national ICT backbone and infrastructure • To facilitate and encourage the development of the nation’s physical infrastructure • To promote competition in the communications industry to increase customer choice and promote the provision of affordable services within the communications industry • To promote the development and the use of a world-class information and communications infrastructure for the country • To ensure that as far as possible development is not constrained by inadequate transport, communications and energy The Strategies • Modernize and expand Ghana’s information and communications infrastructure and services to improve universal access and quality of service (QoS) • Expand the physical infrastructure of Ghana, including those of power and transport. • Promote the development, and deployment of basic and broadband and multi-platform communications infrastructure to facilitate public access to information and services • Put in place special ICT promotion packages, policy instruments and incentives to facilitate the expansion of the information and communications infrastructure • Employ science and technology in ensuring the supply of sustainable, affordable, safe and reliable energy • Develop human resources to support the deployment and rehabilitation of modern and state-of-the-art ICT infrastructure • Promote R&D programmes relating to alternate energy sources such as solar energy, biomass, nuclear, wind and other renewable energy sources to supplement the current traditional energy sources Policy Measures, Instruments and Initiatives Specific policy initiatives and measures shall be targeted at: • developing the necessary legal, institutional and regulatory framework and structures required for supporting the development of the communications infrastructure 64 • developing the necessary highly skilled ICT human resources required for supporting the development and maintenance of an advanced information and communications infrastructure and systems • promoting international standards, and best practices that could among other things aid the process of the development of an advanced and reliable information and communication infrastructure and the improvements in quality of service (QoS) within the local communication services sector • promoting and facilitating the development of the private sector to generate enough demand for advanced and reliable information and communication services • the creation of conditions for an investor friendly telecommunications environment; including those targeting the liberalization of the ICT sector and encouragement of private investment in the ICT sector • the development of the local communications industry towards competitiveness • promoting and facilitating a stable and competitive investment climate to attract both domestic and foreign direct investment • promoting and facilitating the development of the physical and social infrastructure --- targeting the rural areas The Key Implementation Agencies, Players and Stakeholders • Ministry of Roads and Highway • Ministry of Communications and Technology • Ministry of Energy • Telecom Operators and Backbone Infrastructure Providers 65 R&D, SCIENTIFIC AND INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT Policy Context The important role that industrial and scientific research as well as research and development (R&D) can play in developing a nation’s capacity and capabilities to develop advanced products and services industry and sector to facilitate its development process has been acknowledged. For most countries, investments in R&D have been identified as a precondition for a sustained socio-economic development. In both the developed and developing nation’s the driving force behind the development of high-tech industries and services targeted at the export market has been huge investments in R&D efforts. In fact, various studies have established a link between economic development and the level of investments in R&D as well as basic and applied scientific and industrial research. For example, evidence drawn from a number of countries, has established a strong link between the number of scientists and engineers involve in R&D (per million persons) and the high tech exports (in million dollars) of countries. It is acknowledged that Ghana’s research and development capacity (R&D) is limited and evidence shows that very little R&D work is being undertaken in industry and in the nation’s universities and research institutions. Most of these institutions lack the necessary capacity to conduct and engage in advanced and cutting-edge R&D work required for supporting the development of a globally competitive information, knowledge-based and high-tech export industry and services sector. In fact, evidence shows that less than 5% of the Ghana’s scientists and engineers in the universities, colleges and industries are involved in R&D. Also it has been established that linkages between industry and research institutions and universities to facilitate collaborative research and R&D work is rare. In the few cases where some R&D work is being undertaken in the nation’s universities and research institutions, they are not linked to industry. In other words, the required linkage between industry and the research institutions, that is necessary to commercially drive R&D work and its outputs is virtually non-existent in Ghana. The Policy Statement The Government acknowledges that if Ghana is to make any progress in developing a high-tech export industry, a lot of efforts will need to be directed at investing more in R&D and developing the nation’s scientific and industrial research and R&D base devoting particular attention to establishing linkages between industry and the research institutions and universities involved in R&D. As part of these efforts the need to increase the number of scientists and engineers involve in R&D work both in industry and in the universities and research institutes is also recognized. The Government is committed to promoting and supporting R&D initiatives in industry, research institutes and universities to enhance Ghana’s capacity to develop, produce, manufacture and assembly ICT products and services as a step towards developing a globally competitive ICT service sector and industry. As part of this commitment Government shall promote partnership, collaborations and linkages between local R&D Institutions and foreign Centers of Excellence to speed up the process of knowledge and know-how transfer to Ghanaians. 66 This policy commitment shall in addition contribute to addressing some of the other identified developmental challenges facing Ghana, including: the challenges of the weak scientific research base and under-developed research and development (R&D) capacity; the challenges of the limited human resource capacity characterized by low professional, technical and managerial manpower base; the challenges of the disproportionate informal private sector; the challenges of the under-developed and under-performing private sector; the challenges of the low job creation capacity of the economy as well as the challenges of the narrow export base dominated by traditional exports Policy Objectives and Strategies The Objectives • To support and strengthen scientific research and R&D within the nation’s universities and research institutions as a basis for promoting the development of a globally competitive local ICT sector and industry. • To promote and encourage industrial based R&D to facilitate innovation and product development and service improvement and advancement • To develop world-class service sector and industry through the promotion of advanced R&D within the economy • To enhance industrial technology development infrastructure • To promote and facilitate R&D work targeting recyclable materials technologies and application to minimize industrial waste in the environment The Strategies • Improve the research and development (R&D) capacity of Ghana to meet the demands and requirements for developing Ghana’s information and knowledge-based economy and society • Promote agricultural research as well as cutting-edge agriculture-based R&D targeting the development of a modernize and competitive agriculture sector • Encourage R&D activities aimed at the development of tools, equipment and machinery for industries and encourage quality assurance in manufacturing • Support biomedical research and improvement in the general health delivery system and promote and support research into plant medicine to complement allopathic medicine • Facilitate capacity building in all science and technology areas, which hold promise for enhanced national development, including engineering design and industrial technology systems • Promote knowledge acquisition and development of technologies in the new and emerging sciences of biotechnology, materials science, microelectronics and laser technology 67 • Encourage and fund ICT R&D in the nation’s universities and research institutes • Create incentives for industries to set up ICT-related R&D centers in the universities and research institutes through faculty chairs, matching grants and focused joint projects. • Institute mechanisms for soliciting ICT research projects that will be made open to both research institutes and universities to facilitate the selection of good and innovative projects for national development. • Fund vacation and sabbatical visits of expatriate ICT experts and researchers to facilitate the process of knowledge and expertise transfer and sharing through collaboration with local counterparts • Establish ICT R&D institutions with unique and clear mandates and encouraging industries and organizations to establish similar institutions • Setup up national level institutional framework and structures for taking process development at academic institutions and R&D laboratories closer to industrial acceptance. • Provide incentives to local R&D institutions to enter into collaborative research with foreign universities as well as with local companies and multinationals. • Facilitate the acquisition, adaptation and dissemination of new developments in ICTs. • Facilitate the transfer of technology and collaboration on R&D between local Centers of Excellence and international R&D centers.

The rapid changes and developments within the communications sector brought about mainly by the advances in technologies and services has made it necessary for countries to create and operate a dynamic legal and regulatory framework that is responsive to technological changes and advances. Also given that most nation’s legal and regulatory framework most often lags behind technological developments and advances, it is imperative that countries operate in a dynamic and responsive legal and regulatory environment that takes advantage of these technological advances, promote innovation and enhances consumer choice and preferences. It is acknowledged that Ghana’s existing legal and regulatory framework for supporting the development of the communications sector was primarily designed to manage the transition from monopoly to competition and was therefore focused on the creation of a competitive market and the rights of new entrants. The Government recognizes the need to periodically review the operations, provisions and the directives making up the legal regulatory framework in the light of rapid developments in the communications industry, characterized by technological advances evolutions and the resultant changes in user demand, and choices and preferences. It is also acknowledged that rapid changes and developments in the communications industry and sector that has given rise to convergence between communications, telecommunications, broadcasting and information technologies, service, platforms and systems, need to be reflected in the country’s legal and regulatory regime and framework aimed at supporting and facilitating the development of the ICT industry and sector. It is recognized that with such foreseen and anticipated changes in the communications industry, Ghana’s legal and regulatory policy framework for guiding the development of the ICT industry will need to take account of these developments in particular The goal is to as far as possible create a flexible and dynamic legal and regulatory framework and system that restrict regulation to the necessary minimum, reinforce competition within the industry and sector, while ensuring that the basic rights, choices and preference of consumers continue to be protected, and the principle of universal access and service reinforced. The Policy Statement The Government acknowledges that the development and the exploitation of ICTs in the economy and society as well as the development of the information and knowledge economy will need to be supported and facilitated by appropriate legal provisions and legislation; regulatory framework and provisions as well as institutional structures. 69 The Government is therefore committed to promoting and implementing a communications sector legal and regulatory framework that is open and transparent in the development and application of its rules, regulations, directives and provisions; caters for and promote competition and innovation; exhibits the characteristics of clarity in terms of its directives and laws: predictability in that its directives and laws must lead to predictable results, outcomes and consequences for business decisions and relevance in that its directives and laws reflects the pertinent subject matters and issues of the ICT sector and industry. As part of this commitment, specific policy measures shall be taken to facilitate universal service and access to basic and value added telecommunications services; the creation of conditions for an investor friendly communications environment; the development of the communications industry towards competition, while taking steps to facilitate the active involvement of local companies in the industry and as well as promoting liberalization of the sector and private sector investment in the ICT sector. The Government also acknowledges that the deployment, exploitation and the development of ICTs in Ghana will need to be guided by appropriate standards, best practices and guidelines. The Government is therefore committed to facilitating this process. The Government is also committed to the enactment of the necessary cyber laws and legislative provisions to govern and regulate cyber-related activities within the country. Legislation to promote and facilitate electronic commerce and other Internet-related activities in the country shall be enacted in addition to facilitating the enactment of laws relating to: intellectual property rights; data protection and security, freedom of access to information; computer and cyber crime and other cyber-laws, necessary for facilitating their country’s participation in the information age and economy. This policy commitment shall in addition contribute to addressing some of the other identified developmental challenges facing Ghana, including: the challenges of the disproportionate informal private sector; the challenges of the low job creation capacity of the economy as well as the challenges of the narrow export base dominated by traditional exports and the challenges of the weak scientific research base and under-developed research and development (R&D) capacity.

Some of these security concerns have national security and law and order implications while others relate to the protection of individuals and organizations from unlawful acts using the technology. Specific examples include cyber-crimes which have national security implications, unlawful access to critical information, computer and communications networks and resources; electronic frauds targeted mainly at the banks and the financial sector among others. In most countries, security of networks and communications has been identified as a major area of concern for the development of the digital economy. Networks and information systems are now supporting services and carrying data and information of great value to governments business and individuals. The transmission of sensitive and critical information through local and global electronic messaging networks involves an element of security risk to governments, organizations and business establishments. Increased protection of the networks and information systems is therefore necessary to guide against various types of attacks and unauthorized access. Also the growth of attacks and fraud conducted on electronic messaging and communications networks and system in the recent years threatens to undermine consumers’ confidence in online services, electronic commerce and the effective functioning of electronic markets and government systems. The Government acknowledges the need for a policy statement on how these security issues can be addressed within the broad policy framework aimed at the development of Ghana’s information and knowledge-based society and economy. The Policy Statement The Government is committed to putting in place policy measures and mechanisms to address national security and law and order issues relating to the deployment exploitation and the utilization of ICTs within the economy and society. As part of this commitment, policy directives shall be put in place to address security issues relating to privacy, data and consumer protection as well as those relating to the security of computer networks and information systems and their information and data contents. Specific attention shall be devoted to addressing national security issues relating to protection of government computer networks and information systems against various types of attacks on their availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality. Policy mechanisms, and measures shall also be put in place aimed at the protection of the Ghanaian public from undesirable impacts of the digital age and economy in general and in particular those relating to the Internet including the spread of pornographic materials, cyber-crimes and digital frauds. Also to be targeted are national security and law and order implications of the Internet as well as issues relating to 76 aspects of the Internet that can potentially damage or corrupt Ghana’s cultural heritage, national image and national identity. The Government as part of its policy commitment to addressing national security and law and order through the deployment and exploitation of ICTs will: • Use ICTs as an essential tool for combating contemporary and emerging security threats and challenges. • Implement ICT applications and services to enhance command and control activities within the Security Agencies and aid in their interaction with the general populace. • Research and implement solutions that will enable interaction between the Security Agencies and the populace and to facilitate and augment the resources available to these Agencies in the following areas; informing citizens and government; the pursuit and tracking of criminals and other criminal activities; and the management of the operations of these agencies to improve efficiency • Facilitate the deployment of the required infrastructure for advancement of ICTs and related services within the Police force and the Military service. • Implement training standards for members of the security forces to be carried out by current members of the forces and as part of the training regime for entry into those forces. • In consultation with the Office of the Attorney General ensure that the legal framework necessary for the security forces to deploy and use ICTs in carrying out their duties are drafted and enacted. • Explore the use of ICTs by the Security Agencies to enable collaboration with similar external bodies in the delivery of their duties.

and Provisions of the Ghana Integrated ICT   for Accelerated Development (ICT4AD) Policy     Preamble    Nations worldwide have recognized the developmental opportunities and the challenges of the  emerging information age characterized by information and communication technologies  (ICTs). These technologies are driving national development efforts worldwide and a number of  countries in both the developed and developing world are exploring ways of facilitating their  development process through the development, deployment and the exploitation of ICTs within  their economies and societies.    The Ghana ICT for Accelerated Development (ICT4AD) Policy represents the Vision for Ghana  in the information age. It is based on the Policy Framework Document: “AAnn  IInntteeggrraatteedd  IICCTT-- lleedd  SSoocciioo--eeccoonnoommiicc  DDeevveellooppmmeenntt  PPoolliiccyy  aanndd  PPllaann  DDeevveellooppmmeenntt  FFrraammeewwoorrkk  ffoorr   GGhhaannaa””  released in March 2003.  The development of this policy framework document was  based on a nation-wide consultative process involving all key stakeholders in the public sector,  private sector and civil society.     The Ghana ICT for Accelerated Development (ICT4AD) Policy Statement fully takes into account  the aspirations and the provisions of key socio-economic development framework documents  including: the Vision 2020 –The First Steps; the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS) (2002  -2004) and the Co-ordinated Programme for Economic and Social Development of Ghana (2003- 2012)    The Policy Statement sets out  the road map for the development of Ghana’s information society  and economy and provides a basis for facilitating the socio-economic development of the  country in the emerging information, knowledge and  technological age to be dominated by  information and knowledge-based economies.  The Policy is aimed at addressing a number of  developmental challenges facing the country as a basis for achieving a number of  policy goals  and objectives. The key elements of the Policy Statement are summarized as follows:    The Policy Challenges    The Ghana ICT4AD Policy is designed to aid Ghana’s development process by contributing to  addressing the nation’s key developmental challenges. These include:     • The social and economic pressures of a youthful population and the challenges of   turning the youthful population into an asset for development      • The poor performance of the economy --- coupled with rapid population growth and   declining per capita income         7  • An economy with low job creation capacity and dominated by an under-performing  agricultural sector with weak under-developed industrial and services sector      • The heavy national debt burden characterized by high debt per capita, and high debt-  servicing ratio  --- factors acting as  major constrains on the nation’s development efforts    • An under-developed  and under-performing private sector with a disproportionate   informal sector      • Limited human resource capacity characterized by low professional, technical and  managerial manpower base     • Weak  scientific research base and under-developed research and development (R&D)   capacity     • Relatively high proportion of the population with no educational attainment; a high  school drop-out rate and limited access to higher education by the vast majority of the  population especially girls and women.     • Narrow export base dominated by traditional exports     • Under-developed physical infrastructure and     • Poor and limited communications and telecommunications  infrastructure         The Case for the ICT4AD Policy    The emergence of the information age has brought to the fore, the important role that  information, knowledge and technology can play in facilitating socio-economic development.  The effective use of information and knowledge is becoming the most critical factor for rapid  economic growth and wealth creation, and for improving socio-economic well-being.     There is no doubt that information; knowledge and technology are increasingly becoming the  key drivers for socio-economic development world-wide. A nation’s capability to accelerate its  socio-economic development process and gain global competitiveness and improve the well- being of its people depends very much on the extent to which it can develop, use, exploit and  sell, ---- information, knowledge and technology in one form or another.    It has been acknowledged that for Ghana to move her industrially weak, subsistence agriculture  based economy towards an information and knowledge economy she will need to develop and  implement comprehensive integrated ICT-led socio-economic development policies, strategies  and plans.  With the right sets of policies and action plans it will be possible for Ghana to  facilitate its socio-economic development process through the development, deployment and  exploitation of ICTs within the economy and society without first going through an extensive  industrialization process.     It is however recognized that for the policy to make an appreciable desirable impact on the  socio-economic development process of Ghana, it will need to be integrated into the overall      8  developmental objectives, priorities and programmes of the country.  Such  an all-inclusive  comprehensive ‘ICT for development’ policy and strategies must be aimed at the  implementation of initiatives that could contribute to addressing  the key developmental  challenges facing the country    The Basic Question Addressed by the Policy Statement    How to address Ghana’s developmental challenges and accelerate the nation’s socio-economic  development process to improve the socio-economic well-being of its people through the  development, deployment and exploitation of ICTs within the society and economy    The Basic Premise of the Policy    Ghana’s development process can be accelerated through the development, deployment and  exploitation of ICTs within the economy and society    The Basic Motivation of the Policy    Ghana’s accelerated development within the emerging information and digital age will not be  possible without an ICT-driven development agenda    The Overall Objectives of the Policy    To engineer an ICT-led socio-economic development process with the potential to transform  Ghana into a middle income, information-rich, knowledge-based and technology driven  economy and society    The Specific Objectives of the Policy     • To create the necessary enabling environment to facilitate the deployment, utilization  and  exploitation of ICTs within the economy and society      • To support the development of a viable knowledge-based ICT industry to facilitate the   production, manufacturing, development, delivering, and distribution of ICT products  and services     • To facilitate the modernization of  the agricultural sector through the deployment and   exploitation of ICTs to improve on its efficiency and productivity.   • To  support the development of  a competitive high value-added services sector, to  serve as an engine for accelerated development and economic growth with the potential  to develop into a regional business-services and ICT hub.   • To aid the process of the development of national human resource capacity and the  nation’s R&D capabilities to meet the changing  needs and demands of the economy     • To promote an improved educational system within which ICTs are widely deployed to   facilitate the delivery of educational services at all levels of the educational system        9  • To facilitate a wide-spread deployment and exploitation of ICTs within the society to  support the delivery of health and social services     • To support the modernization of the civil and public service through institutional   reforms, renewal and the deployment and exploitation of ICTs to facilitate improvements  in operational effectiveness, efficiency and service delivery     • To facilitate the development, expansion, rehabilitation and the continuous   modernization of the national information and communications infrastructure     • To guide the development and implementation of electronic government and  governance, as well as  electronic commerce and business strategies and action plans      • To accelerate the development of women and eliminate gender inequalities in   education, employment, decision making through the deployment and exploitation of  ICTs by building capacities and providing opportunities for  girls and women     • To facilitate the development and implementation of the necessary legal, institutional   and regulatory framework and structures required for supporting the deployment,  utilization and the development of  ICTs;     • To facilitate the development and promotion of the necessary standards, good practices   and guidelines to support the deployment and exploitation of ICTs within the society and  economy      The Strategic Focus of the Policy    To simultaneously target the development of the ICT sector and industry as well as use ICTs as a  broad-based enabler of developmental goals, with emphasis on the development, deployment  and exploitation of ICTs to aid the development of all other sectors of the economy    The Priority Focus Areas of Policy --- The 14 ICT4AD Pillars     • Accelerated Human Resource Development  • Promoting ICTs in Education – The Deployment and Exploitation of ICTs in Education  • Facilitating Government Administration and Service Delivery – Promoting Electronic   Government and Governance  • Facilitating the Development of the Private Sector  • Developing an Export-Oriented ICT Products and Services Industry  • Modernization of Agriculture and the Development of  an Agro-Business Industry  • Developing a Globally Competitive Value-Added Services Sector --- A Regional Business   Service and ICT  Hub  • Deployment and Spread of  ICTs in the Community  • Promotion of National Health  • Rapid ICT and Enabling Physical Infrastructure Development  • Legal, Regulatory, and Institutional Framework  Provisions   • R&D, Scientific and Industrial Research Capacity Development  • Promoting Foreign and Local Direct Investment Drive in ICTs      10  • Facilitating National Security and Law and Order    Key Drivers of the Policy     • ICTs as a Social-Enabler (Education, Health, Poverty-Reduction, Income-Distribution)  • ICTs as an Enabler of rapid Socio-Economic development  • ICTs as an Enabler of Government Administration and Service Delivery  • ICTs as a Facilitator of Electronic Government and Electronic Commerce Initiatives  • ICTs as an Engine of the Service Sector  • ICTs as an Enabler of Knowledge-driven Industrial development  • ICTs as an Enabler of the Agriculture Sector  • ICTs as a Driver of Private Sector Development  • ICTs as an Agent for Wealth Creation  • ICTs as a Tool for Bridging the Gender inequality Gap in Social, Economic and Political   development    The Principal Questions Addressed by the Policy     • Where we are as a nation?  • Where do we want to get to as a nation?  • When do we want to get there?  • What do we need to do in order to get there?     Concluding    The Policy Statement reflects the nation’s total commitment to transform Ghana into an  information-rich knowledge-based society and economy to ensure that Ghana and its people  fully participate in the information age and enjoy the social, cultural and economic benefits of  the emerging information revolution.    The Government and the People of Ghana are wholeheartedly committed to the implementation  of the provisions of the Policy to facilitate the process of establishing a prosperous society, with  an economy that is globally competitive, dynamic, robust and resilient with respect to the rapid  changes and advances that are taking place in the global economy to be dominated by  technology-driven information and knowledge economies.    To implement the Policy a number of 4-year rolling plans shall be developed and implemented  within the life-span of the Policy – It is envisaged that the Policy will have an operational life of  between fifteen to twenty years.  --- And as a working and living document, it is anticipated that,  necessary  periodic revisions will be made in relation to its key elements to meet changing   developmental  objectives and priorities as well as changes in the global economy and  advances in the technological environment.        11                           PART ONE          The Vision to Transform Ghana in the Information and  Technology Age           12                                         Page Deliberately Left Blank     13       CHAPTER ONE          TTHHEE  PPOOLLIICCYY  BBAACCKKGGRROOUUNNDD  SSTTAATTEEMMEENNTT        Ghana in the Information and Knowledge-based Age     The emerging information and knowledge age and the new technological revolution are heralding a new  economic and social order characterized by the development, and exploitation of ICTs within all spheres  of human endeavor. This era is giving rise to the emergence of information and knowledge-based  economies with traditional economic, industrial and commercial activities moving towards acknowledge- driven processes with most of the advanced economies progressively being transformed into knowledge- based technology-driven services dominated economies.     These economies are increasingly laying emphasis on economic activities with intellectual content and  knowledge. A number of countries  are recognizing the need to rapidly develop their knowledge base  through massive investments in human resource development laying emphasis on improving, and  broadening universal access to higher  and quality education and training avenues including on-the-job  and in-service skill updates and life-long learning.      Also the need to massively invest in research and development (R&D) efforts to create new products, and  services as a way of gaining competitive advantage in an increasingly competitive global economic  environment has been given a priority by most nations as part of their effort to develop their information  economy and society. The use of these emerging technologies to transform government machineries to  facilitate efficiency in operations and service delivery has also been a priority area of Governments  worldwide.    There is therefore no doubt that Governments world-wide have recognized the crucial role that ICTs can  play in facilitating and accelerating socio-economic development. A number of countries in both the  developed and developing world have in place relevant policies and strategic plans that will enable them  transform their economies into information and knowledge-based economies. Ghana like other  developing countries is equally placed to take advantage of these technologies to facilitate her socio- economic development to aid the process of transforming the nation’s economy and society into an  information-rich and knowledge-based economy and society.    The emerging information and knowledge economy is no doubt generating opportunities across all  sectors in both developed and developing countries. --- It is a new source for the creation of quality jobs,  wealth generation and redistribution, rapid economic development and prosperity as well as a means for  facilitating global competitiveness. With the emerging information age, ICTs are seen by a number of  countries as a key factor for achieving progress in economic and social development. These technologies  are offering developing countries like Ghana a window of opportunity to leap-frog the key stages of  industrialization and transform their subsistence agriculture dominated economies into a service-sector      14  driven, high value-added information and knowledge economy that can successfully compete on the  global market.     It is acknowledged that in the new information age, although the mere use of information, knowledge and  technology can improve the socio-economic development fortunes of a given nation. Evidence shows that  those nations who in addition are involved in the development as well as the sale of information (and  information products), knowledge (and knowledge products) and technology (and its products), are  moving faster on the socio-economic development scale compared to others.  There is no doubt that in  the new emerging economic order, the fundamental basis for wealth creation and national prosperity are  information and knowledge and that Ghana cannot afford to be without either of these.    The Challenges, and the Opportunities    It is recognized that if Ghana is to move her industrially weak, subsistence agriculture-based economy  towards an information and knowledge economy she will need to develop and implement comprehensive  integrated ICT-led socio-economic development policies, strategies and plans set within the wider  context of the socio-economic development objectives of the country. There is no doubt that for Ghana to  compete and prosper in the new emerging global economy to be dominated by information and  knowledge-based economies, she will need to embrace and harness ICTs  to facilitate her development  process.    Ghana’s success in the emerging knowledge revolution and technological age will depend on the extent to  which it manages to address the resultant developmental challenges and take advantage of rapidly  evolving technologies. It is acknowledged that, although these new technologies present considerable  challenges to developing countries like Ghana, they also provide considerable opportunities for  sustainable development and for improving competitiveness of key sectors of the economy like:  agriculture, industry, and services.     This Policy Statement defines Ghana’s ICT-driven development agenda in the information age. The  Statement sets out Ghana’s road map in terms of the vision, missions, strategies and policy priorities for  developing Ghana’s information society and economy --- The ultimate objective is to:  accelerate  Ghana’s socio-economic development process towards the realization of the vision to transform Ghana  into a high income economy and society that is  predominately  information-rich and  knowledge-based  within the next two to three decades or less.         Acknowledging Ghana’s Developmental Challenges in terms of Key  Socio-Economic Development Indicators     The ICT4AD Policy acknowledges that for it to make a desirable and appreciable impact on the country’s  developmental process it must in addition to being related to the wider social and economic development  objectives and priorities of the nation, be aimed at addressing the developmental challenges facing Ghana  defined in terms of key socio-economic indicators; ---- with specific reference to the fact that:     • Ghana has a relatively high population growth rate. And that the nation’s population based on the  current population growth rate of  2.5%, will reach 38 million --- double the 2000 figure by 2028.     • Ghana has a relatively youthful population with close to 60% of  the population under the age of   25 years and only 5% of the population over 65 years old      15    • Ghana’s high illiteracy rate with close to 40% of the population above the age of 6 years without   any form of educational attainment with only about 3% of the population with tertiary level  education has  serious implications for the nation’s development.     • The country has a high primary school drop-out rate and very low secondary school enrolment   rate. --- With close to 50% of junior secondary school leavers failing to  progress to senior  secondary school and a high proportion of senior secondary school leavers failing to continue  their education.     • Close to 40% of Ghanaians currently live below the poverty line of less than $1 per day and  five   of the 10 regions of the country currently have more than 40% of their people living in poverty.    The ICT4AD Policy has also taken into account the fact that:     • Ghana has a predominantly agricultural economy ---- most of which is based on subsistence  farming with very little mechanization or application of modern agricultural production methods  or practices. The agriculture labour force has a high percentage of women and about 70% of  these are illiterate     • The Ghanaian economy has not experienced a major structural transformation since   independence. --- And that the majority of the working population (60%) are still actively  involved in agriculture with only 13% working in the industrial sector and  28% in the service  sector of the economy     • Ghana's industrial base is narrow and its services sector, the second largest contributor to GDP   after the agriculture sector, is under-developed      • The informal private sector is by far the largest employment sector of the Ghanaian economy. ----  This sector alone accounts for about 81% of the employed work force, with the formal private  sector accounting for only 8% of the employment of the economically active population.  Majority of women operate in the informal sector with very little support     The Policy Statement also acknowledges that:     • The job creation capacity of the Ghanaian economy is extremely low. ---- And that most of the  employed population  are involved in set-ups that do not have the potential to generate additional  jobs or employment opportunities.      • Only about 15% of the working population are employees of public and private sector   organizations; and that close to 68% of the employed population are self-employed with no  employees compared to 5.2% of self-employed with one or more employees.      • Ghana is currently facing a human resource problem in technical and managerial skills and more   so in the area of  ICT skills.      • Ghana’s R&D capacity and capabilities are limited, with the nation’s universities and research  institutions lacking the necessary capacity to conduct and engage in advanced and cutting-edge  R&D work.         16    The Policy additionally takes into account the fact that:     • Ghana's national debt  is a major impediment to economic development; and that, the nation’s  average national debt per capita (in 2000) exceeded its annual average gross national income per  capita.  And that Ghana’s debt burden measured in terms of its annual debt servicing payments  do present the country with a major developmental challenge     • Ghana’s current gross national income per capita of  $340 is lower than the average for Sub-  Saharan African countries estimated at $480 and also lower than that of  low-income countries  estimated at $420.      • Ghana’s aspiration to accelerate its socio-economic development process and achieve a middle   income status will require achieving a considerably high growth rate well above its current  growth rate. And that Ghana growing at its current economic growth rate will for many years  continue to register a gross national income per capita below the current Sub-Sahara Africa  average.     • Ghana will require a double figure growth rate of  between  10% - 12% per annum sustainable   over the next fifteen to twenty years to be able to  attain a middle income per capita level of   between $1000 and $2000 in the next  15 years and over     • Historically, Ghana has never achieved a double figure growth rate. And that the highest GDP   growth rate the nation has ever achieved was 8.8% in 1984.     • A lot of efforts will be required to transform the economy from its current low single digit  growth rate to a double digit growth rate. And that anything short of a growth rate between 10%  and 12% sustained over a number of years will make it extremely difficult for Ghana to move  into the middle income zone in the foreseeable future.           Crystallizing the Developmental Challenges Facing the Country    Further to taking into account the current status of key socio-economic indicators in guiding the  development of the ICT4AD Policy, the Government also recognizes the need to target the Policy at  addressing the key developmental challenges facing Ghana –and these include:     • The social and economic pressures of a youthful population –-- Ghana’s relatively young  population of  close to 60% of the population under the age of 25 years do present the country  with a number of development challenges. Some of the developmental challenges that Ghana is  facing as a result of having a relatively young population include those relating to heavy social  expenditure budget in areas like: education, training and provision of health and other social   services.      • The challenges of  turning the youthful population into an asset for development –-- The lack of   policies and initiatives targeted at turning the youthful population into a skilled human resource  asset to aid the development of the country may translate into a high unemployable population in  the years to come. Turning of the youthful population into an asset for development and the      17  taking of steps to improve the economy to provide opportunities to a growing population of  young people presents Ghana with a key developmental challenge.     • Rapid population growth and declining per capita income --- At the current growth rate of 2.5%,   Ghana’s population will increase by 50% within the next 12 years; reach the 30 million mark by  2020 and will be double the 2000 figure by 2028. This rapid growth in the population could  present Ghana with a number of developmental challenges especially if economic growth  continues to lag behind population growth.     • An under-performing agricultural sector --- Ghana’s agricultural sector despite experiencing   some improvements in some areas, is seriously underperforming in a number of critical areas.  Given that the agricultural sector currently employs 70% of the labour force, contributes close  35% to the GDP and accounts for 57% of foreign exchange earnings, the lack of development in  the sector has a number of social and economic implications which could further compound  Ghana’s socio-economic problems and retard its developmental efforts     • An economy dominated by the agricultural sector with weak under-developed industrial and   service sector --- The Ghanaian economy is still predominately agriculture-base without a  substantial shift towards the services sector and industrial sector as should be expected if the  economy were on a rapid growth path and modernizing. The structure of the Ghanaian economy  measured in terms of sectorial contribution to GDP indicates that the structure of the economy  changed very little over the last 20 years. Putting in place policies and strategies that modernize  the agriculture sector while at the same time target the development of the industrial and services  sectors to increase their contribution to the GDP constitute a major developmental challenge  facing the country.     • The heavy debt burden --- Ghana’s development is being handicapped by the nation’s heavy debt   burden measured in terms of: the high national debt per capita, the high national debt as  percentage of GDP, the debt service ratio and the debt service to export earnings ratio. The  nation’s debt per capita in 2000 was $350 compared to its income per capita of $340; the national  debt as percentage of GDP increased to about 129% by 2000. Ghana’s  heavy debt burden is  compounding its other economic development problems and this is constraining the nation’s  developmental efforts in a number of areas.     • The disproportionate informal private sector ---- Statistics shows that  the private sector, is   dominated by its informal sub-sector. In other words, the formal private sector forms a very small  fraction of the private sector. The informal private sector is also by far the largest employment  sector of the Ghanaian economy – accounting for close to 81% of the economically active  population, while the formal private sector accounts for only about 8%. The development of the  private sector in general and in particular the formal private sector is one of the major  developmental challenges facing the nation.     • The low professional, technical and managerial manpower base ---- The occupational profile of   the economically active population reveals that: only  8.6% are professional and technical  people  with a lower percentage of 0.3% who are managers and administrators. It is estimated that Ghana  has about 174 registered engineers, 53 legal practitioners, 60 certified accountants, 50 architects  and surveyors and 145 medical and detail practitioners (including doctors) per million of persons.  The low percentage of key technical and professional manpower highlights the relatively low  professional and technically skilled human resource capacity of the economy. The development      18  of a skilled  human resource capacity can be singled out as one of the key developmental  challenges facing the country.     • Relatively high proportion of population with no educational attainment  --- Close to 40% of    Ghanaians over 6 years of age have never been to school, in other words they have no educational  attainment. This figure coupled with the fact that only about 3% of the population had tertiary  level education also present Ghana with a major developmental challenge.     • Low job creation capacity of the economy  --- Close to 68% of employed population are self-  employed with no employees. In other words, the majority of the working population work in  their own small enterprises and has no other employees apart from themselves. With the economy  dominated by the self-employed, who do not have the capacity to employ others, the prospects for  generating additional jobs or employment opportunities for a growing young  population are very  low. The transformation of the economy to improve on its employment generation capacity is a  key developmental challenge facing the country.     • Narrow export base dominated by traditional exports ---- Ghana’s trade with the outside world   has for many years registered huge balance of payment (BoP) deficits. The country’s small  domestic market cannot support the development of the key sectors of the economy. A key  developmental challenge facing Ghana therefore  relates to the development of  a diversified  export-led economy targeting key sectors of the economy including the agriculture, services  and  industrial sectors     • Under-developed physical infrastructure. ---  Ghana currently suffers from a number of physical   infrastructure deficits which is putting a strain on the nation’s developmental efforts. The  developmental implications of the nation’s poor physical infrastructure in the area of: roads,  power, water and sanitation is a major developmental challenge facing the country.     • Poor and limited communications infrastructure --- The development, expansion and the   modernization of the nation’s communications infrastructure is a key developmental challenge.   A key developmental challenge facing the nation entails the development, expansion and the  modernization of the nation’s communications infrastructure to achieve universal service and  access to basic and value added telecommunications services, support the development of the  local ICT industry and aid the country’s socio-economic development process.      It is recognized that the socio-economic problems and challenges facing Ghana are likely to be  compounded by the new challenges posed by globalization and the information age. And that for Ghana,  to make progress in its developmental process, the nation in addition to taking steps to  address these  developmental challenges will also need to put in place efforts to address the additional challenges posed  by globalization and the information revolution.    The ICT4AD Policy Statement sets out Ghana’s vision in the information age. It defines the nation’s  broad vision, and the corresponding missions and strategies to serve as a road map for guiding the  country’s developmental efforts to aid the process of transforming it into an information and knowledge- based society and economy. The Policy Statement in a nutshell defines the vision and the agenda for  developing Ghana’s information society and economy.        19    Summary of the Socio-Economic Development Objectives and   Priorities of Ghana    Ghana through the formulation of a number of socio-economic development policy frameworks over the  years has identified a number of key developmental objectives to address the developmental problems  facing the country. Of these policy frameworks, the key ones are Vision 2020 Socio-Economic  Development Framework,  the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy (2000-2004), the Ghana Science and  Technology Policy and the Co-ordinated  Programme for  Economic and Social Development of Ghana  (2003-2012).

And to ensure effective  and efficient export diversification by making the agricultural sector more price-competitive and  export-oriented.      • To develop and promote the country’s competitive advantage as a trade and investment gateway   to West Africa sub-region.     • To promote the attainment of an efficient, diversified, technologically-progressive and market- driven industrial sector that is capable of sustainable growth.      • To increase the national capacity for industrial production and promote science and technology   activities that enhances industrial productivity.   • To encourage private sector development by promoting an enabling environment, including a  conducive legal and social framework, for private sector investments in industry.    • To strengthen the private sector in an active way to ensure that it is capable of acting effectively  as the engine of growth and poverty reduction      20  • To encourage technological innovation and effective adaptation of known and mature  technologies, and to promote the improvement of local technologies.   • To transform society to become more scientifically based and to improve technology to secure  increased productivity in all economic sectors.   • To improve the efficiency of the public service and ensure that it plays a more positive role in  economic and social development at all levels.     • To improve the technical proficiency, management skills of the Ghanaian workforce, Enlarge   training infrastructure for skills upgrading and match the supply of skilled labour with demand.     • To increase women’s access to ICTs by ensuring a gender balance and positive discrimination in  favour of the girl child to create a balance in trained information technology manpower.      • To promote women’s rights to expression and communication through the use of ICTs and to   develop a reporting mechanism to monitor progress towards gender equality in the area of ICTs     • To enhance the delivery of social services to ensure quality and locational equity, particularly  with regard to education and health services.        The Ghana ICT4AD Policy is set within the wider socio-economic development framework for Ghana and  as such is targeted at addressing a number of the identified developmental objectives and priorities of Ghana  set within the wider context of achieving the Vision for Ghana through development of the nation’s  information economy and society.          21  CHAPTER TWO       TTHHEE  VVIISSIIOONN,,  MMIISSSSIIOONNSS,,  SSTTRRAATTEEGGIIEESS  AANNDD  PPOOLLIICCYY  GGOOAALLSS           The Vision for Ghana      The Global Vision     To improve the quality of life of the people of Ghana by enriching their social, economic and  cultural well-being through the modernization of the economy and society.    The Vision, does not envisage the future of Ghana only in economic development terms -- It  acknowledges the need for Ghana to develop politically, socially and culturally to foster: political  stability, good governance and system of government; improvement in the quality of life of the people of  Ghana; national unity and security; social interaction, cohesion and integration; social justice;  environmental protection and the fostering of the cultural heritage and the image of Ghana.     The Vision also aims at enhancing the pride and confidence of the people of Ghana in their abilities and  capabilities to develop Ghana into a prosperous nation that is at peace with itself territorially and  ethnically.    To contribute to the realization of the Global Vision, within the context of using ICTs as an engine for  Ghana’s socio-economic development, an ICT4AD Vision shall be pursued.    The ICT4AD Vision for Ghana    To improve the quality of  life  of the people of Ghana by significantly enriching  their social,  economic and cultural well-being through the rapid development and  modernization of the  economy and society using information and communication technologies as the main engine  for accelerated and sustainable economic and social development    The ICT4AD Mission Statements    To realize the key aspirations of the ICT4AD vision, the following missions shall be pursued:    Main Mission    To transform Ghana into an information-rich, knowledge-based and technology-driven high income  economy and society             22    Sub-Missions     • To  develop Ghana’s information and knowledge-based society and economy through the  widespread development, deployment, and exploitation of  ICTs within the society and economy     • To transform the educational system to provide the requisite educational, and training services   and environment capable of producing the right types of skills and human resources required  for  developing and driving Ghana’s information and knowledge-based economy and society      • To develop Ghana’s research and development (R&D) capacity and capabilities with the potential   to conduct and engage in advanced and cutting-edge R&D work required for supporting the  development of a globally competitive information, knowledge-based and high-tech export  industry and services     • To transform Ghana into an attractive destination for ICT-related Foreign Direct Investment   (FDI) with the potential to become a competitive regional ICT and business hub.     • To develop a highly competitive ICT-led value-added and export-orientated services sector   driven by a dynamic ICT services sub-sector and industry     • To develop a knowledge-based, technology-driven light modern industrial sector with a dynamic  export-led and globally competitive ICT sub-industry     • To modernize the agricultural sector to substantially improve agricultural value-added and yield   and develop a dynamic and vibrant export-oriented agro-business industry      The Broad Strategies for Achieving the ICT4AD Missions      To achieve the missions of the ICT4AD vision, the following broad strategies shall be pursued:    Strategy A:    To transform Ghana into an information and knowledge-driven ICT literate nation    Strategy B:    To promote the deployment and exploitation of information, knowledge and technology within the  economy and society as key drivers for socio-economic development    Strategy C:    To modernize Ghana’s educational system using ICTs to improve and expand access to education,  training and research resources and facilities, as well as to improve the quality of education and training  and make the educational system responsive to the needs and requirements of the economy and society  with specific reference to the development of the information and knowledge-based economy and society          23  Strategy D:    To improve the human resource development capacity and the research and development (R&D) capacity  of Ghana to meet the demands and requirements for developing the country’s information and  knowledge-based economy and society    Strategy E:    To promote the development of a globally competitive local ICT industry for the development,  production and the sale of information, knowledge, and technology products and services    Strategy F:    To aggressively develop, promote and enhance Ghana’s image as a competitive regional destination for  ICT foreign direct investment (FDI)    Strategy G:    To promote and facilitate the development of the private sector to serve as a key driver for the  development of the economy    Strategy H:    To modernize the civil and public service with the aim to improve its administrative efficiency,  effectiveness and service delivery through the implementation of electronic governance and government  initiatives set within the wider scope of the institutional engineering and renewal of the civil and public  service    Strategy I:    To modernize and expand Ghana’s information and communications infrastructure and services to  improve universal access and service as well as quality of service (QoS)    Strategy J:    To expand the physical infrastructure of Ghana, including those of power and transport.

As part of these efforts, the Government is committed to implementing within the provisions of the broad  strategies identified for achieving this mission ---- to within the next two to three decades or less  transform Ghana’s predominately agricultural economy and society into:      A high income economy dominated by trading in ICT products and services      An economy characterized by a large commercial services sector with a reasonably large and  vibrant, ICT services sub- sector and industry      An economy characterized by a technology-based knowledge-driven industrial sector      An economy with a globally competitive industrial and services sector which are to a large extent   driven by cutting-edge R&D encompassing basic and applied industrial and product development.      An economy based on a rich pool of highly skilled human resources in critical skill areas relevant  for developing and maintaining a competitive edge on the global market      An economy in which the majority of the working population are either directly or indirectly   involved in information and communications related activities       An economy with a modern, efficient and competitive agricultural sector      26     An economy characterized by a wide-spread deployment and exploitation of ICTs within the   society to support the delivery of health, education, government and social services      An economy characterized by a modern educational system within which ICTs are widely  deployed to facilitate the delivery of educational services at all levels of the educational system       An economy in which a reasonable large proportion of the population have access to information   and communications technology products and services      An economy in which the provision and delivery of goods and services of the key sectors of the  economy are to a large extent facilitated by information and communications technologies       An economy in which the provision and delivery of services by government and its administrative   machinery are to a large extent facilitated by  information and communications technologies      An economy based on an advanced and reliable national information and communications  infrastructure      An economy based on a literate society with a high proportion of computer literates.       Achieving a Multi-Sectorial ICT-led Socio Economic Development Policy Goals    In line with the goal to pursue a multi-sectorial development policy targeting key sectors of the economy as  stated in a number of Ghana’s socio-economic development policy frameworks including the Vision  2020, the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper and the Co-ordinated Programme for Economic and  Social Development of Ghana (2003-2012)    The Government is committed to, the establishment of a globally competitive, diversified and balanced  economy that is driven by information, knowledge and skills --- an economy with an ICT-intensive  modern  industrial sector; a modern, efficient and competitive agricultural sector; and a vibrant ICT- driven, valued added services sector capable of serving as the engine for accelerated economic growth  and development.    As part of this commitment, the Government will be implementing a multi-sectorial socio-economic  development policy with the following sectorial goals:    • Agricultural Sector Development Goal    To modernize the agricultural sector to improve its efficiency and productivity to ensure food security,  generate rural employment; contribute to economic growth and to improve the foreign exchange  generation capacity of the sector.    To aggressively promote and facilitate the development of a globally competitive agro-business industry  to support the development of a vibrant agricultural value-added industry capable of supporting the  development and modernization of the agricultural sector and its allied sub-sectors and industries.    To promote basic and cutting-edge agriculture-based research  and related R&D work to improve  agriculture yield of main crops and products, improve on agricultural processes and productivity and to      27  support the development of  marketable value-added agricultural products capable of competing on the  domestic, regional and the global market.    • Service Sector Development Goal    To develop a competitive high value-added services sector, to generate employment and serve as an  engine for accelerated development and economic growth with the potential to develop into a regional  business-services and ICT hub for the ECOWAS sub-region and beyond.    The Government is fully aware that Ghana’s domestic market is far too small and that for Ghana to grow  and accelerate its development process, it must export. The goal is to develop the services sector as a  business hub to produce and export its services into the sub-region and beyond is a key priority area of  the country’s socio-economic development programme    • Industrial Sector Development Goal    To develop a viable knowledge-based ICT production and development industry, a vibrant cottage  industry and a mass-consumer products light industry, capable of generating economic growth and  employment and producing goods for the domestic market and for export into the sub-regions and  beyond.    To increase the efficiency of the operations of the industrial sector to improve on the range of products  produced to enable the sector make an increasing contribution to export earnings and supply the domestic  market at competitive prices.    To encourage the conversion of agricultural commodities (especially perishable food items) into easily  storable products (existing and new products) as manufacturing sector’s contribution to stable food  prices, enhanced farm prices and farm revenues, and to national food security    The Goal to Develop Ghana’s ICT Sector and Use ICTs as a Broad-Based Enabler of   Development Goals     The Government as part of this Policy Statement is guided by the principle that if Ghana is to take full  advantage of the opportunities of the information age and develop a vibrant multi-sectorial information  and knowledge economy, it should not as a nation be just a consumer of ICT goods and services but also  a producer and developer of the technology.     The Government believes that development of a local ICT production industry and service sector is as  equally important as the deployment, exploitation and utilization of the technology to support the  activities of various sectors of the economy and society.    Ghana, as part of its ICT4AD programmes shall be pursuing a policy that lays emphasis on both ICT  Exploitation and Production involving: the utilization and exploitation of ICTs to support the delivery of  government services and the activities of various sectors of the economy as well as the production,  development and delivery of ICT products and services ---- i.e. towards the development and promotion  of an ICT industry and services sector.    These policy provisions will be implemented within five 4-year rolling plans over the next 20 years --- with the 1st, 2nd and 3rd plans laying emphasis on the exploitation and utilization of ICT products and      28  services to support the activities of various sectors of the economy and the 4th and the 5th plans laying  emphasis on the production, development and delivery of ICT products and services.     The Policy is also strategically focused on both the development of the local ICT industry targeted at the  export market as well as on using ICTs as an enabler of Ghana’s broad developmental goals. The  Government believes that: Ghana being an under-developed nation, will need to use ICTs as a broad  enabler of its socio-economic development process as well as implementing polices and programmes  targeted at the development of the ICT sector and industry. The policy recognizes that the spill-over or  catalytic effect of developing the ICT sector on the economy as a whole will not be enough to accelerate  Ghana’s socio-economic development process.      The Policy goal is to simultaneously focus on developing the ICT industry while at the same time using  ICTs to drive other sectors of the economy. This strategy it is hoped will accelerate Ghana’s development  and spread the social and economic impact of the development, deployment and exploitation of ICTs  much faster than a singular focus of the development of the ICT sector.        29                                 PART TWO              The 14 Pillars of the ICT4AD Policy      30                                         Page Deliberately Left Blank      31  CHAPTER FOUR     TTHHEE  1144  PPIILLLLAARRSS  OOFF  TTHHEE  IICCTT44AADD  PPOOLLIICCYY  ----  DDEEFFIINNIINNGG   TTHHEE  PPOOLLIICCYY  PPRRIIOORRIITTYY  AARREEAASS  AANNDD  FFOOCCUUSS         Policy Commitments and Measures to Facilitate the Process of  Transforming Ghana into a Predominately Information-rich and Knowledge-  based Society and Economy      To facilitate the process of transforming Ghana into a predominantly information-rich and knowledge- based society and economy, the following priority areas constituting the 14 pillars of the ICT4AD Policy  shall be targeted:     • Accelerated Human Resource Development    • Promoting ICTs in Education – The Deployment and Exploitation of ICTs in Education     • Facilitating Government Administration and Service Delivery – Promoting Electronic   Government and Governance     • Facilitating the Development of the Private Sector     • Developing an Export-Oriented ICT Products and Services Industry     • Modernization of Agriculture and the Development of  an Agro-Business Industry     • Developing a Globally Competitive Value-Added Services Sector --- A Regional Business  Service and ICT  Hub     • Deployment and Spread of  ICTs in the Community     • Promotion of National Health     • Rapid ICT and Enabling Physical Infrastructure Development     • Legal, Regulatory, and Institutional Framework  Provisions      • R&D, Scientific and Industrial Research Capacity Development     • Promoting Foreign and Local Direct Investment Drive in ICTs     • Facilitating National Security and Law and Order      32  ACCELERATED HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT      Policy Context    It is recognized that human resource is the key to developing and transforming Ghana from a  predominately subsistence agriculture base economy into a predominantly information and knowledge  based economy and society.  Ghana is however currently facing a human resource problem in technical  and managerial skill areas and more so in ICT skills. With only 8.6% of the economically active  population which are professional and technical people, with a lower percentage of 0.3% working as  managers and administrators it is apparent that, considerable resources and efforts will need to be invested  into accelerating the country’s human resource capacity if Ghana is to make any appreciable progress  towards the realization of the aspiration of the ICT4AD Vision.     Also given that the vast majority of qualified applicants do not have access to higher education, the  country is also facing an acute shortage of university and college places --- with less than 30% of  qualified applicants gaining admission to the nation’s universities and that this is having an adverse  impact on the development of the required critical human resources for facilitating the development of the  economy.      It is acknowledged that the extent to which Ghana will benefit from the advances and the opportunities of  the emerging information age will depend on how the country is capable of developing and harnessing its  human resources to initiate, support and maintain its socio-economic development towards an information  and knowledge economy.  The  availability of a diverse pool of technical and managerial skills and  professionals in  critical skills to design, implement, manage, and use ICT applications and services is  most crucial for supporting the development, deployment, exploitation and the application of ICTs for  economic and social development.     Specifically on ICT related skills, Ghana like most developing countries suffers from a huge shortfall in  critical ICT skills and expertise required for the development and support of ICT applications and systems  within the public and private sector. The ICT skill shortage has in fact been identified in a recent survey  as one of the factors inhibiting the growth of the ICT sector. Furthermore it is acknowledged that without  a sustained effort to train workers in key ICT skills, the limited availability of skilled ICT personnel may  place an upper limit on development and deployment of ICT within the economy and society.    For example, many user-organizations in Ghana have not been able to keep up with the rapid  technological developments. In some, there is a lack of expertise to digest new information about these  technologies and to integrate them into the existing operations of the organization with minimal  disruption. Most organizations in the public and private sector face problems in relation to providing  continuous training to the user-staff in the rapidly changing aspects of these technologies. This no doubt  makes it difficult for them to take full advantage of these technological advances.    Most ICT managers in both public and private sector organizations and establishments cannot keep up  with the rapid technological advances. Particular areas include integration of diverse technologies, use of  system-development tools, networking, telecommunications and standards. The economy therefore  requires a pool of this expertise to support the deployment and exploitation of the technologies and  systems within organizational set-ups and as well as support the development of the nation’s information  and communications economy and society.        33  On the whole, Ghana’s human resource base in key skill areas required for developing the nation’s  information economy and society need to be improved if the country is to achieve its goal of transforming  its agricultural based economy into an information-rich and knowledge-based economy.    Policy Statement    The Government acknowledges  that the young population of Ghana of close to 60% under the age of 25  years can be transformed into an asset by adding value to human resources and providing the  environment for utilizing these resources for socio-economic development process ----  and that ICTs  could play a major role in this area. The development of people to support the process of moving Ghana  into an information society and economy is therefore top priority of the Government and the crucial role  that ICTs can play in this area is fully recognized and shall be promoted by the Government.    As part of  the mission aimed at  producing the right types of skills and human resources required  for  developing and driving Ghana’s information and knowledge-based economy and society, the Government  is fully committed to putting in place and facilitating the implementation of a comprehensive human  resource development programme targeting critical skill areas across key sectors of the economy for  supporting the development of the Ghana information society and economy.    This policy commitment  will in addition contribute to addressing some of the other identified   developmental challenges facing Ghana, including:  the challenges of the low professional, technical and  managerial manpower base of the country; the challenges of the social and economic pressures of a  youthful population;   the challenges of  turning the youthful population into an asset for development, as  well as the challenges of the  relatively high proportion of population with no educational attainment.    Policy Objectives and Strategies     The Objectives    The broad objectives are:     • To improve the human resource development capacity and the research and development (R&D)  capacity of Ghana to meet the demands and requirements for developing Ghana’s information  and knowledge-based economy and society     • To develop the nation’s human resource needs in critical skill areas in all key sectors of the   economy     • To promote and facilitate  skill improvement and update within the public and private sector     • To harness and fully utilize the nation’s human resources     • To target the development of technical and managerial skills development as a priority area      • To develop  a pool of  knowledgeable ICT workforce in critical skill areas and professions that  will be able to contribute to the process of the development of  Ghana’s  information and  knowledge economy     • To improve the human resource development capacity of the nation’s universities and colleges          34       The Strategies       • Transform Ghana into an information and knowledge-driven ICT literate nation      • Modernize Ghana’s educational system using ICTs to: improve and expand access to  educational, training and research resources and facilities; improve the quality of education and  training and make the educational system responsive to the needs and requirements of the  economy and society with specific reference to the development of the information and  knowledge-based economy and society.     • Create the conditions for Government Ministries, Public Sector Organizations (PSO) and private   sector establishments to train and up-date the skills of their personnel through in-house training,  provision of regular refreshal courses, study and training leaves     • Promote basic training in ICTs skills in all schools and tertiary institutions     • Ensure the development of  a large pool of ICT professionals with wide range of state of-the-art   ICT skills to meet the manpower needs of the country.     • Encourage the private sector, particularly key industries, to establish comprehensive training  programmes for their own workforces, especially in new technologies     • Support and facilitate the training of women in key skills required by the information and   knowledge economy     • Encourage  life-long learning within the working population  to promote on the job training, skills  update, further and continuing education and learning within the public and private sector     • Ensure that all citizens who qualify to enter tertiary education in Ghana will benefit from such   education, irrespective of their socio-economic background    • Ensure the provision of support to increase access to technical, vocational education and training   to all categories of persons with disabilities and other vulnerable groups     • Encourage links between the education and training systems and the industry     • Ensure that traditional apprenticeship system is reformed and strengthened to improve  productivity in the informal sector     • Encourage internships, co-opts and work-study programmes in all levels within various   institutions.     • Enact laws that provide equal access to physically challenged and vulnerable groups to ICT  training and education.               35  • Ensure that training systems and mechanisms are developed to facilitate coordination and linkage  between different sectors of the economy including research institutions and industries     • Promote and enforce high standards in education, vocational training and life-long learning to   facilitate the development of a globally competitive quality and professional manpower  to  support the development of Ghana’s information and  knowledge-based economy and economy     • Promote  world-class  standards, to support nation-wide professional ICT skills accreditation     • Promote initiatives targeted at re-training and re-skilling of workers within the civil and public   services as well as workers in the private sector to provide them with requisite professional skills  and expertise to enable them fully and effectively participate in the development of the  information and knowledge economy.      Policy Measures, Instruments and Initiatives    Policy initiatives and measures shall be targeted at:     • developing the critical skill  human resource base of key sectors  of the economy    • building, upgrading and improving the capacity and  facilities and of the nation’s universities    polytechnics and research institutions to increase their  annual  intake of students and the output  of graduates  in key professional skill areas  such as engineering, computer science,  physical and  social science, business, finance and accountancy     • facilitating and supporting the development of the requisite pool of highly skilled human   resources; knowledge workers and expertise capable of facilitating the process of developing and  supporting a technology-based knowledge-driven industrial sector     • the development of comprehensive human resource base in critical skill areas required for   facilitating the development of a vibrant value-added services sector and ICT services industry     • facilitating an investment climate for the mobilization of financial and technological resources; as  well as promoting FDI specifically targeting attracting investments that have knowledge and  expertise transfer components     • facilitating and promoting the implementation of community-based ICT initiatives as well as   national ICT applications with human resource development components; including multipurpose  community telecenter projects; teleducation  and SchoolNet  projects; electronic government and  governance initiatives, telemedicine projects; and  e-commerce projects among others;     • initiatives to improve and upgrade computer skills and of civil and public servants through in-  service training and skill update  programmes;     • programmes and  initiatives  aimed at professional skill development in work places in public and  private sector institutions, through, in-service training, distance education and training and life- long learning.      36    The Key Implementation Agencies, Players and Stakeholders     • The Universities, Polytechnics, Colleges and Research Institutions  • The Secondary, Vocational, Technical and Training Schools and Institutions  • All Government Ministries and Public Sector Organizations  • Private Sector Businesses and Establishments  • Local and Foreign Educational and Training Provision Organizations  • The Civil Society and the Labour Union  • Professional Bodies         37     PROMOTING ICTs IN EDUCATION ---The Deployment and  Exploitation of ICTs in Education       Policy Context    Ghana has a high illiteracy rate of  close to 40% of the population  above the age of 6 years who have  never been to school with only about 3% of the population with tertiary level education. Based on the  current population growth rate of  2.5%, Ghana’s population will be about 38 million --- double the 2000  figure by 2028. The projected rate of growth of Ghana’s population is likely to give rise to a number of  socio-economic development challenges including those relating to: pressure on social expenditure in  areas like education.     In fact, Ghana’s, relatively young population of close to 60% of the population under the age of 25 years,  do have the potential to further  increase demand for educational places, which is currently limited at all  levels of the educational system. Currently the country is  experiencing a high primary school drop-out  rate and  very low secondary school enrolment rate. --- With close to 50% of junior secondary school  leavers failing to progress to senior secondary school; and a high proportion  of senior secondary school  leavers failing to continue their education. A recent survey also shows that the level of computer literacy  and awareness in the country is very low and this has been identified as one of the key factors limiting the  development of the ICT industry and sector.      It is acknowledged that for Ghana to make any appreciable progress in its socio-economic development  efforts, substantial resources will need to be directed at reducing the percentage of the population without  any educational attainment, widening access to education to the vast majority of the population and  increasing the percentage of the population with tertiary level education.    The key role that ICTs can play in widening access to education to a wider section of the population;  and  in literacy education and for facilitating  educational delivery and training at all levels has been  recognized.  The Government has acknowledged the need for ICT training and education in the schools,  colleges and universities, and to improve the educational system as a whole.    The Policy Statement    As part of the mission to: transform the educational system to provide the requisite educational, and  training services and environment capable of producing the right types of skills and human resources  required for developing and driving Ghana’s information and knowledge-based economy and society, the  Government is committed to a comprehensive programme of rapid deployment, utilization and  exploitation of ICTs within the educational system from primary school upwards.     Policy efforts shall be directed at using ICTs to facilitate education and learning within the educational  system and to promote e-learning and education as well as life-long learning within the population at  large.      As part of this policy commitment the Government shall put in place policy measures to strengthen  science education at all levels of the educational system and as well as promote technical and vocational  training with emphasis on the use of ICTs to facilitate the training and learning process.        38  This policy commitment shall in addition contribute to addressing some of the other identified  developmental challenges facing Ghana, including: the challenges of the social and economic pressures  of a youthful population; the challenges of turning the youthful population into an asset for development  as well as the challenges limited human resource capacity characterized by low professional, technical  and managerial manpower base of the country      Policy Objectives and

SERVICE DELIVERY --- Promoting Electronic Government and   Governance      Policy Context    The civil and public services play a key role in the socio-economic development process of Ghana.  And  the crucial role that ICTs can play in improving the efficiency of delivery of government services; in  reducing (in the long run) the operational cost of these institutions and in bringing government closer to  the people has been acknowledged.     The deployment, exploitation of ICTs to support the operations and activities of the civil and public  services has been recognized as key to the institutional renewal, re-engineering and the modernization of  the civil and public service.     It is however acknowledged that: the mere deployment of ICTs within public and private sector  organizations and institutions does not necessary translates into improvements in productivity, efficiency  and service delivery which collectively could impact on the overall developmental process of the country.   In other words, the deployment of ICTs within public institutions and business organizations and entities  will have little or no impact on the nation’s development process if not accompanied by a number of  organizational and  procedural changes as well as  changes in attitude to work and work ethics.     It is acknowledged that  for ICTs  to have a real appreciable impact on Ghana’s development there is a  need to address a number of critical success factors and conditions at the institutional and organizational  levels. ---Some of these include making changes in unproductive organizational systems, structures,  procedures and processes, as well as addressing poor attitudes to work and unproductive and inefficient  work ethics which could hinder the effective exploitation of these technologies to improve organizational  efficiency service/produce delivery, productivity and reduction in operational cost.     The Policy Statement    Acknowledging the crucial role that ICTs can play in the  delivery of Government services; bringing  government closer to the people; and  in facilitating the implementing of the Government’s  decentralization policy to support the activities regional and district administrative units, the Government  is committed to the deployment, exploitation of ICTs to support the operations and activities of the Civil  and Public Services as part its commitment to the  modernization of the civil and public service to  facilitate administrative cost reduction and the promotion of effectiveness and efficiency in the delivery  of government services to the people of Ghana.     The Government also recognizing that electronic government and governance initiatives have been  demonstrated in a number of countries as crucial for improving government service delivery to the public  and bringing government closer to the people is committed to putting in place and implementing a  comprehensive e-government and governance strategy for Ghana. In this connection the Government  shall be putting in place the necessary mechanisms to facilitate the development of this strategy soon after  the release of the Policy Document.    This policy commitment shall in addition contribute to addressing some of the other identified  developmental challenges facing Ghana, including: the challenges limited human resource capacity      42  characterized by low professional, technical and managerial manpower base of the country as well as the  challenges of the poor performance of the economy and those related to the   low job creation capacity of  the economy.     Policy Objectives and Strategies     The Objectives    • To reform the civil and public service to improve on its organizational systems, structures,   procedures and processes.     • To address the poor attitudes to work  and unproductive and inefficient work ethics which could  hinder the effective exploitation of ICTs to improve organizational efficiency service delivery,  productivity and reduction in operational cost within the civil and public service     • To improve the efficiency of the civil and  public service and ensure that it plays a more positive role   in economic and social development at all levels    • To facilitate the establishment of an efficient intra-and inter-departmental, inter-sectoral, national and   sub-national system of communication, for the necessary feed-back in policy formulation and  programme implementation, monitoring and review     • To modernize the operations of the civil and public service through the deployment of ICTs to  facilitate administrative cost reduction and its effectiveness and efficiency in the delivery of its  services to the public     • To facilitate the development and implementation a comprehensive e-government and governance  strategy for Ghana.     The Strategies     • Modernize the civil and public service with the aim to improve its administrative efficiency,   effectiveness and service delivery through the implementation of electronic governance and  government initiatives set within the wider scope of the institutional engineering and renewable of the  service     • Facilitate the delivery of  modernized public services in the area of  provision of government  information, social services, health services and educational services through the deployment and the  exploitation of information and communications technologies within the society and the economy     • Promote the  exploitation of information and communication technologies within the civil and public  service  to make public services more efficient, productive and accessible to the public at large     • Provide a  favourable environment for the provision of  electronic government and  electronic  business and commerce services     • Deploy ICTs to facilitate the provision of the necessary social and economic infrastructure required   for development        43  • Develop and promote standards, guidelines and procedures to facilitate the acquisition, installations  and maintenance of ICT equipments and systems within  Government Ministries and other Public  Sector institutions and establishments.     • Develop an e-government interoperability framework to facilitate cross-departmental operations of   ICT systems and services.    • Improve the human resource capability and capacity within the civil and public service through the   encouragement of further training and subsequent retention of skill sets via government sponsored  educational, training and skill update programmes     • Promote the deployment and the use of ICTs to facilitate universal access to public and  government  information and services to support the promotion of the principle and practice of good governance     • Promote the  exploitation of information and communication technologies within the civil and public   service to make public services more efficient, effective and productive and readily accessible to the  public at large     • Encourage information sharing, transparency and accountability and facilitate the process that will  lead to reduction in bureaucracy within and between organizations within the civil and public service.     Policy Measures, Instruments and Initiatives    To achieve the policy objective aim at facilitating Government administration and service delivery,  specific policy initiatives and measures shall be targeted at:    • initiatives targeted at organizational system renewal, within the civil and public service, aimed at   improvement on organizational structures, procedures and processes, as well addressing issues  relating to addressing poor attitudes to work  and unproductive and inefficient work ethics     • modernizing  the civil and public service to improve its efficiency, effectiveness and service delivery   through the deployment and exploitation of ICTs;    • initiatives to improve basic computer and professional  skills of civil and public servants through in-  service training and skill update programmes;    • the implementation of specific programmes to motivate civil and public servants to get involve in   ICTs to improve their productivity, efficiency and effectiveness    • the implementation of e-government initiatives including: government to government (G2G),   government to business (G2B) and government to citizens (G2C) types of e-government initiatives -- - The implementation of some of these initiatives at the local government and district administration  levels will form part of the village information and communications infrastructure (VICI) initiative  reflecting the implementation of e-government NICI programmes at the local and rural community level.     The Key Implementation Agencies, Players and Stakeholders     • All Government Ministries and Public Sector Organizations (PSOs)  • The Public Enterprise Commission  • The Labour Union      44     FACILITATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE   PRIVATE SECTOR       Policy Context    Ghana’s private sector is under-developed and dominated by the informal sector which is by far the  largest employment sector of the Ghanaian economy. – accounting for about 80% of the employed work  force, with the formal private sector accounting for only 7.8% of the employment of the economically  active population.  Given that close to 68% of employed population are self-employed with no employees  and only 5.2% of the employed population are self-employed with one or more employees, the job  creating potential and capacity of  the Ghanaian economy is extremely low.     Also given that new vacancies in the Government sector are declining on a yearly basis, and the fact that,  the majority of the self-employed, do not have the capacity to employ others --- prospects for job  opportunities for what is a relatively young population are very low.  The need to develop the private  sector as a whole and the formal sector in particular to serve as an engine for growth is imperative if  Ghana is to make headway in addressing a number of its key developmental challenges. The development  of the private sector as one of the strategies to improve the economy’s job creation capability is therefore  a priority area of Government’s overall socio-economic development programme    The Policy Statement    The Government recognizing the critical role that the private sector can play as a key partner in the  process of moving Ghana into an information and knowledge economy is  committed to promoting and  facilitating the role of the private sector in the development and participation in the Ghana information  society and economy.    As part of this commitment, the Government will create the  necessary enabling environment and put in  place the necessary policy programmes, and incentive packages to facilitate the role of the private sector  in the nation’s development.

The development of the services sector into a highly competitive value-added sector has been  identified as key to transforming Ghana’s economy into a high income economy with the potential to  create wealth and quality jobs.     It has been established that the inability of the local ICT sector to attract adequate capital through  domestic and foreign direct investment has been one of the main obstacles to the development of a  globally competitive local ICT industry and a valued-added services sector.     The Policy Statement    The Government acknowledges that ICTs can serve as the engine for developing the services sector of  the economy into a competitive regional business services and ICT hub to provide a world class ICT  services targeted ranges of off-shore, banking and financial services to business communities in the  region and beyond.  The Government is committed to putting in place the necessary policy measures and  provides to facilitate this process.    This policy commitment shall in addition contribute to addressing some of the other identified   developmental challenges facing Ghana, including: the challenges of the disproportionate informal  private sector; the challenges of the  low job creation capacity of the economy   as well as the challenges  of the narrow export base dominated by traditional exports       Policy Objectives and Strategies     The Objectives    • To transform Ghana into an attractive destination for ICT-related FDI with the potential to become a   competitive regional ICT and business hub.     • To develop a highly competitive ICT-led value-added and export-orientated services sector driven by  a dynamic ICT services sub-sector and industry     • To aggressively promote Ghana as an ideal destination for ICT related FDI within the sub-region.    • To promote international competitiveness and a secure a place for Ghana in the international   economic system    • To harness and fully utilize Ghana’s human, cultural and natural resources and effectively exploit her   favourable geographical position for the sustainable development of the economy      48    The Strategies     • Promote and facilitate the development of the private sector to serve as a key driver for the   development of the economy     • Take steps to address the constraints  that inhibit productivity  and growth in the services sector and  to ensure favourable conditions for innovation and ICT diffusion in this sector removing obstacles to  productivity and employment growth, including barriers to entry particularly for SMEs     • Promote improvements in the  quality of services and products within the services and industrial  sector     • Encourage technological innovations to support product development and service provision and  delivery      • Modernize the banking system and promote the use of financial market instruments in business   transactions and de-emphasize cash transactions.    • Promote and support electronic banking and financial services provision    • Promote the development of a globally competitive local ICT industry for the development,   production and the sale of information, knowledge, and technology products and services     • Encourage and facilitate the use of, open electronic marketplaces, secure e-business solutions,  electronic signatures, electronic public procurement and electronic payment systems to  support the  development of electronic commerce in the country     Policy Measures, Instruments and Initiatives    To achieve the policy objective of developing a globally competitive value-added services sector, specific  policy initiatives and measures  shall be targeted at:    • promoting the development of the services sector targeting in particular the development of the ICT   services sub-sector and industry;    • promoting the development of and the use of international standards, and best practices to guide the   production and the provisions of services within the economy;    • promoting and encouraging both domestic and foreign direct investment targeting the services sector   including the ICT service sub-sector;     The Key Implementation Agencies, Players and Stakeholders     • Ministry of Finance and Economic  Planning   • Ministry of Private Sector Development  • Ministry of Trade and Industry  • Small and Medium Scale Development Agencies  • Chamber of Commerce and Industry  • Private Sector Businesses and Establishments      49           DEVELOPING AN EXPORT-ORIENTED ICT PRODUCTS AND  SERVICES INDUSTRY       Policy Context    The Ghana ICT sector is under-developed, a recent study shows that the majority of the companies in this  sector are small-to-medium scale ICT companies and most of these are mainly involved in distributive  activities like retailing and the distribution of computer products and services, mainly computers and their  peripherals and standard application software and packages.     On the whole there is  very little activity in the area of the production and development of ICT products  for example assembly of computer hardware systems like personal computers. Apart from a handful of  companies, most of which are small-scale set-ups involve in local assembly on a limited scale, the  majority of companies retailing computer hardware import them as complete systems which they retail to  the public.    The majority of the applications software (mostly standard of-the-shelf products) on the Ghanaian market  are not developed locally. The Ghanaian software development industry is still under-developed with only  a couple of establishments involved in limited software development work; the majority of these are into  customizing applications for clients with very little done in the area of developing systems from the  scratch.   In exception of a number of accounting, banking and database applications where there is some  local software development efforts, the vast majority of Ghanaian companies involved in implementing  ICT systems used imported software as turnkey ‘off-the-shelf’ software or slightly customized systems.    On the whole, the majority of the ICT-related companies and service providers, trade in products and  services with very little local context. In otherwise the vast majority of the  companies locally trade in  ICT products and services that have far less than 100% local context.      A number of factors have been identified as inhibiting the growth of the local ICT industry. For example,  given that the majority of ICT products on the Ghanaian market are imported, with very little local  component; import duties and taxes on computer products and services are seen as having negative  impact on the expansion of the ICT sector, a major part of which is involve in retailing of ICTs products  and services. In fact, de-incentives like taxation and in particular import duties on computer products and  services  have been identified as a major factor inhibiting the growth of the Ghana ICT sector.    The growth of the ICT sector is also being inhibited by lack of infrastructure development in areas like  transport, telecommunications, and electricity. For example the lack of the electricity infrastructure in  some sections of the country has been identified as a bottleneck to the expansion of ICT-related services.     Also it is acknowledged that the development of Ghana’s information and knowledge economy will  require a vibrant ICT industry that focuses on export oriented ICT products development and the  provision of world-class services          50  The Policy Statement    As part of  the mission aimed at: developing a highly competitive ICT-led value-added and export- orientated services sector driven by a dynamic ICT services sub-sector and industry and to develop a  knowledge-based, technology-driven light modern industrial sector with a dynamic export-led and  globally competitive ICT sub-industry, the Government shall be promoting a number of  ICT production  initiatives targeted at developing the local ICT industry in areas like assembling of computers for the local  market and export; the development of a local industry for the repair and maintenance of ICT equipment;  the development of software for the domestic and export market; the  provision of ICT services to support  other sectors of the economy    This policy commitment shall in addition contribute to addressing some of the other identified   developmental challenges facing Ghana, including: the challenges of the disproportionate informal  private sector; the challenges of the  low job creation capacity of the economy, the challenges of the weak   scientific research base and under-developed research and development (R&D) capacity, as well as the  challenges of the narrow export base dominated by traditional exports       Policy Objectives and Strategies     The Objectives    • To promote and support the development of a local industry for the manufacture, assembly repair and   maintenance of computer and communication equipments and products     • To promote and facilitate the development of a world-class software development industry targeting  both the domestic and the export market     • To stimulate, promote and encourage innovation within the ICT industry and sector  as a basis for  promoting growth within the industry, provision of quality of services and the development of  advance and reliable communications infrastructure     • To transform the economy through rapid industrialization    • To maintain a favourable investment climate for investment in manufacturing and provide the   necessary economic infrastructure for industry    • To restructure the production base with a view to changing the sectoral composition of the economy    • To increase the efficiency of production and productivity in all sectors of the economy      The Strategies     • Promote and facilitate the development of the private sector to serve as a key driver for the  development of the economy     • Promote the development of a globally competitive local ICT industry for the development,   production and the sale of information, knowledge, and technology products and services        51  • Encourage the development of a secure  broadband information and communications  infrastructure to support the development and provision of world-class off-shore ICT services in  the areas like software development, financial services and other ICT services targeted at the  export market     • Promote, stimulate and support the development of innovative local content and applications in   the area of information and communications technologies to meet the needs and requirements of  the nation     • Stimulate growth of the local ICT industry through Government patronage of local ICT industry   products and services.     • Improve the environment in which enterprises, especially SMEs develop and grow, in particular  by increasing their access to information, support services and investment  capital and resources,  in particular those targeted at the ICT industry and services sector     • Promote the development of a broad engineering base, especially in the maintenance, repair and   fabrication of machinery and equipment     • Promote the development, adoption and enforcement of international standards within the ICT  industry to facilitate the development of a world-class and globally competitive local ICT  industry and services sector.     • Aggressively develop, promote and enhance Ghana’s image as a competitive regional destination   for ICT foreign direct investment (FDI)      Policy Measures, Instruments and Initiatives    Specific policy initiatives and measures  shall be targeted at:    • putting in place and implementing special tax packages, instruments, and incentive programmes and   mechanisms to promote the development of the local ICT production industry    • promoting the development of a globally competitive local ICT industry    • creating the necessary enabling regulatory framework for facilitating the deployment, exploitation   and the development of ICT products, services and systems within the economy and society    • promoting  the development of a globally competitive local ICT industry for the development,   production and the sale of information, knowledge, and technology products and services    • enacting the various legislations and laws that could promote the development of a vibrant and   modern industrial sector       The Key Implementation Agencies, Players and Stakeholders     • Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning       52  • Ministry of Private Sector Development  • Ministry of Trade and Industry  • Small and Medium Scale Development Agencies  • The Ghana Investment Promotion Center  • The Ghana Free Zones Board  • The Private Sector Foundation  • Chamber of Commerce and Industry  • Private Sector Businesses and Establishments            53     MODERNIZATION OF AGRICULTURE AND THE  DEVELOPMENT OF AN AGRO-BUSINESS INDUSTRY       Policy Context    Ghana’s agricultural sector the bedrock of the economy has been under-performing for a number of  years. The sector is predominantly subsistence agricultural based with very little mechanization or the  application of modern agricultural production methods or practices.     Ghana which currently depend on cocoa for most of its export earnings lost its position as the World  leading producer of cocoa to Cote d’Ivoire and now competes with Indonesia for the second position,  producing on average 390 metric tons per year compared to Cote d’Ivoire annual average output of 1200  metric tons. The country’s  annual agricultural yield in cocoa --- its major agricultural output is low in  comparison with its neighbours. --- Ghana annual average agricultural yield in cocoa based on Year 2000  figures is only 2.5 (‘000 of hectogram per hectare) compared that of Cote d’Ivoire estimated at 5.6 and  that of Nigeria at 4.2; Cameroon at 3.1 and Sierra Leone at 3.5.    Also a recent study shows that the Ghanaian economy has not experience a major structural  transformation since independence. ---The  majority of the working population (60%) are still actively  involve in agriculture with only 13% working in the industrial sector and  28% in the service sector of the  economy    The Policy Statement    As part of  the mission to: modernize the agricultural sector to substantially improve agricultural value- added and yield and develop a dynamic and vibrant export-oriented agro-business industry, the  Government is committed to putting in place the necessary policy measures and mechanism to facilitate  this process.    This policy commitment shall in addition contribute to addressing some of the other identified   developmental challenges facing Ghana, including: the challenges of the poor performance of the  economy and the disproportionate informal private sector; the challenges of the  low job creation  capacity of the economy  as well as the challenges of the narrow export base dominated by traditional  exports.

Policy Measures, Instruments and Initiatives    To achieve the policy objective modernizing the agriculture sector and developing an agro-business  industry the Government  is committed to implementing policy initiatives and measures targeted at:    • improving the mechanization of the agriculture production process as well as improving irrigation   capacity and the use of  fertilizers  to improve productivity and yield per hectare     • special agriculture development policy instruments, and incentive programmes including special   budgetary packages and investment incentives  to promote the development of the agriculture sector;    • promoting and facilitating the development of the  physical and social infrastructure --- targeting  the   rural areas to support the development of agriculture sector;       The Key Implementation Agencies, Players and Stakeholders     • Ministry of Food and Agriculture  • Ministry of Private Sector Development  • The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research  • Small and Medium Scale Development Agencies  • Chamber of Commerce and Industry  • Private Sector Businesses and Establishments           57     DEPLOYMENT AND SPREAD OF ICTS IN THE COMMUNITY      Policy Context    As part of the strategy to facilitate the deployment and exploitation of ICTs in the society and economy,  special efforts will need to be directed at promoting the use of these technologies in rural, urban and  underserved communities. It is acknowledged that the development of Ghana’s information society will  depend on the level and the spread of access to these technologies, and their resources, services and  applications.     Also it is recognized that although ICTs could advance Ghana’s socio-economic development, the  benefits of that development may not necessarily spread to all sections of the society. -- There is therefore  a need for specific efforts to be made in terms of policies and special initiatives aimed at ensuring and  enhancing the possible distributive effects of the developmental impacts of these technologies to the  community at large. Steps will need to be taken to put in place special ICT initiatives to directly address  poverty reduction within targeted communities and sections within the society and taking corrective  measures to mitigate and address specific income distributive issues arising from the developmental  impacts of the deployment and exploitation of ICTs within the economy and society.    It is further acknowledged that although rural ICT deployment  and exploitation initiatives can be   successful and can have impact of the social  and economic outcomes of rural people, most of these  initiatives cannot have an appreciable impact on accelerating the socio-economic development process of  rural communities and beyond if their success are not replicable and/or scalable.    The Policy Statement    The Government acknowledging that Ghana’s entry into the information age will require rapid extension  of access to ICTs to all sections of the community.  --- To reach out to, and benefit, the majority of the  population in for instance health, education and e-commerce, and as such is committed to taking special  policy measures to extend ICT applications, services and access to the wider community including those  in the  rural areas where many of the most disadvantaged and remote communities are.     As part of this commitment the Government will:     • Implement a number of community-based initiatives within the rolling (NICI) plans that will be  developed to implement the provisions of the ICT4AD Policy.      • Put in place measures to develop and implement village information and communications   infrastructure (VICI) initiatives targeting the implementing of NICI programmes at the local  government and district administration levels.     • Commit to putting in place specific ICT policy measures and initiatives targeted at the   disadvantaged sections of the Ghanaian population including the visually, mentally and  physically impaired and disadvantaged.      • Put in place a mechanism to ensure the participation of women in developing the information   society and to ensure that information and communication policies at all levels are engendered,  and geared toward meeting specific developmental needs of women.      58  • Commit to building the capacity of the national machinery responsible for women and children,  to encourage more participation of women and children in ICT initiatives and industry by  addressing gender based inequalities and instituting gender-sensitive policies.     This policy commitment shall in addition contribute to addressing some of the other identified   developmental challenges facing Ghana, including: the challenges of the social and economic pressures  of a youthful population; the challenges of  turning the youthful population into an asset for development,  the challenges of the poor performance of the economy as well as the challenges of the relatively high  proportion of the population with no educational attainment, the high school drop-out rate and limited  access to higher education by the vast majority of the population especially girls and women.      Policy Objectives and Strategies     The Objectives    •  To speed-up the process of the deployment and exploitation of ICTs within all communities      • To promote equal and universal access to information and communications technologies services and   resources to all communities, and within this context, policy directives shall be put in place to ensure  and facilitate equal access for women, the disadvantaged, the disabled, and  rural and under-served  communities     • To improve public access to information and services to facilitate business and administrative   processes to increase productivity and facilitate economic growth.     • To encourage and speed up the process of  the diffusion of  information and communication  technologies within the society and economy     • To diversify and improve the quality of information; increasing  accessibility to ranges of information   resources within and outside the country and creating a supportive environment for the development  of the  mass media and the private press through the deployment and exploitation of ICTs.     • To assist in achieving the targets of the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy      The Strategies     • Encourage and promote the widespread access to  information and communications technologies   services and applications within the economy and society     • Speed up the process of  the provision of e-government, e-health, e-learning, e-commerce services  within the country     • Promote initiatives targeted at facilitating the process diffusion of  ICTs within the communities in  the rural and under-served and under-resourced areas     • Ensure and enhance the possible distributive effects of the developmental impacts of the deployment   and exploitation of ICTs within the society.        59  • Encourage public and private partnerships  (PPPs) to facilitate the roll-out of community-based ICT  initiatives     • Support the strategic use of ICTs to strengthen women’s networking initiatives and community –  based activities that defend and protect the rights of women to participate equally in civil and public  life     • Include ICTs in the drive to reduce illiteracy both as a tool and a part of the curriculum for functional   literacy programmes    • Deploy  ICTs to support activities and programmes aimed at improving the quality of health of the   citizenry      Policy Measures, Instruments and Initiatives    To achieve the policy objective to promote the deployment and exploitation of ICTs within the  community, special policy initiatives and measures shall be targeted at:    • implementing community-based  national ICT programmes and initiatives including telemedicine,   multi-purpose community telecenters,  teleducation and schoolnets initiatives     • promoting the implementation of e-government initiatives including: government to government  (G2G), government to business (G2B) and government to citizens (G2C) types of  e-government  initiatives     • promoting initiatives aimed at the strengthening of Ghana’s democratic institutions and good   governance through ICTs    • community-based village information and communications infrastructure (VICI) initiatives reflecting   NICI programmes and initiatives at the local community-level.    • special ICT initiatives targeted at the disadvantaged communities and sections of the Ghanaian   society, including the underserved communities and the physically and mentally challenged      The Key Implementation Agencies, Players and Stakeholders     • All Government Ministries and Public Sector Organizations  • Private Sector Businesses and Establishments  • International and Donor Agencies  • Local and International NGOs  • The Civil Society and the Labour Union           60  PROMOTION OF NATIONAL HEALTH      Policy Context    Information and communications technologies are increasingly been deployed to facilitate the delivery of  health services in a number of countries.  These technologies are providing a number of opportunities to  facilitate the modernization of the operations of the health delivery system in Ghana to improve access to  the nation’s limited health facilities and resources and to provide access to health information and other  services to a wider section of the community.      Key areas of possible applications include: the implementation of telemedicine systems; the development  of health information and management systems; the deployment of ICTs to facilitate the spread of health  and medical services to rural and under-served areas; the use of ICTs to support medical education and  training among others.    Specifically in the area of public health information, it is acknowledged that ICTs can be used to facilitate  the collection, analysis and the dissemination of information to support health education and awareness  creation as well as for supporting decision making related to health and population-wide issues.       Policy Statement    The Government is committed to implementing a number of initiatives aimed at facilitating the  widespread deployment and utilization of ICTs to support the activities and the operations of the health  delivery system throughout the country. Specific initiatives will include implementing a national  telemedicine programme to support nation-wide health service delivery including rural and community- based health services as well as to support community-based continuing medical education of health  professionals.     The Government as part of this commitment shall invest in ICT based healthcare systems to ensure that  Ghanaians have access to appropriate healthcare delivery. This will include networking healthcare  institutions to collate information, share data and communicate online, establishing internet connectivity  and access to healthcare professionals, and making ICT skills acquisition mandatory for all healthcare  professional.        Policy Objectives and Strategies     Objectives     • To improve the health status of the population while focusing efforts on reducing inequalities in  health.       • To  promote the implementation of telemedicine applications within the Health Delivery System    • To integrate and deploy ICTs in health program delivery with targets for health education,   training and preventive detection.         61  • To support the dissemination of preventive information for the general public, and in particular  for HIV/AIDS.      • To utilize  ICTs  as a tool for collecting community information; linking health care professionals   and enhancing health administration, remote diagnostics, and distribution of medical supplies.    • To increase geographical, financial and socio-cultural access to health services    • To improve quality of health delivery, improving health-worker-performance and responsiveness   to client needs    • To improve the efficiency of health service delivery, improving cost effectiveness and planning,   management and administration.         Strategies    • Network all healthcare institutions to collate information, share data and communication online.    • Restructure the healthcare system by providing a national databank to support on-line national   healthcare information, administration and management at primary, regional and tertiary levels.    • Establish full internet connectivity and access for healthcare professionals at all levels (primary,   regional and tertiary).    • Make ICT skills acquisition mandatory for all healthcare professionals     • Utilize ICTs for the establishment of Health Management Information Systems across primary,   regional and tertiary healthcare systems.    • Use ICTs to provide education and to combat major national health threats such as HIV/AIDS,   malaria, etc and as an enabler for the provision of the proposed National Health Insurance driven  health service.

In fact evidence points to the fact that telecommunications and communications  infrastructure deployment and usage is a necessary precondition for sustained economic growth in Ghana.  There is no doubt that development of a nation’s communication infrastructure will be essential for  speeding up the process of the deployment and exploitation of ICTs within the society and economy.     On the whole, Ghana’s physical, telecommunications and communications infrastructure is currently  under-underdeveloped and limited in coverage.  It is acknowledged that special policy measures and  initiatives will need to be aimed at developing the communications infrastructure to improve universal  access and service  ---- And that this policy measures  will need to be directed at creating the necessary  legal, regulatory and institutional enabling environment to facilitate the development of the  telecommunications and communications infrastructure to improve the coverage of the network and its  services.       The Policy Statement    The Government is committed to facilitating the rapid development, upgrade, improvement and  deployment of the necessary infrastructure in all key areas.  And as part of this policy commitment,  specific policy measures shall be put in place to facilitate the creation of the necessary legal, regulatory  and institutional enabling environment to support the development of the nation’s physical and  communications infrastructure.    The Government is also committed to improving communication facilities and to diversifying the means  of access through the utilization of appropriate telecommunications systems. And as part of this strategy  shall be facilitating increasing access to telecommunication facilities; and the rehabilitation and  strengthening of telecommunication and communication facilities as well as the necessary physical  infrastructure    This policy commitment shall in addition contribute to addressing some of the other identified  developmental challenges facing Ghana, including: the challenges of the under-developed and under- performing private sector; the challenges of the limited human resource capacity characterized by low  professional, technical and managerial manpower base; as well as the challenges of the weak scientific  research base and under-developed R&D capacity of the country.                63  Policy Objectives and Strategies     The Objectives    • To promote and facilitate initiatives targeted at the development of a reliable, fast adaptive and robust   national ICT backbone and infrastructure     • To facilitate and encourage the development of the nation’s physical infrastructure     • To promote competition in the communications industry to increase customer choice and promote   the provision of affordable services within the communications industry     • To promote the development and the use of a world-class information and communications  infrastructure for the country     • To ensure that as far as possible development is not constrained by inadequate transport,   communications and energy      The Strategies     • Modernize and expand Ghana’s information and communications infrastructure and services to   improve universal access and quality of service (QoS)     • Expand the physical infrastructure of Ghana, including those of power and transport.    • Promote the development, and deployment of basic and broadband and multi-platform   communications infrastructure  to facilitate public access to information and services    • Put in place special ICT promotion packages, policy instruments and incentives to facilitate the   expansion of the information and communications infrastructure    • Employ science and technology in ensuring the supply of sustainable, affordable, safe and reliable   energy    • Develop human resources to support the deployment and rehabilitation of modern and state-of-the-art   ICT infrastructure    • Promote R&D programmes relating to alternate energy sources such as solar energy, biomass,   nuclear, wind and other renewable energy sources to supplement the current traditional energy  sources       Policy Measures, Instruments and Initiatives    Specific policy initiatives and measures shall be targeted at:    • developing  the necessary legal, institutional and regulatory framework and structures required for   supporting the development of the communications infrastructure        64  • developing the necessary highly skilled ICT human resources required for supporting the  development and maintenance of an advanced information and communications infrastructure and  systems     • promoting international standards, and  best practices that could among other things aid the process   of the development of an advanced and reliable information and communication infrastructure and  the improvements in quality of service (QoS) within the local communication services sector     • promoting and facilitating the development of the private sector to generate enough demand for   advanced and reliable information and communication services    • the creation of conditions for an investor friendly telecommunications environment; including those   targeting the liberalization of the ICT sector and encouragement of private investment in the ICT  sector      • the development of the local communications industry towards competitiveness    • promoting and facilitating  a stable and competitive investment climate to attract both domestic and   foreign direct investment    • promoting and facilitating the development of the  physical and social infrastructure --- targeting  the   rural areas       The Key Implementation Agencies, Players and Stakeholders     • Ministry of Roads and Highway  • Ministry of Communications and Technology  • Ministry of Energy  • Telecom Operators and Backbone Infrastructure Providers         65     R&D, SCIENTIFIC AND INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH CAPACITY  DEVELOPMENT       Policy Context    The important role that industrial and scientific  research as well as research and development  (R&D) can  play in developing a nation’s capacity and capabilities to develop advanced products and services industry  and sector to facilitate its development process  has been acknowledged. For most countries, investments  in R&D have been identified as a precondition for a sustained socio-economic development.     In both the  developed and developing nation’s the driving force behind the development of high-tech  industries and services targeted at the export market has been huge investments in R&D efforts. In fact,  various studies have established a link between economic development and the level of investments in  R&D as well as basic and applied scientific and industrial research. For example, evidence drawn from a  number of countries, has established a strong link between the number of scientists and engineers involve  in R&D (per million persons) and the high tech exports (in million dollars) of countries.    It is acknowledged that Ghana’s research and development capacity (R&D) is limited and evidence shows  that very little R&D work is being undertaken in industry and in the nation’s universities and research  institutions. Most of these institutions lack the necessary capacity to conduct and engage in advanced and  cutting-edge R&D work required for supporting the development of a globally competitive information,  knowledge-based and high-tech export industry and services sector. In fact, evidence shows that less than  5% of the Ghana’s scientists and engineers in the universities, colleges and industries are involved in  R&D.     Also it has been established that linkages between industry and research institutions and universities to  facilitate collaborative research and R&D work is rare. In the few cases where some R&D work is being  undertaken in the nation’s universities and research institutions, they are not linked to industry. In other  words, the required  linkage between industry and the research institutions, that is necessary to  commercially drive R&D work and its outputs is virtually non-existent in Ghana.        The Policy Statement    The Government acknowledges that if Ghana is to make any progress in developing a high-tech export  industry, a lot of efforts will need to be directed at investing more in R&D and developing the nation’s  scientific and industrial research and R&D base devoting particular attention to establishing linkages  between industry and the research institutions and universities involved in R&D. As part of these efforts  the need to increase the number of scientists and engineers involve in R&D work both in industry and in  the universities and research institutes is also recognized.     The Government is committed to promoting and supporting R&D initiatives in industry, research  institutes and  universities to enhance Ghana’s capacity to develop, produce, manufacture and assembly  ICT products and services as a step towards developing a globally competitive ICT service sector and  industry. As part of this commitment Government shall promote partnership, collaborations and linkages  between local R&D Institutions and foreign Centers of Excellence to speed up the process of knowledge  and know-how transfer to Ghanaians.      66    This policy commitment shall in addition contribute to addressing some of the other identified   developmental challenges facing Ghana, including: the challenges of the  weak  scientific research base  and under-developed research and development (R&D) capacity; the challenges of the limited human  resource capacity characterized by low professional, technical and managerial manpower base; the  challenges of the disproportionate informal private sector; the challenges of the under-developed  and  under-performing private sector;  the challenges of the  low job creation capacity of the economy   as  well as the challenges of the narrow export base dominated by traditional exports        Policy Objectives and Strategies     The Objectives     • To support and strengthen scientific research and R&D within the nation’s universities and  research institutions as a basis for promoting the development of a globally competitive local ICT  sector and industry.     • To promote and encourage industrial based R&D to facilitate innovation and product   development and service improvement and advancement     • To develop world-class service sector and industry through the promotion of advanced R&D  within the economy     • To enhance industrial technology development infrastructure      • To promote and facilitate R&D work targeting recyclable materials technologies and application   to minimize industrial waste in the environment      The Strategies        • Improve the research and development (R&D) capacity of Ghana to meet the demands and  requirements for developing Ghana’s information and knowledge-based economy and society     • Promote agricultural research as well as cutting-edge agriculture-based R&D  targeting the   development of a modernize and competitive agriculture sector     • Encourage R&D activities aimed at the development of  tools, equipment and machinery for  industries and encourage quality assurance in manufacturing     • Support biomedical research and improvement in the general health delivery system and promote   and support research into plant medicine to complement allopathic medicine     • Facilitate capacity building in all science and technology areas, which hold promise for enhanced  national development, including engineering design and industrial technology systems     • Promote knowledge acquisition and development of technologies in the new and emerging   sciences of biotechnology, materials science, microelectronics and laser technology      67         • Encourage and fund ICT R&D in the nation’s universities and research institutes     • Create incentives for industries to set up ICT-related R&D centers in the universities and research  institutes through faculty chairs, matching grants and focused joint projects.     • Institute mechanisms for soliciting ICT research projects that will be made open to both research   institutes and universities to facilitate the selection of good and innovative projects for national  development.     • Fund vacation and  sabbatical visits of expatriate ICT experts and researchers to facilitate the   process of knowledge and expertise transfer and sharing through collaboration with local  counterparts      • Establish ICT R&D institutions with unique and clear mandates and encouraging industries and   organizations to establish similar institutions     • Setup up national level institutional framework and structures for taking process development at  academic institutions and R&D laboratories closer to industrial acceptance.     • Provide incentives to local R&D institutions to enter into collaborative research with foreign   universities as well as with local companies and multinationals.     • Facilitate the acquisition, adaptation and dissemination of new developments in ICTs.     • Facilitate the transfer of technology and collaboration on R&D between local Centers of  Excellence and international R&D centers.

The rapid changes and  developments within the communications sector brought about mainly by the advances in technologies  and services has made it necessary  for countries  to create and operate a dynamic legal and regulatory  framework  that  is  responsive to technological changes and advances.     Also given that most nation’s legal and regulatory framework most often lags behind technological  developments and advances, it is imperative that countries operate in a dynamic and responsive legal and  regulatory environment that takes advantage of these technological advances, promote innovation  and  enhances consumer choice and preferences.    It is acknowledged that Ghana’s existing legal and regulatory framework for supporting the development  of the communications sector was primarily designed to manage the transition from monopoly to  competition and was therefore focused on the creation of a competitive market and the rights of new  entrants.  The Government recognizes the need to periodically review the operations, provisions and the  directives making up the legal regulatory framework in the light of rapid developments in the  communications industry, characterized by technological advances evolutions  and  the resultant  changes  in user demand, and choices and preferences.     It is also acknowledged that rapid changes and developments in the communications industry and sector  that has given rise to convergence between communications, telecommunications, broadcasting and  information technologies, service, platforms and systems,  need to be reflected in the country’s legal and  regulatory regime and framework aimed at supporting and facilitating the development of the ICT  industry and sector.    It is recognized that with such foreseen and anticipated changes in the communications industry, Ghana’s  legal and regulatory policy framework for guiding the development of the ICT industry will need to take  account of these developments in particular     The goal is to as far as possible create a flexible and dynamic legal and regulatory framework and system  that  restrict regulation to the necessary minimum, reinforce competition within the industry and sector,  while ensuring that the basic rights, choices and preference of consumers continue to be protected, and the  principle of universal access and service reinforced.     The Policy Statement    The Government acknowledges that the development and the exploitation of ICTs in the economy and  society  as well as the development of the information and knowledge economy will need to be supported  and facilitated by appropriate legal provisions and legislation; regulatory framework and provisions as  well as institutional structures.       69    The Government is therefore committed to promoting and implementing a communications sector legal  and regulatory framework that is open and transparent in the development and application of  its rules,  regulations, directives and provisions; caters for and promote competition and innovation; exhibits the  characteristics of clarity in terms of its directives and laws: predictability in that its directives and laws  must lead to predictable results, outcomes and consequences for business decisions and relevance in that  its directives and laws reflects the pertinent subject matters and issues of the ICT sector and industry.    As part of this commitment, specific policy measures shall be taken to facilitate universal service and  access to basic and value added telecommunications services; the creation of conditions for an investor  friendly communications environment; the development of the communications industry towards  competition, while taking steps to facilitate the active involvement of local companies in the industry and  as well as promoting liberalization of the sector  and  private sector  investment in the ICT sector.    The Government also acknowledges that the deployment, exploitation and the development of ICTs in  Ghana will need to be guided by appropriate standards, best practices and guidelines. The Government is  therefore committed to facilitating this process.     The Government is also committed to the enactment of the necessary cyber laws and legislative  provisions to govern and regulate cyber-related activities within the country. Legislation to promote and  facilitate electronic commerce and other Internet-related activities in the country shall be enacted in  addition to facilitating the enactment of laws relating to: intellectual property rights; data protection and  security, freedom of access to information; computer and cyber crime and other cyber-laws, necessary for  facilitating their country’s participation in the information age and economy.     This policy commitment shall in addition contribute to addressing some of the other identified  developmental challenges facing Ghana, including: the challenges of the disproportionate informal  private sector; the challenges of the low job creation capacity of the economy   as well as the challenges  of the narrow export base dominated by traditional exports and the challenges of the weak scientific  research base and under-developed research and development (R&D) capacity.

Capital investment initiatives and  investments with R&D component as well as human resource development components in the area of ICT  skills and other information economy related skills to aid Ghana’s socio-economic development process  will also be encouraged and facilitated.    This policy commitment shall in addition contribute to addressing some of the other identified  developmental challenges facing Ghana, including: the challenges of the disproportionate informal  private sector; the challenges of the low job creation capacity of the economy, the challenges of the weak  scientific research base and under-developed research and development (R&D) capacity as well as the  challenges of the narrow export base dominated by traditional exports         73    Policy Objectives and Strategies       The Objectives     • To facilitate the mobilization of the requisite financial, technological and other resources required  for supporting the implementation of various policy initiatives with resource mobilization  implications     • To promote and facilitate domestic and foreign private sector  investments in ICT Infrastructure   development    • To support and facilitate the mobilization of private sector funding to support community-based   ICT initiatives and projects     • To facilitate the mobilization of private sector funding for human resource development capacity  building in key sectors of the economy     • To promote FDI with R&D, knowledge transfer and joint partnership components       The Strategies      • Promote local and foreign direct investments in the development of communication infrastructure     • Encourage and facilitate the domestic and foreign  private sector to invest in the development of  the national information and communication infrastructure     • Facilitate an investment climate for the mobilization of financial and technological resources; as   well as promoting FDI specifically targeting attracting investments that have knowledge and  expertise transfer components     • Use the financial system as an effective instrument for mobilizing capital for development     • Encourage the private sector to support funding for R&D activities, especially to cater for the   needs of the small, micro, and medium enterprises (SMMEs) which can be nurtured to become  the cutting edge for the commercialization of novel products or processes     • Transform Ghana into an attractive destination for ICT-related FDI with the potential to become a   competitive regional ICT and business hub.     • Develop a highly competitive ICT-led value-added and export-orientated services sector driven   by a dynamic ICT services sub-sector and industry     • Develop a knowledge-based, technology-driven light modern industrial sector with a dynamic  export-led and globally competitive ICT sub-industry         74    Policy Measures, Instruments and Initiatives    To achieve the policy objective to promote and facilitate an accelerated human resource development  policy initiatives and measures shall be targeted at:    • promoting and encouraging both domestic and foreign direct investment targeting the services sector   including the ICT service sub-sector    • implementing budgetary and tax incentive programmes and packages aimed at encouraging private   sector organizations to invest in human resource development and community-based ICT initiatives       The Key Implementation Agencies, Players and Stakeholders     • The Ghana Investment Promotion Center  • The Ghana Free Zone Board  • The Export Promotion Council  • Ministry of Trade and Industry  • Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning  • Private Sector Businesses and Establishments  • The Labour Union           75      FACILITATING NATIONAL SECURITY AND LAW AND ORDER       Policy Context    The deployment, exploitation and utilization of ICTs within the economy and society raises a number of  security and  privacy and consumer protection issues that need to be address as part of the efforts to  facilitate the socio-economic development process of the country. Some of these security concerns have  national security and law and order implications while others relate to the protection of individuals and  organizations from unlawful acts using the technology. Specific examples include cyber-crimes which  have national security implications, unlawful access to critical information, computer and  communications networks and resources; electronic frauds targeted mainly at the banks and the financial  sector among others.    In most countries, security of networks and communications has been identified as a major area of  concern for the development of the digital economy. Networks and information systems are now  supporting services and carrying data and information of great value to governments business and  individuals. The transmission of sensitive and critical information through local and global electronic  messaging networks involves an element of security risk to governments, organizations and business  establishments.     Increased protection of the networks and information systems is therefore necessary to guide against  various types of attacks and unauthorized access. Also the growth of attacks and fraud conducted on  electronic messaging and communications networks and system in the recent years threatens to  undermine consumers’ confidence in online services, electronic commerce and the effective functioning  of electronic markets and government systems.    The Government acknowledges the need for a policy statement on how these security issues can be  addressed within the broad policy framework aimed at the development of Ghana’s information and  knowledge-based society and economy.    The Policy Statement    The Government is committed to putting in place policy measures and mechanisms to address national  security and law and order issues relating to the deployment exploitation and the utilization of ICTs  within the economy and society. As part of this commitment, policy directives shall be put in place to  address security issues relating to   privacy, data and consumer protection as well as those relating to the  security of computer networks and information systems and their information and data contents.    Specific attention shall be devoted to addressing national security issues relating to protection of  government computer networks and information systems against various types of attacks on their  availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality.     Policy mechanisms, and measures shall also be put in place aimed at the protection of the Ghanaian  public from undesirable impacts of the digital age and economy in general and in particular those relating  to the Internet including the spread of pornographic materials, cyber-crimes and digital frauds. Also to be  targeted are national security and law and order implications of the Internet as well as issues relating to      76  aspects of the Internet that can potentially damage or corrupt Ghana’s cultural heritage, national image  and national identity.    The Government as part of its policy commitment to addressing national security and law and order  through the deployment and exploitation of ICTs will:     • Use ICTs as an essential tool for combating contemporary and emerging security threats and  challenges.     • Implement ICT applications and services to enhance command and control activities within the   Security Agencies and aid in their interaction with the general populace.      • Research and implement solutions that will enable interaction between the Security Agencies and  the populace and to facilitate and augment the resources available to these Agencies in the  following areas; informing citizens and government; the pursuit and tracking of criminals and  other criminal activities; and the management of the operations of these agencies to improve  efficiency      • Facilitate the deployment of the required infrastructure for advancement of ICTs and related   services within the Police force and the Military service.     • Implement training standards for members of the security forces to be carried out by current  members of the forces and as part of the training regime for entry into those forces.     • In consultation with the Office of the Attorney General ensure that the legal framework necessary   for the security forces to deploy and use ICTs in carrying out their duties are drafted and enacted.     • Explore the use of ICTs by the Security Agencies to enable collaboration with similar external  bodies in the delivery of their duties.

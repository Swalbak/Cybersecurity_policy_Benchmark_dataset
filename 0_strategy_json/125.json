Data and our ability to process data at the ready are differentiators to ensure mission success. Cloud is a fundamental component of the global infrastructure that will empower the warfighter with data and is critical to maintaining our military' s technological advantage. The DoD Cloud Strategy reasserts our commitment to cloud and the need to view cloud initiatives from an enterprise perspective for more effective adoption. It recognizes our experience over the past five years and identifies seven strategic objectives along with guiding principles to set a path forward. It emphasizes mission and tactical edge needs along with the requirement to prepare for artificial intelligence while accounting for protection and efficiencies. The strategy drives implementation toward the enterprise cloud environment, an ecosystem composed of a General Purpose and Fit For Purpose clouds. It focuses implementation activities on two fundamental types of work: first is the stand up of cloud platforms ready to receive data and applications, and second is the ongoing work to migrate existing applications and to develop new applications in the cloud. This effort is a Department priority. As we execute this strategy, we will continue to seek the active participation and commitment of all DoD Components to realize the benefits ofcloud as we operate on the 21st century battlefield.

The Department of Defense (DoD) has multiple disjointed and stove-piped information systems distributed across modem and legacy infrastructure around the globe leading to a litany ofproblems that impact warfighters', decision makers', and DoD staffs ability to organize, analyze, secure, scale, and ultimately, capitalize on critical information to make timely, data-driven decisions. Today, the Department is largely constrained by physical resources, manpower limitations, organic skillsets and, oftentimes, laborious contracting processes to procure or grow storage and computing capabilities. In addition, the cyberspace domain continues to be an increasingly contested environment. In order for the U.S. to keep its strategic advantage, warfighters and the force that support them need to be provided with the proper capabilities and technologies to succeed. To this end, commercial industry has made significant strides in addressing these challenges that the Department can leverage. Commercial cloud computing is a subscription-based service that provides network-based storage and compute resources. It allows users to store and access data and programs over the Internet rather than on a local computer hard drive. It also allows users to access information from anywhere at any time, effectively removing the need for the user to be in the same physical location as the hardware that stores the data. The Department must take full advantage of this technology enabler. 1.1 Inadequate Efficiency and Security in Information Technology The physical information technology (IT) infrastructure deployed across the Department was purchased with a \"maximum use\" case in mind. In other words, the hardware can support the greatest possible expected demand, regardless ofhow infrequently that may happen, ifat all. This causes much of the physical IT infrastructure purchased to be idle the majority of the time. Commercial cloud infrastructure works differently. It can scale dynamically to support resource demands with the benefit of only paying for the actual use. During most times, systems can be scaled down to support the minimal traffic that is the norm. By owning and operating the physical hardware associated with on-premises data centers, the Department can incur unnecessary security risks and consume resources that could otherwise be realigned to support warfighters and the workforce in other mission areas. A combination of overly strict policies and procurement procedures make it difficult for DoD to ensure that both hardware and software are updated appropriately. The cost spent on physical hardware has a negative impact on diverting vital resources away from the warfighter and workforce as well as security impacts with a direct burden of responsibility for security updates of both hardware and 1 UNCLASSIFIED software on DoD. The Department has historically been challenged to keep up with cyber threats to its IT infrastructure. 1.2 Disparate Cloud Efforts and Disjointed Implementation DoD has not had clear guidance on cloud computing, adoption, and migration to provide unifying guidance or a coherent plan. This has made it difficult for the Department to embrace modem IT capabilities, to benefit from the efficiency and capacity offered by commercial cloud services, and to continue to evolve with technology at the speed of relevance. The lack of guidance has led to Departmental inefficiencies and has hindered the Department in IT modernization efforts. It has led to disparate efforts with siloed teams, disjointed implementations with limited capability, siloed data, and inefficient acquisitions that cannot take advantage of economies of scale. 1.3 Lack of Cloud Fitness DoD has stood up a number of clouds that have not been architected or designed for enterprise use. It is imperative that DoD has a cloud strategy to ensure that legacy applications are not moved to cloud without properly rearchitecting them to make use of the data, security, resiliency, and application advantages that cloud provides. Additionally, DoD should independently test and assess cloud network security to verify security compliance and incident response, and review all contractor and third-party testing results to ensure that performance and security monitoring are sufficient. Systems that are not \"cloud ready\" will most likely use excessive amounts of cloud infrastructure resources, meaning they will not be any more efficient and will almost certainly cost more to operate. This is why system rationalization is critical, but, without proper guidance, many program offices may not do this properly or skip it entirely. There is currently no enterprise-wide guidance on how to rationalize a system nor for assessing a system's cloud readiness. This gap has further led to the siloed data behavior mentioned earlier and restricted the ability of the Department to share information. This enterprise-wide guidance is imperative to the success of any cloud strategy - enterprise or otherwise. As DoD has continued to stand up independent clouds, we continue to dilute our already constrained cloud expertise. This enterprise cloud strategy provides the constructs for optimizing our use of cloud talent. To date, the DoD oftentimes relies on outside contracting firms to perform these assessments, never building the organic corporate knowledge to carry us into the future. Decisions are being made at high levels without in-house technical expertise as advisors. The Department must invest in its own future by building technical knowledge within. 1.4 Readiness for Artificial Intelligence (Al) As DoD embarks to stand up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC), it will require an enterprise cloud infrastructure capability. An enterprise cloud will provide the common data and infrastructure platforms that will enable Al to meet the full promise of warfighter advantage. DoD has created this DoD Cloud Strategy to align with the larger DoD cyber strategy, strengthening the security and resilience of the networks and systems that contribute to the Department's military advantage. 2 UNCLASSIFIED 2 Strategic Objectives DoD will continue to rely on its ability to process and disseminate information for military operations, intelligence collection, and related activities. To ensure this, the Department must address the unique mission requirements through a multi-cloud, multi-vendor strategy that incorporates a General Purpose cloud and Fit For Purpose clouds (reference Appendix A). To this end, this strategy will design objectives around solving these strategic challenges: • Enable Exponential Growth • Scale for the Episodic Nature of the DoD Mission • Proactively Address Cyber Challenges • Enable AI and Data Transparency • Extend Tactical Support for the Warfighter at the Edge • Take Advantage ofResiliency in the Cloud • Drive IT Reform at DoD 2.1 Enable Exponential Growth The pace of data growth is accelerating; in the last two years, the world produced 90% of all existing data. This is a trend that has been going on for a decade, with no end in sight; however, the Department's ability to access all of that data when and where it is needed has not evolved at the same pace. Modem computing capabilities can access, retrieve, manipulate, merge, analyze, and visualize data at machine speeds, providing substantial decision making advantages on the battlefield. To adapt to the continuously growing data environment, DoD requires an extensible and secure cloud environment that spans the homeland to the global tactical edge, as well as the ability to rapidly access computing and storage capacity to address warfighting challenges at the speed of relevance. DoD relies on critical intelligence to make vital national security decisions. The quantity and quality of intelligence information has been the tipping point in numerous conflicts. As the quantity of raw information production increases, so does the struggle to organize, analyze, and distribute that information to make critical decisions. DoD must continue to maintain its strategic advantage across the globe. In today's world, this cannot be done without laying the critical foundation needed to harness the power of its own data and information systems. This is the realization of cloud computing: the ability to organize, analyze, secure, scale, and ultimately, capitalize on critical information and fight in the digital age. These capabilities must be ubiquitous and available to all Department decision makers, warfighters, and staff. 2.2 Scale for the Episodic Nature of the DoD Mission (Elasticity) By implementing a scalable solution, mission owners will gain significant efficiencies in the execution of mission capabilities and cyber operations by fully embracing the dynamic elasticity of commercial cloud architecture. The Department's cloud infrastructure will allow for provisioning and deprovisioning of resources automatically. This provides optimum asset 3 UNCLASSIFIED utilization when compared to traditional IT infrastructure that is constantly in use, even when demand is minimal. This efficiency will also eventually improve the government's budgeting, billing, and payment practices by providing detailed resource usage reports for all mission owners. This transparency will further drive more efficiencies in the future on how applications are built. Additionally, the cloud pay-for-use model will provide the flexibility to optimize costs across the IT portfolio and allow DoD to adapt to changing priorities, budgetary conditions, and industry developments. To achieve this cost transparency, strong governance will need to be put in place for how applications are built and data is transmitted and stored. As we develop these standards, implement them, and subsequently learn and better align our services and data to an enterprise solution, we can look to automated tools and techniques to better inform accurate tracking of financial execution of cloud resources. 2.3 Proactively Address Cyber Challenges DoD must create a standard cloud-based cyber architecture that addresses the needs of commercial and internal-based clouds and encompasses infrastructure, applications, and data. This must include the ability to keep the environment \"evergreen\" in terms of security and technology. DoD will produce a unified cybersecurity architecture that addresses cloud and the needs of classified and unclassified missions and data. The capabilities will be tested and assessed independently and frequently to ensure that cybersecurity attributes remain effective against developing threats. DoD must embrace modern security mechanisms built into modern commercial cloud providers' platforms to ensure the security of these large amounts of data and to safeguard the information. This requires shifting the focus of security from the perimeter edge of the network to actively controlling use of the data itself. In addition to modern encryption algorithms and key management built into commercial cloud services, proper tagging of data will allow for it to be tracked and protected at the necessary levels. DoD will develop a Data Management Strategy that provides the focused discussion with respect to data. In addition to DoD data security, each Cloud Service Provider will be integral to combating cyber challenges and securing the cloud. The Cloud Service Providers will automatically scan infrastructure resources and generated logs, which will be used to identify vulnerabilities early and to make intrusion detection and mitigation in near-real time a reality across much ofthe enterprise. With the rise of hardware vulnerabilities, such as Spectre, and increased insider threat, a focus must be applied to both software and hardware- which change at an incredible pace. Keeping up with those changes is difficult, but failure to keep pace has created significant security risks and will only increase in the years to come. Here, again, modern commercial providers have addressed this problem. Moving infrastructure from DoD-managed, on-premises facilities to the cloud will take advantage ofthe rapid roll out ofsoftware and hardware updates. Cloud Service Providers are able to shift workloads within their data centers such that updates are seamless to customers. Hardware with defects or vulnerabilities is constantly swapped out and software patches are applied with vigor in a secure and fault tolerant manner. Although commercial cloud has many security advantages and opportunities for the Department, the transition to the commercial cloud environment also presents new security challenges. The transition from traditional IT management to the managed cloud service model alters the balance of visibility and control with ease of use, automation, leading edge technology 4 UNCLASSIFIED adoption, and optimization of its information domain. The DoD CIO is responsible for defining the security guidelines in the cloud environment. The risk and the responsibility for executing the security in the cloud environment is shared between the Cloud Service Provider(s) and the system owners. DoD CIO will identify the command and control (C2) requirements of the shared cybersecurity responsibility model between DoD and commercial vendors to ensure standard execution of C2 responsibilities for DoD information in commercial cloud. The specific requirements of securing a cloud environment will strain the traditional technical workforce and requires specialized skills where the Department currently has limited expertise. Historically, information security has been heavily focused on perimeter defense: limiting network access at the boundary. Unfortunately, this model is challenging for a commercial cloud environment where data is being accessed remotely and shared within and between deployments, regions, and from each Cloud Service Provider to other data locations, such as on-premises data centers at military installations. Therefore, the Department will shift its security focus from perimeter defense to securing data and services. This shift will be accomplished first through strong authentication for both people and machines and secure encryption mechanisms both at rest and in transit. In order to facilitate remote access, the DoD cloud environments will supply built­ in cryptographic technology that enables organizations to encrypt communications by default. Since the information security responsibility is shared between the Department and its Cloud Service Providers, the Department will include language in all cloud computing contracts directing Cloud Service Providers to monitor their cloud infrastructure and maintain authenticated, encrypted logging of security-relevant events that generate an audit trail and are engineered to be resistant to tampering. To address the workforce strain in adopting these new security postures, the Department will include cloud adoption assistance and specialized training for its workforce as a part ofDoD Cloud Service Provider contracts. 2.4 Enable AI and Data Transparency DoD must enable decision makers to use modern data analytics, such as Al and machine learning (ML), at the speed of relevance to make time-critical decisions rapidly in the field to support lethality and enhanced operational efficiency. The algorithms used to inform decisions are dependent on the Department's data and information being organized, secure, and visible in a common environment. An environment where data is stored in a multitude of disparate and disjointed stove pipes reduces the efficiency and tempo ofthe Department. To maximize the utility ofcloud computing technologies, data must be managed properly and follow modern technologies like data lakes and data hubs, which are accelerated and amplified by cloud technology. Data stored in an enterprise DoD cloud will be highly available, well-governed, and secure. Data will be the fuel that powers those advanced technologies, such as ML and AL This critical decision making data will be made available through modem cloud networking, access control, and cross domain solutions to those who require access. Common data standards will be a key part of the Department's methodology for tagging, storing, accessing, and processing information. Ensuring an enterprise cloud environment will increase the transparency of this data, and drive the velocity of data analysis, processing, and decision making. Leveraging advances in commercial cloud security technologies will ensure the Department's information is protected at the appropriate level. Commercial cloud provides the ability to scale and secure both the collection and the analysis of data stored in an enterprise DoD cloud. This gives mission owners the capability to 5 UNCLASSIFIED make decisions with the most relevant information. The distributed nature of cloud computing allows for a more flexible execution environment while simultaneously providing increased information security. This allows for scaling and distributing data repository stores while maintaining security posture and providing new opportunities to obtain mission insights through data collaboration. Similarly, the computing power required for analysis of massive amounts of data can be scaled seamlessly in seconds. This ability to scale will ensure that mission execution is not hindered by insufficient computing and storage capacity and enable the creation of new information models that were previously unachievable. 2.5 Extend Tactical Support for the Warfighter at the Edge The DoD cloud environment will serve mission owners in every environment, across the range ofmilitary operations, from the tactical edge to the home front, both CONUS and OCONUS, and at all classification levels and disseminations (e.g., NOFORN and REL). We must embrace computing solutions that enable warfighters in their environment versus forcing them to conform to the current environment ofsiloed data and legacy applications. The integration and operation of computing solutions will be straightforward and repeatable, regardless of the required classification level of the system. This will allow warfighters to make data driven decisions and enhance DoD ability to share data with allies and operate as a coalition force. The security of the classified environments will support the level demanded by mission requirements. Industry has made huge strides in disconnected operations. The Department's General Purpose and Fit For Purpose clouds will capitalize on these efforts to provide the warfighter with the latest technology where they need it and when they need it regardless of the environment. Cloud devices employed by warfighters at the tactical edge will be ruggedized and adaptable, providing for automatic synchronization to the greater cloud once communication is sufficient or reestablished. While certain DoD programs are not immediately amenable to migration to the cloud, some ofthese sytems may ultimately be bridged to the cloud, while others may be addressed through separate non-cloud solutions. But overall, this auto synchronization of information will ensure warfighters are retaining data, feeding it back into models, and fighting with the most recent algorithms. Doing this in a secure environment will be a force multiplier and directly support the primary goal of the cloud environment: information superiority. 2.6 Take Advantage of Resiliency in the Cloud Enterprise cloud allows for continuity of operations and efficient failover in times of crisis and operational disruption. Cloud computing is a key component in overcoming these challenges and ensuring comprehensive mission execution, due to its distributed, scalable, and redundant nature. Executing this cloud strategy will incorporate standard approaches to leveraging cloud for this mission resiliency. The enterprise cloud will offer support for failover in times of infrastructure degradation as well as recovery from operational outages and significant cyber incidents. The distributed, redundant nature of cloud computing overcomes another cyber challenge with its ability to failover in times of crisis. Our commercial cloud solutions will use advances in technology to automate failover, solving a major deficiency throughout the Department. DoD will only be able to ensure continuity of operations for digital services. We will accomplish this by taking advantage of multi-region and multi-availability zone (AZ) architecture, which exists natively within major cloud providers, and pairing this with the effective deployment of secure 6 UNCLASSIFIED Cloud Access Points (CAPs) to cloud-based cybersecurity solutions for increased resilience. DoD cloud architectures will allow for workloads to shift from one AZ or region to another, within a single cloud provider, nearly instantaneously upon detection of the failure of a primary data center. This will be vital in the case ofhuman-made or natural destruction of a large geographic area. The configuration of automated failover is not itself automatic. To fully achieve this capability, applications will need to be re-architected for the cloud. This will allow the Department to bypass the cost and manual effort currently required for the Department to maintain multiple instances of the same data across cloud providers or on-premises data centers, which does not provide the same level offailover as that provided by commercial cloud. 2.7 Drive IT Reform at DoD The cloud will allow DoD to further consolidate its sprawling data center assets. The Department still has an opportunity to further rationalize and has done significant work to rationalize and reduce data centers. The cloud will provide an opportunity to accelerate and extend those consolidation opportunities, as well as the opportunity to deliver integrated Defensive Cyber Operations (DCO) and achieve efficiencies through rapid deployment of common services. An enterprise cloud perspective will enable more centralized cloud management and a broader availability of security service options for wider cloud adoption by DoD to include those DoD Components with smaller implementation staff. 3 Strategic Approaches and Guiding Principles DoD requires an extensible and secure cloud environment that spans the homeland to the global tactical edge, as well as the ability to rapidly access computing and storage capacity to address warfighting challenges at the speed of relevance. Technologies such as AI and ML have the potential to fundamentally change the character of war. DoD will embrace an approach that leverages multiple cloud providers who can provide General Purpose and Fit For Purpose clouds. The interoperability of the multi-vendor and multi-cloud environment will be governed by one overarching enterprise cloud strategy. To achieve the objectives outlined above, the Department will pursue a set of guiding principles that will inform future decisions about enterprise clouds: Warfighter First, Cloud Smart-Data Smart, Leveraging Commercial Industry Best Practices, and Creating a Culture Better Suited for Modem Technology Evolution. 3.1 Warfighter First Throughout the Department's transition to commercial cloud services, it needs to continuously test that cloud solutions are built in a manner that never puts the warfighter and his/her mission at risk. This will require the Department to rigorously red team and challenge itself with independent assessments of the cloud environment and to utilize tactical distributed computing. At all times, DoD needs to ensure that cloud is addressing the needs of improving military lethality. By constantly challenging itself around lethality with red teams, DoD can ensure that the cloud will be positioned to support the challenges of the global environment. 7 UNCLASSIFIED 3.2 Cloud Smart-Data Smart To achieve the objectives outlined above, the Department must pursue a Cloud Smart-Data Smart approach. This approach includes: • Cloud Smart: One cloud strategy to adopt cloud solutions that streamline transformation and embrace modern capabilities for multiple clouds and missions • Data Smart: Data transparency and visibility enabled by enterprise infrastructure, application standards, and data tagging. The Department seeks to leverage the decision making advantages on the battlefield enabled by AI and ML. The Department will best take advantage ofthese capabilities by executing this succinct, integrated, and adaptive cloud strategy that encompasses multiple clouds and missions across the entire DoD. Systems/applications can be designed with the cloud in mind to simplify adoption and to allow for integration across the Department. Common data and application standards associated with conducting operations in the cloud, such as data normalization/tagging, transport protocols, and interfaces, will be developed to enable and encourage the adoption of enterprise solutions that navigate DoD away from custom, approaches. These standards, combined with the computing power offered by cloud, will allow the Department to function at a tempo never before seen, making informed, analytical decisions at machine speed. 3.3 Leverage Commercial Industry Best Practices In addition to Cloud Smart-Data Smart, DoD must leverage commercial industry best practices in its approach. This includes: • Leveraging commercial technology, capability, and innovation whenever possible • Maximizing competition to ensure that DoD is getting the best technology and value • Leverage industry open standards and best practices to avoid lock-in and provide maximum flexibility for future cloud advances • Independently assessing the services delivered to ensure that the data remains secure. The Department will leverage critical foundational technologies available in commercial cloud computing and storage, to enable innovation wherever possible, while eliminating considerable technical debt and security risk. DoD is positioning itself to get the best value in today's market of cloud computing capabilities to support warfighting and business requirements and to grow capability as industry evolves. In addition, DoD seeks to maximize competition, not only when awarding the pathfinder General Purpose cloud, but also by ensuring access to a variety of Software as a Service (SaaS) capabilities that are complementary to the General Purpose and Fit For Purpose clouds. The Department must take advantage of the advances that American private industry has made. All of this will be built into commercial pricing structures. IfDoD can adopt this commercial mindset toward cloud computing, it can incorporate commercial industry lessons learned into future architecture decisions. 3.4 Create a Culture Better Suited for Modern Technology Evolution Finally, through this strategy, the Department seeks to create a culture that is better suited for adaptability and modem technology. This includes: 8 UNCLASSIFIED • Creating an environment where people can innovate iteratively • Embracing enterprise solutions and navigating away from custom federated approaches • Creating a sustainable culture and workforce that can effectively use what cloud provides • Creating a culture that enables continuous learning from our cloud partners. Iterative innovation is essential for successfully adapting modem technologies in an evolutionary fashion. To achieve this, DoD will embrace the use of leading modem technology quickly and more rapid prototyping ofnew systems. Examples include developing and deploying capabilities for DevSecOps in the cloud environment to securely develop and test software for use in the cloud and using commercial clouds to enable small and medium size companies to more effectively secure Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). To achieve this innovation and create a culture better suited for adaptability and modem technology, the DoD workforce must change its culture. The Department must develop a cadre of technical professionals, as well as encourage technical proficiency throughout the entire Department. The Department has never built or implemented an enterprise cloud solution and therefore, recognizes the importance offinding a commercial partner to help begin the process of enterprise learning and the development of technical cloud proficiency. 4 Implementation DoD is driving toward an enterprise cloud environment that is composed of a General Purpose cloud and multiple Fit For Purpose clouds. In addition, it should be recognized that the Department will still need non-cloud data center capability for applications that are not suited for the cloud. Over time, with the adoption of an enduring enterprise cloud strategy, the non-cloud environment should become smaller. There are two fundamental types of work that must be considered in any cloud implementation. The first is a set offundamental activities that are required to stand up a cloud platform, ready to receive applications, data, or infrastructure for cloud deployment. The second set ofactivities is the ongoing work to migrate existing applications or to construct new applications onto the cloud platform.

A-4   ii     UNCLASSIFIED   1 Strategic Environment   \"Ifwe fail to adapt ... at the speed o.frelevance, then our military forces ... will lose the  very technical and tactical advantages we've enjoyed since World War II \"   - Secretary ofDefense James N Mattis   Information is vital to United States (U.S.) national security and our ability to understand  emerging threats, project power globally, conduct operations, support diplomatic efforts, and  enable global economic viability. The Department of Defense (DoD) has multiple disjointed and  stove-piped information systems distributed across modem and legacy infrastructure around the  globe leading to a litany ofproblems that impact warfighters', decision makers', and DoD staffs  ability to organize, analyze, secure, scale, and ultimately, capitalize on critical information to make  timely, data-driven decisions. Today, the Department is largely constrained by physical resources,  manpower limitations, organic skillsets and, oftentimes, laborious contracting processes to procure  or grow storage and computing capabilities. In addition, the cyberspace domain continues to be an  increasingly contested environment. In order for the U.S. to keep its strategic advantage,  warfighters and the force that support them need to be provided with the proper capabilities and  technologies to succeed.   To this end, commercial industry has made significant strides in addressing these  challenges that the Department can leverage. Commercial cloud computing is a subscription-based  service that provides network-based storage and compute resources. It allows users to store and  access data and programs over the Internet rather than on a local computer hard drive. It also allows  users to access information from anywhere at any time, effectively removing the need for the user  to be in the same physical location as the hardware that stores the data. The Department must take  full advantage of this technology enabler.   1.1 Inadequate Efficiency and Security in Information Technology  The physical information technology (IT) infrastructure deployed across the Department   was purchased with a \"maximum use\" case in mind. In other words, the hardware can support the  greatest possible expected demand, regardless ofhow infrequently that may happen, ifat all. This  causes much of the physical IT infrastructure purchased to be idle the majority of the time.  Commercial cloud infrastructure works differently. It can scale dynamically to support resource  demands with the benefit of only paying for the actual use. During most times, systems can be  scaled down to support the minimal traffic that is the norm.   By owning and operating the physical hardware associated with on-premises data centers,  the Department can incur unnecessary security risks and consume resources that could otherwise  be realigned to support warfighters and the workforce in other mission areas. A combination of  overly strict policies and procurement procedures make it difficult for DoD to ensure that both  hardware and software are updated appropriately. The cost spent on physical hardware has a  negative impact on diverting vital resources away from the warfighter and workforce as well as  security impacts with a direct burden of responsibility for security updates of both hardware and   1     UNCLASSIFIED   software on DoD. The Department has historically been challenged to keep up with cyber threats  to its IT infrastructure.   1.2 Disparate Cloud Efforts and Disjointed Implementation  DoD has not had clear guidance on cloud computing, adoption, and migration to provide   unifying guidance or a coherent plan. This has made it difficult for the Department to embrace  modem IT capabilities, to benefit from the efficiency and capacity offered by commercial cloud  services, and to continue to evolve with technology at the speed of relevance.   The lack of guidance has led to Departmental inefficiencies and has hindered the  Department in IT modernization efforts. It has led to disparate efforts with siloed teams, disjointed  implementations with limited capability, siloed data, and inefficient acquisitions that cannot take  advantage of economies of scale.   1.3 Lack of Cloud Fitness  DoD has stood up a number of clouds that have not been architected or designed for   enterprise use. It is imperative that DoD has a cloud strategy to ensure that legacy applications are  not moved to cloud without properly rearchitecting them to make use of the data, security,  resiliency, and application advantages that cloud provides. Additionally, DoD should  independently test and assess cloud network security to verify security compliance and incident  response, and review all contractor and third-party testing results to ensure that performance and  security monitoring are sufficient. Systems that are not \"cloud ready\" will most likely use  excessive amounts of cloud infrastructure resources, meaning they will not be any more efficient  and will almost certainly cost more to operate. This is why system rationalization is critical, but,  without proper guidance, many program offices may not do this properly or skip it entirely.   There is currently no enterprise-wide guidance on how to rationalize a system nor for  assessing a system's cloud readiness. This gap has further led to the siloed data behavior mentioned  earlier and restricted the ability of the Department to share information. This enterprise-wide  guidance is imperative to the success of any cloud strategy - enterprise or otherwise.   As DoD has continued to stand up independent clouds, we continue to dilute our already  constrained cloud expertise. This enterprise cloud strategy provides the constructs for optimizing  our use of cloud talent. To date, the DoD oftentimes relies on outside contracting firms to perform  these assessments, never building the organic corporate knowledge to carry us into the future.  Decisions are being made at high levels without in-house technical expertise as advisors. The  Department must invest in its own future by building technical knowledge within.   1.4 Readiness for Artificial Intelligence (Al)  As DoD embarks to stand up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC), it will require   an enterprise cloud infrastructure capability. An enterprise cloud will provide the common data  and infrastructure platforms that will enable Al to meet the full promise of warfighter advantage.   DoD has created this DoD Cloud Strategy to align with the larger DoD cyber strategy,  strengthening the security and resilience of the networks and systems that contribute to the  Department's military advantage.   2     UNCLASSIFIED   2 Strategic Objectives  DoD will continue to rely on its ability to process and disseminate information for military   operations, intelligence collection, and related activities. To ensure this, the Department must  address the unique mission requirements through a multi-cloud, multi-vendor strategy that  incorporates a General Purpose cloud and Fit For Purpose clouds (reference Appendix A). To this  end, this strategy will design objectives around solving these strategic challenges:   • Enable Exponential Growth   • Scale for the Episodic Nature of the DoD Mission   • Proactively Address Cyber Challenges   • Enable AI and Data Transparency   • Extend Tactical Support for the Warfighter at the Edge   • Take Advantage ofResiliency in the Cloud   • Drive IT Reform at DoD   2.1 Enable Exponential Growth  The pace of data growth is accelerating; in the last two years, the world produced 90% of   all existing data. This is a trend that has been going on for a decade, with no end in sight; however,  the Department's ability to access all of that data when and where it is needed has not evolved at  the same pace. Modem computing capabilities can access, retrieve, manipulate, merge, analyze,  and visualize data at machine speeds, providing substantial decision making advantages on the  battlefield. To adapt to the continuously growing data environment, DoD requires an extensible  and secure cloud environment that spans the homeland to the global tactical edge, as well as the  ability to rapidly access computing and storage capacity to address warfighting challenges at the  speed of relevance.   DoD relies on critical intelligence to make vital national security decisions. The quantity  and quality of intelligence information has been the tipping point in numerous conflicts. As the  quantity of raw information production increases, so does the struggle to organize, analyze, and  distribute that information to make critical decisions.   DoD must continue to maintain its strategic advantage across the globe. In today's world,  this cannot be done without laying the critical foundation needed to harness the power of its own  data and information systems. This is the realization of cloud computing: the ability to organize,  analyze, secure, scale, and ultimately, capitalize on critical information and fight in the digital age.  These capabilities must be ubiquitous and available to all Department decision makers,  warfighters, and staff.   2.2 Scale for the Episodic Nature of the DoD Mission (Elasticity)  By implementing a scalable solution, mission owners will gain significant efficiencies in   the execution of mission capabilities and cyber operations by fully embracing the dynamic  elasticity of commercial cloud architecture. The Department's cloud infrastructure will allow for  provisioning and deprovisioning of resources automatically. This provides optimum asset   3     UNCLASSIFIED   utilization when compared to traditional IT infrastructure that is constantly in use, even when  demand is minimal. This efficiency will also eventually improve the government's budgeting,  billing, and payment practices by providing detailed resource usage reports for all mission owners.  This transparency will further drive more efficiencies in the future on how applications are built.   Additionally, the cloud pay-for-use model will provide the flexibility to optimize costs  across the IT portfolio and allow DoD to adapt to changing priorities, budgetary conditions, and  industry developments. To achieve this cost transparency, strong governance will need to be put  in place for how applications are built and data is transmitted and stored. As we develop these  standards, implement them, and subsequently learn and better align our services and data to an  enterprise solution, we can look to automated tools and techniques to better inform accurate  tracking of financial execution of cloud resources.   2.3 Proactively Address Cyber Challenges  DoD must create a standard cloud-based cyber architecture that addresses the needs of   commercial and internal-based clouds and encompasses infrastructure, applications, and data. This  must include the ability to keep the environment \"evergreen\" in terms of security and technology.   DoD will produce a unified cybersecurity architecture that addresses cloud and the needs  of classified and unclassified missions and data. The capabilities will be tested and assessed  independently and frequently to ensure that cybersecurity attributes remain effective against  developing threats.   DoD must embrace modern security mechanisms built into modern commercial cloud  providers' platforms to ensure the security of these large amounts of data and to safeguard the  information. This requires shifting the focus of security from the perimeter edge of the network to  actively controlling use of the data itself. In addition to modern encryption algorithms and key  management built into commercial cloud services, proper tagging of data will allow for it to be  tracked and protected at the necessary levels. DoD will develop a Data Management Strategy that  provides the focused discussion with respect to data.   In addition to DoD data security, each Cloud Service Provider will be integral to combating  cyber challenges and securing the cloud. The Cloud Service Providers will automatically scan  infrastructure resources and generated logs, which will be used to identify vulnerabilities early and  to make intrusion detection and mitigation in near-real time a reality across much ofthe enterprise.  With the rise of hardware vulnerabilities, such as Spectre, and increased insider threat, a focus  must be applied to both software and hardware- which change at an incredible pace. Keeping up  with those changes is difficult, but failure to keep pace has created significant security risks and  will only increase in the years to come. Here, again, modern commercial providers have addressed  this problem. Moving infrastructure from DoD-managed, on-premises facilities to the cloud will  take advantage ofthe rapid roll out ofsoftware and hardware updates. Cloud Service Providers are  able to shift workloads within their data centers such that updates are seamless to customers.  Hardware with defects or vulnerabilities is constantly swapped out and software patches are  applied with vigor in a secure and fault tolerant manner.   Although commercial cloud has many security advantages and opportunities for the  Department, the transition to the commercial cloud environment also presents new security  challenges. The transition from traditional IT management to the managed cloud service model  alters the balance of visibility and control with ease of use, automation, leading edge technology   4     UNCLASSIFIED   adoption, and optimization of its information domain. The DoD CIO is responsible for defining  the security guidelines in the cloud environment. The risk and the responsibility for executing the  security in the cloud environment is shared between the Cloud Service Provider(s) and the system  owners. DoD CIO will identify the command and control (C2) requirements of the shared  cybersecurity responsibility model between DoD and commercial vendors to ensure standard  execution of C2 responsibilities for DoD information in commercial cloud. The specific  requirements of securing a cloud environment will strain the traditional technical workforce and  requires specialized skills where the Department currently has limited expertise.   Historically, information security has been heavily focused on perimeter defense: limiting  network access at the boundary. Unfortunately, this model is challenging for a commercial cloud  environment where data is being accessed remotely and shared within and between deployments,  regions, and from each Cloud Service Provider to other data locations, such as on-premises data  centers at military installations. Therefore, the Department will shift its security focus from  perimeter defense to securing data and services. This shift will be accomplished first through  strong authentication for both people and machines and secure encryption mechanisms both at rest  and in transit. In order to facilitate remote access, the DoD cloud environments will supply built­ in cryptographic technology that enables organizations to encrypt communications by default.  Since the information security responsibility is shared between the Department and its Cloud  Service Providers, the Department will include language in all cloud computing contracts directing  Cloud Service Providers to monitor their cloud infrastructure and maintain authenticated,  encrypted logging of security-relevant events that generate an audit trail and are engineered to be  resistant to tampering. To address the workforce strain in adopting these new security postures,  the Department will include cloud adoption assistance and specialized training for its workforce  as a part ofDoD Cloud Service Provider contracts.   2.4 Enable AI and Data Transparency  DoD must enable decision makers to use modern data analytics, such as Al and machine   learning (ML), at the speed of relevance to make time-critical decisions rapidly in the field to  support lethality and enhanced operational efficiency. The algorithms used to inform decisions are  dependent on the Department's data and information being organized, secure, and visible in a  common environment. An environment where data is stored in a multitude of disparate and  disjointed stove pipes reduces the efficiency and tempo ofthe Department. To maximize the utility  ofcloud computing technologies, data must be managed properly and follow modern technologies  like data lakes and data hubs, which are accelerated and amplified by cloud technology.   Data stored in an enterprise DoD cloud will be highly available, well-governed, and secure.  Data will be the fuel that powers those advanced technologies, such as ML and AL This critical  decision making data will be made available through modem cloud networking, access control,  and cross domain solutions to those who require access. Common data standards will be a key part  of the Department's methodology for tagging, storing, accessing, and processing information.  Ensuring an enterprise cloud environment will increase the transparency of this data, and drive the  velocity of data analysis, processing, and decision making. Leveraging advances in commercial  cloud security technologies will ensure the Department's information is protected at the  appropriate level.   Commercial cloud provides the ability to scale and secure both the collection and the  analysis of data stored in an enterprise DoD cloud. This gives mission owners the capability to   5     UNCLASSIFIED   make decisions with the most relevant information. The distributed nature of cloud computing  allows for a more flexible execution environment while simultaneously providing increased  information security. This allows for scaling and distributing data repository stores while  maintaining security posture and providing new opportunities to obtain mission insights through  data collaboration. Similarly, the computing power required for analysis of massive amounts of  data can be scaled seamlessly in seconds. This ability to scale will ensure that mission execution  is not hindered by insufficient computing and storage capacity and enable the creation of new  information models that were previously unachievable.   2.5 Extend Tactical Support for the Warfighter at the Edge  The DoD cloud environment will serve mission owners in every environment, across the   range ofmilitary operations, from the tactical edge to the home front, both CONUS and OCONUS,  and at all classification levels and disseminations (e.g., NOFORN and REL). We must embrace  computing solutions that enable warfighters in their environment versus forcing them to conform  to the current environment ofsiloed data and legacy applications. The integration and operation of  computing solutions will be straightforward and repeatable, regardless of the required  classification level of the system. This will allow warfighters to make data driven decisions and  enhance DoD ability to share data with allies and operate as a coalition force. The security of the  classified environments will support the level demanded by mission requirements.   Industry has made huge strides in disconnected operations. The Department's General  Purpose and Fit For Purpose clouds will capitalize on these efforts to provide the warfighter with  the latest technology where they need it and when they need it regardless of the environment.  Cloud devices employed by warfighters at the tactical edge will be ruggedized and adaptable,  providing for automatic synchronization to the greater cloud once communication is sufficient or  reestablished. While certain DoD programs are not immediately amenable to migration to the  cloud, some ofthese sytems may ultimately be bridged to the cloud, while others may be addressed  through separate non-cloud solutions. But overall, this auto synchronization of information will  ensure warfighters are retaining data, feeding it back into models, and fighting with the most recent  algorithms. Doing this in a secure environment will be a force multiplier and directly support the  primary goal of the cloud environment: information superiority.   2.6 Take Advantage of Resiliency in the Cloud  Enterprise cloud allows for continuity of operations and efficient failover in times of crisis   and operational disruption. Cloud computing is a key component in overcoming these challenges  and ensuring comprehensive mission execution, due to its distributed, scalable, and redundant  nature. Executing this cloud strategy will incorporate standard approaches to leveraging cloud for  this mission resiliency. The enterprise cloud will offer support for failover in times of infrastructure  degradation as well as recovery from operational outages and significant cyber incidents.   The distributed, redundant nature of cloud computing overcomes another cyber challenge  with its ability to failover in times of crisis. Our commercial cloud solutions will use advances in  technology to automate failover, solving a major deficiency throughout the Department. DoD will  only be able to ensure continuity of operations for digital services. We will accomplish this by  taking advantage of multi-region and multi-availability zone (AZ) architecture, which exists  natively within major cloud providers, and pairing this with the effective deployment of secure   6     UNCLASSIFIED   Cloud Access Points (CAPs) to cloud-based cybersecurity solutions for increased resilience. DoD  cloud architectures will allow for workloads to shift from one AZ or region to another, within a  single cloud provider, nearly instantaneously upon detection of the failure of a primary data center.  This will be vital in the case ofhuman-made or natural destruction of a large geographic area. The  configuration of automated failover is not itself automatic. To fully achieve this capability,  applications will need to be re-architected for the cloud. This will allow the Department to bypass  the cost and manual effort currently required for the Department to maintain multiple instances of  the same data across cloud providers or on-premises data centers, which does not provide the same  level offailover as that provided by commercial cloud.   2.7 Drive IT Reform at DoD  The cloud will allow DoD to further consolidate its sprawling data center assets. The   Department still has an opportunity to further rationalize and has done significant work to  rationalize and reduce data centers. The cloud will provide an opportunity to accelerate and extend  those consolidation opportunities, as well as the opportunity to deliver integrated Defensive Cyber  Operations (DCO) and achieve efficiencies through rapid deployment of common services. An  enterprise cloud perspective will enable more centralized cloud management and a broader  availability of security service options for wider cloud adoption by DoD to include those DoD  Components with smaller implementation staff.   3 Strategic Approaches and Guiding Principles  DoD requires an extensible and secure cloud environment that spans the homeland to the   global tactical edge, as well as the ability to rapidly access computing and storage capacity to  address warfighting challenges at the speed of relevance. Technologies such as AI and ML have  the potential to fundamentally change the character of war. DoD will embrace an approach that  leverages multiple cloud providers who can provide General Purpose and Fit For Purpose clouds.  The interoperability of the multi-vendor and multi-cloud environment will be governed by one  overarching enterprise cloud strategy. To achieve the objectives outlined above, the Department  will pursue a set of guiding principles that will inform future decisions about enterprise clouds:  Warfighter First, Cloud Smart-Data Smart, Leveraging Commercial Industry Best Practices, and  Creating a Culture Better Suited for Modem Technology Evolution.   3.1 Warfighter First  Throughout the Department's transition to commercial cloud services, it needs to   continuously test that cloud solutions are built in a manner that never puts the warfighter and  his/her mission at risk. This will require the Department to rigorously red team and challenge itself  with independent assessments of the cloud environment and to utilize tactical distributed  computing. At all times, DoD needs to ensure that cloud is addressing the needs of improving  military lethality. By constantly challenging itself around lethality with red teams, DoD can ensure  that the cloud will be positioned to support the challenges of the global environment.   7     UNCLASSIFIED   3.2 Cloud Smart-Data Smart  To achieve the objectives outlined above, the Department must pursue a Cloud Smart-Data   Smart approach. This approach includes:   • Cloud Smart: One cloud strategy to adopt cloud solutions that streamline transformation  and embrace modern capabilities for multiple clouds and missions   • Data Smart: Data transparency and visibility enabled by enterprise infrastructure,  application standards, and data tagging.   The Department seeks to leverage the decision making advantages on the battlefield  enabled by AI and ML. The Department will best take advantage ofthese capabilities by executing  this succinct, integrated, and adaptive cloud strategy that encompasses multiple clouds and  missions across the entire DoD. Systems/applications can be designed with the cloud in mind to  simplify adoption and to allow for integration across the Department. Common data and  application standards associated with conducting operations in the cloud, such as data  normalization/tagging, transport protocols, and interfaces, will be developed to enable and  encourage the adoption of enterprise solutions that navigate DoD away from custom, approaches.  These standards, combined with the computing power offered by cloud, will allow the Department  to function at a tempo never before seen, making informed, analytical decisions at machine speed.   3.3 Leverage Commercial Industry Best Practices  In addition to Cloud Smart-Data Smart, DoD must leverage commercial industry best   practices in its approach. This includes:   • Leveraging commercial technology, capability, and innovation whenever possible  • Maximizing competition to ensure that DoD is getting the best technology and value  • Leverage industry open standards and best practices to avoid lock-in and provide   maximum flexibility for future cloud advances  • Independently assessing the services delivered to ensure that the data remains secure.   The Department will leverage critical foundational technologies available in commercial  cloud computing and storage, to enable innovation wherever possible, while eliminating  considerable technical debt and security risk. DoD is positioning itself to get the best value in  today's market of cloud computing capabilities to support warfighting and business requirements  and to grow capability as industry evolves. In addition, DoD seeks to maximize competition, not  only when awarding the pathfinder General Purpose cloud, but also by ensuring access to a variety  of Software as a Service (SaaS) capabilities that are complementary to the General Purpose and  Fit For Purpose clouds. The Department must take advantage of the advances that American  private industry has made. All of this will be built into commercial pricing structures. IfDoD can  adopt this commercial mindset toward cloud computing, it can incorporate commercial industry  lessons learned into future architecture decisions.   3.4 Create a Culture Better Suited for Modern Technology  Evolution   Finally, through this strategy, the Department seeks to create a culture that is better suited  for adaptability and modem technology. This includes:   8     UNCLASSIFIED   • Creating an environment where people can innovate iteratively  • Embracing enterprise solutions and navigating away from custom federated approaches  • Creating a sustainable culture and workforce that can effectively use what cloud provides  • Creating a culture that enables continuous learning from our cloud partners.   Iterative innovation is essential for successfully adapting modem technologies in an  evolutionary fashion. To achieve this, DoD will embrace the use of leading modem technology  quickly and more rapid prototyping ofnew systems. Examples include developing and deploying  capabilities for DevSecOps in the cloud environment to securely develop and test software for use  in the cloud and using commercial clouds to enable small and medium size companies to more  effectively secure Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). To achieve this innovation and  create a culture better suited for adaptability and modem technology, the DoD workforce must  change its culture. The Department must develop a cadre of technical professionals, as well as  encourage technical proficiency throughout the entire Department. The Department has never built  or implemented an enterprise cloud solution and therefore, recognizes the importance offinding a  commercial partner to help begin the process of enterprise learning and the development of  technical cloud proficiency.   4 Implementation  DoD is driving toward an enterprise cloud environment that is composed of a General   Purpose cloud and multiple Fit For Purpose clouds. In addition, it should be recognized that the  Department will still need non-cloud data center capability for applications that are not suited for  the cloud. Over time, with the adoption of an enduring enterprise cloud strategy, the non-cloud  environment should become smaller. There are two fundamental types of work that must be  considered in any cloud implementation. The first is a set offundamental activities that are required  to stand up a cloud platform, ready to receive applications, data, or infrastructure for cloud  deployment. The second set ofactivities is the ongoing work to migrate existing applications or to  construct new applications onto the cloud platform. Appendix A of this document is a detailed  implementation plan that lays out the lines ofeffort that must be accomplished to fully realize the  benefits of cloud computing and to effectively operate on the 21st century battlefield.   9     UNCLASSIFIED   ~  OoD Ent•rpriu Cloud Envlronm•nt   (iTa:il ~ @  ~ 2 ~ ~ ~ .......................... ........~   f Curnnt State JEDI Pathfinder Ob~ctives Optimized   - Internal Clouds   Extorna,1 Cloud   • Curr..,tly, the OoO has many   ·--· stanclalone....... bothInternal and external   • Ooud Onboardin1  • 1-.,-.1o--cv-o,.,.- • Enterprise Shared ServicH   • Automated Account PrOllislonlng and  ~Tool lnt.a,atl°\"   • Ad,,a,-4C.pel,il- Available (e.g.  5e<vlce Providers • While the current doud portfolio • Tectlcal Up and Cross,Oomain Al, Machine leamlna)   SffVeS the OoO, It Is not I~ Solutions • Application and data efftdendH for  or efllclent • Cootract Management   • Laamlrc / Knowledse Men.......,t for  hybrid cloud and multi-vendor  solutions   DeY<!lopers for Consistent Solutlonl\"I   Figure 1: DoD Pathfinder to Hybrid Cloud Environments and Multiple Vendors   *JEDI- Joint Enterprise Defense lnfrastrucure   5 Conclusion  Information is a fundamental enabler for advantage on a 21st century battlefield and will   enable a more lethal, resilient, and innovative Joint Force. Today, the DoD information  environment is made up of multiple disjointed and stove-piped systems distributed across modern  and legacy infrastructure around the globe. The data that flows through these systems is growing  at an exponential rate. This has caused a litany of problems that impact warfighters', decision  makers', and DoD staffs ability to capitalize on critical information to make timely, data-driven  decisions. To address these challenges, DoD has implemented a number of cloud solutions;  however, they have been built in a disjointed manner. Furthermore, DoD is starting to leverage  emerging technologies, such as AI, to help manage the understanding ofall the Department's data.  However, the critical infrastructure that AI is being built on top of is disparate and disjointed.   To overcome these challenges, DoD will utilize this guiding strategy to further develop a  detailed enterprise approach for managing its data, infrastructure, and application landscape. The  advent of commercial cloud has provided a powerful opportunity to address these problems. To  best take advantage of the opportunity presented by commercial cloud, the Department must  implement an enterprise cloud strategy. The appropriate strategy for the DoD will be to leverage  a combination of General Purpose and Fit For Purpose clouds along with the advantages of  multiple commercial cloud providers. To achieve the objectives outlined above, the Department  will pursue a set of interrelated strategic approaches: Warfighter First, Cloud Smart-Data Smart,  Leverage Commercial Industry Best Practices, and Create a Culture Better Suited for Modem   10     UNCLASSIFIED   Technology Evolution. DoD needs to develop an organizational construct that insures adoption of  the enterprise cloud.   The time is now. DoD can no longer afford to delay its technological and cultural shift to  truly modem technologies. Rapidly providing DoD access to underlying foundational  technologies, like cloud computing and data storage, on a global scale is critical to national defense  and in preparing DoD to fight and win wars. If the Department wants to maintain its overmatch, it  will need to leverage technologies such as AI and therefore, it must urgently create an enterprise  cloud environment. The strategy outlined in this document provides the approach for moving  forward.   11     UNCLASSIFIED   Appendix A: Implementation Details  The Department ofDefense is driving towards an enterprise cloud environment that is composed  of a General Purpose cloud and multiple Fit For Purpose clouds. In addition, it should be  recognized that the Department will still need non-cloud data center capability for applications  that are not suited for the cloud. Over time, with the adoption of an enduring enterprise cloud  strategy, the non-cloud environment should become smaller.   The Department's Enterprise Cloud Environment components and important considerations­ migration, governance, and workforce- are described in detail below.

This General Purpose cloud will allow for the Department to take advantage of  economies of scale, broadly provide common core services, and ensure information superiority  through data aggregation and analysis.   To implement the Department's General Purpose cloud, an industry partner will be  required. The complexity of this endeavor and the Department's lack of large-scale, enterprise,  commercial cloud experience means that this partnership is critical to the successful standup ofthe  enterprise General Purpose cloud.   A-1     UNCLASSIFIED   The implementation of General Purpose cloud needs to comprehend four key tenets:   • Offer Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS)  • Offer separate environments at all classification levels  • Centralized computing to tactical edge computing for the warfighter  • Enable emerging technologies, such as AI   The JEDI Cloud Program will be the foundational approach to deliver the benefits of a  General Purpose enterprise cloud for DoD while embracing the four tenets above. The setup of  and migration to the JEDI Cloud requires the steps outlined in the Migration section. A key  implementation imperative is that mission owners will be able to rapidly onboard and control their  environments, but with common implementation governance supported by a contract.   Fit-for-Purpose  In situations where a General Purpose cloud solution is not capable of supporting mission   needs, the Department may use a Fit For Purpose commercial solution or an on-premises cloud  solution. Two examples are described here:   1. Software as a Service (SaaS): DoD software applications (e.g., email, chat, collaboration,  etc.) over time will migrate to a subscription service where an indusµ-y partner will be  leveraged for both applications and infrastructure.   2. The Department's milCloud 2.0 environment, a cloud-services product portfolio managed  by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), features an integrated suite of  capabilities designed to drive agility into the development, deployment, and maintenance  of secure DoD applications.   The primary implementation bias for DoD will be to utilize General Purpose cloud  computing. Only when mission needs cannot be supported by General Purpose will Fit For Purpose  alternatives be explored. In such a case, a mission owner will be required to submit for approval  an Exception Brief to the Office of the DoD CIO describing the capability and why the General  Purpose cloud service does not support their mission.   As Fit For Purpose solutions are justified, approved, and established, each Fit For Purpose  cloud environment will be enacted with enterprise capabilities and scalability in mind. They should  stiII support networking with the General Purpose cloud environment as well as with other Fit For  Purpose solutions through modern commercial cloud capabilities for both inter-cloud and cross­ domain communication. Secure network peering will allow for data sharing and increased  visibility where required.   The Department recognizes that the commercial cloud marketplace will continue to evolve.  DoD expects that cloud technology and offerings will continue to become more interoperable and  seamlessly integrated, enabling lower transaction costs and better inter-cloud security features  across multiple providers. DoD is best served by a robust, competitive, and innovative technology  industrial base.   Cloud Migration  There are two fundamental types of work that must be considered in any cloud   implementation. The first is a set of fundamental activities that are required to stand up a cloud   A-2     UNCLASSIFIED   platform, ready to receive applications, data, or infrastructure for cloud deployment. The second  set of activities is the ongoing work to migrate existing applications or to construct new  applications onto the cloud platform. The migration activities will need to be overseen by an  ongoing governance process that assures security, application development, and data and  infrastructure standards.   The fundamental activities required to stand up a cloud environment are composed offive  lines of effort:   1. Technical Build - create network connectivity, encryption, data sourcing, and security  services ( e.g., authentication and ongoing red team engagement) on an enduring basis.   2. Governance - create stakeholder forums, policies, roadmaps, technical standards  (architecture and application development), data connectivity standards, resiliency and  failover standards, and migration approaches.   3. Automated Provisioning and Billing - automate the ability to quickly provision cloud  resources (storage, compute, and application development) and ensure cloud costs are  appropriately captured to provide financial transparency.   4. Migration Capability - create repeatable migration process, backed with qualified staff and  playbooks for onboarding tenants.   5. Workforce Development - identify, train, and engage resources to create a robust and  sustainable cloud workforce.   After the standup of the cloud environment and the conclusion of fundamental activities,  the ongoing activities ofmigrating applications will take over. The magnitude of effort required to  stand up a General Purpose cloud at the scale and complexity of the Department is initially best  served through a single provider that will allow DoD to maximize pace and minimize risk. The  effort required to migrate applications will vary greatly from system to system. Migrating to a  cloud environment is not typically as simple as \"lift and shift.\" The migration process will be  defined in the DoD's Cloud Migration Playbook and will include the many different paths to  realize cloud. The Department will closely monitor the initial efforts to migrate into the  Department's General Purpose enterprise cloud. The lessons learned from the various migrations  will inform the regular refinement of the play book, which will provide a consistent and repeatable  process for mission owners to apply to their respective systems and applications.   Organizations within DoD that have previously implemented their own cloud will work  with the Office of the DoD CIO to determine the best way to integrate their efforts with the  Department's enterprise cloud strategy. Where it makes sense that a standalone cloud environment  should be migrated to the Department's General Purpose cloud, a thoughtful migration approach  will be developed that does not disrupt existing contracts. If it is determined that an existing  standalone cloud should be retained, it will be given a formal Fit For Purpose designation and will  be expected to adhere to the DoD's enterprise cloud policies.   Governance and Organization  Oversight and governance for the initial build out of this enterprise cloud strategy will be   led by the Office of the DoD CIO. At some future date, once the General Purpose cloud  environment is fully implemented and Fit For Purpose implementations have matured, it is  possible that overall leadership could be transitioned to a different organization inside DoD. The  DoD CIO will establish an enterprise cloud organization with appropriate leadership and the   A-3     UNCLASSIFIED   required governance forums to ensure that overall objectives and implementation plans as  described in this strategy are enacted. The DoD CIO will leverage existing governance forums to  the greatest extent possible.   The DoD CIO will organize forums that bring together all lessons learned and find ways  to integrate into DoD policies, procedures, and acquisition strategies moving forward. These  forums will allow the Department to do regular checks on cloud adoption progress and course  correct quickly. The forums will develop detailed implementation plans on rationalization,  assessment, planning, and budgeting for accelerating the digital environment to migrate into the  enterprise cloud solution.   These forums must be the catalyst to aggressively move the Department to embrace the use  ofcloud. The DoD CIO in conjunction with the governance forums will provide written guidance  on the process and what factors are key to assessing a system for General Purpose or Fit For  Purpose hosting. The Department must strive for a Cloud First bias on all future application  development/implementations. Organizations should move toward rnpdemization by  implementing \"cloud native\" applications, meaning that the architecture of the system can make  use of the scalable, dynamically elastic, distributed nature of cloud computing platforms. Leaving  systems running on legacy infrastructure or using other legacy technology must be the exception,  not the standard.   Additionally, these forums will work through the Office ofthe Under Secretary ofDefense  for Acquisition and Sustainment (A&S) to address current regulations that govern acquisitions to  fully take advantage of modem utility/consumption-based services and to enhance contracting  capabilities and ATO processes to enable reuse of PaaS/SaaS and cloud-based applications.  Working through Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE), the forums will provide early  insight into annual Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) for cloud activity  in the Department. Additionally, these forums will work with the Office of Chief Management  Officer (CMO) for application of relevant data standards and governance processes in cloud  activities.   As JAIC matures, a key organizational imperative will be to ensure that the requirements  of JAIC and enterprise cloud are being jointly integrated.   Workforce Considerations  In today's world, our adversaries are working to develop new capabilities that leverage the   advantages of cloud. Therefore, we must ensure, that as we migrate and become more dependent  on the cloud, that we are organically growing our cloud technical skills to outpace our adversaries.  We can never lose sight that cloud is a key enabler for emerging technologies, such as AI. The  future DoD cloud workforce must grow organic technical capabilities by building a more diverse  and balanced workforce among military and civilian components. DoD's workforce must obtain a  basic level of cloud proficiency in order to most effectively exploit the benefits of cloud. Just as  every Marine is a rifleman, every DoD employee must have basic cloud awareness to effectively  operate on the 21st century battlefield.

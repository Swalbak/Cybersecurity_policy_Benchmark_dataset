It defines the strategic fra- mework, priorities and peacetime, military conflict and wartime national-level military de- fence responsibilities. State Defence planning is coherent with military defence plans and po- litical safeguards of collective defence provi- ded by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). According to National Security Law, State Defence Plan must be aligned with Mili- tary Threat Analysis and framework laid out in the State Defence Concept. State defence concerns every citizen of Latvia. It is, therefore, the responsibility of the gover- nment, public authorities and every resident of Latvia. If we all take our and our country’s se- curity seriously, we as a society will become better prepared for any potential crisis or other contingency. People need to constantly be awa- re of current security challenges and how they can contribute to state defence efforts. The new State Defence Concept is released at a time when our society continues to feel the pressures of volatile international security si- tuation and different kinds of non-military threats, such as cybersecurity threats, disin- formation and hostile propaganda, socio-eco- nomic challenges of the pandemic, natural calamities and other contingencies that have significant impact on public safety, health and well-being, as well as the overall stability in the country. As government tackles all of the above concerns, it must ensure military vigi- lance and combat readiness of its army. It must also continue to implement a comprehensive armed forces capability development program- me. Current regional security context requires Latvia to continue its consistent and pragma- tic steps towards stronger state defence, which will allow us to withstand external pressure and achieve faster post-crisis recovery. 2 1. InTernaTIonal securITy 1. 1. Global trends Rules-based international order, which emer- ged after the World War II and became uni- versally accepted after the Cold War, is going through changes. Although conventions and international treaties are still in force and le- gally binding, and security institutions and ins- truments still work, some countries choose to blatantly ignore international obligations and sovereignty, territorial integrity of other states. Current trends affecting the international or- der are driven by politics of force and rivalry, which creates even further uncertainty about international security in future. Diversity of security challenges, including technological developments, terrorism, climate change and pandemic, is a serious concern for global secu- rity in a polycentric world. Global networks are fragmented and we see increasing attempts to act unilaterally, to use blunt force to resolve disputes, in cases when multilateral dialogue should be set up. If igno- red, such policies may escalate the risk of ag- gression and conflicts. Given the geopolitical environment around Latvia, the importance of strengthening national defence capabilities and closer cooperation with NATO will only incre- ase under such scenario. Military presence of allied NATO countries in the region and their direct support is an im- portant factor in Latvia’s security. On the ot- her hand, different dynamics between allies may also influence our national security. The United States of America (USA) has changed its political stance on how to maintain global order. Its expectations to see other partners ma- king equal contribution to collective defence are reasonable. Although European countries have made notable progress in recent years, in- sufficient military spending still hampers their ability to adequately respond to military thre- ats in Europe and other regions of the world. European countries still rely heavily on the US military resources both in collective defence and international missions. Fourth industrial revolution has given us new technologies that will have a profound effect on state defence and social structure. New technologies, more powerful social media and our increasing dependence on gadgets is alre- ady affecting the way we consume informa- tion, exposing new vulnerabilities and giving rise to new ways to manipulate us. Such pro- cesses pose greater danger for democracies, while authoritarian regimes with their firm grip on social media and internet, as well as use of new technologies to control and persecute their people, will find that welcoming. Terrorist groups and organisations continue to interfere with domestic policies and internatio- 3 nal affairs. Terrorist attacks in Europe, Middle East, Afghanistan, Northern Africa and Sahel region have intensified. The risk of terrorist organisations capitalising on the financial and political weaknesses of underdeveloped coun- tries and imposing alternative, non-conventio- nal forms of government has increased. Private military and security companies are deeply embedded in on-going military con- flicts. De facto use of private military and se- curity companies for achieving national in- terests, while denying any involvement with mercenaries, has become a pattern for some countries. These private entities are used as a tool for accessing services such as logistics, re- connaissance, military protection and training, which have traditionally been provided by go- vernment players. As private military and secu- rity companies acquire a greater role in future international interventions, the security risks associated with them increase and likelihood of them meddling within sovereign states’ in- ternal affairs becomes more and more real. Global climate changes are already making some regions of the world uninhabitable, which leads to new conflicts and movement of people. New migration patterns have a direct and indirect impact on Europe’s security, as well. Pandemics, industrial accidents and natu- ral disasters may have severe effects on Latvia and other socially and technologically highly developed allies. This could in turn affect the security situation in unexpected ways. . COVID19 pandemic clearly exposed the we- aknesses of globalisation and global economic risks. Concentration of production of critical goods in particular countries may cause seri- ous problems with regard to security of supply and shortage of critical goods on the market during a crisis. We can also see that some coun- tries will stop at nothing to fulfil their geopo- litical ambitions, including making use of the the pandemic. Global trends show that the balance of power has shifted and it is becoming increasingly dif- ficult to maintain peace and stability with dip- lomatic and economic means. Allies in Europe and North America, and their military and tech- nological advancements, are being challenged by other centres of power that are looking to extend their domination on international are- na. Allied nations need to remain united and committed to collective defence, continue to build their own national defence capabilities, demonstrate solidarity and keep credible deter- rence and defence posture. 1. 2. Regional trends Security situation in the Baltic Sea region has been influenced by Russia’s provocative and aggressive military and hybrid activities for a while. But it has become considerably worse since Russia’s aggression against Ukraine in 4 2014. Russia interferes in elections, political and social processes of other countries. It uses information warfare and cyber-attacks. Crack- down on Russian dissidents intensifies. Russia continues to rattle its weapons in a behaviour considered to be a relic since the end of the Cold War up until recently. Russia is following a clear pattern: as long as there is no punish- ment or retribution, anything goes. Aggression against Ukraine and attempts to limit the sovereignty of Belarus clearly show that Russia’s appetite is growing. Attempts to change the geopolitical landscape of Euro- pe will only intensify. Use of military power cannot be ruled out either. The favourite nar- rative of the Kremlin about Russia being ‘the last standing fortress’ surrounded by enemies is still popular among its people who are content with harsh socio-economic realities of their life and consider aggression against neighbouring counties acceptable. Russian state-controlled media continue to purposefully paint a negative image of Latvia as a country where Nazi ideas are widely sup- ported and Russians are hated. As a result, ac- cording to opinion polls conducted in Russia, many Russians consider Latvia one of its main long-time enemies. Russia is likely to continue to portray Latvia as a hostile country and also a failed state. That is how Russia justifies its confrontational policy and tries to hide from its own population the fact that after the collapse of the Soviet Union Baltic countries have deve- loped more successfully. In recent years Russia has made huge invest- ments into development of its military capa- bilities pointed at the West, one of its strate- gic directions. New military units are formed, weapons modernised, and military formations stationed in the Kaliningrad region are being reinforced. The main focus of Russia’s mili- tary training and capability development pro- jects is mobility of its forces, high readiness forces and blocking of access to the Baltic Sea by water and air. Realistically, Russia cannot afford a full scale global-level conventional war with NATO. That is why Russia focuses on more realistic scenarios like hybrid warfare and sudden attack that would give it an advan- tage of surprise, allowing it to capture territo- ries easier, just like in the case of Georgia and Ukraine. Russia has also clearly indicated and even threatened that it might use nuclear wea- pons if necessary. As Russia continues its aggression against Uk- raine, it also proceeds with its efforts to divide the members of NATO and the European Union (EU). Russia actively seeks allies amongst member states who would help it apply the necessary political pressure to either fully or partly lift the sanctions imposed against it. So- lidarity and unity among the member states of NATO and the EU will be crucial in showing Russia that any attempts to drive a wedge be- 5 tween them will not succeed and active dialo- gue is the best way forward. Introduction of different deterrence measures in the Baltic region since 2014, including de- velopment of national capabilities and deploy- ment of NATO forces, has allowed to reduce security threats in the region. National security and defence of the Baltic countries will depend on their ability to upgrade national capabilities and benefit from NATO’s collective defence. 2. sTraTegIc sTaTe defence ob- jecTIves 2. 1. Primary state defence objective Latvian people and the state are constantly in- fluenced by geopolitical developments around the world and in Europe. Our nation has had to face existential threats numerous times in the past and we have successfully overcome them. That is why state defence is the very cornersto- ne of continuity of the Latvian State and nation. The objective of the state defence system is to prevent and eliminate potential threats to national security, assure national sovereignty, ensure that government and its departments can operate and provide continuity, protect the people and make sure every citizen of Latvia feels responsible for the state and its security. 2. 2. State defence strategy The objective of the State defence strategy is to make sure Latvia has a robust defence system, which allows to maximise any potential dama- ges to an aggressor while minimising its gains, and thus deter any potential attack. National Armed Forces will always protect Latvia against any military attack, irrespecti- ve of the size of the aggressor’s army. It will not stand down and will try to create as much damage to the potential aggressor as possible. Moreover, one of the pillars of Latvia’s state defence is NATO’s collective defence pro- visions. At the same time, population of Latvia must clearly understand that nobody is going to protect Latvia but the people of Latvia them- selves and they need to be ready to stand up for their country. Considering the development of modern tech- nologies and more intricate ways of influencing public attitudes, including the use of online and big data tools, the deterrence is no longer about military preparedness only. Deterrence de- pends on people’s will to defend their country and prepare for any potential emergency well in advance. Peacetime psychological resilience of the society is becoming increasingly impor- tant in countering external influence and ensu- ring deterrence. Comprehensive defence is the best tool for 6 achieving societal resilience. Comprehensive defence not only makes us more prepared for peacetime and wartime crisis, it also reduces distrust between people and the government and contributes to a more cohesive society overall. Here are the four pillars of state defence: • NATIONAL ARMED FORCES. Mission of the National Armed Forces is to ensure the continuity of the state, make sure gover- nment is operational and army can quickly respond to sudden attacks, quickly detect any covert aggression, identify, assess and eliminate any potential threat. In case of large-scale military aggression, National Armed Forces have to use their assets to weaken the enemy and prevent it from ma- king any progress, as well as cause maxi- mum damage possible to the aggressor. In case of full or partial temporary occupation of Latvia, National Armed Forces must help people join the resistance. • COMPREHENSIVE DEFENCE. Objec- tive of comprehensive defence is to make sure public authorities, non-governmen- tal actors and citizens are ready to defend their state, help National Armed Forces, maintain vital functions of the society and economy and engage in civil defence in a time of war. Societal resilience is rooted in psychological resilience against external factors. It also involves advance individual level preparedness for a potential crisis or war by disseminating instructions on how to act and what to do in case of crisis or war. • NATO COLLECTIVE DEFENCE. Main elements of NATO’s collective defence, which deter potential aggressors from at- tacking Latvia, are unity of NATO member states, presence of allied troops in Latvia and credibility of the Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty . • INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION. Closer bilateral military cooperation pri- marily with the US, Canada, the Baltic Sea region countries and largest allies in Europe is key to credible deterrence and adequa- te national-level preparedness for external aggression. European Union should play a greater role in shaping security policy and build closer ties with NATO. Cooperation should lead to smoother exchange of infor- mation, regional defence partnerships, joint participation in international missions and post-aggression support to partner countries like Georgia and Ukraine. 3. sTaTe defence framework 3. 1. National Armed Forces National Armed Forces (NAF) are the backbo- ne of the state defence system. Development of NAF is centred around efficient defence ag- ainst different kinds of attacks. Defence system 7 must be capable of detecting potential threats early on. In order to successfully defend Latvia, Na- tional Armed Forces must make full use of Latvia’s unique terrain, stoping any advances of the enemy, inflicting maximum damage to its personnel and equipment, disabling and destroying the command, control and supply chains, and ensuring host nation support for allied forces. . The main operational component of the Natio- nal Armed Forces consists of Regular Force, National Guard and National Armed Forces Reserve. Here are the key goals of National Armed Forces development: • mobility • highly decentralised command, control and supply systems • highest survivability standards • interoperability • high firepower • resilience against electronic warfare • efficient management and maintenance of military assets • highest technological standards If defence spending remains at its current le- vel, army will be able to develop only its core functions. Development of capabilities such as medium-range air and missile defence, active defence at sea and longrange indirect fire sup- port remain long-term goals. Latvia is therefo- re forced to rely on its allies for missing capa- bilities, including financial support required to fill capability gaps. 3. 1. 1. Conventional defence 3. 1. 1. 1. Early warning system Considering the military upgrades imple- mented by Russia, mainly focusing on high readiness and mobility units, Latvia needs to upgrade its national early warning system to minimise the risks of a sudden attack and pro- vide decision makers with most accurate and timely data. Data collection, analysis and dissemination for timely decision-making is the responsibility of state security services and NAF. Early war- ning system must integrate State Border Gu- ard systems and external border infrastructure management systems. Efficient early warning system must: • alert on any changes • provide decision-makers with instant upda- tes • simulate potential response scenarios. 3. 1. 1. 2. Command, control and com- munication systems Battlefield situational awareness and quick, 8 efficient communication among strategic, operational and tactical levels are major pre- conditions for successful defence operati- ons. Command, control and communication systems have to be able to operate in various conditions, including environments where sig- nals are being supressed, GPS may not be trac- ked and other weapons of electronic warfare are used. Command and control system must also provide secure communications, prevent data interception and other types of attempted manipulation. . 3. 1. 1. 3. Rapid response Rapid response is one of the key capabilities of National Armed Forces and National Guard, and in time of war also State Border Guard and the Central Bank. To be able to efficiently defend itself, Latvia needs to maintain a cer- tain number of highly prepared rapid response units. These units are primarily made up of Land For- ces Mechanised Infantry Brigade and National Guard brigades. National Guard battalions are required to maintain company-size high readi- ness units with all necessary support elements, such as indirect fire support, anti-armour capa- bility, air defence capability. National Armed Forces as well as the responsible state security services and law enforcement services need to be able to respond to any threat immediately. They must also be capable of responding to a direct attack. Enhanced response of Vidzeme and Latgale National Guard brigades can be achieved through closer integration of these units with professional army units. 3. 1. 1. 4. Integration of State Border Guard and Central Bank’s Security De- partment State Border Guard and Central Bank’s Se- curity Department are required to join NAF in case of a military attack as a primary reinfor- cement. Closer integration and improved com- patibility of State Border Guard and Central Bank’s Security Department with NAF will enhance the ability of these units to contribute to state defence. NATO certification and basic military training is the most appropriate way of ensuring that these units meet the applicable defence capability standards. State Border Guard must ensure appropriate number and size of units that can cover the whole length of the external border of Latvia. 3. 1. 1. 5. Combat readiness High standards of combat readiness require NAF to organise regular training at various le- vels. NAF must organise NAMEJS, a compre- hensive military exercise for its personnel and staff of other government agencies responsib- le for state defence and security, at least once every four years. Training must be as realistic 9 and close to actual combat as possible. For this purpose more exercises must be organised out- side military training grounds allowing each unit to practice within their designated area. NAF wartime units must be activated, conduc- ting full personnel training and mobilisation of infrastructure and assets, including private sec- tor and civil defence systems. Latvia must also continue to host joint Baltic exercises, coordi- nate training with NATO military formations, work on force coordination and seamless col- laboration in a single operational framework. Regular snap combat readiness drills must be organised for testing unit training, prepared- ness, combat readiness and capability levels. These drills should give a better understanding of unit response plans, readiness of military personnel to respond to national level threats and readiness of units to get fully operational and engage in military operations at short no- tice. Strategic-level exercise KRISTAPS must be conducted at least every 12 months to test the emergency management plans, crisis and war- time response plans of the Cabinet of Ministers, ministries and other governmental institutions. 3. 1. 1. 6. Defence decentralisation Decentralisation and operational coordination at unit level is crucial for NAF to be able to effectively resist any aggression throughout the territory of Latvia. Tactical training of smaller units is therefore instrumental. Unit commanders of all levels, from top to section level, must be capable of taking the leadership and coordinating overall strategic, operational and tactical delivery. Pre- cise information about enemy units and com- munication among various units is essential in achieving these goals. According to Article 25 of the National Securi- ty Law, unit commanders need to be adequately trained and ready to get engaged in state defen- ce based on State Defence Operational Plan without instructions from the top. 3. 1. 1. 7. Infrastructure NAF and Latvia as a host country need to de- velop regional training infrastructure, training areas and firing ranges. Development of di- fferent types of warehouse facilities is also a priority. Gradual development of National Guard batta- lion infrastructure shall improve decentralised operations and supply. Further standardisation of military facilities and infrastructure is im- portant for the efficient development and con- venient maintenance of these assets. Wider use of environmentally friendly wooden materials suitable for Latvia’s climatic conditions should 10 also be encouraged. 3. 1. 1. 8. Counter-mobility Development of counter-mobility systems is a peacetime activity, which involves finding the right cooperation partners, proactive infra- structure adjustments, identification of human resource and training needs and delivery of spe- cific military exercise. NAF should continue to enhance its counter-mobility cooperation with private sector, conduct regular counter-mobili- ty execution operations, including mobilisation of required resources, during regular military training. NAF should build a system that allows cons- tructing reinforcing obstacles in early stages of conflict or even peacetime. In case of a military conflict, defence minister may decide to remo- ve specific civil infrastructure and substitute it with necessary operational counter-mobility solutions. 3. 1. 1. 9. Peacetime and wartime logis- tics management Centralised procurement system for NAF, Na- tional Guard and Cadet Force is managed on day to day basis by professional competence centre, a civilian agency which is gradually consolidating defence procurements, opera- tes the single asset inventory, distribution and quality control system. It also promotes unified standards and enhances technical and supply management competences. One of the key priorities of NAF with regard to logistics is development of combat , logistics, supply and maintenance units. 3. 1. 1. 10. Host nation support It is the responsibility of Latvia as the host na- tion to provide other allies with support during peacetime and early stages of a crisis. Host na- tion support includes access to vital resources, infrastructure, locations, and in case of military conflict also priority access to national airports, ports and motorways. In peacetime bureaucra- tic hurdles need to be minimised to ensure free movement of allied forces across NATO and EU. EU-level decisions must be made. Infra- structure must also be adapted for military mo- bility. In terms of host nation support priorities, Lat- via needs to continue focusing on development of Liepāja Port and Lielvārde airfield. New infrastructure projects, for example, Rail Bal- tic need to be suitable for military needs. This includes construction of railway link to Camp Ādaži. Military mobility parameters agreed by NATO and EU countries need to be followed when building or repairing roads and bridges. Government institutions responsible for host nation support planning and delivery need to 11 build their own asset reserves, infrastructure, sector-specific expertise and analytical capaci- ty that meet support standards and obligations stipulated in relevant legal acts. 3. 1. 1. 11. Cooperation with civilian sec- tor A deeper permanent cooperation with civilian sector is key in ensuring functions of NAF and basic needs of the society during wartime. NAF must strengthen its medical capabilities and cooperation with Latvian universities on integration of military medicine in universi- ty curriculum. NAF must also cooperate with healthcare sector on crisis management trai- ning and scenario-based response planning for potential aggression. Integration of State Border Guard , Central Bank’s Security Department, Information Technology Security Incident Response In- stitution, Latvian Environment, Geology and Meteorology Centre, A/S ‘Latvijas Gaisa sa- tiksme’ and Civil Aviation Agency with NAF must be tested on regular basis. Stakeholders must also take part in planning and military exercises. Civil protection system is part of the state de- fence framework. It is fundamental for effi- cient and comprehensive defence, as it ensures the coordination between civilian and military sectors, resource coordination and harmonisa- tion of capabilities. Implementation of NATO’s basic standards in civilian sector is crucial in ensuring critical services to people and civilian support during military operations. Civil pro- tection system must be able to provide basic needs of the population during peacetime, war- time, military attack or threats. Civilian protection operational command cen- tre is responsible for the functioning of civil protection system during war, military attack or danger. Its procedures and analytical ca- pacity must be improved and regularly tested during crisis management exercises. . Civilian protection operational command centre must work together with NAF, as well as govern- ment institutions, companies and local civil defence commissions . Exchange of information between all stake- holders responsible for crisis management is absolutely crucial for reaching common goals of civil-military cooperation. To ensure the efficient coordination of crisis response, civil and military communication networks must be secure and protected against any attempts to disrupt them. 3. 1. 2. Protection against hybrid threats The level of hybrid threats in Latvia is constant- ly high. It is important to strengthen resilience of the society and boost capabilities required 12 to respond to such threats on daily basis and in case of aggression. Considering the rather limitless opportunities to execute influence operations and the wide range of technologies for social engineering, society must be ready to cope with new types of security challenges. NAF, national security community and other responsible authorities need to upgrade the capacity to identify, record and expose hybrid threats targeting Latvia. Efficient functioning, cooperation and speed of reaction of government bodies are crucial for defending the state against hybrid threats. Crisis management procedures and awareness of responsible officials need to be regularly upgraded to make sure that top government of- ficials can take decisions quickly and based on the right information that allows them to either contain threats or eliminate them entirely. 3. 1. 3. Resistance It is the duty of every citizen to defend their country and show either active or passive re- sistance to aggressor. In case of sudden mili- tary attack each unit of NAF and every civilian institution know exactly what they need to do according to State Defence Plan. They do not need to be told when to start defending Latvia. NAF and government authorities will conti- nue to defend Latvia even if control over part of the country’s territory is lost during a war. They will continue to resist the aggressor until a point where territorial sovereignty of Latvia is fully restored. National Security Law spe- cifies precise responsibilities of NAF in case of war or military attack. It also stipulates people’s rights and obligations in time of war or military attack. NAF must plan and prepare for resistance proactively. Civilian population is engaged in counter-mobility and resistance operations on voluntary and mutual trust basis. This can be achieved through peacetime education of population and setting up coordination fra- meworks and adequate support infrastructure. 3. 2. Comprehensive defence system Country may be lost without a fight if people are not ready to defend themselves. Public aware- ness, resilience against manipulation attempts, practical knowledge on how to overcome cri- sis and civic participation are fundamental for stability and safety of the society. Sustainable development of Latvia is impossible without state defence and societal resilience. Knowledge and decisive action at an individu- al level are key for crisis preparedness, mana- gement and recovery. Comprehensive defence requires culture of preparedness. Society ne- eds to put effort into getting themselves ready for possible worst-case scenarios. People need 13 to support each other in their private and social circle to give each other more reassurance and build the necessary level of psychological re- silience. Strengthening of National Guard and Cadet Force is essential because these orga- nisations provide all citizens with possibility to prepare for potential threats while continuing to live a civil life. Comprehensive defence serves a twofold pur- pose of building peacetime societal resilience and ensuring state defence during war. Here are the main crisis and wartime priorities of comprehensive defence system: 1) public support for National Armed Forces in ensuring state defence: • participation in National Armed Forces and armed resistance • host nation support to allied forces • counter-mobility operations • all kinds of support to NAF and allies (for example, to facilitate information exchan- ge, supply and other functions/activities) • resistance movement and support, passive resistance (for example, refusal to colla- borate with aggressor’s army, civil disobe- dience) 2) capacity of society and economy to deliver critical services and manage all kinds of con- tingencies, including military conflict: • government functioning, efficient response and continuity • clear wartime tasks and responsibilities of each institution and local government, pre- cisely defined critical human resources and functions • undisrupted access to critical services (for example, electricity, communications, fi- nancial services, food, critical infrastructu- re and personnel safety) at all times • proactive supply and accumulation of raw materials and other resources for critical services • timely preparedness for crisis or war across all levels of society, including individual le- vel of every citizen. 3. 2. 1. Continuity of government Continuous delivery of core government func- tions during a potential crisis or war requires preliminary work on relevant protocols across all levels of institutional framework, including the office of the president, parliament, Cabinet of Ministers and other government and local institutions. It also requires national security community continuity, as well as capacity to tackle tasks critical for functioning of the so- ciety. Considering how dependent government insti- tutions and society have become on technolo- gies and access to data, security of information 14 systems plays a significant role in government continuity during a crisis or war. Finally, each public body should have well-de- fined responsibilities and role in the context of state defence. Core functions need to be clearly identified, ensuring their continuity at all times. 3. 2. 2. Societal resilience Public involvement is indispensable to com- prehensive defence. Civic engagement of Lat- vian population is crucial. People need to take greater responsibility for what is happening in the country. This includes national defence. Latvia needs to promote the culture of prepa- redness. Each non-governmental organisation, private company and government institution needs to accept its responsibility for ensuring readiness to any potential crisis. Societal resi- lience plays a major part in building this cultu- re. It involves timely education and prepared- ness for wartime response, including people’s ability to survive and take care of themselves for as long as possible or at least for the initi- al 72 hours. Dissemination of information and training on the best courses of action in case of threats must be stepped up. In addition, re- gular workshops, training and presentations to various groups of the society need to be rolled out. Latvia must offer hands on training to all groups and communities in our society. Every individual’s knowledge and skills can be crucial in supporting state defence. All kinds of assets and resources can make a differen- ce. Psychological support to the victims and families of essential workers on the front line of crisis management and mitigation can be es- sential. 3. 2. 3. Information space security Government must use different available re- sources to ensure that information space is pro- tected. Every citizen of Latvia must be aware that individual and general protection against influence operations and information space at- tacks is a continuous process. Media literacy training of the society must be continued through school and university cur- riculum and targeted training designed for va- rious social groups. It is also important to conti- nue communicating with various groups of the society to make them fully aware of the current information space challenges and threats, and thus promote critical thinking and psychologi- cal resilience against influence operations. In addition, defence sector must create an in- tegrated strategic communication platform based on various communication channels. In case of military threat to our country, strate- gic communication platform and various other activities in the information space would con- tribute to more efficient response of Latvia to 15 information warfare and psychological opera- tions which are an integral part of any conflict. Latvia must promote strong awareness across all levels about the harms of foreign influence operations. Government must prepare a toolkit for countering all kinds of influence operati- ons against Latvia. This kind of preparedness would give potential aggressor a clear strate- gic signal that Latvia will have zero tolerance against influence operations both in times of peace and war. 3. 2. 4. Economic resilience Every business in Latvia has a role in state defence. However, businesses, products and services of which are critical for state defence during a crisis, are particularly valuable. Providers of these services must continue operating despite crisis or war. They must provide continuous functioning of national economy and keep the supply of necessary products and services running. Consequently, security of supply and economic and technological dependence on countries that do not belong to NATO or the EU is a serious business consideration for these companies. Government must build a state emergency reserves system that meets the above require- ments. The system would be triggered upon early indications of potential threat and utilise options contracts. It would also restrict exports of food, medicines and strategic raw mate- rials. By delegating mobility responsibilities to trusted business operators during peaceti- me, Latvia can create an efficient framework for structured private sector contribution to state defence. Government institutions must identify the needs and create state emergency reserves system. This would enhance econo- mic resilience and ensure that government can continue providing vital services and functions despite the crisis. In peacetime business owners can help strengthen state defence by encouraging their employees to join National Guard and National Armed Forces Reserve and create National Guard units in their companies, which also contributes to better physical security of their assets during a potential crisis. 3. 2. 5. Non-governmental sector All citizens can contribute to national policies. Voting is not the only way to influence national policies as a citizen. In democracy citizens must self- organise to be able to promote their agenda, help improve everyday life and efficiency of government institutions. Constant self-organising is crucial in today’s complex communicative and manipulative environment. Only by helping each other will people be able to better understand what is happening outside 16 their social circle and distinguish between what is important and what is not when a crisis comes. Mutual trust between people and confidence in government is absolutely vital for state se- curity and development. In case of crisis, trust towards one another and the government can be decisive in country’s ability to consolidate around efforts to overcome crisis. Non-governmental organisations play an im- portant part in providing this link. NGOs need to be involved in defence planning and delivery of theoretical and practical training. Govern- ment, on the other hand, must clearly define the role and responsibilities of NGOs in delivering functions and tasks delegated to them. And, last but not least, in peacetime NGOs must contribute to educating society and pro- viding necessary skills. Social partners should also raise public awareness about crisis res- ponse. In case of emergency, NGOs should be able to help people and disseminate verified information by also engaging Latvian diaspora abroad for these purposes. 3. 2. 6. Church Church plays a major role in strengthening psychological resilience of religious groups of population during a crisis or war. Church may help religious groups cope better with shocks and motivate them to help others around them. Another important way in which religious or- ganisations can help Latvia in case of crisis or war is to help spread credible information, help victims and provide solace to those affected or touched by the crisis, especially wartime tra- gedies. 3. 2. 7. Civil resistance In cases when aggressor’s force temporarily ta- kes over control of a part of our country’s ter- ritory, and Latvia is under a real threat, civilian population must retreat to the parts of the coun- try still controlled by National Armed Forces and allied troops if possible. Citizens have the duty to decline collabora- tion with illegitimately appointed government officials and institutions, occupying power or aggressor’s army, and continue passive resis- tance. This can be achieved by distancing one- self from decisions and actions of occupying power, avoiding mass events organised by occupying power, non-disclosure of informa- tion and boycotting of illegal elections, refe- rendums or popular votes held by enemy go- vernment. Covert support of people is decisive for the su- ccess of the resistance movement. People can help by, for example, offering resources, me- dical help and supplies, information, financial, communications, training, recruitment, recon- 17 naissance and other assistance to members of the civil resistance movement, armed resistan- ce, NAF and allied troops. There are different ways in which every citizen of Latvia can con- tribute to the resistance movement. In the me- antime, citizens also have to take into account the associated security risks. 3. 2. 8. Cyber security One of the integral elements of comprehensi- ve defence is cyber security and IT resilience. Greater focus on cyber security training (cyber hygiene) and sticking to minimum security standards can help reduce risks (vulnerabili- ties) to government institutions, society and businesses, and ensure continuous operations. It is also advisable to keep reducing depen- dence on technologies produced by countries with aggressive cyberspace strategies against NATO, the European Union or their member states. With introduction of fifth generation mobi- le networks (5G) strategic security agenda of many countries is dominated by 5G network security and its technical, technological and political elements. It also requires people and the society at large to change their habits and reduce digital secu- rity risks like storing of personal data on unsafe servers and downloading unverified mobile ap- plications. People must also critically evaluate whether it is appropriate to allow open use of their personal data on various platforms. Cyber security should be a part of education curriculum. It should be one of the topics in state defence lessons . It should also be integ- rated in annual training of government and lo- cal institutions. There is also a need to create a network of regional units of Cyber Cadet Force and National Guard Cyber Security Unit. Protection of information and cyber space in time of crisis or war should rely on active and passive defence to prevent any attempts to ap- ply external pressure on the population and to disable people. In case of military threat, it is important to en- sure continuous exchange of data and access to critical services 3. 2. 9. Youth education Youth education and training is crucial in sha- ping tomorrow’s society of Latvia. Quality of their education will determine the future resi- lience of the Latvian society against external factors, constantly increasing technological pressures and vulnerabilities associated with the use of technologies. That is why it is so important to integrate Cadet Force and state defence lessons into schools and their curriculum. It will help reach the 18 above goals and set up a full scale comprehen- sive defence system. Meaningful youth state defence education, patriotic upbringing, civic awareness, cohesion, leadership and physical training will significantly enhance internatio- nal competitiveness of Latvia in the future. Schools across Latvia are currently switching to skills-based learning, which means that greater attention can now be given to young people’s leadership qualities that are essential for development of Cadet Force and the com- prehensive defence system. Cadet Force will continue to provide voluntary military training for youth until full introduction of state defen- ce lessons in national school setting. Informal Cadet Force education is available to children and youngsters aged 10 to 21 but the main tar- get group still is Year 5-9 pupils, altogether 8,000 children in different parts of Latvia. Currently state defence is an elective course available to upper secondary (Year 10-11) pu- pils. It teaches young people core state defence skills, how to act in tmes of crisis, critical thin- king and civic patriotism. State defence trai- ning also gives the essential knowledge, skills and mindset to deal with crisis. State defence themes should be integrated in other general education courses and also university curricu- la, too. Youngsters attending state defence lessons are eligible to apply for voluntary state defence summer camps. At these camps young peop- le can enhance the training they have received in classroom setting throughout the academic year in a real environment and boost their ove- rall physical condition without any risk to their health. State defence lessons will become part of mandatory training in all Latvian secondary schools from 2024/2025 academic year. Every year around 30,000 young people aged 15-17 will be taught. . At least 2,000 young people should partici- pate in voluntary summer camps each year to ensure that Latvia has a growing share of population with military training. This training is a step towards professional army for those who want to join armed forces and should also encourage youngsters to explore opportunities provided by National Guard, army reserve and other public jobs. Even if graduates of summer camps decide not to continue their military ca- reer in active service, they will join the army reserve and can be mobilised when necessary because they will have the necessary resilience and know how to respond to a crisis. In case of crisis they will represent the most active, mobile, knowledgeable and skilful part of the society and will be able to defend themselves and others. State defence lessons are a modern way of teaching youngsters about current security challenges. This course is designed for much broader target group compared to mandatory 19 military service (conscription), which targets only a certain part of the society, traditionally particularly male. Introduction of state defence lessons shall rapidly increase the number of ci- tizens with state defence skills . It is expected that in 10 years’ time almost third of Latvia’s population could be trained this way. Ministry of Defence is planning to create its own vocational secondary education establish- ment. On top of general education curriculum, this establishment will provide its pupils skills and values that will contribute to their intel- lectual and leadership qualities, high sense of responsibility and other skills necessary for enhanced physical and mental endurance. This is how Ministry plans to train future military commanders and promote leadership among Latvian army officers. Vocational secondary education establishment, which will offer gene- ral education curriculum, will focus on STEM subjects: mathematics, physics, chemistry and technologies. This will allow future officers to master the necessary skills for using modern combat vehicles. 3. 3. NATO collective defence Although Latvia is located in a region domina- ted by a far more superior military power, Lat- via is part of the strongest military alliance in the world, NATO. NATO contributes to stron- ger deterrence and defence of Latvia. NATO’s collective defence is instrumental in ensuring security of Latvia and peace in Europe at large. 3. 3. 1. Regional presence Allied presence in Latvia shows clear com- mitment of allies to supporting Latvia. It is a powerful deterrence signal to all potential ag- gressors. Allied presence is strategically im- portant. Permanent presence of NATO forces in Latvia is the objective that should be pur- sued by all means. Allied forces support NAF units during operations and are strongly integ- rated in NAF command chain. Allied forces possess all the required capabilities to meet support goals. Presence of allied troops can also be ensured outside formal NATO mecha- nisms, on basis of bilateral or multilateral co- operation agreements between Latvia and res- pective countries. Further strengthening of NATO Enhanced Forward Presence Battle Group Latvia is vital in ensuring more efficient support to Latvian units responsible for state defence. It will also enhance the deterrence effect. It is extremely important to enhance allied presence with long-range capabilities such as fire support, air defence and coastal and port defence systems. Allied units deployed to Latvia are the core component of allied presence. Additionally, among factors contributing to deterrence are: • regular international military exercises hosted in Latvia 20 • NATO command headquarters located in Latvia, especially the Multinational Division Headquarters North • armoured vehicles and equipment deployed to Latvia 3. 3. 2. NATO credibility Attack against one ally is considered an attack on all allies. That is the principle, which under- pins Alliance’s deterrence policy. Here are the main elements of NATO’s credibility: • readiness to grant political and military sup- port in case of attack • military presence of allied forces countries facing the biggest threats • reinforcement capabilities • development of national capabilities of member states via investing at least 2% of their GDP in defence • credible nuclear deterrence policy Latvia needs to constantly work on the deve- lopment of these elements to make sure NATO military power is sufficient to guarantee peace and stability in Latvia and our allied countries. NATO collective defence provides a 360-de- gree approach to deter threats and guarantee the security and sovereignty of all of its mem- ber states. 3. 3. 3. Response readiness Presence of allied forces does not automatical- ly mean they are ready to respond. NATO must be able to give instant military response to pre- vent the aggressor from achieving fait accom- pli or making the situation irreversible. NATO should be able to proactively reinforce national defence of member states in case of military tensions to de-escalate a potential conflict. Modern warfare is becoming increasingly ra- pid. Early warning systems are therefore under great pressure. NATO must be able to respond even when warning is given at last minute or attack is very sudden. Here are the fundamen- tal elements of rapid response: • proactive deployment of allied troops to countries facing imminent security threats • well-trained, capable and equipped rapid reaction units • operational defence plans with clear rein- forcement strategies • efficient political and military leadership • high military mobility Latvia must fill gaps in all of these areas. Multinational Division Headquarters North, which is located in Latvia, should become the framework for enhancing coordinated rapid response capabilities of NATO forces in case of a potential crisis. 21 3. 4. International cooperation 3. 4. 1. Strategic partnership with the United States US is Latvia’s main strategic partner. US has supported our country throughout history and has helped significantly strengthen our state defence ever since we restored our indepen- dence. Latvia highly appreciates the support provided by the US, especially the presence of US troops in Latvia, as well as assistance in developing NAF capabilities and delivering joint training. Latvia needs to continue the existing close co- operation with US in areas such as regional defence plans, strengthening of military capa- bilities and regular exchange of information on regional security. Military presence of US troops in Latvia is a crucial element of our de- terrence capabilities. Further reinforcement of such presence is the future goal. Another prio- rity is the deployment of US military vehicles, equipment and assets to Latvia and the Baltic region. Latvia and the US need to continue joint inter- national missions. NAF need to continue joint projects with Michigan National Guard, which has been involved in the NAF development for already three decades now. 3. 4. 2. Baltic cooperation Estonia and Lithuania have traditionally, politi- cally and geographically been the closest allies of Latvia. Efficient defence cooperation betwe- en Baltic countries is an essential element of re- gional security, stability and threat prevention. Latvia strongly supports comprehensive Bal- tic-level military cooperation in all available formats and efforts to promote common securi- ty and defence policy in different international formats and forums. Mutual trust, coordination of military capability development projects, enhanced compatibility of armed forces and integration of command and control systems is key to successful Baltic cooperation. 3. 4. 3. Canada Canada is the framework nation of NATO En- hanced Forward Presence Battle Group Latvia. It commands the battle group and is a particu- larly important ally of Latvia. Latvia needs to continue enhancing its bilateral cooperation with Canada. Latvia is looking forward to joint battle group development projects, including setting up of joint combat support arrange- ments. Latvia should consider joint NAF in- ternational missions with Canadian side and possible civilian cooperation as a way of ex- panding its successful military cooperation with Canada. 22 3. 4. 4. The United Kingdom United Kingdom is one of Latvia’s main al- lies in Europe. UK has consistently supported strengthening of NATO collective defence and has had a shared understanding of our regional security challenges. UK and Latvia must con- tinue defence cooperation irrespective of how the future relationship between the UK and the European Union will form. Latvia is ready to continue its participation in various military cooperation formats coordinated by the UK , especially the Joint Expeditionary Force led by the UK. 3. 4. 5. Poland Militarily Poland is one Baltic region’s and Europe’s strongest NATO countries. Poland’s understanding of the European geopolitical si- tuation and its geographical proximity makes Poland a strategic defence policy partner for Latvia in the Baltic Sea Region. Therefore, intensification of bilateral cooperation with Poland, together with deepening of Baltic Sea Region cooperation in all available formats, must be continued. 3. 4. 6. Countries of NATO Enhanced Forward Presence Battle Group Latvia Canada, Albania, Czech Republic, Iceland, Italy, Montenegro, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain belong to the group of countries which form the NATO Enhanced Forward Pre- sence Battle Group Latvia and together make up a serious contribution to Latvia’s deterrence and defence capabilities. Latvia highly values this contribution and shall continue to promote close bilateral ties with these countries in the future, as well. Latvia is committed to support these countries in their future efforts to address various threats and challenges arising in the Southern flank, Arctic and Central Europe. 3. 4. 7. Germany The role played by Germany in defence and foreign policy areas has significantly increased since UK’s decision to withdraw from the EU. Latvia should continue to enhance coopera- tion with Germany on common approach and action plans for addressing Europe’s strategic and military threats. Germany plays a major role in strengthening Baltic Sea region’s de- fence and security. Latvia needs politically and militarily strong Germany, which can safegu- ard peace and stability in Europe. That is why bilateral cooperation with Germany is so im- portant. Latvia is looking forward to enhanced cooperation between military industries and joint military training delivered together with Germany. Regional multilateral cooperation formats are also a good framework for deeper cooperation with Germany. 23 3. 4. 8. France France has a significant role in shaping Europe- an security and defence policy. It also contribu- tes to successful implementation of NATO de- terrence policy and Baltic Sea region defence plans. It is important to continue bringing Bal- tic Sea region defence and successful NATO deterrence policy closer together. 3. 4. 9. Nordic countries Considering geographical proximity, similar threat perception, shared cultural and historical background, cooperation between Baltic and Nordic countries should be much deeper. Building on Northern Group, Nordic-Baltic and other Baltic Sea region cooperation fra- meworks, Latvia should enhance political and military cooperation with Scandinavian coun- tries, and thus strengthen regional solidarity. 3. 4. 10. Ukraine and Georgia Latvia will continue supporting Georgian and Ukrainian efforts to negotiate the return of illegally occupied areas by showing solidarity and non-recognition of occupation. Latvia will continue to expand bilateral defence cooperation with these countries and support further Euro-Atlantic integration of Ukraine and Georgia. 3. 4. 11. Arms control Latvia supports peaceful resolution of con- flicts between countries, with full respect for international laws. Arms control is an essenti- al tool for achieving that. It provides greater transparency of military capabilities and faci- litates stable relations among countries. However, arms control mechanisms have star- ted eroding in the past 10 years. There is less and less transparency and predictability . Exis- ting treaties are being ignored or even violated. Latvia must contribute to greater awareness among allies about the importance of ensuring that all parties fulfil their liabilities. That is the only way to ensure efficient arms control and greater safety. Latvia and its allies have to be ready to use mi- litary means to protect their sovereignty in ca- ses when arms control regimes are violated by other states parties. Arms control merely com- plements other elements of general defence and deterrence policy of Latvia in the current security environment. The United Nations and Organisation for Se- curity and Cooperation in Europe are the main multinational bodies working towards reliable arms control to promote more security. 24 3. 4. 12. NAF role in international mili- tary operations and rapid response for- ces In order to promote safety in regions surroun- ding Europe and maximise the impact of in- ternational organisations, Latvia will continue to contribute its military resources to interna- tional operations and rapid response forces. Participation in international missions and rapid response forces gives NAF troops ad- ditional experience and skills. It gives NAF combat units higher level of preparedness and interoperability with allied forces. NAF needs to develop and sustain a capability to contri- bute one battalion-size unit to any of the pe- ace-keeping operations for at least two rotation periods in order to be capable to contribute in international security efforts more effectively. Participation in these operations depends on current operational needs of Latvian defence sector. 3. 5. European Union Latvia believes that the Common Security and Defence Policy of the European Union (EU) must remain a member state competence, sub- ject to unanimous consent. Latvia is ready to continue contributing to the Common Security and Defence Policy of the EU and participate in EU military missions and operations car- ried out in regions that have direct impact on security of EU member states. Balanced and efficient regional support to partner countries, including Eastern Partnership countries, and their armed forces through European Peace Fa- cility is the best way to secure peace and stabi- lity in Europe’s neighbouring regions. Latvia supports EU defence initiatives like Per- manent Structured Cooperation and European Defence Fund, which contribute to safer Euro- pe. Enhanced military mobility in Europe, gre- ater competitiveness and mutual cooperation within EU’s defence industry is crucial for en- suring level playing field and harmonised stan- dards for defence industry development across the Union. NATO is the only collective defence framework Latvia is part of, and EU defence cooperation initiatives can have a complementary effect on NATO efforts if duplication is avoided. NATO and EU must work closely on issues such as crisis management, defence against non-con- ventional threats , countering of disinformation and consistent strategic communication. Latvia will continue to advocate cooperation with third countries that are members of NATO but do not belong to the EU. Such a cooperation is crucial and these countries must be offered to join EU defence projects whenever possible. 25 3. 6. State defence assets 3. 6. 1. Budget Adequate defence funding is an important prerequisite for reaching appropriate level of state defence capabilities. Sufficient defence funding demonstrates our commitment to international obligations. It is also a strong signal of political will to ensure adequate state defence. In 2014, during the Wales Summit, NATO member states agreed to meet the NATO guideline to spend a minimum of 2% of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on defence and keep the funding at the same level in future. To meet the NATO target, Latvia has set a defence spending threshold of 2% of GDP in its Law on the Financing of National Defence. According to NATO guideline, defence fun- ding can only be spent on defence needs. Fun- ding of other needs that are not related to state defence is not considered defence spending. In the duration period of the Concept, Latvia must ensure a balanced defence budget that has the following breakdown between budget lines: personnel and administrative costs (50%), maintenance costs (30%) and investments (at least 20%). 3. 6. 2. Personnel NAF must continue to increase its personnel size taking into account the constraints of the national labour market. By recruiting additio- nal defence personnel, Latvia significantly inc- reases the costs of potential aggressor’s attack. In the duration period of the Concept, profes- sional army of Latvia must reach the size of 8,000 troops to fill all the vacancies in NAF units and support the expected capability de- velopment outcomes. NAF will continue to acquire new capabilities and equipment in the coming years and well-educated, trained, highly motivated professional soldiers with va- rious fields of expertise will become the core asset of NAF. National Guard is indispensable in defending territorial integrity of Latvia. According to the existing plans, the size of the National Guard must grow to 10,000 troops by 2024 and reach 12,000 troops by 2027. National Guard must continue to recruit young generation of troops to ensure that young peop- le, who have decided to go through full military training and pursue a military career in Natio- nal Guard, while also leading a civilian life, can contribute to state defence. It is necessary to continue the employer outreach programme to convince them to encourage National Gu- ard troops to participate in military exercises, 26 perform specific military duties and master the necessary skills. National Guard must develop training modules and provide distance learning possibilities to be able to attract National Guard members of various backgrounds, including vital support staff, by offering them a possibility to gradual- ly complete training modules and continuously develop their skills and competences through flexible learning plans that fit all individual work and private life arrangements. It is vital to continue raising public awareness about voluntary participation in state defen- ce to make sure this kind of civic engagement receives the wide support and respect that it deserves. It is absolutely pivotal to change people’s scepticism towards National Guard. Politicians and opinion leaders need to become real role-models of active participation in Na- tional Guard. They should also support public campaigns that focus on the prestige of being a member of the National Guard to generate a long-lasting public support for National Guard. It is also necessary to continue increasing the size of trained reserve personnel, including retired professional service members, non-ac- tive duty National Guard, graduates of Level 4 Cadet Force training who have also comple- ted state defence training camp courses, given the reserve oath of enlistment and completed military training for army reserve volunteers. According to the Concept, this should allow training and recruiting about 6,000 new reser- ve troops. It is equally important to set up a full reser- ve training programme based on unit level framework for reserve force engagement and operational readiness, i.e. create a two-level reserve personnel training system with active reserve (unit-level training) and permanent re- serve (centrally managed and coordinated fra- mework). In case of full mobilisation, reserve training is provided by the Cadet Force Centre. Defence sector civilian staff plays an important role in ensuring suitability and constant effi- ciency of the overall system. Although there is a clear separation between military and civili- an service, it is a must for the defence sector civilian personnel to have at least basic mili- tary training to be able to deliver vital military functions. It is also important to identify other critical pro- fessions outside defence sector that are vital for continuity of the state and the society in case of military conflict or intervention. These include occupations, service of which during crisis or war is just as important as in peacetime. 3. 6. 3. Security of supply Secure supply of assets and resources essenti- al for NAF combat capability assurance is one 27 of the key priorities. It plays a crucial role in times of crisis when undisrupted, reliable, se- cure and timely delivery of goods and services may be decisive for efficient state defence. 3. 6. 4. Sectoral-level asset reserves Resilience and continued operations at the sectoral level are elements of comprehensive defence that are critical for defending Latvia. Availability of critical materials and resources in the initial stages of a crisis is essential in ensuring critical services and preventing na- tional-level threats. Each sector must define a list of essential goods and services crucial for threat response at the sectoral level. Essential reserves and secure supply of materials and resources are fundamental and should be co- vered by local industries when needed. It is necessary to improve sectoral product compli- ance assurance systems, speed up new product certification and market authorisation in times of crisis. Ensuring of sufficient supply of food, other essential goods and emergency products to the government sector and society is crucial in ti- mes of crisis or war. Private sector should help develop logistics solutions that ensure mana- gement, supply and stockpiling of essential locally produced food and industrial products during times of peace, crisis or war. 3. 6. 5. Industry Latvia needs to continue rolling out policies and programs supporting the development of national defence and security industry and build close cooperation with its players. The primary objective of such support and coope- ration with local economic actors is secure sup- ply of materials, resources and assets essential for NAF, access to necessary resource manage- ment expertise and building of extended mobi- lisation resource pool according to NAF needs. Meaningful and efficient support for the deve- lopment of the industry requires clearly defi- ned national priorities. These priorities have to be based on thorough analysis of national economic potential and NAF capability deve- lopment priorities. Current national-level priorities are develop- ment of unmanned systems, arms, maintenan- ce of NAF support and combat vehicles and equipment, individual equipment systems and components, cyber security, information and communications systems. 3. 6. 6. Strategic partnerships Meaningful and coordinated development of mobilisation resource pool, secure supply of materials, resources and services required for functioning of NAF based on national-level priorities, require strategic partnerships betwe- 28 en the sector organisations and defence indus- try players. Strategic partnerships need to be created in priority areas such as maintenance of NAF combat vehicles and equipment, ammunition manufacturing and development of locally produced communication equipment to ensure security of supply during crisis or war. Successful implementation of the Concept depends on prior cooperation between defen- ce sector and industry players, availability of expertise, know-how, manufacturing assets and investments. Industry must also ensure compliance with legal requirements applicable to strategic goods manufacturers and suppliers. Development of the strategic partnerships concept takes into account such considerati- ons as gradual implementation of cooperation projects, integration with NAF reserve, mobi- lisation and comprehensive defence systems, National Guard, compliance with profit margin limiting rules, complete audits and readiness to invest in future development projects. 3. 6. 7. Research and innovation Innovation is a crucial element of the deve- lopment and competitiveness of national in- dustry. Efficient transfer and implementation of innovative technologies will lead to signifi- cant boost of NAF capacity to deliver in terms of state defence despite limitations stemming from resource constraints faced by the sector. Latvia needs to create a national innovation support framework and promote integration of national research and development frameworks into the scientific programmes of the EU and NATO to create a stronger environment for defence sector innovations. However, Latvia must also be aware of financial risks associa- ted with R&D activities and implementation of technological innovations. Innovation support measures must be alig- ned with national priorities and lead to new, ground-breaking technologies in fields with greater R&D potential at the national level. 3. 6. 8. Mobilisation Testing framework established by the Mobi- lisation Law requires NAF to update Mobilisa- tion Plan every year to reflect the current capa- bility gaps and resources of the civilian sector required to ensure functions of NAF in case of mobilisation. In case of war, NAF may need to temporarily take over control of certain areas and properties necessary for NAF and allied force training, force integration, maintenance and tactical movements. Early identification of resource gaps is crucial in making sure ap- propriate mobilisation requests are being made. Mobilisation levels of National Armed Forces 29 can be determined through snap mobilisation training, whereas mobilisation readiness and mobilisation personnel training require prior planning and delivery of such training in con- junction with business operators who have re- ceived mobilisation requests. In case of crisis, economic operators must provide NAF and allied forces with all neces- sary support: power supply, medical services, civilian communications, catering and other services that are vital in performance of state defence tasks. Regular exercises and testing of economic operators’ readiness to mobilise is a must once relevant economic operators are trained and ready to meet their mobilisation objectives. Appropriate supply flexibility is also essential. 30 4. concludIng remarks Ministry of Defence shall finance the imple- mentation of the State Defence Concept from the allocated sector funding. State Defence Concept and NAF Development Plan form the basis for medium-term plan- ning, including documents such as Defence Minister’s Guidelines for development of sta- te defence framework and next year’s budget plans. National Armed Forces development plans must contribute to continuity of the State De- fence Concept. Plans must identify and con- sider NAF capabilities, which are critical in ensuring delivery of key components of state defence system. Concept is the basis for Defence Minister’s Guidelines for development of state defence framework. These guidelines contain specific operational planning tasks that relevant unit commanders need to perform to enhance state defence. According to National Security Law, State De- fence Concept is approved by the Parliament at least once every election cycle, but not later than 1 October of the second year of the res- pective convocation. 31 KONCEPCIJA _GoBack Introduction 1.

It defines the strategic fra- mework, priorities and peacetime, military  conflict and wartime national-level military de- fence responsibilities. State Defence planning  is coherent with military defence plans and po- litical safeguards of collective defence provi- ded by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation  (NATO). According to National Security Law,  State Defence Plan must be aligned with Mili- tary Threat Analysis and framework laid out in  the State Defence Concept.  State defence concerns every citizen of Latvia.  It is, therefore, the responsibility of the gover- nment, public authorities and every resident of  Latvia. If we all take our and our country’s se- curity seriously, we as a society will become  better prepared for any potential crisis or other  contingency. People need to constantly be awa- re of current security challenges and how they  can contribute to state defence efforts.    The new State Defence Concept is released at  a time when our society continues to feel the  pressures of volatile international security si- tuation and different kinds of non-military  threats, such as cybersecurity threats, disin- formation and hostile propaganda, socio-eco- nomic challenges of the pandemic, natural  calamities and other contingencies that have  significant impact on public safety, health and  well-being, as well as the overall stability in  the country. As government tackles all of the  above concerns, it must ensure military vigi- lance and combat readiness of its army. It must  also continue to implement a comprehensive  armed forces capability development program- me. Current regional security context requires  Latvia to continue its consistent and pragma- tic steps towards stronger state defence, which  will allow us to withstand external pressure  and achieve faster post-crisis recovery.     2   1. InTernaTIonal securITy  1. 1. Global trends  Rules-based international order, which emer- ged after the World War II and became uni- versally accepted after the Cold War, is going  through changes. Although conventions and  international treaties are still in force and le- gally binding, and security institutions and ins- truments still work, some countries choose to  blatantly ignore international obligations and  sovereignty, territorial integrity of other states.   Current trends affecting the international or- der are driven by politics of force and rivalry,  which creates even further uncertainty about  international security in future. Diversity of  security challenges, including technological  developments, terrorism, climate change and  pandemic, is a serious concern for global secu- rity in a polycentric world.  Global networks are fragmented and we see  increasing attempts to act unilaterally, to use  blunt force to resolve disputes, in cases when  multilateral dialogue should be set up. If igno- red, such policies may escalate the risk of ag- gression and conflicts. Given the geopolitical  environment around Latvia, the importance of  strengthening national defence capabilities and  closer cooperation with NATO will only incre- ase under such scenario.  Military presence of allied NATO countries  in the region and their direct support is an im- portant factor in Latvia’s security. On the ot- her hand, different dynamics between allies  may also influence our national security. The  United States of America (USA) has changed  its political stance on how to maintain global  order. Its expectations to see other partners ma- king equal contribution to collective defence  are reasonable. Although European countries  have made notable progress in recent years, in- sufficient military spending still hampers their  ability to adequately respond to military thre- ats in Europe and other regions of the world.  European countries still rely heavily on the US  military resources both in collective defence  and international missions.   Fourth industrial revolution has given us new  technologies that will have a profound effect  on state defence and social structure. New  technologies, more powerful social media and  our increasing dependence on gadgets is alre- ady affecting the way we consume informa- tion, exposing new vulnerabilities and giving  rise to new ways to manipulate us. Such pro- cesses pose greater danger for democracies,  while authoritarian regimes with their firm grip  on social media and internet, as well as use of  new technologies to control and persecute their  people, will find that welcoming.  Terrorist groups and organisations continue to  interfere with domestic policies and internatio-    3   nal affairs. Terrorist attacks in Europe, Middle  East, Afghanistan, Northern Africa and Sahel  region have intensified. The risk of terrorist  organisations capitalising on the financial and  political weaknesses of underdeveloped coun- tries and imposing alternative, non-conventio- nal forms of government has increased.  Private military and security companies  are  deeply embedded in on-going military con- flicts. De facto use of private military and se- curity companies  for achieving  national in- terests, while denying any involvement with  mercenaries, has become a pattern for some  countries. These private entities are used as a  tool for accessing services such as logistics, re- connaissance, military protection and training,  which  have traditionally been provided by go- vernment players. As private military and secu- rity companies acquire a greater role in future  international interventions, the security risks  associated with them increase and likelihood  of them meddling within sovereign states’ in- ternal affairs becomes more and more real.  Global climate changes are already making  some regions of the world uninhabitable,  which leads to new conflicts and movement of  people. New migration patterns have a direct  and indirect impact on Europe’s security, as  well. Pandemics, industrial accidents and natu- ral disasters may have  severe effects on Latvia  and other socially and technologically highly  developed allies. This could in turn affect the   security situation in unexpected ways. .  COVID19 pandemic clearly exposed the we- aknesses of globalisation and global economic  risks. Concentration of production of critical  goods  in particular countries may cause seri- ous  problems with regard to security of supply  and shortage of critical goods on the market  during a crisis. We can also see that some coun- tries will stop at nothing  to fulfil their geopo- litical ambitions, including making use of the   the pandemic.   Global trends show that the balance of power  has shifted and it is becoming increasingly dif- ficult to maintain peace and stability with dip- lomatic and economic means. Allies in Europe  and North America, and their military and tech- nological advancements, are being challenged  by other centres of power that are looking to  extend their domination on international are- na. Allied nations need to remain united and  committed to collective defence, continue to  build their own national defence capabilities,  demonstrate solidarity and keep credible deter- rence and defence posture.  1. 2. Regional trends   Security situation in the Baltic Sea region has  been influenced by Russia’s provocative and  aggressive military and hybrid activities for a  while. But it has become considerably worse  since Russia’s aggression against Ukraine in     4   2014. Russia interferes in elections, political  and social processes of other countries. It uses  information warfare and cyber-attacks. Crack- down on Russian dissidents intensifies. Russia  continues to rattle its weapons in a behaviour  considered to be a relic since the end of the  Cold War up until recently. Russia is following  a clear pattern: as long as there is no punish- ment or retribution, anything goes.  Aggression against Ukraine and attempts to  limit the sovereignty of Belarus clearly show  that Russia’s appetite is growing. Attempts  to change the geopolitical landscape of Euro- pe will only intensify. Use of military power  cannot be ruled out either. The favourite nar- rative of the Kremlin about Russia being ‘the  last standing fortress’ surrounded by enemies is  still popular among its people who are content  with harsh socio-economic realities of their life  and consider aggression against neighbouring  counties acceptable.  Russian state-controlled media continue to  purposefully paint a negative image of Latvia  as a country where Nazi ideas are widely sup- ported and Russians are hated. As a result, ac- cording to opinion polls conducted in Russia,  many Russians consider Latvia one of its main  long-time enemies. Russia is likely to continue  to portray Latvia as a hostile country and also  a failed state. That is how Russia  justifies its  confrontational policy and tries to hide from its  own population the fact that after the collapse   of the Soviet Union Baltic countries have deve- loped more successfully.  In recent years Russia has made huge invest- ments into development of its military capa- bilities pointed at the West, one of its strate- gic directions. New military units are formed,  weapons modernised, and military formations  stationed in the Kaliningrad region are being  reinforced. The main focus of Russia’s mili- tary training and capability development pro- jects is mobility of its forces, high readiness  forces and blocking of access to the Baltic Sea  by water and  air. Realistically, Russia cannot  afford a full scale global-level conventional  war with NATO. That is why Russia focuses  on more realistic scenarios like hybrid warfare  and sudden attack that would give it an advan- tage of surprise, allowing it to capture territo- ries easier, just like in the case of Georgia and  Ukraine. Russia has also clearly indicated and  even threatened that it might use nuclear wea- pons if necessary.  As Russia continues its aggression against Uk- raine, it also proceeds with  its efforts to divide  the members of NATO and the European Union  (EU). Russia  actively seeks allies amongst  member states who would help it apply the  necessary political pressure to either fully or  partly lift the sanctions imposed against it. So- lidarity and unity among  the member states of  NATO and the EU will be crucial in showing  Russia that any attempts to drive a wedge be-    5   tween them will not succeed and active dialo- gue is the best way forward.  Introduction of different deterrence measures  in the Baltic region since 2014, including de- velopment of national capabilities and deploy- ment of NATO forces, has allowed to reduce  security threats in the region. National security  and defence of the Baltic countries will depend  on their ability to upgrade national capabilities  and benefit from NATO’s collective defence.  2. sTraTegIc sTaTe defence ob- jecTIves  2. 1. Primary state defence objective  Latvian people and the state are constantly in- fluenced by geopolitical developments around  the world and in Europe.  Our nation has had to  face existential threats numerous times in the  past and we have successfully overcome them.  That is why state defence is the very cornersto- ne of continuity of the Latvian State and nation.   The objective of the state defence system is  to prevent and eliminate potential threats to  national security, assure national sovereignty,  ensure that government and its departments  can operate and provide continuity, protect the  people and make sure every citizen of Latvia  feels responsible for the state and its  security.  2. 2. State defence strategy   The objective of the State defence strategy is to  make sure Latvia has a robust defence system,  which allows to maximise any potential dama- ges to an aggressor while minimising its gains,  and thus deter any potential attack.    National Armed Forces will always protect  Latvia against any military attack, irrespecti- ve of the size of the aggressor’s army. It will  not stand down and will try to create as much  damage to the potential aggressor as possible.  Moreover, one of the pillars of Latvia’s state  defence is NATO’s collective defence pro- visions. At the same time, population of Latvia  must clearly understand that nobody is going  to protect Latvia but the people of Latvia them- selves and they need to be ready to stand up for  their country.   Considering the development of modern tech- nologies and more intricate ways of influencing  public attitudes, including the use of online and  big data tools, the deterrence is no longer about  military preparedness only. Deterrence de- pends on people’s will to defend their country  and prepare for any potential emergency well  in advance. Peacetime psychological resilience  of the society is becoming increasingly impor- tant in countering external influence and ensu- ring deterrence.   Comprehensive defence is the best tool for     6   achieving societal resilience. Comprehensive  defence not only makes us more prepared for  peacetime and wartime crisis, it also reduces   distrust between people and the government  and contributes to a more cohesive society  overall.  Here are the four pillars of state defence:  •  NATIONAL ARMED FORCES. Mission  of the National Armed Forces is to ensure  the continuity of the state, make sure gover- nment is operational and army can quickly  respond to sudden attacks, quickly detect  any covert aggression, identify, assess and  eliminate any potential threat. In case of  large-scale military aggression, National  Armed Forces have to use their assets to  weaken the enemy and prevent it from ma- king any progress, as well as cause maxi- mum damage possible to the aggressor. In  case of full or partial temporary occupation  of Latvia, National Armed Forces must help  people join the resistance.  •  COMPREHENSIVE DEFENCE. Objec- tive of comprehensive defence is to make  sure public authorities, non-governmen- tal actors and citizens are ready to defend  their state, help National Armed Forces,  maintain vital functions of the society and  economy and engage in civil defence in a  time of war. Societal resilience is rooted in  psychological resilience against external  factors. It also involves advance individual   level preparedness for a potential crisis or  war by disseminating instructions on how  to act and what to do in case of crisis or war.  •  NATO COLLECTIVE DEFENCE. Main  elements of NATO’s collective defence,  which deter potential aggressors from at- tacking Latvia, are unity of NATO member  states, presence of allied troops in Latvia  and credibility of the Article 5 of the North  Atlantic Treaty .   •  INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION.  Closer bilateral military cooperation pri- marily with the US, Canada, the Baltic Sea  region countries and largest allies in Europe  is key to credible deterrence and adequa- te national-level preparedness for external  aggression. European Union should play a  greater role in shaping security policy and  build closer ties with NATO. Cooperation  should lead to smoother exchange of infor- mation, regional defence partnerships, joint  participation in international missions and  post-aggression support to partner countries  like Georgia and Ukraine.  3. sTaTe defence framework  3. 1. National Armed Forces  National Armed Forces (NAF) are the backbo- ne of the state defence system. Development  of NAF is centred around efficient defence ag- ainst different kinds of attacks. Defence system     7   must be capable of detecting potential threats  early on.   In order to  successfully defend Latvia, Na- tional Armed Forces must make full use of  Latvia’s unique terrain, stoping any advances  of the enemy, inflicting maximum damage to  its personnel and equipment, disabling and  destroying the command, control and supply  chains, and ensuring host nation support for  allied forces.  .   The main operational component of the Natio- nal Armed Forces  consists of Regular Force,  National Guard and National Armed Forces  Reserve. Here are the key goals of National  Armed Forces development:  •  mobility •  highly decentralised command, control and   supply systems •  highest survivability standards •  interoperability  •  high firepower •  resilience against electronic warfare •  efficient management and maintenance of   military assets •  highest technological standards   If defence spending remains at its current le- vel, army will be able to develop only its core  functions. Development of capabilities such as  medium-range air and missile defence, active  defence at sea and longrange indirect fire sup-  port remain long-term goals. Latvia is therefo- re forced to rely on its allies for missing capa- bilities, including financial support required to  fill capability gaps.   3. 1. 1. Conventional defence   3. 1. 1. 1. Early warning system   Considering the military upgrades imple- mented by Russia, mainly focusing on high  readiness and mobility units, Latvia needs to  upgrade its national early warning system to  minimise the risks of a sudden attack and pro- vide decision makers with most accurate and  timely data.   Data collection, analysis and dissemination for  timely decision-making is the responsibility  of state security services and NAF. Early war- ning system must integrate State Border Gu- ard systems  and external border infrastructure  management systems. Efficient early warning  system must:  •  alert on any changes •  provide decision-makers with instant upda-  tes  •  simulate potential response scenarios.   3. 1. 1. 2. Command, control and com- munication systems  Battlefield situational awareness and quick,     8   efficient communication among  strategic,  operational and tactical levels are  major pre- conditions for successful defence operati- ons. Command, control and communication  systems have to be able to operate in various  conditions, including environments where sig- nals are being supressed, GPS may not be trac- ked and other weapons of electronic warfare  are used. Command and control system must  also provide secure communications, prevent  data interception and  other types of attempted  manipulation. .   3. 1. 1. 3. Rapid response   Rapid response is one of the key capabilities  of National Armed Forces and National Guard,  and in time of war also State Border Guard   and the Central Bank. To be able to efficiently  defend itself, Latvia needs to maintain a cer- tain number of highly prepared rapid response  units.   These units are primarily made up of Land For- ces Mechanised Infantry Brigade and National  Guard brigades. National Guard battalions are  required to maintain company-size high readi- ness units with all necessary support elements,  such as indirect fire support, anti-armour capa- bility, air defence capability. National Armed  Forces as well as the responsible state security  services and law enforcement services need to  be able to respond to any threat immediately.  They must also be capable of responding to a   direct attack. Enhanced response of Vidzeme  and Latgale National Guard brigades can be  achieved through closer integration of these  units with professional army units.  3. 1. 1. 4. Integration of State Border  Guard  and Central Bank’s Security De- partment   State Border Guard  and Central Bank’s Se- curity Department are required to join NAF in  case of a military attack as a primary reinfor- cement. Closer integration and improved com- patibility of State Border Guard  and Central  Bank’s Security Department with NAF will  enhance the ability of these units to contribute  to state defence. NATO certification and basic  military training is the most appropriate way  of ensuring that these units meet the applicable  defence capability standards.   State Border Guard must ensure appropriate  number and size of units that can cover the  whole length of the external border of Latvia.   3. 1. 1. 5. Combat readiness  High standards of combat readiness require  NAF to organise regular training at  various le- vels. NAF must organise NAMEJS, a compre- hensive military exercise for its personnel and  staff of other government agencies responsib- le for state defence and security, at least once  every four years. Training must be as realistic     9   and close to actual combat as possible. For this  purpose more exercises must be organised out- side military training grounds  allowing each  unit to practice within their designated area.    NAF wartime units must be activated, conduc- ting  full personnel training and mobilisation of  infrastructure and assets, including private sec- tor and civil defence systems.  Latvia must also  continue to host joint Baltic exercises, coordi- nate training with NATO military formations,  work on force  coordination and seamless col- laboration in a single operational framework.   Regular snap combat readiness drills must be  organised  for testing unit training, prepared- ness, combat readiness and  capability levels.  These drills should give a better understanding  of unit response plans, readiness of military  personnel to respond to national level threats  and readiness of units to get fully operational  and engage in military operations at short no- tice.      Strategic-level exercise KRISTAPS must be  conducted at least every 12 months to test the  emergency management plans, crisis and war- time response plans of the Cabinet of Ministers,  ministries and other governmental institutions.    3. 1. 1. 6. Defence decentralisation  Decentralisation and operational coordination  at unit level is crucial for NAF to be able to   effectively resist any aggression throughout  the territory of Latvia.   Tactical training of smaller units is therefore  instrumental. Unit commanders of all levels,  from top to section level, must be capable of  taking the leadership and coordinating overall  strategic, operational and tactical delivery. Pre- cise information about enemy units and com- munication among  various units is essential in  achieving these goals.   According to Article 25 of the National Securi- ty Law, unit commanders need to be adequately  trained and ready to get engaged in state defen- ce based on State  Defence Operational Plan  without instructions from the top.    3. 1. 1. 7. Infrastructure  NAF and Latvia as a host country need to de- velop regional training infrastructure, training  areas and firing ranges. Development of di- fferent types of warehouse facilities is also a  priority.  Gradual development of National Guard batta- lion infrastructure shall improve decentralised  operations and supply. Further standardisation  of military facilities and infrastructure is im- portant for the efficient development and con- venient maintenance of these assets. Wider use  of environmentally friendly wooden materials  suitable for Latvia’s climatic conditions should     10   also be encouraged.   3. 1. 1. 8. Counter-mobility  Development of counter-mobility systems is  a peacetime activity, which involves finding  the right cooperation partners, proactive infra- structure adjustments, identification of human  resource and training needs and delivery of spe- cific military exercise. NAF should continue to  enhance its counter-mobility cooperation with  private sector, conduct regular counter-mobili- ty execution operations, including mobilisation  of required resources, during regular military  training.   NAF should build a system that allows cons- tructing reinforcing obstacles in early stages of  conflict or even peacetime. In case of a military  conflict, defence minister may decide to remo- ve specific civil infrastructure and substitute it  with necessary operational counter-mobility  solutions.   3. 1. 1. 9. Peacetime and wartime logis- tics  management  Centralised procurement system for NAF, Na- tional Guard and Cadet Force   is managed on  day to day basis by professional competence  centre, a civilian agency which is gradually  consolidating defence procurements, opera- tes the single asset inventory, distribution and  quality control system. It also promotes unified   standards and enhances technical and supply  management competences.   One of the key priorities of NAF with regard to  logistics is development of combat , logistics,  supply and maintenance units.  3. 1. 1. 10. Host nation  support  It is the responsibility of Latvia as the host na- tion to provide other allies with support during  peacetime and early stages of a crisis. Host na- tion support includes access to vital resources,  infrastructure, locations, and in case of military  conflict also priority access to national airports,  ports and motorways. In peacetime bureaucra- tic hurdles need to be minimised to ensure free  movement of allied forces across NATO and  EU. EU-level decisions must be made. Infra- structure must also be adapted for military mo- bility.   In terms of host nation  support priorities, Lat- via needs to continue focusing on development  of Liepāja Port and Lielvārde airfield. New  infrastructure projects, for example, Rail Bal- tic need to be suitable for military needs. This  includes construction of railway link to Camp  Ādaži. Military mobility parameters agreed by  NATO and EU countries need to be followed  when building or repairing roads and bridges.  Government institutions responsible for host  nation  support planning and delivery need to     11   build their own asset reserves, infrastructure,  sector-specific expertise and analytical capaci- ty that meet support standards and obligations  stipulated in relevant legal acts.  3. 1. 1. 11. Cooperation with civilian sec- tor  A deeper permanent cooperation with civilian  sector is key in ensuring functions of NAF and  basic needs of the society during wartime.   NAF must strengthen its medical capabilities  and cooperation with Latvian universities on  integration of military medicine in universi- ty curriculum. NAF must also cooperate with  healthcare sector on crisis management trai- ning and scenario-based response planning for  potential aggression.  Integration of State Border Guard , Central  Bank’s Security Department, Information  Technology Security Incident Response In- stitution, Latvian Environment, Geology and  Meteorology Centre, A/S ‘Latvijas Gaisa sa- tiksme’ and Civil Aviation Agency with NAF  must be tested on regular basis. Stakeholders  must also take part in planning and military  exercises.  Civil protection system is part of the state de- fence framework. It is fundamental for effi- cient and comprehensive  defence, as it ensures  the coordination between civilian and military   sectors, resource coordination and harmonisa- tion of capabilities. Implementation of NATO’s  basic standards in civilian sector is crucial in  ensuring critical services to people and civilian  support during military operations. Civil pro- tection system must be able to provide basic  needs of the population during peacetime, war- time, military attack or threats.  Civilian protection operational command cen- tre is responsible for the functioning of civil  protection system during war, military attack  or danger. Its procedures and analytical ca- pacity must be improved and regularly tested  during crisis management exercises. . Civilian  protection operational command centre must  work together with NAF, as well as govern- ment institutions, companies and local civil  defence commissions .   Exchange of information between all stake- holders responsible for crisis management is  absolutely crucial for reaching common goals  of civil-military cooperation. To ensure the  efficient coordination of crisis response, civil  and military communication networks must be  secure and protected against any attempts to  disrupt them.  3. 1. 2. Protection against hybrid threats  The level of hybrid threats in Latvia is constant- ly high. It is important to strengthen  resilience  of the society and boost capabilities required     12   to respond to such threats on daily basis and in  case of aggression.   Considering the rather limitless opportunities  to execute influence operations and the wide  range of technologies for social engineering,  society must be ready to cope with new types  of security challenges. NAF, national security  community and other responsible authorities  need to upgrade the capacity to identify, record  and expose hybrid threats targeting Latvia.   Efficient functioning, cooperation and  speed  of reaction of government bodies are  crucial  for defending the state against hybrid threats.  Crisis management procedures and awareness  of responsible officials need to be regularly  upgraded to make sure that top government of- ficials can take decisions quickly and based on  the right information that allows them to either  contain threats or eliminate them entirely.    3. 1. 3. Resistance  It is the duty of every citizen to defend their  country and show either active or passive re- sistance to aggressor. In case of sudden mili- tary attack each unit of NAF and every civilian  institution know exactly what they need to do  according to State Defence Plan. They do not  need to be told when to start defending Latvia.   NAF and government authorities will conti- nue to defend Latvia even if  control over part   of the country’s territory is lost during a war.  They will continue to resist the aggressor until  a point where territorial sovereignty of Latvia  is fully restored. National Security Law spe- cifies precise responsibilities of NAF in case  of war or military attack. It also stipulates  people’s rights and obligations in time of war  or military attack.   NAF must plan and prepare for resistance  proactively. Civilian population is engaged  in counter-mobility and resistance operations  on voluntary and mutual trust basis. This can  be achieved through peacetime education of  population and setting up  coordination fra- meworks and adequate support infrastructure.   3. 2. Comprehensive  defence system  Country may be lost without a fight if people are  not ready to defend themselves. Public aware- ness, resilience against  manipulation attempts,  practical knowledge on how to overcome cri- sis and civic participation are fundamental for  stability and safety of the society. Sustainable  development of Latvia is impossible without  state defence and societal resilience.  Knowledge and decisive action at an individu- al level are key for crisis preparedness, mana- gement and recovery. Comprehensive  defence  requires culture of preparedness.  Society ne- eds to put effort into getting themselves ready  for possible worst-case scenarios. People need     13   to support each other in their private and social  circle to give each other more reassurance and  build the necessary level of psychological re- silience. Strengthening of National Guard and  Cadet Force  is essential because these orga- nisations provide all citizens with possibility to  prepare for potential threats while continuing  to live a civil life.   Comprehensive defence serves a twofold pur- pose of building peacetime societal resilience  and ensuring state defence during war. Here  are the main crisis and wartime priorities of  comprehensive defence system:  1) public support for National Armed Forces in  ensuring state defence:  •  participation in National Armed Forces and  armed resistance  •  host nation  support to allied forces •  counter-mobility operations •  all kinds of support to NAF and allies (for   example, to facilitate information exchan- ge, supply and other functions/activities)  •  resistance movement and support, passive  resistance (for example, refusal to colla- borate with aggressor’s army, civil disobe- dience)  2) capacity of society and economy to deliver  critical services and manage all kinds of con- tingencies, including military conflict:  •  government functioning, efficient response  and continuity   •  clear wartime tasks and responsibilities of  each institution and local government, pre- cisely defined critical human resources and  functions  •  undisrupted access to critical services (for  example, electricity, communications, fi- nancial services, food, critical infrastructu- re and personnel safety) at all times   •  proactive supply and accumulation of raw  materials and other resources for critical  services  •  timely preparedness for crisis or war across  all levels of society, including individual le- vel of every citizen.  3. 2. 1. Continuity of government  Continuous delivery of core government func- tions during a potential crisis or war requires  preliminary work on relevant protocols across  all levels of institutional framework, including  the office of the president, parliament, Cabinet  of Ministers and other government and local  institutions. It also requires national security  community continuity, as well as capacity to  tackle tasks critical for functioning of the so- ciety.   Considering how dependent government insti- tutions and society have become on technolo- gies and access to data,   security of information     14   systems plays a significant role in government  continuity during a crisis or war.   Finally, each public body should have well-de- fined responsibilities and role in the context of  state defence. Core functions need to be clearly  identified, ensuring their continuity at all times.   3. 2. 2. Societal resilience  Public involvement is indispensable to com- prehensive  defence. Civic engagement of Lat- vian population is crucial. People need to take  greater responsibility for what is happening in  the country. This includes national defence.   Latvia needs to promote the culture of prepa- redness. Each non-governmental organisation,  private company and government institution  needs to accept its responsibility for ensuring  readiness to any potential crisis. Societal resi- lience plays a major part in building this cultu- re. It involves timely education and prepared- ness for wartime response, including people’s  ability to survive and take care of themselves  for as long as possible or at least for the initi- al 72 hours. Dissemination of information and  training on the best courses of action in case  of threats must be stepped up. In addition, re- gular workshops, training and presentations to  various groups of the society need to be rolled  out. Latvia must offer hands on training to all  groups and communities in our society.  Every individual’s knowledge and skills can be  crucial in supporting state defence. All kinds  of assets and resources can make a differen- ce. Psychological support to the victims and  families of essential workers on the front line  of crisis management and mitigation can be es- sential.  3. 2. 3. Information space security  Government must use different available re- sources to ensure that information space is pro- tected. Every citizen of Latvia must be aware  that individual and general protection against  influence operations and information space at- tacks is a continuous process.  Media literacy training of the society must be  continued through school and university cur- riculum and targeted training designed for va- rious social groups. It is also important to conti- nue communicating with various groups of the  society to make them fully aware of the current  information space challenges and threats, and  thus promote critical thinking and psychologi- cal resilience against influence operations.   In addition, defence sector must create an in- tegrated strategic communication platform  based on various communication channels. In  case of military threat to our country, strate- gic communication platform and various other  activities in the information space would con- tribute to more efficient response of Latvia to     15   information warfare and psychological opera- tions which are an integral part of any conflict.   Latvia must promote strong awareness across  all levels about the harms of foreign influence  operations. Government must prepare a toolkit  for countering all kinds of influence operati- ons against Latvia. This kind of preparedness  would give potential aggressor a clear strate- gic signal that Latvia will have zero tolerance  against influence operations both in times of  peace and war.    3. 2. 4. Economic resilience  Every business in Latvia  has a  role in state  defence. However, businesses, products and  services of which are critical for state defence  during a crisis, are particularly valuable.  Providers of these services must continue  operating despite crisis or war. They must  provide continuous functioning of national  economy and keep the supply of necessary  products and services running. Consequently,   security of supply and economic and  technological dependence on countries that  do not belong to NATO or the EU is a serious  business consideration for these companies.   Government must build a state emergency  reserves system that meets the above require- ments. The system would be triggered upon   early indications of potential threat and utilise  options contracts. It would also restrict exports  of food, medicines and strategic raw mate- rials. By delegating mobility responsibilities  to trusted business operators during peaceti- me, Latvia can create an efficient framework  for structured private sector contribution to  state defence. Government institutions must  identify the needs and create state emergency  reserves system. This would enhance econo- mic resilience and ensure that government can  continue providing vital services and functions  despite the crisis.  In peacetime business owners can help  strengthen state defence by encouraging their  employees to join National Guard and National  Armed Forces Reserve and create National  Guard units in their companies, which also  contributes to better physical security of their  assets during a potential crisis.   3. 2. 5. Non-governmental sector  All citizens can contribute to national policies.  Voting is not the only way to influence national  policies as a citizen. In democracy citizens  must self- organise to be able to promote  their agenda, help improve everyday life and  efficiency of government institutions. Constant  self-organising is crucial in today’s complex  communicative and manipulative environment.  Only by helping each other will people be able  to better understand what is happening outside     16   their social circle and distinguish  between  what is important and what is not when a crisis  comes.   Mutual trust between people and confidence  in government is absolutely vital for state se- curity and development. In case of crisis, trust  towards one another and the government can  be decisive in country’s ability to consolidate  around efforts to overcome crisis.  Non-governmental organisations play an im- portant  part in providing this link. NGOs need  to be involved in defence planning and delivery  of theoretical and practical training. Govern- ment, on the other hand, must clearly define the  role and responsibilities of NGOs in delivering  functions and tasks delegated to them.   And, last but not least, in peacetime NGOs  must contribute to educating society and pro- viding necessary skills. Social partners should  also raise public awareness about crisis res- ponse. In case of emergency, NGOs should be  able to help people and disseminate verified  information by also engaging Latvian diaspora  abroad for these purposes.   3. 2. 6. Church  Church plays a major role in strengthening  psychological resilience of religious groups of  population during a crisis or war. Church may  help religious groups cope better with shocks   and motivate them to help others around them.  Another important way in which religious or- ganisations can help Latvia in case of crisis or  war is to help spread credible information, help  victims and provide solace to those affected or  touched by the crisis, especially wartime tra- gedies.  3. 2. 7. Civil resistance  In cases when aggressor’s force temporarily ta- kes over control of a part of our country’s ter- ritory, and Latvia is under a real threat, civilian  population must retreat to the parts of the coun- try still controlled by National Armed Forces  and allied troops if possible.  Citizens have the duty to decline collabora- tion with illegitimately appointed government  officials and institutions, occupying power or  aggressor’s army, and continue passive resis- tance. This can be achieved by distancing one- self from decisions and actions of occupying  power, avoiding mass events organised by  occupying power, non-disclosure of informa- tion and boycotting of illegal elections, refe- rendums or popular votes held by enemy go- vernment.  Covert support of people is decisive for the su- ccess of the resistance movement. People can  help by, for example, offering resources, me- dical help and supplies, information, financial,  communications, training, recruitment, recon-    17   naissance and other assistance to members of  the civil resistance  movement, armed resistan- ce, NAF and allied troops. There are different  ways in which every citizen of Latvia can con- tribute to the resistance movement. In the me- antime, citizens also have to take into account  the associated security risks.   3. 2. 8. Cyber security  One of the integral elements of comprehensi- ve  defence is cyber security and IT resilience.  Greater focus on cyber security training (cyber  hygiene) and sticking to minimum security  standards can help reduce risks (vulnerabili- ties) to government institutions, society and  businesses, and ensure continuous operations.  It is also advisable to keep reducing depen- dence on technologies produced by countries  with aggressive cyberspace strategies against  NATO, the European Union or their  member  states.   With introduction of fifth generation mobi- le networks (5G) strategic security agenda of  many countries is dominated by 5G network  security and its technical, technological and  political elements.  It also requires people and the society at large  to change their habits and reduce digital secu- rity risks like storing of personal data on unsafe  servers and downloading unverified mobile ap- plications. People must also critically evaluate   whether it is appropriate to allow open use of  their personal data on various platforms.   Cyber security should be a part of education  curriculum. It should be one of the topics in  state  defence lessons . It should also be integ- rated in annual training of government and lo- cal institutions. There is also a need to create a  network of regional units of Cyber Cadet Force   and National Guard Cyber Security Unit.  Protection of information and cyber space in  time of crisis or war should rely on active and  passive defence to prevent any attempts to ap- ply external pressure on the population and to  disable people.   In case of military threat, it is important to en- sure continuous exchange of data and access to  critical services  3. 2. 9. Youth education   Youth education and training is crucial in sha- ping tomorrow’s society of Latvia. Quality of  their education will determine the future resi- lience of the Latvian society against external  factors, constantly increasing technological  pressures and vulnerabilities associated with  the use of technologies.   That is why it is so important to integrate Cadet  Force  and state defence lessons  into schools  and their curriculum. It will help reach the     18   above goals and set up a full scale comprehen- sive  defence system. Meaningful youth state  defence education, patriotic upbringing, civic  awareness, cohesion, leadership and physical  training will significantly enhance internatio- nal competitiveness of Latvia in the future.  Schools across Latvia are currently switching  to skills-based learning, which means that  greater attention can now be given to young  people’s leadership qualities that are essential  for development of Cadet Force and the com- prehensive  defence system.  Cadet Force will  continue to provide voluntary military training  for youth until full introduction of state  defen- ce lessons in national school setting. Informal  Cadet Force education is available to children  and youngsters aged 10 to 21 but the main tar- get group still is Year 5-9 pupils, altogether  8,000 children in different parts of Latvia.  Currently state  defence is an elective course  available to upper secondary (Year 10-11) pu- pils. It teaches young people core state  defence  skills, how to  act in tmes of crisis, critical thin- king and civic patriotism. State  defence trai- ning also gives the essential knowledge, skills  and mindset to deal with  crisis. State  defence  themes should be integrated in other general  education courses and also university curricu- la, too.   Youngsters attending  state defence lessons are  eligible to apply for voluntary state  defence   summer camps. At these camps young peop- le can enhance the training they have received  in classroom setting throughout the academic  year in a real environment and boost their ove- rall physical condition without any risk to their  health. State  defence lessons  will become  part  of mandatory training in all Latvian secondary  schools from 2024/2025 academic year. Every  year around 30,000 young people aged 15-17  will be taught. .    At least 2,000 young people should partici- pate  in voluntary summer camps  each year  to ensure that Latvia has a growing share of  population with military training. This training  is a step towards professional army for those  who want to join armed forces and should also  encourage youngsters to explore opportunities  provided by National Guard, army reserve and  other public jobs. Even if graduates of summer  camps decide not to continue their military ca- reer in active service, they will join the army  reserve and can be mobilised when necessary  because they will have the necessary  resilience  and know how to respond to a crisis. In case  of crisis they will represent the most active,  mobile, knowledgeable and skilful part of the  society and will be able to defend themselves  and others.    State defence lessons  are a modern way of  teaching youngsters about current security  challenges. This course is designed for much  broader target group compared to mandatory     19   military service (conscription), which targets  only a certain part of the society, traditionally  particularly male. Introduction of state defence  lessons  shall rapidly increase the number of ci- tizens with  state defence skills . It is expected  that in 10 years’ time almost third of Latvia’s  population could be trained this way.   Ministry of Defence is planning to create its  own vocational secondary education establish- ment. On top of general education curriculum,  this establishment will provide its pupils skills  and values that will contribute to their intel- lectual and leadership qualities, high sense of  responsibility and other skills necessary for  enhanced physical and mental endurance. This  is how Ministry plans to train future military  commanders and promote leadership among  Latvian army officers. Vocational secondary  education establishment, which will offer gene- ral education curriculum, will focus on STEM  subjects: mathematics, physics, chemistry and  technologies. This will allow future officers to  master the necessary skills for using  modern  combat vehicles.   3. 3. NATO collective defence  Although Latvia is located in a  region domina- ted by a far more superior military power, Lat- via is part of the strongest military alliance in  the world, NATO. NATO contributes to stron- ger deterrence and defence of Latvia. NATO’s  collective defence is instrumental in ensuring   security of Latvia and peace in Europe at large.  3. 3. 1. Regional presence  Allied presence in Latvia shows clear com- mitment of allies to supporting Latvia. It is a  powerful deterrence signal to all potential ag- gressors. Allied presence is strategically im- portant. Permanent presence of NATO forces  in Latvia is the objective that should be pur- sued by all means. Allied forces support NAF  units during operations and are strongly integ- rated in NAF command chain. Allied forces  possess all the required capabilities to meet  support goals. Presence of allied troops can  also be ensured outside formal NATO mecha- nisms, on basis of bilateral or multilateral co- operation agreements between Latvia and res- pective countries.   Further strengthening of NATO Enhanced  Forward Presence Battle Group Latvia is vital  in ensuring more efficient support to Latvian  units responsible for state defence. It will  also  enhance the deterrence effect. It is extremely  important to enhance allied presence with  long-range capabilities such as fire support, air  defence and coastal and port defence systems.  Allied units deployed to Latvia are the core  component of allied presence. Additionally,   among factors contributing to deterrence are:  •  regular international military exercises   hosted in  Latvia    20   •  NATO command headquarters located  in Latvia, especially the Multinational             Division Headquarters North  •  armoured vehicles  and equipment deployed  to Latvia  3. 3. 2. NATO credibility  Attack against one ally is considered an attack  on all allies. That is the principle, which under- pins Alliance’s deterrence policy. Here are the  main elements of NATO’s credibility:  •  readiness to grant political and military sup- port in case of attack  •  military presence of allied forces  countries  facing the biggest threats  •  reinforcement capabilities •  development of national capabilities of   member states via investing at least 2% of  their GDP in defence   •  credible nuclear deterrence policy  Latvia needs to constantly work on the deve- lopment of these elements to make sure NATO  military power is sufficient to guarantee peace  and stability in Latvia and  our allied countries.   NATO collective defence provides a 360-de- gree approach to deter threats and guarantee  the security and sovereignty of all of its mem- ber states.   3. 3. 3. Response readiness  Presence of allied forces does not automatical- ly mean they are ready to respond. NATO must  be able to give instant military response to pre- vent the aggressor from achieving fait accom- pli or making the situation irreversible. NATO  should be able to proactively reinforce national  defence of member states in case of military  tensions to de-escalate a potential conflict.  Modern warfare is becoming increasingly ra- pid. Early warning systems are therefore under  great pressure. NATO must be able to respond  even when warning is given at last minute or  attack is very sudden. Here are the fundamen- tal elements of rapid response:  •  proactive deployment of allied troops to  countries facing imminent security threats  •  well-trained, capable and equipped rapid  reaction units   •  operational defence plans with clear rein- forcement strategies  •  efficient political and military leadership •  high military mobility  Latvia must fill gaps in all of these areas.     Multinational Division Headquarters North,  which is located in Latvia, should become the  framework for enhancing coordinated rapid  response capabilities of NATO forces in case  of a potential crisis.    21   3. 4. International cooperation  3. 4. 1. Strategic partnership with the  United States  US is Latvia’s main strategic partner. US  has  supported our country throughout history  and  has helped significantly strengthen our state  defence ever since we restored our  indepen- dence. Latvia highly appreciates the support  provided by the US, especially the presence  of US troops in Latvia, as well as assistance  in developing NAF capabilities and delivering  joint training.   Latvia needs to continue the existing close co- operation with US in areas such as regional  defence plans, strengthening of military capa- bilities and regular exchange of information  on regional security. Military presence of US  troops in Latvia is a crucial element of our de- terrence capabilities. Further reinforcement of  such presence is the future goal. Another prio- rity is the deployment of US military vehicles,  equipment and assets to Latvia and the Baltic  region.  Latvia and the US  need to continue joint inter- national missions. NAF need to continue joint  projects with Michigan National Guard, which  has been involved in the NAF development for  already three decades now.  3. 4. 2. Baltic cooperation  Estonia and Lithuania have traditionally, politi- cally and geographically been the closest allies  of Latvia. Efficient defence cooperation betwe- en Baltic countries is an essential element of re- gional security, stability and threat prevention.  Latvia strongly supports comprehensive Bal- tic-level military cooperation in all available  formats and efforts to promote common securi- ty and defence policy in different international  formats and forums. Mutual trust, coordination  of military capability development projects,  enhanced compatibility of armed forces and  integration of command and control systems is  key to successful Baltic cooperation.  3. 4. 3. Canada   Canada is the framework nation of NATO En- hanced Forward Presence Battle Group Latvia.  It commands the battle group and is a particu- larly important ally of Latvia. Latvia needs to  continue enhancing its bilateral cooperation  with Canada. Latvia is looking forward to joint  battle group development projects, including  setting up of joint combat support arrange- ments. Latvia should consider joint NAF in- ternational missions with Canadian side and  possible civilian cooperation as a way of ex- panding its successful military cooperation  with Canada.     22   3. 4. 4. The United Kingdom  United Kingdom is one of Latvia’s main al- lies in Europe. UK has consistently supported  strengthening of NATO collective defence and  has had a shared understanding of our regional  security challenges.  UK and Latvia must con- tinue defence cooperation irrespective of how  the future relationship between the UK and the  European Union will form.  Latvia is ready to  continue its participation in various military  cooperation formats coordinated by the UK ,  especially the Joint Expeditionary Force led by  the UK.  3. 4. 5. Poland  Militarily Poland is one Baltic region’s and  Europe’s strongest NATO countries. Poland’s  understanding of the European geopolitical si- tuation  and its geographical proximity makes  Poland  a strategic defence policy partner for  Latvia in the Baltic Sea Region.  Therefore,  intensification of bilateral cooperation with  Poland, together with deepening of Baltic Sea  Region  cooperation in all available formats,  must be continued.   3. 4. 6. Countries of NATO Enhanced  Forward Presence Battle Group Latvia  Canada, Albania, Czech Republic, Iceland,   Italy, Montenegro, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia  and Spain belong to the  group of countries  which form the NATO Enhanced Forward Pre- sence Battle Group Latvia and together make  up a serious contribution to Latvia’s deterrence  and defence capabilities. Latvia highly values  this contribution and shall continue to promote  close bilateral ties with these countries in the  future, as well. Latvia is committed to support  these countries in their future efforts to address  various threats and challenges arising in the  Southern flank, Arctic and Central Europe.   3. 4. 7. Germany  The role played by Germany in defence and  foreign policy areas has significantly increased  since UK’s decision to withdraw from the EU.  Latvia should continue to enhance coopera- tion with Germany on common approach and  action plans for addressing Europe’s strategic  and military threats. Germany plays a major  role in strengthening Baltic Sea region’s de- fence and security. Latvia needs politically and  militarily strong Germany, which can safegu- ard peace and stability in Europe. That is why  bilateral cooperation with Germany is so im- portant. Latvia is looking forward to enhanced  cooperation between military industries and  joint military training delivered together with  Germany. Regional multilateral cooperation  formats are also a good framework for deeper  cooperation with Germany.    23   3. 4. 8. France  France has a significant role in shaping Europe- an security and defence policy. It also contribu- tes to successful implementation of NATO de- terrence policy and Baltic Sea region defence  plans. It is important to continue bringing Bal- tic Sea region defence and successful NATO  deterrence policy closer together.  3. 4. 9. Nordic countries  Considering geographical proximity, similar  threat perception, shared cultural and historical  background, cooperation between Baltic and  Nordic countries should be much deeper.   Building on Northern Group, Nordic-Baltic  and other Baltic Sea region cooperation fra- meworks, Latvia should enhance political and  military cooperation with Scandinavian coun- tries, and thus strengthen regional solidarity.  3. 4. 10. Ukraine and Georgia  Latvia will continue supporting Georgian and  Ukrainian efforts to negotiate the return of  illegally occupied areas by showing solidarity  and non-recognition of occupation. Latvia  will continue to expand bilateral defence  cooperation with these countries and support  further Euro-Atlantic integration of Ukraine  and Georgia.  3. 4. 11. Arms control   Latvia supports peaceful resolution of con- flicts between countries, with full respect for  international laws. Arms control is an essenti- al tool for achieving that. It provides greater  transparency  of military capabilities and faci- litates stable relations among  countries.    However, arms control mechanisms have star- ted eroding  in the past 10 years. There is less  and less transparency and predictability . Exis- ting treaties are being ignored or even violated.  Latvia must contribute to greater awareness  among allies about the importance of ensuring  that all parties fulfil their liabilities. That is the  only way to ensure efficient arms control and  greater safety.   Latvia and its allies have to be ready to use mi- litary means to protect their sovereignty in ca- ses when arms control regimes are violated by  other states parties. Arms control merely com- plements other elements of general defence  and deterrence policy of Latvia in the current  security environment.  The United Nations and Organisation for Se- curity and Cooperation in Europe are the main  multinational bodies working towards reliable  arms control to promote more security.     24   3. 4. 12. NAF role in international mili- tary operations and rapid response for- ces  In order to promote safety in regions surroun- ding Europe and maximise the impact of in- ternational organisations, Latvia will continue  to contribute its military resources to interna- tional operations and rapid response forces.  Participation in international missions and  rapid response forces gives NAF troops ad- ditional experience and skills. It gives NAF  combat units higher level of preparedness and  interoperability with allied forces. NAF needs  to develop and sustain a capability  to contri- bute one battalion-size unit to any of the pe- ace-keeping operations for at least two rotation  periods in order to be capable to contribute in  international security efforts more effectively.  Participation in these operations depends on  current operational needs of Latvian defence  sector.   3. 5. European Union  Latvia believes that the Common Security and  Defence Policy of the European Union (EU)  must remain a member state competence, sub- ject to unanimous consent. Latvia is ready to  continue contributing to the Common Security  and Defence Policy of the EU  and participate   in EU military missions and operations car- ried out in regions that have direct impact on   security of EU member states. Balanced and  efficient regional support to partner countries,  including Eastern Partnership countries, and  their armed forces through European Peace Fa- cility is the best way to secure peace and stabi- lity in Europe’s neighbouring regions.   Latvia supports EU defence initiatives like Per- manent Structured Cooperation and European  Defence Fund, which contribute to safer Euro- pe. Enhanced military mobility in Europe, gre- ater competitiveness and mutual cooperation  within EU’s defence industry is crucial for en- suring level playing field and harmonised stan- dards for defence industry development across  the Union.  NATO is the only collective defence framework  Latvia is part of, and EU defence cooperation  initiatives can have a complementary effect on  NATO efforts if duplication is avoided. NATO  and EU must work closely on issues such as  crisis management, defence against non-con- ventional threats , countering of disinformation  and consistent strategic communication.   Latvia will continue to advocate  cooperation  with third countries that are members of NATO  but do not belong to the EU. Such a cooperation  is  crucial and these countries must be offered  to join EU defence projects whenever possible.    25   3. 6. State defence assets  3. 6. 1. Budget  Adequate defence funding is an important  prerequisite for reaching appropriate level of  state defence capabilities. Sufficient defence  funding demonstrates our commitment to  international obligations. It is also a strong  signal of political will to ensure adequate state  defence.  In 2014, during the Wales Summit, NATO  member states agreed to meet the NATO  guideline to spend a minimum of 2% of their  Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on defence and  keep the funding at the same level in future. To  meet the NATO target, Latvia has set  a defence  spending threshold of 2% of GDP in its Law on  the Financing of National Defence.   According to NATO guideline, defence fun- ding can only be spent on defence needs. Fun- ding of other needs that are not related to state  defence is not considered defence spending.   In the duration period of the Concept, Latvia  must ensure a balanced defence budget that has  the following breakdown between budget lines:  personnel and administrative costs (50%),  maintenance costs (30%) and investments (at  least 20%).  3. 6. 2. Personnel  NAF must continue to increase its personnel  size taking into account the constraints of the  national labour market. By recruiting additio- nal defence personnel, Latvia significantly inc- reases the costs of potential aggressor’s attack.  In the duration period of the Concept, profes- sional army of Latvia must reach the size of  8,000 troops to fill all the vacancies in NAF  units and support the expected capability de- velopment outcomes. NAF will continue to  acquire new capabilities and equipment in  the coming years and well-educated, trained,  highly motivated professional soldiers with va- rious fields of  expertise will become the core  asset of NAF.   National Guard is  indispensable in defending  territorial integrity of Latvia. According to the  existing plans, the size of the National Guard  must grow to 10,000 troops by 2024 and reach  12,000 troops by  2027.   National Guard must continue to recruit young  generation of troops to ensure that young peop- le, who have decided to go through full military  training and pursue a military career in Natio- nal Guard, while also leading a civilian life,  can contribute to state defence. It is necessary  to continue the employer outreach programme  to convince them to encourage National Gu- ard troops to participate in military exercises,     26   perform specific military duties and master the  necessary skills.   National Guard must develop training modules  and provide distance learning possibilities to  be able to attract National Guard members of  various backgrounds, including vital support  staff, by offering them a possibility to gradual- ly complete training modules and continuously  develop their skills and competences through  flexible learning plans that fit all individual  work and private life arrangements.   It is vital to continue raising public awareness  about voluntary participation in  state defen- ce to make sure this kind of civic engagement  receives the wide support and respect that it  deserves. It is absolutely pivotal to change  people’s scepticism towards National Guard.  Politicians and opinion leaders need to become  real role-models of active participation in Na- tional Guard. They should also support public  campaigns that focus on the prestige of being  a member of the National Guard to generate a  long-lasting public support for National Guard.  It is also necessary to continue increasing the  size of trained reserve personnel, including  retired professional service members, non-ac- tive duty National Guard, graduates of Level  4 Cadet Force  training who have also comple- ted  state defence training camp courses, given  the reserve oath of enlistment and completed  military training for army reserve volunteers.   According to the Concept, this should allow  training and recruiting about 6,000 new reser- ve troops.   It is equally important to set up a full reser- ve training programme based on unit level  framework for reserve force engagement and  operational readiness, i.e. create a two-level  reserve personnel training system with active  reserve (unit-level training) and permanent re- serve (centrally managed and coordinated fra- mework). In case of full mobilisation, reserve  training is provided by the Cadet Force  Centre.   Defence sector civilian staff plays an important  role in ensuring suitability and constant effi- ciency of the overall system. Although there is  a clear separation between military and civili- an service, it is a must for the defence sector  civilian personnel to have at least basic mili- tary training to be able to deliver vital military  functions.   It is also important to identify other critical pro- fessions outside defence sector that are vital for  continuity of the state and the society in case of  military conflict or intervention. These include  occupations,  service of which during  crisis or  war is just as important as in peacetime.   3. 6. 3. Security of supply  Secure supply of assets and resources essenti- al for NAF combat capability assurance is one     27   of the key  priorities. It plays a crucial role in  times of crisis when undisrupted, reliable, se- cure and timely delivery of goods and services  may be decisive for efficient state  defence.   3. 6. 4. Sectoral-level asset reserves  Resilience and continued operations at the  sectoral level are elements of comprehensive   defence that are critical for defending Latvia.  Availability of critical materials and resources  in the initial stages of a crisis is essential in  ensuring critical services and preventing na- tional-level threats. Each sector must define a  list of essential goods and services crucial for  threat response at the sectoral level. Essential  reserves and  secure supply of materials and  resources are  fundamental and should be co- vered by local industries when needed. It is  necessary to improve sectoral product compli- ance assurance systems, speed up new product  certification and market authorisation in times  of crisis.  Ensuring of sufficient supply of food, other  essential goods and emergency products to the  government sector and society  is crucial in ti- mes of crisis or war. Private sector should help  develop logistics solutions that ensure mana- gement, supply and stockpiling of essential  locally produced food and industrial products  during times of peace, crisis or war.  3. 6. 5. Industry  Latvia needs to continue rolling out policies  and programs supporting the development of  national defence and security industry and  build close cooperation with its players. The  primary objective of such support and coope- ration with local economic actors is secure sup- ply of materials, resources and assets essential  for NAF, access to necessary resource manage- ment expertise and building of extended mobi- lisation resource pool according to NAF needs.  Meaningful and efficient support for the deve- lopment of the industry requires clearly defi- ned national priorities. These priorities have  to be based on thorough analysis of national  economic potential and NAF capability deve- lopment priorities.   Current national-level priorities are develop- ment of unmanned systems, arms, maintenan- ce of NAF support and combat vehicles and  equipment, individual equipment systems and  components, cyber security, information and  communications systems.  3. 6. 6. Strategic partnerships  Meaningful and coordinated development of  mobilisation resource pool, secure supply of  materials, resources and services required for  functioning of NAF based on national-level  priorities, require strategic partnerships betwe-    28   en the sector organisations and defence indus- try players.   Strategic partnerships need to be created in  priority areas such as maintenance of NAF  combat vehicles and equipment, ammunition  manufacturing and development of locally  produced communication equipment to ensure   security of supply during crisis or war.   Successful implementation of the Concept  depends on prior cooperation between defen- ce sector and industry players, availability of  expertise, know-how, manufacturing assets  and investments. Industry must also ensure  compliance with legal requirements applicable  to strategic goods manufacturers and suppliers.  Development of the strategic partnerships  concept takes into account such considerati- ons as  gradual implementation of cooperation  projects, integration with NAF reserve, mobi- lisation and comprehensive defence systems,  National Guard, compliance with profit margin  limiting rules, complete audits and readiness to  invest in future development projects.   3. 6. 7. Research and innovation  Innovation  is a crucial element of the deve- lopment and competitiveness of national in- dustry. Efficient transfer and implementation  of innovative technologies will lead to signifi- cant boost of NAF capacity to deliver in terms   of state defence despite limitations stemming  from resource constraints faced by the sector.  Latvia needs to create a national innovation  support framework and promote integration of  national research and development frameworks  into the scientific programmes of the EU and  NATO to create a stronger environment for  defence sector innovations. However, Latvia  must also be aware of financial risks associa- ted with R&D activities and implementation of  technological innovations.    Innovation support measures must be alig- ned with national priorities and lead to new,  ground-breaking technologies in fields with  greater R&D potential at the national level.  3. 6. 8. Mobilisation  Testing framework established by the Mobi- lisation Law requires NAF to update Mobilisa- tion Plan every year to reflect the current capa- bility gaps and resources of the civilian sector  required to ensure functions of NAF in case of  mobilisation. In case of war, NAF may need to  temporarily take over control of certain areas  and properties necessary for NAF and allied  force training, force integration, maintenance  and tactical movements. Early identification  of resource gaps is crucial in making sure ap- propriate mobilisation requests are being made.    Mobilisation levels of National Armed Forces     29   can be determined through snap mobilisation  training, whereas mobilisation readiness and  mobilisation personnel training require prior  planning and delivery of such training in con- junction with business operators who have re- ceived mobilisation requests.  In case of crisis, economic operators must  provide NAF and allied forces with all neces-  sary support: power supply, medical services,  civilian communications, catering and other  services that are vital in performance of state  defence tasks. Regular exercises and testing of  economic operators’ readiness to mobilise is  a must once relevant economic operators are  trained and ready to meet their mobilisation  objectives. Appropriate supply flexibility is  also essential.      30   4. concludIng remarks  Ministry of Defence shall finance the imple- mentation of the State Defence Concept from  the allocated sector funding.   State Defence Concept and NAF Development  Plan form the basis for medium-term plan- ning, including documents such as Defence  Minister’s Guidelines for development of sta- te defence framework and next year’s budget  plans.  National Armed Forces development plans  must contribute to continuity of the State De- fence Concept. Plans must identify and con- sider NAF capabilities, which are critical in  ensuring delivery of key components of state  defence system.  Concept is the basis for Defence Minister’s  Guidelines for development of state defence  framework. These guidelines contain specific  operational planning tasks that relevant unit  commanders need to perform to enhance state  defence.  According to National Security Law, State De- fence Concept is approved by the Parliament  at least once every election cycle, but not later  than 1 October of the second year of the res- pective  convocation.    31     KONCEPCIJA    _GoBack  Introduction  1.

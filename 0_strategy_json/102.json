More worryingly, there was a shift from profit-motivated attacks towards those aimed at causing massive disruptions, such as the WannaCry ransomware campaign. Given Singapore’s connectivity, what happens globally is often immediately felt here. WannaCry similarly hit some businesses here, but the impact was not as widespread or disruptive as seen elsewhere. The discovery of the “kill switch” over the weekend, when most businesses were shut, helped. However, other cyber-attacks struck elsewhere against government agencies, businesses, and individuals. The breaches suffered by two of our universities and the Ministry of Defence’s Internet access system during the course of 2017 reflect the increasingly targeted nature of cyber-attacks. These attacks were carefully planned, and were not the work of casual hackers or criminal gangs. Cybersecurity is not just about threats, but also opportunities – for businesses and individuals. I am particularly encouraged to see greater awareness and interest in cybersecurity among the youth. Six talented youth from Singapore pitted their skills against some of the best in the Cyber Security Challenge UK in November 2017, in rounds of tests that included fending off live cyber-attacks. As cyber-attacks grow in scale and complexity, we will need to grow the talent pool to defend our cyberspace. As we review Singapore's cyber landscape in 2017, we hope to draw out the lessons learnt from the incidents of the past year, so that we can be better equipped to tackle the threats in the future. Singapore’s move towards being a Smart Nation will bring benefits to many. But we need everyone to be savvy users of this connectivity. We know that we are only as strong as our weakest link. Therefore, we all need to do our part to ensure basic cyber hygiene is in place, such as using stronger passwords, to keep our networks trusted and secure. We hope that this second edition will provide more practical information for you to do your part in keeping Singapore’s cyberspace safe and trustworthy for all.

Through case studies of incidents in Singapore, the publication aims to offer insights and practical lessons to mitigate and recover from cyber-attacks. This edition also features some emerging trends and issues that Singapore is watching closely. CYBER THREATS SINGAPORE FACES CHAPTER 1 8 9 CASE STUDY Data Breach in Banking & Finance Sector The Banking & Finance sector remains a top target for cyber threat actors given the valuable and sensitive financial data held by these companies. The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS), with the support of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), conducts regular industry- wide exercises to strengthen safeguards in the sector. The most recent one, Exercise Raffles V, was conducted in August 2017 and involved 139 financial institutions. Participants exercised their response plans to various scenarios, including cyber threats. WHEN September 2017 BACKGROUND The website of a Singapore insurance company was breached, compromising the personal data of 5,400 customers, including their e-mail addresses, mobile numbers and dates of birth. FINDINGS The attackers accessed the company’s system through an unpatched vulnerability. CASE ANALYSIS The threat actors exploited an unpatched vulnerability in the company’s system. This gave them access to customer records. Fortunately, no sensitive financial information (e.g. credit card details) was compromised. The company made a police report and logged a case with the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC). TACTICS, TECHNIQUES & PROCEDURES Breached website through exploitation of an unpatched vulnerability. THREAT ACTOR(S) INVOLVED Unknown malicious actors compromised the company's website. FOLLOW-UP ACTION The vulnerability in the affected server was patched to prevent further compromise. The company also checked that its other servers did not have the same vulnerability. All affected customers were notified via e-mail or phone call. Companies that collect and hold personal data are attractive targets for cybercriminals, and should ensure that their systems are updated and the proper safeguards are in place. \"AS WE GO MORE DIGITAL AND ONLINE, CYBER RISKS WILL MOUNT. THESE RISKS NEED TO BE MANAGED WELL TO MAINTAIN PUBLIC TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN TECHNOLOGY. TO FULLY HARNESS THE BENEFITS OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY, WE MUST BUILD ROBUST CYBER DEFENCES AND HAVE EFFECTIVE RECOVERY PLANS WHEN THINGS GO WRONG.\" - MR RAVI MENON, MANAGING DIRECTOR, MONETARY AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE THREATS TO BANKING & FINANCE THREATS TO CRITICAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) sectors1 deliver essential services, and a compromise of their systems can have a debilitating impact on Singapore’s society and economy. Cyber-attacks targeting CIIs can spill over to unintended victims connected to these systems. The NotPetya ransomware infection in June 2017 was believed to have targeted Ukraine, where more than 12,500 machines in its financial, energy, and government sectors were affected. The attack also spread globally to at least 64 other countries.2 International shipping giant Maersk and pharmaceutical heavyweight Merck were some of the large multi-national companies that suffered collateral damage. NotPetya crippled Maersk’s computer systems and it had to revert to tracking cargo manually. Maersk's partners and respective maritime authorities in international ports had to make relevant accommodations. In Singapore, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) and terminal operator PSA Singapore worked closely to rapidly step up cybersecurity measures. That prevented the spread of NotPetya to systems here via Maersk's affected systems, while ensuring that Singapore’s port operations went on. The NotPetya infection reiterated the need for CII sector readiness and incident response planning. The interconnectedness and interdependencies of global maritime and other supranational networks underscore the importance of international cooperation in responding to and mitigating the effects of cyber-attacks. 1 Singapore’s 11 CII sectors are: Aviation, Banking & Finance, Energy, Government, Healthcare, Infocomm, Land Transport, Maritime, Media, Security & Emergency, and Water. 2 “New Ransomware, Old Techniques: Petya Adds Worm Capabilities,” Microsoft Secure Blog, Microsoft 29 June 2017, microsoftsecure/2017/06/29/windows-10-platform-resilience-against-the-petya-ransomware-attack/. Chapter 1 Cyber Threats Singapore Faces 10 11 \"IT’S NO SECRET THAT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, INCLUDING MINDEF, ARE PRIME TARGETS, AND WE ARE UNDER CONSTANT CYBER- ATTACK. BECAUSE OF THIS, WE NEED TO CONTINUALLY BE VIGILANT AND IMPROVE OUR CYBER DEFENCES SO THAT WE REMAIN RESILIENT AGAINST CYBER-ATTACKS.\" - MR DAVID KOH, IN COMMENTS TO THE MEDIA IN FEBRUARY 2017 AS DEPUTY SECRETARY (TECHNOLOGY), MINISTRY OF DEFENCE, FOLLOWING AN I-NET BREACH AT THE MINISTRY CASE STUDY Ransomware in Schools WHEN June 2017 BACKGROUND CSA received reports that staff laptops at some schools were infected with ransomware after users visited malicious websites or accessed spoofed e-mails that executed malicious code. FINDINGS Attackers hijacked websites to display a fake error message that prompted users to click on a link to update a “Chrome Font Pack”. CASE ANALYSIS The attacks were assessed to be opportunistic rather than targeted. The ransomware was triggered when the individuals clicked on unfamiliar links or opened malicious e-mail attachments from their personal e-mail accounts. TACTICS, TECHNIQUES & PROCEDURES Phishing e-mails; websites hosting malicious files. THREAT ACTOR(S) INVOLVED Unknown hackers motivated by financial gain or seeking to cause disruption. FOLLOW-UP ACTION The infected laptops were quarantined, re-formatted, and had their programs reinstalled. In all instances, no ransom was paid, and no classified information was compromised. the Government’s systems, a Government Security Operations Centre (SOC) equipped with artificial intelligence and advanced analytics will be set up by 2020 to replace the current Cyber Watch Centre. Government and private sector organisations are encouraged to set aside at least 8 per cent of Information Technology (IT) budgets for cybersecurity, as an investment to manage risk. THREATS TO GOVERNMENT In 2017, Government agencies faced a range of cyber threats including system intrusions and spoofed websites. Some schools were infected with ransomware on Internet-facing laptops. In a separate incident, the Ministry of Defence’s (MINDEF) Internet access system (I-net) was breached in a targeted and carefully planned cyber-attack. The affected devices in both cases were not connected to Government networks and no classified information was compromised. To reduce the opportunity for cyber-attacks over the Internet and better protect systems and citizens’ data, Government agencies separated Internet surfing from Government networks in 2017. As part of on-going efforts to beef up cyber defences for SPECIAL TOPIC BREACHES OF PERSONAL DATA Personal data breaches are growing in scale and frequency, with significant disclosures in 2017 coming from tech company Yahoo, US credit bureau Equifax, and ride-sharing company Uber. The Uber breach exposed the names, e-mail addresses, and mobile phone numbers of an estimated 380,000 users in Singapore. The matter is being investigated by the PDPC. Stolen personal data is often sold in underground markets, and used for identity theft, fraudulent transactions, and social engineering. Systems that store and transmit personal data are therefore highly attractive and profitable targets for cyber-attackers. As these systems continue to proliferate, especially with the greater digitalisation of services such as online banking and shopping, we need to ensure that cybersecurity measures are robustly implemented and regularly reviewed. Prime Minister (PM) Lee Hsien Loong (seated, centre) being briefed in 2017 about CSA's crisis management processes during a major cyber incident. PM Lee was accompanied by (L-R) Deputy PM (DPM) and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean, and Minister for Communications & Information and Minister-in-charge of Cyber Security Dr Yaacob Ibrahim. Source: MCI. Chapter 1 Cyber Threats Singapore Faces 12 13 CASE ANALYSIS SingCERT found that the computers were infected by a remote access trojan (RAT) that let the attackers control the companies’ systems without physical access. Such infections usually arise when a person clicks on unfamiliar e-mail links or attachments. No data was lost or leaked in this instance. TACTICS, TECHNIQUES & PROCEDURES Phishing e-mail; RAT. FOLLOW-UP ACTION SingCERT notified its Malaysian counterpart (MyCERT) about the compromised computer there. It explained the situation to the two affected Singapore companies and assisted them in cleaning up the devices. The victims were advised to change the passwords for their e-mail accounts, so that attackers would not be able to enter the systems again using the old passwords. SingCERT also advised the victims to maintain regular and reliable backups of their data. SPECIAL TOPIC INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS Most ICS are legacy systems originally meant to operate in closed network environments unconnected to the Internet. Today, ICS are increasingly connected to Internet-facing networks to facilitate new processes and boost performance (e.g. data collection or remote monitoring). Consequently, they are similarly exposed to cyber threats through these networks. As cyber threats to ICS grow in frequency and sophistication, the risks can be severe. In late 2017, Triton, a new malware threatening ICS, was discovered. Triton allows attackers to prevent the activation of safety measures (e.g. sprinklers or alarms) during hazardous situations (e.g. fires or gas leakages), potentially resulting in life-threatening situations. ICS owners need to assess the risks to their systems regularly and adopt corresponding mitigating actions. They can take immediate measures such as application whitelisting (a list of programs allowed to run on the system), and timely patch management to fix known vulnerabilities. To promote cybersecurity information exchange among ICS operators and security practitioners from CII sectors, CSA initiated the formation of an ICS community in 2017. CSA worked with community members to produce a handbook - “ICS Cybersecurity Guidelines”. The handbook offers best practices for strengthening cybersecurity in ICS environments. Industrial Control Systems (ICS) refer to the hardware and software used to control equipment and process data in industrial sectors. In Singapore, ICS are found in CII sectors such as Energy, Land Transport, Media, Telecommunications, and Water. \"THANKS TO SINGCERT FOR YOUR HELP WITH THE VIRUS ATTACK ON OUR COMPANY SERVER. WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY RECOVERED ALL DATA, INCLUDING FROM OUR BACKUPS, FOLLOWING THE STEPS AS YOU ADVISED.\" - MISS MAY LEE, ACCOUNTS EXECUTIVE AT A PRECISION ENGINEERING COMPANY, APPROACHED CSA IN AUGUST 2017 FOR ASSISTANCE WITH A RANSOMWARE ATTACK THREATS TO BUSINESSES Businesses are common targets of cyber-attacks. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are especially vulnerable, as they often lack the resources or know-how to adopt appropriate cybersecurity practices. In one survey of Singapore SMEs, more than one third of respondents admitted to having no cyber protection.3 According to the Singapore Police Force (SPF), a growing threat that businesses in Singapore face is e-mail impersonation scams. Victims may not realise that WHEN July 2017 BACKGROUND SingCERT investigated a case of computers that had been compromised by malware which allowed attackers to gain entry into them from another location. Two companies in Singapore and one in Malaysia providing industrial component servicing and supply were affected. FINDINGS Unknown malicious actors created suspicious files in the computers. CASE STUDY RAT-infested Businesses their business partners’ e-mail accounts have been hacked or spoofed. They follow the instructions in the e-mail, thinking that it is a fund transfer to their partner. In effect, the funds are transferred to the attacker’s account. These scams may involve large sums of money. SPF observed 328 cases in 2017, up from 257 in 2016. Businesses lost around S$43 million in 2017, with one case alone accounting for close to S$5.7 million. Almost 40 per cent of the 146 cases reported to SingCERT in 2017 involved businesses, particularly SMEs. Most of the cases involved phishing attacks and ransomware. Businesses are encouraged to invest in cybersecurity solutions to protect themselves, especially since the cost of a cyber-attack can be far higher than the cost of getting protected in the first place. A cyber- attack on a business could hurt its computer systems and disrupt its entire business operations. It could also result in the loss of customer confidence, and cause collateral damage to business partners. 3 Survey conducted in September 2017 by QBE Singapore with 402 local SMEs. “Press Release: Survey shows only 14 per cent of local SMEs intend to internationalise,” QBE Singapore press release, 29 January 2018, Infographics_29_Jan_2018.pdf. Chapter 1 Cyber Threats Singapore Faces 14 15 The first reports of tech support scams surfaced around 2008 and gained momentum over the years. Fake tech support websites are created by scammers who trick users into believing that their devices are infected or have technical issues. After following through with the scammer’s instructions, the user may find their devices inaccessible, and will need to pay a ransom or “service fee” to restore them. TECH SUPPORT SCAMS Do not call the numbers provided on suspicious websites or pop-ups. Do not provide sensitive information (e.g. log-in credentials, two-factor authentication, financial information) to people who claim to be tech support without proper verification. Do not allow strangers to have remote access to your computer. a) b) c) HOW CAN I PROTECT MYSELF FROM SUCH SCAMS? CASE STUDY \"Your Computer Has Been Blocked\" Scam WHEN August 2017 BACKGROUND While surfing the Internet, an individual clicked on a link that caused her computer to freeze. A pop-up provided a number for her to call for “tech support”. When she dialled the number, a “technician” advised her to purchase a security solution from a given link. Finding the advice suspicious, she hung up and tried to reboot her system. Despite several attempts, she was unable to do so, and approached SingCERT for assistance. FINDINGS A pop-up that appeared while surfing the Internet caused the computer to freeze. CASE ANALYSIS SingCERT assessed that the individual had encountered a tech support scam. Such scams scare users into sending money or entering their credit card details on phishing sites, by claiming that their computers have been infected by a virus. TACTICS, TECHNIQUES & PROCEDURES Tech support scam; phishing website. FOLLOW-UP ACTION SingCERT provided the individual with a step- by-step guide on how to remove the pop-up, which included a reinstallation of the operating system. She was advised on cyber hygiene best practices, such as visiting only known and trusted websites. Your computer has been blocked Automatically report details of possible security incidents to Google. Privacy policy Back to safety1- !?THREATS TO INDIVIDUALS In Singapore, the three most common cyber threats reported to SingCERT by individuals were phishing, ransomware, and tech support scams. Separately, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) noted that online scams remained a concern. In 2017, there were 825 cases of Internet love scams, with victims losing a total of S$37 million. There were about 1,960 cases of e-commerce scams, where victims lost a total of S$1.4 million, typically from making payment for online purchases that were not delivered to them. People continue to be the weakest link in cybersecurity. Many are still not diligent about protecting their digital lives. This has an impact on our collective safety in cyberspace. - MR JAMES LEE, STUDENT, ON PRACTISING GOOD CYBER HYGIENE IN SCHOOL AND AT HOME \"IT CAN BE AS SIMPLE AS NOT OPENING E-MAIL MESSAGES OR ATTACHMENTS FROM UNKNOWN SOURCES, AND CHOOSING STRONG PASSWORDS.\" Chapter 1 Cyber Threats Singapore Faces 16 17 USE ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE USE STRONG PASSWORDS AND ENABLE 2FA SPOT SIGNS OF PHISHING UPDATE YOUR SOFTWARE ASAP Installing anti-virus software prevents malware infections which can cause persistent pop-ups, battery drain, or even data loss. Prevent cyber criminals from stealing your personal information, as well as money in your accounts. Create long and random passwords, and enable Two-Factor Authentication. Scammers use phishing e-mails to get you to disclose your valuable personal information. Look out for signs of phishing such as URLs that have misleading domain names. Your devices are more vulnerable to known cyber-attacks when you don’t update your software. Install security updates as soon as possible. 4 CYBER TIPS TO GO SAFE ONLINE Remember to Go Safe Online To get more cyber tips, visit Over one third of respondents delayed installing software updates on their mobile devices.

According to a public awareness survey by CSA conducted in 2017,4 most respondents recognised that everyone had a role to play in cybersecurity, and were concerned about cybersecurity risks. However, fewer than half (about 30 to 40 per cent) of respondents felt they were personally at risk of encountering cyber threats such as malware infections, personal data breaches, or online scams. There is still room for improvement in adopting good cyber habits. Many respondents had lax password management habits. Most respondents used their mobile devices for transactions such as shopping and banking. While the majority installed software updates, 38 per cent still did not do so as soon as possible (see facing page). This leaves devices potentially vulnerable in the interim. Translating awareness into good cyber hygiene starts with simple but important practices (see “4 Cyber Tips” on facing page).

In 2017, Advanced Persistent Threats and cybercriminals continued to be active, while the threats of website defacements, phishing, and malware showed no signs of abating. CHAPTER 2 20 21 SPECIAL TOPIC CRYPTOCURRENCIES The sharp price spikes and dips of cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin and Ether) have attracted significant public interest. They are increasingly “mined”, traded, and transacted across the globe. Unlike legal tender fiat currencies, the vast majority of cryptocurrencies are neither issued nor backed by any government or centralised authority. Instead, they use cryptography and blockchain technology to enable decentralised, transparent, and secure transactions within a network. While there is nothing inherently illegal about cryptocurrencies, they may be used to facilitate illegal activities online due to the relative anonymity they afford. In the Dark Web (see p.23), Bitcoin has gained traction as a mode of payment in the trade of counterfeit Singapore identification documents, financial and personal data, and drugs. Criminals have also asked for payments in Bitcoin for ransomware infections and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) extortion attempts detected in Singapore. Computer-facilitated crimes such as e-commerce and “China Officials Impersonation” scams have been observed to ask for payments in Bitcoin. As interest and speculation in cryptocurrencies continue to rise, criminals will find new means to obtain them, whether for financial gain, or to perpetuate other crimes such as money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities. Experts have also warned about the growing threat posed by “crypto-jacking” – the use of a computer to mine a cryptocurrency through browser- based scripts or malware. More cyber-attacks against cryptocurrency intermediaries such as exchanges (where cryptocurrencies are traded) and \"wallets\" (where they are stored) can be expected. Other forms of cryptocurrency-related cyber-attacks may include phishing e-mails and online scams that promise cryptocurrencies as a reward. at stealing information related to Government or research. Both universities have since enhanced the security for their networks. CSA also reached out to other universities and informed CII sectors to step up monitoring and checks on their networks. ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREATS 5 These TTPs range from simple attacks like phishing and ransomware infections to the highly tailored exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities. Zero-days are software vulnerabilities that are unknown to the software creator or security researchers, and are considered to be severe threats since there are no mitigating patches available. 6 \"Action Taken Following Breach of Two Universities’ IT Networks,” CSA press release, 12 May 2017, following-breach-of-two-universities-it-networks. Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), which are often backed by a nation-state, expend significant effort to mount targeted attacks on countries or organisations of interest. Using a range of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs),5 they conduct malicious activities that include espionage and mass disruptions. Some of the most disruptive global In April 2017, two universities – the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) – reported intrusions into their networks. Based on investigations, both attacks were found to be the incidents in 2017 have been linked to APTs, including the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware campaigns. They are highly adept at masking their tracks, and it is often difficult to definitively attribute a cyber-attack to a particular APT. In Singapore, APT attacks in 2017 included incidents at two work of APTs.6 NUS detected an unauthorised intrusion into its IT systems through a server, while NTU faced multiple waves of malware attacks on their systems. Immediate action was taken to isolate the affected desktop computers and servers, CASE STUDY Universities targeted by APTs and tactical recovery was also done on the universities’ networks. While the universities’ networks were separate from the Government’s, both incidents were assessed to have been carefully planned and aimed universities (see below). APTs may seek out “softer” or indirect targets as a means to gain access to government or CII sectors, which have relatively well- protected networks. Chapter 2 Cyber Threats in Focus 22 23 The promise of anonymity and the prospect of evading state surveillance make the Dark Web a choice hideout for cyber- attackers and criminals. Much of the Dark Web’s content and services is illegal in nature, including marketplaces selling drugs, pornography, and stolen personal data. Dark Web marketplaces increasingly facilitate the execution and monetisation of cyber-attacks. These marketplaces are often used to trade malware, ransomware- as-a-service, and do-it-yourself exploit kits, which in turn allow would-be cybercriminals to purchase these products and conduct cyber-attacks. Law enforcement agencies around the world are closely watching this space. In July 2017, an international law enforcement effort brought down two of the largest Dark Web marketplaces, AlphaBay and Hansa, and disrupted the trade of illegal goods and services. The Dark Web is a section of the Internet only accessible through special software9 that allows users to remain anonymous or untraceable. The Singapore Police Force (SPF) is starting to see cybercrime cases involving the Dark Web. In the first such conviction in Singapore, a 29-year-old Singaporean was sentenced to 36 months’ jail in November 2017, after admitting to obtaining and using PayPal Accounts and credit/ debit card information bought off the Dark Web to make online purchases, modifying the PayPal accounts obtained, and retaining the illegal proceeds. Using the compromised PayPal accounts and credit/debit card credentials, the person made fraudulent purchases amounting to about S$25,000 worth of goods, and re-sold them for profit. In addition, he used the stolen credentials to purchase food and hotel accommodation for his own consumption. Under the CMCA, transacting in and possessing stolen data, malware, and other illicit goods and services – regardless of the means employed to do so – can be illegal. 9 For example, browsers such as Tor (short for “The Onion Router”) route communications through a network of servers in order to mask the location of users. SPECIAL TOPIC THE DARK WEB \"GOVERNMENTS AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR MUST WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THE INTERNET IS SAFE AND SECURE FOR CITIZENS. THE CYBERCRIME CHALLENGE IS COMPLEX AND CANNOT BE SOLVED BY ANY SINGLE ENTITY. WE MUST HAVE A COOPERATIVE APPROACH TO ENABLE COLLECTIVE DEFENCE.\" - MR MATTHIAS YEO, CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER (ASIA), SYMANTEC CORPORATION, ON COMBATING CYBERCRIME TOGETHER CYBER CRIMINALS Cybercrime continues to grow in Singapore, with 5,430 cybercrime cases reported in 2017. Between 2016 and 2017, cybercrime cases grew from 15.6 per cent7 to 16.6 per cent of total crimes, even as the overall level of crime fell. Traditional crime, such as gambling, scams, and vice, has also increasingly gone online. Online cheating8 and cyber extortion accounted for 82.7 and 1.4 per cent of all cybercrime cases respectively. 15.9 per cent of cybercrime involved compromised social media and SingPass accounts, impersonation scams, 7 In the Singapore Cyber Landscape 2016, it was reported that cybercrime accounted for 13.7 per cent of all crimes in 2016. SPF has since revised that 2016 figure to 15.6 per cent. 8 In such cases, criminals coaxed their victims into surrendering sensitive personal and financial information using social engineering techniques. ransomware, unauthorised access (e.g. to corporate servers and systems), among other cybercrimes. These are offences under the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act (CMCA). In total, cybercrime victims suffered losses amounting to more than S$95 million in 2017, with the highest loss in a single case – an Internet love scam – amounting to about S$6 million. Cracking down on cybercrime will require continued collaboration between governments, law enforcement agencies, and other stakeholders. The CMCA was amended in 2017. It will now be an offence to: a) Deal in illegally obtained personal information for illegitimate purposes. b) Obtain hacking tools (including physical devices, software and passwords) to commit cyber offences. c) Commit criminal acts that create significant risk of harm in Singapore, even while overseas.

WEBSITE DEFACEMENTS In Singapore, the number of websites defaced increased from 1,750 defacements in 2016 to about 2,040, a 16.6 per cent increase. Many of these were part of global mass defacement campaigns. The defaced websites belonged mostly to SMEs from sectors such as manufacturing, retail, and information and communications technology (ICT). No Government websites were compromised. Attackers often exploit unpatched vulnerabilities in servers or web applications to deface websites. When popular content management systems (CMS)10 are hit, the effect can be inadvertently amplified. This was the case in February 2017, when an exploit of a WordPress vulnerability saw two million websites worldwide defaced.11 Some Singapore websites were similarly affected as a result, marking the peak in defacements here. Hacktivists tend to seek out high- profile websites or leverage iconic events to launch defacement campaigns for maximum impact and visibility. For example, CSA noted an increase in defacements of Singapore websites on 9 August, Singapore’s National Day. While these were assessed to be opportunistic rather than targeted, it highlights the potential for such incidents during iconic events. Many of the websites had been defaced previously, suggesting that their owners had not taken the appropriate security and patching measures to protect their websites. Website owners should update and patch their software in a timely manner, to reduce the possibility of having their websites defaced.

This may also result in new vulnerabilities and malware that can be exploited by hackers. In 2017, malware such as Brickerbot, Reaper, and Satori emerged, but these were essentially variants of the Mirai malware that infected thousands of vulnerable IoT devices globally in 2016. Like Mirai, the variants could have caused massive DDoS attacks, but none were observed in 2017. Estimated number of global infections by IoT malware (Sources: McAfee, BleepingComputer, and Qihoo 360 NetLab) You do not want your IoT devices to turn on you. The timely patching of IoT devices against known vulnerabilities is critical to preventing attackers from exploiting them. Do: STOP YOUR DEVICES FROM JOINING A ZOMBIE BOTNET ARMY The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the vast network of everyday objects like baby monitors, printers, televisions, and autonomous vehicles that are connected to the Internet. Hackers are also increasingly targeting mobile devices, such as smartphones. Smartphones, which are often used to access or control IoT devices, can spread malware to connected devices through mobile apps, e-mail, Bluetooth, and other means of connectivity. Given Singapore’s high mobile penetration rate,19 mobile devices can be a breeding ground for cyber-attacks, if people have poor cybersecurity practices.

The majority of these malware are not new. 15 There were slightly more than 60 C&C servers observed in Singapore’s cyberspace in 2016. The difference between 2016 and 2017 numbers is a result of CSA’s efforts to enhance its view of the overall cyber threat landscape. Figures observed in 2017 are in line with global trends, but are not directly comparable with past years’ figures. 16 Based on unique Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (the numerical code assigned to each device that can connect to the Internet or other network), approximately 150,000 botnet drones were observed in Singapore in 2017. 17 Also known as Pushdo, it is a spam malware that targets Windows OS and is responsible for a huge amount of spam activity around the world. First detected in 2007. 18 A computer worm that targets vulnerable Windows operating systems, first detected in 2008. For example, Cutwail17 and Conficker18 were first detected in 2007 and 2008 respectively. Common tools such as Windows Defender and Microsoft Safety Scanner can detect and remove these threats. The fact that old malware like Conficker continue to infect systems suggests that many do not make use of similar tools, to scan for viruses and clean up their systems. Malicious software, or malware for short, are programs devised to compromise the security of a computer system. Compromised systems may inadvertently become drones that are part of a larger botnet – a network of compromised computers controlled without the owners' knowledge. Threat actors control botnets through Command and Control (C&C) servers to carry out malicious attacks such as e-mail spam and Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks (DDoS). On average, five common malware accounted for over half the daily infections in 2017 Chapter 2 Cyber Threats in Focus 30 31 Ransomware victims are discouraged from paying the ransom. The international “No More Ransom” Initiative, of which CSA is a Supporting Partner, helps most victims successfully retrieve their files through more than 50 free decryption tools against over 100 types of ransomware. Visit the No More Ransom project ( or SingCERT ( for more information and prevention tips. WHAT TO DO IF YOUR COMPUTER IS INFECTED BY RANSOMWARE !? !? !? RANSOMWARE There were three major ransomware outbreaks worldwide in 2017. The WannaCry global campaign in May 2017 affected at least 150 countries and infected more than 200,000 systems. Close on its heels, NotPetya hit at least 65 countries in June 2017, while Bad Rabbit affected almost 200 systems in Russia and Eastern Europe in October 2017. Singapore was relatively unscathed, with only a few incidents of WannaCry reported. 25 cases of ransomware were reported to SingCERT in 2017. However, the actual number of ransomware cases is likely to be higher as many go unreported. Besides WannaCry, victims were infected by ransomware such as Cerber, Dharma, and Sage, and faced ransom demands ranging between S$2,000 and S$4,000. Businesses affected by ransomware can suffer significant disruptions to their operations, and lose access to important files. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts files on victims’ devices, making them unusable until the ransom is paid. Common attack vectors for ransomware are phishing e-mails that contain malicious attachments or links, or pop-ups that exploit vulnerabilities in browsers to install ransomware. Many devices may have open ports, such as those associated with the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which are typically used by companies for file-sharing purposes. However, malicious actors can take advantage of these ports to inject malware such as WannaCry into devices in the network. In 2017, most WannaCry infections detected in Singapore were rendered benign due to a “kill switch” that deactivated the malware. However, devices with open ports are still vulnerable to other types of malware. To mitigate this risk, users should protect their devices with updated anti-virus software, patch known vulnerabilities, and check that ports (such as ports 139 and 445) on their devices are not unnecessarily exposed. OPEN PORTS OPEN TO INFECTION !? !? Chapter 2 Cyber Threats in Focus Chapter 3 | Building Up Singapore's Cyber Resilience32 33 CSA, together with its partners, is working to build up Singapore’s cyber resilience, so that when a cyber-attack happens, we can bounce back to business as usual quickly. Efforts to boost Singapore’s cyber resilience include: (a) Enhancing preparedness against cyber threats. (b) Strengthening international cooperation. (c) Developing a professional cybersecurity workforce. (d) Research & development. (e) Raising cybersecurity awareness. BUILDING UP SINGAPORE'S CYBER RESILIENCE CHAPTER 3 “A VIBRANT CYBERSECURITY ECOSYSTEM IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO ROBUST NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY.” - DR YAACOB IBRAHIM, MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION, AND MINISTER-IN-CHARGE OF CYBER SECURITY, SPEAKING TO PARLIAMENT IN MARCH 2017 34 35 CYBER LEGISLATION The Cybersecurity Act, passed in Parliament in February 2018, establishes a legal framework for the oversight and maintenance of national cybersecurity in Singapore. Its four key objectives are to: Strengthen the protection of CIIs against cyber-attacks. Authorise CSA to prevent and respond to cybersecurity threats and incidents. Establish a light-touch licensing framework for cybersecurity service providers. \"THE CYBERSECURITY ACT PROVIDES A STARTING POINT FOR NATIONAL CYBER RESILIENCE, FROM THE LEGISLATION OF MEASURES TO BE TAKEN, TO THE REGULATION OF CYBERSECURITY SERVICE PROVIDERS. IN MANY WAYS, THE ACT IS BOTH TIMELY AND INSTRUCTIVE.\" - MR JACK OW, TECHNOLOGY LAWYER, ON THE IMPORTANCE OF CYBER RESILIENCE TO KEEP SOCIETY FUNCTIONING The Act facilitates information sharing, which is critical as timely information helps the Government and owners of computer systems identify vulnerabilities and prevent cyber incidents more effectively. The Act provides a framework for CSA to request for information, and for the protection and sharing of such information. The Act provides a framework for the designation of CIIs. It provides CII owners with clarity on their obligations to protect CIIs from cyber-attacks, and requires the owners to report cybersecurity incidents to CSA. The Act empowers the Commissioner of Cybersecurity to investigate cyber threats and incidents to determine their impact and prevent further harm. These powers are calibrated based on the severity of the threat or incident and the measures required. Some cybersecurity services can be sensitive because the service providers performing them would know where the vulnerabilities in clients’ computer systems are. Licensing cybersecurity service providers will give businesses and clients more assurance in engaging such services. Establish a framework for sharing cybersecurity information. ENHANCING PREPAREDNESS AGAINST CYBER THREATS CYBER EXERCISES A cyber-attack is almost inevitable. Therefore, CIIs need to be ready to deal with such scenarios. Cyber exercises enable organisations to regularly review and refine their cyber incident response plans before an actual incident happens. Industry-specific exercises such as Exercise CyberArk are conducted regularly. At the national level, CSA conducts the multi-sectoral Exercise Cyber Star to familiarise stakeholders with the national crisis management system and processes in the event of a major cyber incident in Singapore. Such exercises allow the sectors to reassess their cybersecurity capabilities and identify opportunities for improvement.

Chapter 3 Building Up Singapore's Cyber Resilience Chapter 3 Building Up Singapore's Cyber Resilience 36 37 The S$10 million ACCP seeks to build technical, policy, and strategy- building capabilities within ASEAN Member States. Since April 2017, more than 120 ASEAN cybersecurity officials and incident responders have been trained through ACCP initiatives, such as the ASEAN Cyber Norms Workshop, a US-Singapore Workshop on Cybersecurity, and ASEAN CYBER CAPACITY PROGRAMME (ACCP) an Australia–Singapore Cyber Risk Reduction Workshop. Singapore also hosted an International Law for Cyber Operations Course in August 2017. The course was conducted by international experts, including the key drafters of the Tallinn Manual. The Manual covers the current global legal landscape for cyber and how laws apply in different situations. Singapore’s efforts to strengthen international collaboration also include: Establishing partnerships between governments through Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) on cybersecurity cooperation with countries such as Australia, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Engaging in CERT-to-CERT cooperation and exchange of best practices with like- minded partners.

STRENGTHENING INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION Singapore believes in the importance of a rules-based international order for cyberspace, based on applicable international law and the adoption of voluntary cyber norms. This should be complemented by a coordinated capacity building framework, to build countries’ capacity in dealing with cybersecurity and cybercrime issues. Robust confidence building measures are also important, to reduce the risk of cyber conflict and foster closer working relationships between international and regional partners. These elements guide Singapore’s engagements with our partners. The borderless nature of cyber threats calls for countries to work together, to achieve collective action and mutual understanding. The annual Singapore International Cyber Week (SICW) brings together international and regional cyber leaders to forge partnerships and engage in critical dialogue on cybersecurity. The second edition of SICW in September 2017 attracted more than 7,000 stakeholders, including policy- makers, industry experts and non-governmental organisations from close to 50 countries. SICW events such as International Cyber Leaders’ Symposium, ASEAN Cyber Prosecutors Roundtable, and IoT Cyber Roundtable advanced conversations on cyber norms, regional cybercrime cooperation, and IoT cybersecurity standards respectively.

The nature of modern computer coding and programs is such that mistakes and vulnerabilities are inevitable. The MINDEF Bug Bounty Programme was a response to this reality and the rapidly-evolving cyber threat landscape. It served to improve the cybersecurity of MINDEF’s Internet-facing systems more quickly and effectively than other conventional programmes would have been able to. From 15 January to 4 February 2018, selected white hat hackers were invited to test eight major MINDEF Internet-facing systems for vulnerabilities, and were rewarded for any valid bugs found. HackerOne, a reputable international bug bounty company, was engaged to manage the programme. A total of 264 white hats from around the world participated in this programme, including 57 of HackerOne’s top 100 white hats and 100 from the local white hat community. 97 vulnerability reports were submitted from 34 participants, with 35 reports deemed valid.

In the near term, we anticipate the following trends to persist. • RAISING CYBERSECURITY AWARENESS An important component of cyber resilience is awareness of cyber threats and how to deal with them. Cultivating good cyber hygiene practices to safeguard our devices and information is a good place to start. On-going efforts to raise cybersecurity awareness in Singapore include: The inaugural National Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign roadshow in February 2017 attracted close to 16,000 visitors from all walks of life.

This technology undergirds cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether. But blockchain technology offers other potential uses, which include supply chain management, intellectual property protection, and election security. Those considering using blockchain technology solutions should ensure that the surrounding ecosystem is secure. For instance, cryptocurrency exchanges and unsecured \"wallets” that facilitate such transactions may be vulnerable to other attack vectors, and can be prominent targets for hackers and cybercriminals. WEAK LINKS IN THE (BLOCK)CHAIN THREAT ACTORS WILL ACTIVELY TARGET WEAK LINKS Determined attackers will seek out less well- protected entities with linkages to critical targets. Once compromised, these “softer” targets may expose their partners to cyber-attacks. STATE-LINKED ACTORS WILL BECOME BOLDER State-linked cyber actors may make bolder moves – including disruptive attacks against CIIs – to further their backers’ geopolitical agendas. MORE SIGNS OF AI-ENABLED CYBER THREATS AND SOLUTIONS Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) technologies can be weaponised by cyber-attackers to infiltrate and wreak havoc on systems, and to make social engineering even more personalised. On the flip side, AI/ML can be leveraged for cyber defence. Cyber defenders will look to take advantage of new tools and capabilities to detect anomalies and counter malicious activity in cyberspace. MORE DISRUPTIVE ATTACKS AGAINST COUNTRIES, BUSINESSES, AND INDIVIDUALS Cyber-attacks are likely to grow more disruptive and destructive. Industrial Control Systems vulnerabilities may continue to be targeted, leading to industrial incidents and even injuries. THREATS TO CONNECTED MOBILE DEVICES WILL GROW Hackers will target mobile devices using methods such as phishing scams, spoofed mobile applications, and “free” public Wi-Fi. These methods may be used to steal personal information, spread malware, and conduct cyber espionage. CHECK OUT 46 47 2017 saw more vulnerabilities disclosed and disruptive attacks happening than in previous years. More cyber-attacks are likely. Cybersecurity is a team sport – we all have a part to play, and we all need to play our part well. We can start by practising good cyber hygiene. While we do what we can as individuals, the Singapore Government will also continue to work with stakeholders here and internationally towards a safe and trustworthy cyberspace. 48 49 A section of the Internet only accessible through software that allows users to remain anonymous or untraceable. The Dark Web is part of the Deep Web. The Deep Web encompasses web resources that search engines like Google and Yahoo cannot find, such as legitimate but private resources (e.g. e-mail), or public resources behind a paywall or login wall (e.g. paid journal subscriptions).

More worryingly, there was a shift  from profit-motivated attacks towards those aimed at causing massive  disruptions, such as the WannaCry ransomware campaign.   Given Singapore’s connectivity, what happens globally is often immediately  felt here. WannaCry similarly hit some businesses here, but the impact  was not as widespread or disruptive as seen elsewhere. The discovery  of the “kill switch” over the weekend, when most businesses were  shut, helped. However, other cyber-attacks struck elsewhere against  government agencies, businesses, and individuals. The breaches suffered  by two of our universities and the Ministry of Defence’s Internet access  system during the course of 2017 reflect the increasingly targeted nature  of cyber-attacks. These attacks were carefully planned, and were not the  work of casual hackers or criminal gangs.   Cybersecurity is not just about threats, but also opportunities – for  businesses and individuals. I am particularly encouraged to see greater  awareness and interest in cybersecurity among the youth. Six talented  youth from Singapore pitted their skills against some of the best in the  Cyber Security Challenge UK in November 2017, in rounds of tests that  included fending off live cyber-attacks. As cyber-attacks grow in scale and  complexity, we will need to grow the talent pool to defend our cyberspace.   As we review Singapore's cyber landscape in 2017, we hope to draw out  the lessons learnt from the incidents of the past year, so that we can be  better equipped to tackle the threats in the future. Singapore’s move  towards being a Smart Nation will bring benefits to many. But we need  everyone to be savvy users of this connectivity. We know that we are only  as strong as our weakest link. Therefore, we all need to do our part to  ensure basic cyber hygiene is in place, such as using stronger passwords,  to keep our networks trusted and secure. We hope that this second edition  will provide more practical information for you to do your part in keeping  Singapore’s cyberspace safe and trustworthy for all.

Through case studies  of incidents in Singapore, the publication aims to offer  insights and practical lessons to mitigate and recover from  cyber-attacks. This edition also features some emerging  trends and issues that Singapore is watching closely.    CYBER  THREATS  SINGAPORE  FACES  CHAPTER 1       8 9  CASE STUDY  Data Breach in Banking & Finance Sector  The Banking & Finance sector remains a  top target for cyber threat actors given the  valuable and sensitive financial data held  by these companies.   The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS),  with the support of the Monetary Authority of  Singapore (MAS), conducts regular industry- wide exercises to strengthen safeguards in  the sector. The most recent one, Exercise  Raffles V, was conducted in August 2017  and involved 139 financial institutions.  Participants exercised their response plans   to various scenarios, including cyber threats.  WHEN  September 2017  BACKGROUND  The website of a Singapore  insurance company was  breached, compromising  the personal data of 5,400  customers, including their  e-mail addresses, mobile  numbers and dates of birth.   FINDINGS  The attackers accessed  the company’s system  through an unpatched  vulnerability.  CASE ANALYSIS  The threat actors  exploited an unpatched  vulnerability in the  company’s system.  This gave them access  to customer records.  Fortunately, no sensitive  financial information  (e.g. credit card details)  was compromised. The  company made a police  report and logged a case  with the Personal Data  Protection Commission  (PDPC).  TACTICS, TECHNIQUES  & PROCEDURES  Breached website  through exploitation of an  unpatched vulnerability.  THREAT ACTOR(S)  INVOLVED  Unknown malicious  actors compromised  the company's website.  FOLLOW-UP ACTION  The vulnerability in the  affected server was  patched to prevent further  compromise. The company  also checked that its other   servers did not have  the same vulnerability.  All affected customers  were notified via e-mail  or phone call.   Companies that collect  and hold personal data  are attractive targets for  cybercriminals, and should  ensure that their systems  are updated and the proper  safeguards are in place.  \"AS WE GO MORE DIGITAL AND ONLINE, CYBER RISKS  WILL MOUNT. THESE RISKS NEED TO BE MANAGED WELL TO  MAINTAIN PUBLIC TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN TECHNOLOGY.  TO FULLY HARNESS THE BENEFITS OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY,  WE MUST BUILD ROBUST CYBER DEFENCES AND HAVE  EFFECTIVE RECOVERY PLANS WHEN THINGS GO WRONG.\"  - MR RAVI MENON, MANAGING DIRECTOR, MONETARY AUTHORITY OF SINGAPORE  THREATS TO BANKING & FINANCE  THREATS TO CRITICAL  INFORMATION  INFRASTRUCTURE  Critical Information  Infrastructure (CII)  sectors1 deliver  essential services,  and a compromise of  their systems can have  a debilitating impact on  Singapore’s society and  economy. Cyber-attacks  targeting CIIs can spill  over to unintended  victims connected to  these systems.   The NotPetya ransomware  infection in June 2017 was  believed to have targeted  Ukraine, where more  than 12,500 machines  in its financial, energy,  and government sectors  were affected.   The attack also spread  globally to at least  64 other countries.2  International shipping  giant Maersk and  pharmaceutical  heavyweight Merck   were some of the large  multi-national companies  that suffered collateral  damage. NotPetya crippled  Maersk’s computer systems  and it had to revert to  tracking cargo manually.   Maersk's partners and  respective maritime  authorities in international  ports had to make relevant  accommodations. In  Singapore, the Maritime  and Port Authority of  Singapore (MPA) and  terminal operator PSA  Singapore worked  closely to rapidly step up  cybersecurity measures.  That prevented the spread  of NotPetya to systems  here via Maersk's affected   systems, while ensuring  that Singapore’s port  operations went on.  The NotPetya infection  reiterated the need for  CII sector readiness and  incident response planning.  The interconnectedness  and interdependencies  of global maritime and  other supranational  networks underscore the  importance of international  cooperation in responding  to and mitigating the  effects of cyber-attacks.   1 Singapore’s 11 CII sectors are: Aviation, Banking & Finance, Energy, Government, Healthcare, Infocomm, Land Transport, Maritime, Media, Security &  Emergency, and Water.  2 “New Ransomware, Old Techniques: Petya Adds Worm Capabilities,” Microsoft Secure Blog, Microsoft 29 June 2017, https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/ microsoftsecure/2017/06/29/windows-10-platform-resilience-against-the-petya-ransomware-attack/.

FINDINGS  Attackers hijacked websites  to display a fake error message  that prompted users to click  on a link to update a “Chrome  Font Pack”.  CASE ANALYSIS  The attacks were assessed  to be opportunistic rather than  targeted. The ransomware was  triggered when the individuals  clicked on unfamiliar links  or opened malicious e-mail  attachments from their  personal e-mail accounts.  TACTICS, TECHNIQUES  & PROCEDURES  Phishing e-mails; websites  hosting malicious files.   THREAT ACTOR(S) INVOLVED  Unknown hackers motivated  by financial gain or seeking  to cause disruption.  FOLLOW-UP ACTION  The infected laptops were  quarantined, re-formatted, and  had their programs reinstalled.  In all instances, no ransom  was paid, and no classified  information was compromised.    the Government’s systems,  a Government Security  Operations Centre (SOC)  equipped with artificial  intelligence and advanced  analytics will be set up by  2020 to replace the current  Cyber Watch Centre.  Government and private  sector organisations are  encouraged to set aside  at least 8 per cent of  Information Technology (IT)  budgets for cybersecurity,  as an investment to  manage risk.  THREATS TO  GOVERNMENT  In 2017, Government  agencies faced a range  of cyber threats including  system intrusions and  spoofed websites.  Some schools were  infected with ransomware  on Internet-facing laptops.  In a separate incident,  the Ministry of Defence’s  (MINDEF) Internet access  system (I-net) was breached  in a targeted and carefully  planned cyber-attack. The  affected devices in both   cases were not connected to  Government networks  and no classified information  was compromised.   To reduce the opportunity  for cyber-attacks over the  Internet and better protect  systems and citizens’ data,  Government agencies  separated Internet surfing  from Government networks  in 2017.   As part of on-going efforts  to beef up cyber defences for   SPECIAL TOPIC  BREACHES  OF PERSONAL  DATA Personal data breaches are  growing in scale and frequency,  with significant disclosures in  2017 coming from tech company  Yahoo, US credit bureau Equifax,  and ride-sharing company  Uber. The Uber breach exposed  the names, e-mail addresses,  and mobile phone numbers of  an estimated 380,000 users in  Singapore. The matter is being  investigated by the PDPC.   Stolen personal data is often  sold in underground markets,  and used for identity theft,  fraudulent transactions, and  social engineering. Systems  that store and transmit  personal data are therefore  highly attractive and profitable  targets for cyber-attackers.   As these systems continue to  proliferate, especially with the  greater digitalisation of services  such as online banking and  shopping, we need to ensure  that cybersecurity measures  are robustly implemented  and regularly reviewed.  Prime Minister (PM) Lee Hsien Loong (seated, centre) being briefed in 2017 about  CSA's crisis management processes during a major cyber incident. PM Lee was  accompanied by (L-R) Deputy PM (DPM) and Coordinating Minister for National  Security Teo Chee Hean, and Minister for Communications & Information and  Minister-in-charge of Cyber Security Dr Yaacob Ibrahim. Source: MCI.  Chapter 1 Cyber Threats Singapore Faces    12 13  CASE ANALYSIS  SingCERT found that the computers  were infected by a remote access  trojan (RAT) that let the attackers  control the companies’ systems  without physical access. Such  infections usually arise when a  person clicks on unfamiliar e-mail  links or attachments. No data was  lost or leaked in this instance.   TACTICS, TECHNIQUES &  PROCEDURES  Phishing e-mail; RAT.   FOLLOW-UP ACTION  SingCERT notified its Malaysian  counterpart (MyCERT) about the  compromised computer there.  It explained the situation to the  two affected Singapore companies  and assisted them in cleaning  up the devices.  The victims were advised to change  the passwords for their e-mail  accounts, so that attackers would  not be able to enter the systems  again using the old passwords.  SingCERT also advised the victims  to maintain regular and reliable  backups of their data.  SPECIAL TOPIC  INDUSTRIAL CONTROL SYSTEMS  Most ICS are legacy systems originally meant to  operate in closed network environments unconnected  to the Internet. Today, ICS are increasingly connected  to Internet-facing networks to facilitate new processes  and boost performance (e.g. data collection or remote  monitoring). Consequently, they are similarly exposed  to cyber threats through these networks.   As cyber threats to ICS grow in frequency and  sophistication, the risks can be severe. In late 2017,  Triton, a new malware threatening ICS, was discovered.  Triton allows attackers to prevent the activation of safety  measures (e.g. sprinklers or alarms) during hazardous  situations (e.g. fires or gas leakages), potentially  resulting in life-threatening situations. ICS owners  need to assess the risks to their systems regularly and  adopt corresponding mitigating actions. They can take  immediate measures such as application whitelisting  (a list of programs allowed to run on the system), and  timely patch management to fix known vulnerabilities.   To promote cybersecurity information exchange  among ICS operators and security practitioners  from CII sectors, CSA initiated the formation of an  ICS community in 2017. CSA worked with community  members to produce a handbook - “ICS Cybersecurity  Guidelines”. The handbook offers best practices for  strengthening cybersecurity in ICS environments.   Industrial Control Systems (ICS) refer to the  hardware and software used to control equipment  and process data in industrial sectors. In Singapore,  ICS are found in CII sectors such as Energy, Land  Transport, Media, Telecommunications, and Water.  \"THANKS TO SINGCERT   FOR YOUR HELP WITH   THE VIRUS ATTACK ON OUR  COMPANY SERVER. WE HAVE  SUCCESSFULLY RECOVERED  ALL DATA, INCLUDING FROM  OUR BACKUPS, FOLLOWING  THE STEPS AS YOU ADVISED.\"  - MISS MAY LEE, ACCOUNTS EXECUTIVE     AT A PRECISION ENGINEERING COMPANY,    APPROACHED CSA IN AUGUST 2017 FOR        ASSISTANCE WITH A RANSOMWARE ATTACK  THREATS TO  BUSINESSES  Businesses are common targets  of cyber-attacks. Small and  medium enterprises (SMEs) are  especially vulnerable, as they often  lack the resources or know-how  to adopt appropriate cybersecurity  practices. In one survey of  Singapore SMEs, more than one  third of respondents admitted to  having no cyber protection.3  According to the Singapore Police  Force (SPF), a growing threat that  businesses in Singapore face is  e-mail impersonation scams.  Victims may not realise that   WHEN  July 2017   BACKGROUND  SingCERT investigated a case of computers that had been  compromised by malware which allowed attackers to gain  entry into them from another location. Two companies  in Singapore and one in Malaysia providing industrial  component servicing and supply were affected.     FINDINGS  Unknown malicious actors created suspicious files  in the computers.  CASE STUDY  RAT-infested Businesses   their business partners’ e-mail  accounts have been hacked or  spoofed. They follow the instructions  in the e-mail, thinking that it is a  fund transfer to their partner. In  effect, the funds are transferred to  the attacker’s account. These scams  may involve large sums of money.  SPF observed 328 cases in 2017,  up from 257 in 2016. Businesses  lost around S$43 million in 2017,  with one case alone accounting  for close to S$5.7 million.  Almost 40 per cent of the 146  cases reported to SingCERT in 2017   involved businesses, particularly  SMEs. Most of the cases involved  phishing attacks and ransomware.   Businesses are encouraged to  invest in cybersecurity solutions to  protect themselves, especially since  the cost of a cyber-attack can be  far higher than the cost of getting  protected in the first place. A cyber- attack on a business could hurt its  computer systems and disrupt its  entire business operations. It could  also result in the loss of customer  confidence, and cause collateral  damage to business partners.   3 Survey conducted in September 2017 by QBE Singapore with 402 local SMEs. “Press Release: Survey shows only 14 per cent of local SMEs intend  to internationalise,” QBE Singapore press release, 29 January 2018, http://www.qbe.com.sg/retrieveDocument?docName=SME_press_release_and_ Infographics_29_Jan_2018.pdf.

Fake tech  support websites are created by scammers who trick  users into believing that their devices are infected or have  technical issues. After following through with the scammer’s  instructions, the user may find their devices inaccessible, and  will need to pay a ransom or “service fee” to restore them.   TECH SUPPORT SCAMS  Do not call the numbers provided on suspicious websites or pop-ups.  Do not provide sensitive information (e.g. log-in credentials,  two-factor authentication, financial information) to people who  claim to be tech support without proper verification.  Do not allow strangers to have remote access to your computer.  a)  b)  c)  HOW CAN  I PROTECT  MYSELF  FROM SUCH  SCAMS?  CASE STUDY  \"Your Computer Has Been Blocked\" Scam  WHEN  August 2017  BACKGROUND  While surfing the Internet, an individual  clicked on a link that caused her computer  to freeze. A pop-up provided a number for her  to call for “tech support”. When she dialled  the number, a “technician” advised her to  purchase a security solution from a given link.   Finding the advice suspicious, she hung  up and tried to reboot her system. Despite  several attempts, she was unable to do so,  and approached SingCERT for assistance.  FINDINGS  A pop-up that appeared while surfing the  Internet caused the computer to freeze.   CASE ANALYSIS  SingCERT assessed that the individual had  encountered a tech support scam. Such scams  scare users into sending money or entering their  credit card details on phishing sites, by claiming  that their computers have been infected by a virus.  TACTICS, TECHNIQUES & PROCEDURES  Tech support scam; phishing website.  FOLLOW-UP ACTION  SingCERT provided the individual with a step- by-step guide on how to remove the pop-up,  which included a reinstallation of the operating  system. She was advised on cyber hygiene  best practices, such as visiting only known  and trusted websites.   Your computer has been blocked  Automatically report details of possible security incidents to Google. Privacy policy  Back to safety1-   !?THREATS TO  INDIVIDUALS  In Singapore, the three most common  cyber threats reported to SingCERT by  individuals were phishing, ransomware,  and tech support scams.   Separately, the Singapore Police Force  (SPF) noted that online scams remained  a concern. In 2017, there were 825 cases  of Internet love scams, with victims losing  a total of S$37 million. There were about  1,960 cases of e-commerce scams, where  victims lost a total of S$1.4 million, typically  from making payment for online purchases  that were not delivered to them.    People continue to be the weakest link in  cybersecurity. Many are still not diligent about  protecting their digital lives. This has an impact  on our collective safety in cyberspace.   - MR JAMES LEE, STUDENT, ON PRACTISING     GOOD CYBER HYGIENE IN SCHOOL AND AT HOME  \"IT CAN BE AS SIMPLE AS NOT OPENING  E-MAIL MESSAGES OR ATTACHMENTS  FROM UNKNOWN SOURCES, AND  CHOOSING STRONG PASSWORDS.\"  Chapter 1 Cyber Threats Singapore Faces    16 17  USE ANTI-VIRUS  SOFTWARE  USE STRONG  PASSWORDS AND  ENABLE 2FA  SPOT SIGNS OF  PHISHING  UPDATE YOUR  SOFTWARE ASAP  Installing anti-virus  software prevents malware  infections which can cause  persistent pop-ups, battery  drain, or even data loss.  Prevent cyber criminals  from stealing your  personal information,  as well as money in your  accounts. Create long  and random passwords,  and enable Two-Factor  Authentication.  Scammers use phishing  e-mails to get you to  disclose your valuable  personal information.  Look out for signs of  phishing such as URLs  that have misleading  domain names.

According to a public  awareness survey by CSA  conducted in 2017,4 most  respondents recognised  that everyone had a role  to play in cybersecurity,  and were concerned  about cybersecurity risks.  However, fewer than half  (about 30 to 40 per cent)  of respondents felt they  were personally at risk  of encountering cyber  threats such as malware  infections, personal data  breaches, or online scams.  There is still room for  improvement in adopting  good cyber habits.  Many respondents  had lax password  management habits.  Most respondents used  their mobile devices for  transactions such as  shopping and banking.  While the majority  installed software  updates, 38 per cent still  did not do so as soon  as possible (see facing  page). This leaves devices  potentially vulnerable in  the interim.

In 2017, Advanced Persistent  Threats and cybercriminals continued to be active,  while the threats of website defacements, phishing,  and malware showed no signs of abating.   CHAPTER 2    20 21  SPECIAL TOPIC  CRYPTOCURRENCIES The sharp price spikes and dips of cryptocurrencies  (such as Bitcoin and Ether) have attracted significant  public interest. They are increasingly “mined”, traded,  and transacted across the globe.   Unlike legal tender fiat currencies, the vast majority  of cryptocurrencies are neither issued nor backed by  any government or centralised authority. Instead, they  use cryptography and blockchain technology to enable  decentralised, transparent, and secure transactions  within a network.    While there is nothing inherently illegal about  cryptocurrencies, they may be used to facilitate  illegal activities online due to the relative anonymity  they afford. In the Dark Web (see p.23), Bitcoin has  gained traction as a mode of payment in the trade  of counterfeit Singapore identification documents,  financial and personal data, and drugs.  Criminals have also asked for payments in Bitcoin for  ransomware infections and Distributed Denial of Service  (DDoS) extortion attempts detected in Singapore.  Computer-facilitated crimes such as e-commerce  and “China Officials Impersonation” scams have been  observed to ask for payments in Bitcoin.  As interest and speculation in cryptocurrencies  continue to rise, criminals will find new means to obtain  them, whether for financial gain, or to perpetuate other  crimes such as money laundering and the financing of  terrorist activities. Experts have also warned about the  growing threat posed by “crypto-jacking” – the use of a  computer to mine a cryptocurrency through browser- based scripts or malware.  More cyber-attacks against cryptocurrency intermediaries such as exchanges (where  cryptocurrencies are traded) and \"wallets\" (where  they are stored) can be expected. Other forms of  cryptocurrency-related cyber-attacks may include  phishing e-mails and online scams that promise  cryptocurrencies as a reward.  at stealing information related  to Government or research.  Both universities have since  enhanced the security for their  networks. CSA also reached out  to other universities and informed  CII sectors to step up monitoring  and checks on their networks.  ADVANCED PERSISTENT THREATS  5 These TTPs range from simple attacks like phishing and ransomware infections to the highly tailored exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities. Zero-days are  software vulnerabilities that are unknown to the software creator or security researchers, and are considered to be severe threats since there are no mitigating  patches available.   6 \"Action Taken Following Breach of Two Universities’ IT Networks,” CSA press release, 12 May 2017, https://www.csa.gov.sg/news/press-releases/action-taken- following-breach-of-two-universities-it-networks.  Advanced Persistent Threats  (APTs), which are often backed by  a nation-state, expend significant  effort to mount targeted attacks  on countries or organisations of  interest. Using a range of tactics,  techniques, and procedures  (TTPs),5 they conduct malicious  activities that include espionage  and mass disruptions. Some  of the most disruptive global   In April 2017, two universities  – the National University  of Singapore (NUS) and  the Nanyang Technological  University (NTU) – reported  intrusions into their networks.  Based on investigations, both  attacks were found to be the   incidents in 2017 have been linked  to APTs, including the WannaCry  and NotPetya ransomware  campaigns. They are highly adept  at masking their tracks, and it  is often difficult to definitively  attribute a cyber-attack to a  particular APT.   In Singapore, APT attacks in  2017 included incidents at two   work of APTs.6 NUS detected  an unauthorised intrusion into  its IT systems through a server,  while NTU faced multiple waves  of malware attacks on their  systems. Immediate action was  taken to isolate the affected  desktop computers and servers,   CASE STUDY  Universities targeted by APTs  and tactical recovery was also  done on the universities’ networks.   While the universities’  networks were separate from  the Government’s, both incidents  were assessed to have been  carefully planned and aimed   universities (see below). APTs  may seek out “softer” or indirect  targets as a means to gain access  to government or CII sectors,  which have relatively well- protected networks.  Chapter 2 Cyber Threats in Focus  https://www.csa.gov.sg/news/press-releases/action-taken-following-breach-of-two-universities-it-networks https://www.csa.gov.sg/news/press-releases/action-taken-following-breach-of-two-universities-it-networks   22 23  The promise of anonymity and  the prospect of evading state  surveillance make the Dark  Web a choice hideout for cyber- attackers and criminals. Much  of the Dark Web’s content and  services is illegal in nature,  including marketplaces selling  drugs, pornography, and stolen  personal data.  Dark Web marketplaces  increasingly facilitate the  execution and monetisation  of cyber-attacks. These  marketplaces are often used  to trade malware, ransomware- as-a-service, and do-it-yourself  exploit kits, which in turn allow  would-be cybercriminals to  purchase these products  and conduct cyber-attacks.   Law enforcement agencies  around the world are closely  watching this space. In July  2017, an international law  enforcement effort brought  down two of the largest Dark  Web marketplaces, AlphaBay  and Hansa, and disrupted  the trade of illegal goods  and services.  The Dark Web is a section of the Internet only  accessible through special software9 that allows  users to remain anonymous or untraceable.  The Singapore Police Force (SPF)  is starting to see cybercrime  cases involving the Dark Web.  In the first such conviction  in Singapore, a 29-year-old  Singaporean was sentenced to 36  months’ jail in November 2017,  after admitting to obtaining and  using PayPal Accounts and credit/ debit card information bought  off the Dark Web to make online  purchases, modifying the PayPal  accounts obtained, and retaining  the illegal proceeds.   Using the compromised PayPal  accounts and credit/debit card  credentials, the person made  fraudulent purchases amounting  to about S$25,000 worth of goods,  and re-sold them for profit.  In addition, he used the stolen  credentials to purchase food  and hotel accommodation for  his own consumption.   Under the CMCA, transacting  in and possessing stolen data,  malware, and other illicit goods  and services – regardless of   the means employed to do so  – can be illegal.    9 For example, browsers such as Tor (short for “The Onion Router”) route communications through a network of servers in order to mask the location of users.

Between 2016 and  2017, cybercrime cases grew  from 15.6 per cent7 to 16.6  per cent of total crimes,  even as the overall level  of crime fell. Traditional  crime, such as gambling,  scams, and vice, has also  increasingly gone online.

These are offences under  the Computer Misuse and  Cybersecurity Act (CMCA).   In total, cybercrime victims  suffered losses amounting  to more than S$95 million in  2017, with the highest loss  in a single case – an Internet  love scam – amounting to  about S$6 million.   Cracking down on  cybercrime will require  continued collaboration  between governments,  law enforcement agencies,  and other stakeholders.   The CMCA was amended in 2017.  It will now be an offence to:   a)  Deal in illegally obtained       personal information for      illegitimate purposes.  b)  Obtain hacking tools       (including physical devices,         software and passwords)       to commit cyber offences.  c)  Commit criminal acts       that create significant       risk of harm in Singapore,       even while overseas.

WEBSITE  DEFACEMENTS  In Singapore, the number of websites  defaced increased from 1,750  defacements in 2016 to about 2,040,  a 16.6 per cent increase. Many of these  were part of global mass defacement  campaigns. The defaced websites  belonged mostly to SMEs from sectors  such as manufacturing, retail, and  information and communications  technology (ICT). No Government  websites were compromised.  Attackers often exploit unpatched  vulnerabilities in servers or web  applications to deface websites.   When popular content management  systems (CMS)10 are hit, the effect  can be inadvertently amplified.  This was the case in February 2017,  when an exploit of a WordPress  vulnerability saw two million  websites worldwide defaced.11 Some  Singapore websites were similarly  affected as a result, marking the  peak in defacements here.  Hacktivists tend to seek out high- profile websites or leverage iconic  events to launch defacement  campaigns for maximum impact and   visibility. For example, CSA noted an  increase in defacements of Singapore  websites on 9 August, Singapore’s  National Day. While these were  assessed to be opportunistic rather  than targeted, it highlights the potential  for such incidents during iconic events.  Many of the websites had been defaced  previously, suggesting that their owners  had not taken the appropriate security  and patching measures to protect  their websites. Website owners should  update and patch their software in a  timely manner, to reduce the possibility  of having their websites defaced.  Website defacements are a common mode of attack by mischief-makers   and hacktivist groups to promote their agenda. Common targets include   the websites of governments, schools, and news agencies.

This may also  result in new vulnerabilities  and malware that can be  exploited by hackers. In  2017, malware such as  Brickerbot, Reaper, and Satori  emerged, but these were  essentially variants of the  Mirai malware that infected  thousands of vulnerable IoT  devices globally in 2016.  Like Mirai, the variants  could have caused massive  DDoS attacks, but none  were observed in 2017.

Do:  STOP YOUR DEVICES FROM  JOINING A ZOMBIE BOTNET ARMY   The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the vast  network of everyday objects like baby monitors,  printers, televisions, and autonomous vehicles  that are connected to the Internet.   Hackers are also  increasingly targeting  mobile devices, such as  smartphones. Smartphones,  which are often used  to access or control IoT  devices, can spread  malware to connected  devices through mobile  apps, e-mail, Bluetooth,  and other means of  connectivity. Given  Singapore’s high mobile  penetration rate,19 mobile  devices can be a breeding  ground for cyber-attacks,  if people have poor  cybersecurity practices.

The majority of these malware are not new.       15 There were slightly more than 60 C&C servers observed in Singapore’s cyberspace in 2016. The difference between 2016 and 2017 numbers is a result of CSA’s  efforts to enhance its view of the overall cyber threat landscape. Figures observed in 2017 are in line with global trends, but are not directly comparable with past  years’ figures.   16 Based on unique Internet Protocol (IP) addresses (the numerical code assigned to each device that can connect to the Internet or other network), approximately  150,000 botnet drones were observed in Singapore in 2017.  17 Also known as Pushdo, it is a spam malware that targets Windows OS and is responsible for a huge amount of spam activity around the world. First detected  in 2007.  18 A computer worm that targets vulnerable Windows operating systems, first detected in 2008.  For example, Cutwail17 and Conficker18 were  first detected in 2007 and 2008 respectively.  Common tools such as Windows Defender  and Microsoft Safety Scanner can detect  and remove these threats. The fact that  old malware like Conficker continue to  infect systems suggests that many do  not make use of similar tools, to scan  for viruses and clean up their systems.  Malicious software, or malware for short, are programs devised to  compromise the security of a computer system. Compromised systems  may inadvertently become drones that are part of a larger botnet  – a network of compromised computers controlled without the owners'  knowledge. Threat actors control botnets through Command and  Control (C&C) servers to carry out malicious attacks such as e-mail  spam and Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks (DDoS).   On average, five common malware accounted for over half the daily infections in 2017  Chapter 2 Cyber Threats in Focus  http://Data.gov.sg https://www.data.gov.sg/dataset/mobile-penetration-rate   30 31  Ransomware victims are discouraged from paying the ransom. The international  “No More Ransom” Initiative, of which CSA is a Supporting Partner, helps most  victims successfully retrieve their files through more than 50 free decryption  tools against over 100 types of ransomware. Visit the No More Ransom project (www.nomoreransom.org) or SingCERT (www.csa.gov.sg/singcert) for more  information and prevention tips.  WHAT TO DO IF YOUR COMPUTER  IS INFECTED BY RANSOMWARE  !?  !?  !?  RANSOMWARE  There were three major  ransomware outbreaks worldwide  in 2017. The WannaCry global  campaign in May 2017 affected at  least 150 countries and infected  more than 200,000 systems.  Close on its heels, NotPetya hit  at least 65 countries in June  2017, while Bad Rabbit affected  almost 200 systems in Russia  and Eastern Europe in October  2017. Singapore was relatively  unscathed, with only a few  incidents of WannaCry reported.  25 cases of ransomware were   reported to SingCERT in 2017.  However, the actual number of  ransomware cases is likely to be  higher as many go unreported.  Besides WannaCry, victims were  infected by ransomware such  as Cerber, Dharma, and Sage,  and faced ransom demands  ranging between S$2,000 and  S$4,000. Businesses affected  by ransomware can suffer  significant disruptions to their  operations, and lose access  to important files.  Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts files  on victims’ devices, making them unusable until the  ransom is paid. Common attack vectors for ransomware  are phishing e-mails that contain malicious attachments  or links, or pop-ups that exploit vulnerabilities in  browsers to install ransomware.   Many devices may have open ports, such as those associated with  the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which are typically  used by companies for file-sharing purposes. However, malicious  actors can take advantage of these ports to inject malware such as  WannaCry into devices in the network.    In 2017, most WannaCry infections detected in Singapore were  rendered benign due to a “kill switch” that deactivated the  malware. However, devices with open ports are still vulnerable to  other types of malware.   To mitigate this risk, users should protect their devices with  updated anti-virus software, patch known vulnerabilities, and  check that ports (such as ports 139 and 445) on their devices are  not unnecessarily exposed.

Efforts to  boost Singapore’s cyber resilience include:   (a) Enhancing preparedness against cyber threats. (b) Strengthening international cooperation. (c) Developing a professional cybersecurity workforce. (d) Research & development. (e) Raising cybersecurity awareness.  BUILDING UP SINGAPORE'S CYBER RESILIENCE  CHAPTER 3  “A VIBRANT CYBERSECURITY ECOSYSTEM IS AN IMPORTANT  FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO ROBUST NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY.”  - DR YAACOB IBRAHIM, MINISTER FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION,     AND MINISTER-IN-CHARGE OF CYBER SECURITY, SPEAKING TO PARLIAMENT IN MARCH 2017     34 35  CYBER  LEGISLATION  The Cybersecurity Act, passed in Parliament in February  2018, establishes a legal framework for the oversight and  maintenance of national cybersecurity in Singapore.  Its four key objectives are to:   Strengthen the  protection of CIIs  against cyber-attacks.   Authorise CSA to  prevent and respond to  cybersecurity threats  and incidents.   Establish a light-touch  licensing framework  for cybersecurity  service providers.  \"THE CYBERSECURITY ACT PROVIDES A STARTING  POINT FOR NATIONAL CYBER RESILIENCE, FROM  THE LEGISLATION OF MEASURES TO BE TAKEN,  TO THE REGULATION OF CYBERSECURITY SERVICE  PROVIDERS. IN MANY WAYS, THE ACT IS BOTH  TIMELY AND INSTRUCTIVE.\"   - MR JACK OW, TECHNOLOGY LAWYER, ON THE IMPORTANCE    OF CYBER RESILIENCE TO KEEP SOCIETY FUNCTIONING  The Act facilitates  information sharing,  which is critical as  timely information helps  the Government and  owners of computer  systems identify  vulnerabilities and  prevent cyber incidents  more effectively. The Act  provides a framework  for CSA to request for  information, and for the  protection and sharing  of such information.  The Act provides a  framework for the  designation of CIIs.  It provides CII owners  with clarity on their  obligations to protect  CIIs from cyber-attacks,  and requires the owners  to report cybersecurity  incidents to CSA.  The Act empowers  the Commissioner  of Cybersecurity to  investigate cyber  threats and incidents to  determine their impact  and prevent further  harm. These powers  are calibrated based  on the severity of the  threat or incident and  the measures required.  Some cybersecurity  services can be sensitive  because the service  providers performing  them would know where  the vulnerabilities  in clients’ computer  systems are. Licensing  cybersecurity service  providers will give  businesses and clients  more assurance in  engaging such services.   Establish a  framework for  sharing cybersecurity  information.  ENHANCING  PREPAREDNESS  AGAINST CYBER  THREATS  CYBER  EXERCISES  A cyber-attack is almost inevitable. Therefore, CIIs need to  be ready to deal with such scenarios. Cyber exercises enable  organisations to regularly review and refine their cyber  incident response plans before an actual incident happens.  Industry-specific exercises such as Exercise CyberArk are  conducted regularly. At the national level, CSA conducts the  multi-sectoral Exercise Cyber Star to familiarise stakeholders  with the national crisis management system and processes  in the event of a major cyber incident in Singapore. Such  exercises allow the sectors to reassess their cybersecurity  capabilities and identify opportunities for improvement.

STRENGTHENING  INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION  Singapore believes in the importance of a  rules-based international order for cyberspace,  based on applicable international law and the  adoption of voluntary cyber norms. This should  be complemented by a coordinated capacity  building framework, to build countries’ capacity  in dealing with cybersecurity and cybercrime  issues. Robust confidence building measures  are also important, to reduce the risk of cyber  conflict and foster closer working relationships  between international and regional partners.  These elements guide Singapore’s engagements  with our partners.  The borderless nature of cyber threats calls for  countries to work together, to achieve collective  action and mutual understanding.   The annual Singapore International Cyber Week  (SICW) brings together international and regional  cyber leaders to forge partnerships and engage  in critical dialogue on cybersecurity. The second  edition of SICW in September 2017 attracted  more than 7,000 stakeholders, including policy- makers, industry experts and non-governmental  organisations from close to 50 countries. SICW  events such as International Cyber Leaders’  Symposium, ASEAN Cyber Prosecutors Roundtable,  and IoT Cyber Roundtable advanced conversations  on cyber norms, regional cybercrime cooperation,  and IoT cybersecurity standards respectively.

The nature of modern computer coding and programs is such that mistakes and  vulnerabilities are inevitable. The MINDEF Bug Bounty Programme was a response  to this reality and the rapidly-evolving cyber threat landscape. It served to improve  the cybersecurity of MINDEF’s Internet-facing systems more quickly and effectively  than other conventional programmes would have been able to.  From 15 January to 4 February 2018, selected white hat hackers were invited to test  eight major MINDEF Internet-facing systems for vulnerabilities, and were rewarded  for any valid bugs found. HackerOne, a reputable international bug bounty company,  was engaged to manage the programme. A total of 264 white hats from around the  world participated in this programme, including 57 of HackerOne’s top 100 white hats  and 100 from the local white hat community. 97 vulnerability reports were submitted  from 34 participants, with 35 reports deemed valid.

Those considering using  blockchain technology  solutions should ensure  that the surrounding  ecosystem is secure. For  instance, cryptocurrency  exchanges and unsecured  \"wallets” that facilitate  such transactions may  be vulnerable to other  attack vectors, and can  be prominent targets for  hackers and cybercriminals.   WEAK LINKS IN  THE (BLOCK)CHAIN  THREAT ACTORS  WILL ACTIVELY TARGET  WEAK LINKS  Determined attackers will seek out less well- protected entities with linkages to critical targets.  Once compromised, these “softer” targets may  expose their partners to cyber-attacks.  STATE-LINKED  ACTORS WILL  BECOME BOLDER  State-linked cyber actors may make bolder moves –  including disruptive attacks against CIIs – to further  their backers’ geopolitical agendas.   MORE SIGNS  OF AI-ENABLED  CYBER THREATS  AND SOLUTIONS  Artificial intelligence and machine learning  (AI/ML) technologies can be weaponised by  cyber-attackers to infiltrate and wreak havoc  on systems, and to make social engineering  even more personalised.  On the flip side, AI/ML can be leveraged for  cyber defence. Cyber defenders will look to  take advantage of new tools and capabilities  to detect anomalies and counter malicious  activity in cyberspace.  MORE DISRUPTIVE  ATTACKS AGAINST  COUNTRIES,  BUSINESSES, AND  INDIVIDUALS  Cyber-attacks are likely to  grow more disruptive and  destructive. Industrial Control  Systems vulnerabilities may  continue to be targeted,  leading to industrial incidents  and even injuries.  THREATS TO  CONNECTED MOBILE  DEVICES WILL GROW  Hackers will target mobile  devices using methods such  as phishing scams, spoofed  mobile applications, and “free”  public Wi-Fi. These methods  may be used to steal personal  information, spread malware,  and conduct cyber espionage.    CHECK OUT    46 47  2017 saw more vulnerabilities disclosed and disruptive   attacks happening than in previous years. More cyber-attacks   are likely. Cybersecurity is a team sport – we all have a part   to play, and we all need to play our part well. We can start    by practising good cyber hygiene. While we do what we can    as individuals, the Singapore Government will also continue   to work with stakeholders here and internationally towards    a safe and trustworthy cyberspace.     48 49  A section of the Internet only accessible through software that allows  users to remain anonymous or untraceable. The Dark Web is part of  the Deep Web. The Deep Web encompasses web resources that search  engines like Google and Yahoo cannot find, such as legitimate but private  resources (e.g. e-mail), or public resources behind a paywall or login wall  (e.g. paid journal subscriptions).   The unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,  modification, disposal or similar risks of personal data in an  organisation's possession or under its control.   Where an attacker attempts to prevent legitimate users from accessing  information or services online. The most common and obvious type of  DoS attack occurs when an attacker \"floods\" a network with information.  In a distributed DoS attack, an attacker takes unauthorised control of  multiple computers, which may be harnessed as a botnet, to launch  a DoS attack.  An individual or group who wants to undermine the reputation or  destabilise the operations of an entity, or to publicise their political  or social agenda and gain recognition, usually by hacking an  organisation's website.  ICS belong to a class of operational technology (OT) systems used  in nearly every industrial sector to monitor, control and automate  industrial operations and processes.  The vast network of everyday objects, like baby monitors, printers,  televisions, and autonomous vehicles that are connected to the Internet.  Malicious software intended to perform unauthorised processes that will  have adverse impact on the security of a computer system. E.g. virus,  worm, Trojan horse, spyware, and adware.  Data which, on its own (e.g. full name, NRIC number) or in combination  with other available data (e.g. medical or educational information,  can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity.  A common technique used by hackers to trick people (typically through  e-mails) into divulging personal information, transferring money, or  installing malware.  Malware that encrypts files on a victim's device, rendering them  unusable until a ransom is paid, usually in the form of Bitcoin or other  cryptocurrency. It may spread through phishing e-mails that contain  malicious attachments or links, or malicious pop-ups that appear  when users access unsafe websites.  Tricking or deceiving computer systems or other users by hiding or  faking one’s true identity. Commonly spoofed targets include e-mails,  IP addresses, and websites.  Dark Web   Data Breach    Denial of Service (DoS) / Distributed DoS (DDoS)   Hacktivists  Industrial Control Systems (ICS)   Internet of Things (IoT)  Malware  Personal Data     Phishing      Ransomware      Spoofing   Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)  Attack Surface  Blockchain Technology  Bot/Botnet  Command and Control (C&C) Servers    Critical Information Infrastructure (CII)   Cryptocurrency   Cybercrime      Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)  Cyberspace   An attack in which perpetrators successfully gain access to a targeted  system, and stay undetected for a long period of time to exfiltrate, modify,  or destroy critical data. APTs can also refer to the advanced, and often  state-linked or state-sponsored threat actors that conduct extended  campaigns, such as cyber espionage.  Referring to all vulnerable resources of a system, or the sum of the  points through which an attacker could try to enter an environment.  A decentralised record-keeping technology that can be used by  cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin to allow secure, public, and  anonymous transactions to take place. Transactions are batched together  as “blocks”, which are secured using cryptography, and designed to be  tamper-resistant and immutable.  An automated software program used to carry out specific tasks.  A botnet is a network of compromised computers infected with  malicious bots, controlled as a group without the owners' knowledge.  Centralised devices operated by attackers to maintain communications  with compromised systems (known as botnets) within a target network.  The computer or computer system necessary for the continuous  delivery of an essential service, which the loss or compromise  thereof will have a debilitating effect on the availability of the  essential services in Singapore.  A form of digital token secured by cryptography and can be used as  a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value. Used  synonymously with digital or virtual currency. Examples include  Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin.  Refers to (a) offences where a computer system is the target of a criminal  act; and (b) offences where traditional crimes are committed via the  means of a computer system. The first category refers to offences under  the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act (CMCA) and the second  category refers to traditional crimes performed online such as online  cheating, and cyber extortion. See “National Cybercrime Action Plan,”  Ministry of Home Affairs, 20 July 2016.  A new generation of systems with integrated computational and physical  capabilities that can interact with humans through many methods.  The complex environment resulting from the interaction of people,  software and services on the Internet by means of technology devices  and networks connected to it. It does not exist in a physical form per se.
